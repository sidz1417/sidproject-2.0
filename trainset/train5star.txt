i dont have this collection but i have played all of the games on here separately and they were great
the might and magic xeen games are the best of the s rpgs games in my opinionmight and magic  and  were pretty good i think  was much better
 was the most difficult of the might and magic games but i like a good challenge
if youve never played the might and magic series but you enjoy swordandsorcery rpgs with challenging puzzles and quests i recommend giving them a tryi bought this as soon as i saw it
its worth your money even if you own one or more of the games in this product because youll probably spend more buying them separatelyi love might and magic iv and v that have fun  gameply and even cooler introduction videoi love this game way more than i liked newer games with better graphics like diablo or baldurs gate even though i did like diablo and baldurs gate
whats so special about it in other games i sometimes felt as if i were slogging through a level
in mm something is always happening
one goes up in level quite often so there are new spells or better skills or new weapons or more armor or some goodie or the other every time you turn around
most of the monsters have a least a couple of goldpieces so nearly every critter killed gives you something
this makes the game very addictive  just get one more level and you can get that skill you want just kill five more monsters and you can afford that armor
what
its  am  one can play battles in real time or in turnbased mode
i have truly miserable handeye coordination and many video games are simply too hard for me and thus not fun
this game lets the dexterous play in real time but the turnbased option lets those of us who are nondexterous play too
i wish every game had a turnbased option
also in this vein you use your characters skills to attack monsters not your own so you dont have to line up a blow with a sword or an arrow from a bow or a fireball from a wizard   you just tell your charcters whom you want them to attack and they figure it out
you figure the strategy your characters handle the handeye coordination
thats why theyre the adventurers and youre sitting at a computer
  the party is large enough that one gets to take advantage of several different types of skills  you can have a fighter a mage a cleric and an archer  but they move as a unit so the game doesnt descend into the chaos that some other rpgs do  many recent rpgs seem to be so concerned with realism that theyve sacrificed gameplay  just as one example ive played rpgs where archers are always having to run back to town to buy more arrows even if they buy  at a time
in mm theres some concern with realism but more concern with gameplay
if you have a bow its assumed that you have arrows to go with it  you never have to buy any
there are some space limitations but no weight limitations so if it fits in your space allotment you can carry it  the mandate mania website run by a fan not the official site is one of the most helpful game websites ive ever seen
they give lots of information and its very well organized  i could go on and on but this is long enough
  the game is fun and charming reasonably easy without being dull and has lots of skills quests places and itemsif you are the type of gamer who enjoys playing rpgsbased on a lot of skillmagic and other stat building elementsthen this collection of games are right up your alleythese are the gems of the rpg worldfor those of you new to the mm games dont worry theres plenty of enjoyment for newbies and roleplaying vets alike
if you are the type of gamer who is hung up on hollywoodtype graphics and games with scripted storiesyou knowthe games that let you play for about  minutes while the cutscenes playout the other or sohours of the gamethen you probably wont enjoy these as much as someone who likes to accually like to use thier brainno offense but you know who you arewhen getting into a good ole fashioned dungeon crawler
a must buy for collecters and rpg purists
a  darviusmmvi is one of the best rpgs available
i like it better than the flashy new ones because it runs smoothly the textsize is not displayed in tiny microfont the game is long and for many other reasons
it is not overcomplicated and it is generally very fun to play
the story is intriguing and complex and will keep you interested
the dungeons and caves are surprisingly large and not easy to negotiate
the countless enemies are very challenging to beat and the overworld is giganticenjoyable game
i think another reviewer said it reminded them of macgyver that show where the character had to be creative with objects in order to get out of sticky situations
this game is somewhat like that
it wasnt too difficult  i only relied on a walkthrough once
it also worked fine on xp
the only problem is youll need to download a patch from dreamcatcher  after that you can continue to playit is always a pleasure especially in current era of d shootem up games when a new adventure game in quotold stylequot d pointandclick interface emerges
it is even better pleasure if it is a good adventure game
and nightlong by team  definitely belongs to this categoryyour hero is named joshua reeve he lives in  and the game starts when he waits for a beautiful car gets in it and goes through streets with old friend hugh martenson who is a governor of the union city and currently faces some troubles
he became a target of terroristic attacks and asks joshua for a help because he saved his life in the past and this is an opportunity for joshua to do the same in return nightlong comes on three cd full of perfect graphics animations and music the puzzles are on the right level of difficulty and the story pulls you in the game immediately from the beginning
if you are a fan of good adventure games you will not regret the money you spend for buying it
i only hope that nightlong is not the last adventure game from team i change my hardware acceleration to none and then nightlong worked on my  me
also if i switch to game compatible setting it works okotherwise it crashes in the sphinx roomfor people with newer computers try switching to game compatible or turn off hardware acceleration and the game might be ok thennot as long as the longest journey but just as funif youre looking for a d pc platformer then look no further
this is the  game you are looking for
its better than croc  and has much better camera  positioning
it has a less kiddies feel to it than croc  alsothe  graphics are gorgeous and you get to do things like water ski
still not as  gooas mario  but then this is pc after all and platformers are no longer   a pennyone tip thought for voodoo users is that this game is fast   too fast
so go to the website and get the patch to slow it down a  bit
throughly enjoyable  i wish there were more games like this on the  pc
it gets  stars aa i cant think of a better game of its genre on this  platformhello raymandont be fooled about the quotfor everyonequot label on this game
this is not only a truly amazing work of art graphically speaking but also one of the best d arcade games out there on pccharacter animations are done in superb quality with a lot of details in conveying emotions with the animated bodies
the environments are also crafted well with excellent architecture that never makes you feel that you are running through a mazemusic is also a strong aspect of this game and is well delivered
and sound effect is used with great effectthere are two points that must be noted
first this game is very hard
i know a friend who downloaded a patch to make rayman invincible and he still couldnt finish it
also there is no ingame savegame feature
you can only save after a level
although most levels are quotbite sizequot so you dont lose much progress if you lose there are numerous occasions that a particularly difficult scenario would require you to march through the same terrain again and again and againthe pc version is different from others is that it features  languages but no voiceovers
voices are done in the same way as the people in quotthe simsquot or the adults in charlie brown showsit is an excellent game for kids who are looking for fun and for young adults who want to switch from the usual firstperson shooter gamesthis game has great gameplay good enough graphicsmusicsoundlow end requirments for it to run fine
great adventure almost beat itits a long game and tons of levels for it to packed all on to one discjust buy it storylinethis game has a great one
adventure peoplei reccomend it
also the action is pretty goodbeing an ex soldier i say that this game is more realistic than operation flashpoint
 in df you dont have to shoot like hell in order to kill the enemy in df you are not going to charge in to the enemy like a fool unless you are ready to commit suicide you can use air strikes on a tank
i do believe it would be suicide to move in on a tank with satchel charges if that tank is fully operational
i believe a tank can be laser targeted
so all in all think about it
operation flashpoint is a good game but some rough edges need to be smoothen out
real soldiers would not commit themselves to such danger and would not be asked to do sothe graphics are bad there are plenty of bugs to go around and in the end theres not all that much you end up doing in the missions
but somehow this game is super funmaybe its the fact that the graphics are slopped together to the point where you kinda think theyre kidding around
the people off the city are all freaks and you and they make all sorts of real noises
the noises the pilot makes when you walk towards water or near the edge of a buidling are hilariouseven though theres not really all that much to do in these cities you probably wont notice it too much
all the stuff is pretty fun
you get to put out fires rescue people chase down speeders etc
a fun little thing is that when you transport people if you start to descend as fast as you can the little displays of them in your chopper show them getting all flustered and scared
classici wouldnt exactly say that this game is so bad its good because it does have appeal
the gameplay is good for killing some timei guess thats what this game boils down to
an extremely fun timekillersimant ok so its for windows xp
that is ok because i happen to have one
pand the fun of dieing all over n over reminded me how advanced the game really isi dont recall everything like how to correctly start a good colony just yet but my gosh i love this gamei remember i used to beat the game as a kid haha now its like uhhh where did i put that hole again
good laughs when you are really really trying too hard and you wind up in a spider or other ants dinner plate lolthis is the game that got me hooked on computer games
you are an ant
well not just one ant a whole nest of them
you can be any ant you want and you can control them all if you want or let them do their own thing
i was that type of kid that liked to play in the ant bed and feed spiders crickets i caught in the grass
this game lets you do that in the summerwinterspringfallsummerwinterthis game is very similar to diablo
it does pretty much everything diablo does slightly better though
the plot is more interesting the graphics are better than diablo i the spells are better the monsters are generally more interesting
most importantly the interface is better  especially when it comes to casting spells
i always found spell casting in diablo just awkward enough to make the mage classes less fun than the fighters here spell casting is easy to do and extremely satisfyingi really wish nox had been more influential
i played diablo clones for years without coming across any that i enjoyed as much as nox and only ones as recent as torchlight have had interfaces that seemed this slickthe interface is super well done
made enjoying the game easy
it was for me a real surprise how well it was done
it did not recieve all the hype many games get yet it is as good as any other i played ie
diablo  and unique in many ways
as in all rpgs there is a spot or two where the play gets a bit teadious but this game had much less of this than others
each of the three character types requires a truely different style of play
one aggressive hack and slash with weapons and armor emphasis one moderate magic bent with spells and charms emphasis and one defensive summoner idiom with let your friends do the killing while you try and stay out of the way emphasis
each requires different actions and thinking strategy and each is just as fun as the others just different which means there is good replayability even if you dont go online for a fight
this game is growing harder to get these days so if you have an interest act nowhail flaviusyears ago when this first came out i was hooked
forming a online clan we called our selves sithlords
we were fully committed to having fun
whats great about this game was the balance across the classes
i loved it
the story of the game was amazing as well
now i have no idea if the servers are still up for online fun but it was truely nice at one point in timegreat pickultima ix in my opinion has the largest best looking virtual world of any gameeverything can be interacted with and you can go anywhere
climbing to the top of a mountain peak to get a better view of your surroundings or  swimming out to a small island in a river are just a couple of examples
graphics are outstanding as is the design of the land
your character is  viewed in rd person ala mario  and you control his movements with your  mouse and keyboard
i just thought i would add that because the game box  does not really explain that
every other character you come across has his  or her own problem which you can choose to solve or not to solve
because  the world is so huge you better be ready for hours of hours of  exploration
there are no linear paths to follow and you can go about your  quest however you see fit
the downside of this game is the occasional  crash choppy frame rates in some areas where there are many trees and  objectsbut not unplayable and i had problems installing it on my  computer
the auto install feature does not work very well but theses  problems are minor compared to the overall greatness of the game
my system  is a mhz pentium ii  megs of rammore would be better a voodoo    i am running the game in x with  bit colori have been a fan of the ultima series since the first one came out and i was thrilled to get my hands on this finally installment when it was released
this game is simply beautiful the breath and depth of the world is simply amazing
the voices are very well done and the characters are interesting and compelling
very few games have a story that is as rich and rewarding as the one found in this game
i could go on and on about how great this game is but let me just say this one thing  ultima  is probably one of the best rpgs released for a computer in recent years
i have noticed the complaints people have made about the game being buggy but i have never had a single problem from the initial installation to the end of the game
if you are a fan of the ultima series this game is a must have for youim a huge blade runner fan first and for most
when i bought the game i was astonished
the plot beautifully done
you play br dectective ray mccoy sorry fans but you cant play rick deckard in this
but he does show up in a picture you recieve
plus on the training maze it shows his top score
youre first assignment for the day is an animal murder of a fancy pet shop in the future animals are very rare so they made bad fake ones
once getting your hands on a picture of several replicants the perps that blade runners chase the real story beginswhat also makes this game really neat is how you chose the ending and your fate you can be a replicant killer and kill all the replicants in the story or you can be a replicant helper and help the replicants escape
the music is straight from the film even though vangelis didnt do the job
most of the stars from the film sean young joe turkel william sanderson ect
return to their charecters voices exept for ruger hauer harrison ford and daryl hannah
some people think that gaff in the game yes he is  is played by none other than edward james olmos this is false
ejo is way to great of an actor to be played in a video game
most of the charecters in the game replicate the ones in the movie for example ray is supposed to be deckard roy baty is replaced by a rep named clovis and cap
bryant is replaced by a fat sleazebag named guzza
even one of the endings in which ray drives off with a girl replicant is a copy of the original ending for the movie
this game is the best
youll like it even if your not a br fan
enjoyblade runner is very appealing to me
i have played the game through at least thirty times
one thing i love about the game is the sound of rain falling down
the voice acting is very impressive and the game has a great  script
i actully found the plot of the game more appealing than that of  the moviesa few downsides i can get over is the video sequences
a  lot of them have really bad animation
another downside is the audio  sometimes when two characters are talking to each other there will be a  long pause inbetween the end of one persons dialogue and the start of the  next persons
like i said i can get over thatthis game sets itself apart from other games in the adventure genre mainly due to the fact that it is so realistic
gameplay is anything but linear and the sound of the character voices and environments is great
good cut scenes as well
most importantly the game has multiple endings so replay value is high
dont miss out on this classic which does the movie and the book proudthis game version of the popular scifi movie is excellent
the graphics music and gameplay are first rate
as an added bonus you can replay the game many times as the endings varyfor fans of the film this is a must buy
for adventure gamers it is a game you will keep and play again and againi picked this game up about a year ago having never seen the movie
i did not know what to expect
what i got though was a completely thought provoking psychologicially challenging intuitive breathtaking and mezmorizing game that left me clutched to my computer for daysthe story is unlike any other
it follows the locations of the movie and if you have seen it youll recognize many of the scenes
cut scenes in games usually are a let down here they excell
the gameplay never dips unless you get stuck and are pulling your hair out trying to figure out what to do next
but that is how murder mysteries are supposed to be
this isnt a game that you will finish in  hours
heck when i play it over it still takes me awhilethe main drawing point to this game is the numerous paths that you can take
it is an adventure game in real time
so if you are lollygagging around in one area for a long time just doing nothing youll miss something later and the game will change
you can always beat the game but the path you take is what makes the game so outstanding
are you a good guy
a bad guy
who are you
it all depends on the decisions that you make and the peoplereplicants that you enteract withif you are a hardcore adventure gamer and dont have this one you should be ashamed
as for everyone else you are without excuse as well
buy it nowblade runner is a game by westwood studios the great people who brought you command amp conquer and a studio always breaking new grounds in  technology
this game was great becasue a number of reasons
one  because you dont even have to like the movie to play this game nor do you  have to see it to play the game
second it really has many effects that  really put you in the world of this copdetective
third the cinema  scenes are awesome and run smoothly even on older systems and really add  quite a movieesque feel to this
but thats not all it has  different  endings depending on who you talk to or what you do during the game
its  really ashame to see such a great game with cutting edge technology on its  background and nobody really knew of this game
its like a zelda game  comming out but not noticed
even if you didnt know about this epic  game you shouldnt doubt its style because it has everything you could  want in a game
the soundtrack is awesome the graphics even though the  characters are a bit pixilizedare awesome and the replay value is over  the hill
ive played this game over  times and still havnt seen all the  endings
with the cheap price theyre asking why not give it a try you  wont be sorryjust to let all you wing commander fans that even though i have never played wing commanders  a great plot is something i always look for in a game i play a lot of rpgs
so yes i would have to state for you all that the story was certainly not one of the greatest i have ever come across but there certainly was a plot to this game
well a story anyway
however i got this game because i wanted a good space sim and cgw rated this one the highestthe graphics although not top of the line today were superb when the game was released and its graphics still work today for they are full of imagination and feature a solid frame rate
the alien ships were incredibly well designed and the enemy ship textures have cool glowing almost glossy textures
makes the kilrathi fighters who you will see look obsolete
i loved how this game didnt use just sprites for fighters like some other games i have played
also i love how the closer you are to an exploding target the more you shake from the impact of its explosionalso the gameplay is pretty much the same as now
thats right i dont think a single space sim has actually played noticeably better than this
the control is tight and unlike xwing you can go diagonal
you can also taunt your enemies and if the enemy you are taunting has a live alien pilot he will usually move to attack you
this is good when his original target is pleading for help and you wont fight any nonlive pilots until later disc   i also loved how some enemy fighters are whole and after you destroy the whole they split up into three or six additional fighters
this adds a new fun level to the game as you fight a type of opponent that has never been conceived beforelastly the sound is awesome and must be listened to loud or at least with good base
the pilots voices are well acted more than the pleading cruisers youre supposed to save the sound effects are cool especially the boom and the music is incredible
i would if i could turn the music volume up to max and keep the sound effects to a lower level for the music doesnt rattle any nonawesome speakersthe plot while not overly amazing does feature some good moments and the background storyline is very epic
i loved how in the future not just any prophecy comes true but the prophecy of the aliens who for the past two decades was locked in total war with humanity
simply put the destruction of the kilrathi home planet proved to their gods that they were not worthy of living and so their gods began a process called quotknathrakquot i might not have spelled it right
this quotknathrakquot is the brutal process of elimination of the kilrathi their defeaters and all life in existence
needless to say this is a very bad thing to humanity who are now more armed then ever before its  already
to fight the incoming menaces a bug like speciesthis game is short and the cutscenes are really just character development or plot
i did really like the characters but they didnt fit into the plot except for a select few
i also didnt like how i wasnt gonna figure out who the bugs were until wing commander prophecy ii which is a project that was cancelled because origin decided to from now on only make online games like the ultima online disaster origin
its sad but as long as i have this game the future of alien menaces better watch out for i have killed so many of you alreadywing commander prophecy is without a doubt one of my alltime personal favorite games for the pc
aside from the fact that it gracefully and heroically retires christopher blair mark hammil from the series the  game is an expertly crafted piece of entertaining with only a few  stylistic flaws
it also improves greatly over wing commander iv the  price of freedom by making combat missions longer than the video cut  scenes something that dogged its predecessor greatly
prophecy has such  eerie underpinnings that work together with the game and live action  cinematics to make for an awesome story
it is also the start of a new  generationafter the defeat of the kilrathi by blair in wing  commander iii heart of the tiger the confederation finally has peace with  regards to their once feline adversaries and the cult of sivar
but there  in lies the crux of the matter for an ages old kilrathi prophecy points to  a time when darkness will descend upon the universe and the kilrathi will  die bathed in their own blood and their once mighty claws no match for the  coming evil a time that they call knthrak a translation that means  either darkness or evil
and it all begins with the destruction of a  confederation survey ship analyzing the destroyed kilrathi homeworld in the  kilrah system by an unknown racethere shall come a timewhen one who  has the heart of a kilrathibut is not kilrathi born shall  raincleansing fire down upon usand knthrak a time of great  darknessshall embrace uswe are then taken to the tcs midway a  gargantuan super carrier that will be the focus of the game and your home  base for the duration
it is truly a magnificent ship and about the same  size as darth vaders super star destroyerabout  meters in length
it  acts as a mobile base for the terran confederation and designed to be the  center piece of a larger armada
it is here that we meet lance caseyyour  characterwho is fresh from the academy and son of a famous tcn pilot
we  also meet up with old wing commander alumnusmaniac tom wilson who takes  every opportunity to belittle casey until getting his comeuppance in the  worst way and by numerous members of the midways crewbasically  its your job to figure out just who these new aliens are and what they  want
what they apparently want is to slaughter everyone and everything  they come across which is great because thats why youre here
there are  heaps of missions here and they are all a great deal of fun
missions range  from standard combat air patrols caps to seeking out and destroying  capital ships taking down freighters and search and rescue missions
one  of the most memorable moments of the game is a missile launch especially  the swarms which leave twisting contrails as they streak off towards their  targets
origin really did a fine job on the new fighter designsthey no  longer have the blocky slablike look that price of freedom had but  instead have a more graceful rounded look
most of these ships are also a  joy to fly conveying a great sense of speed and maneuverability though  less so with bombers like the devastatorsid mead of  amp  blade runner fame was hired on to design the alien nephilimphylum  fighters and capital ships and produces true wonders
the fighters have a  beautiful aquaticinsectile look to them while the capital class starships  resemble nothing most people have ever seen
they are both fearsome and  invoke no small amount of curiosity from the player and made me want to  find out more about this dark and enigmatic racemission designs  seems to have been a priority at origin because they are expertly crafted  and bear much resemblance to freespace  and lack the timesensitive  nature that plagued many of the xwing amp tie fighter missions from  lucasarts
i also retract my title comment in my freespace  reviewwing  commander prophecy is as good a game
the missions take priority over the  cut scenes the post flight ones become annoyingly repetitive as there are  only  or  to see and you see them often
beyond that this is origins  swan song as there doesnt seem to be any movement from them to sequel it  beyond secret ops which only adds new missions good as they are
this is a  fantastic gameit both looks and plays great while possessing a solid and  engrossing story
superbi bought this from a bargin bin at walmart for  thinking if it was junk i wouldnt be out much money
my first reaction was wow this actually looks pretty goodmy further reaction was how in the world have i not heard of this game before
this is fantastic
this was just a great surprise
good flight dynamics reasonably challenging scenarios freedom of choice of missions and accompanying loot and some wellplaced tension between upgrades ie
if i take this one i cant get that oneso which one which one
ive played through a few times now and enjoyed each time
i have to say too that bruces voice totally makes the time more enjoyableim a little surprised that some are selling it for so high
seriously
its not that good but i wouldnt steer someone away from paying  for it
this is one of those games that when you meet someone else whos played it you enjoy the conversations because of how few people have shared in how good this game isthis game blew my mind
i first saw it when i played a demo that was on delta force  i loved the demo and immediately tried finding a copy
about a week after i placed my order with novalogic they mailed me back saying that it was out of print
disappointment set in so i went over to my local electronics boutique and lo and behold they had not one but two copies
this game is great
the graphics rock my sockshard
i love just sitting still and watching a planet turn or watching a larger star devour a smaller one
they did a really great job of making you feel like the world was alive
the storyline is fantastic i really liked the idea that i could just take whichever jobs i wanted
just a word of advice here if you side with galspan youll have access to a great deal of guided missiles and the like but will be lacking in the area of special weapons and the guided missiles arent so strong compared to the bora rockets
the bora have no guided weapons at all but their dumb fire rockets seem to do more damage and they also have the two most powerful special weapons in the game the rail gun which can destroy any fighter with one hit and the nova device i think its called that which basically emits a largeish explosion from your ship
this game is great fun the world is so incredibly fun to look at i could watch it for hours and still be amazed
have fun with it while you can because it seems like space sims are going out of style so good ones like this the freespace games and freelancer are going to become harder to find
wish i would have baught that second copyits fun and the replay value is great
im playing it for the rd time now
great ships nice story line
i wish that you can hire more than one wingman though
i have a voodoo  video card and a sb live sound card and i have no problems running the gameive been playing outer space combat sims since the original xwing came out in   tachyon is just as fun and i must say the graphics are way better
  im using a geforce on a piii  with the games graphics settings maxed out
it runs perfectly
its an older game but i could never run it cause i didnt have a nice enuf system
it reminds me a lot of privateer  but i think its better
definitely check this one out
cant beat the price and you get more than what you pay for this gamewell i had the choice of buying this or starlancer
the graphics in starlancer looked better the box was better it looked more impressive but one thing made me buy tachyonthe don
i will just say this now  bruce campbell is such a dude
army of darkness has the funniest lines in  any film ever and i didnt want to miss out on any other potential  classics i got a very decent game into the bargain as well
less linear  which i prefer this game has such a great sense of humour and depth to it  which could so easily almost be overlooked
for example a little fact that  would be overlooked im sure every single news bulletin has its own  specific pictures or animation and considering the amount of news  bulletins throughout the game this just goes to show novalogic werent  slacking
i can see how some people would criticize it calling it  mediocre because of its old look and feel
however in my opinion older  games are the best and im so glad that novalogic have gone back to basics  almost swapping revolution for a great gaming experience
bruce campbell  doesnt disappoint as jake logan and the whole game is very tight
it also  has one of the best manuals ever
buy enjoy also buy army of darkness
i  love that filmlook theres nothing i can say that can do this game justice
saying that the graphics are groundbreaking the sound is excellent and that it has an honesttoltinsert deitygt plot that would actually make a  fairly decent sf novel just doesnt capture the magnitude of this  gamego to the interplay website and download the playable demo
afterwards pick your jaw up off of the floor so that you can buy the full  versiongod i have never liked a space shooter as much as freespace  the joystick is excellent when controlling your craft
you have a nice looking set of ships with good graphics to boot
at the time predoom  i thought they were they best graphics known to mankindthe only problem is to me anyway is that the whole realism with controlling your space ship is a little too complicated i mean if you set the game down for a year and had to pick it back up you would have to do the tutorial or memorize all the controls from the manualanyway it is a decent game and if you have a lot of time on your hands pick it upby now some you have already heard of or read reviews of freespace  the sequel to the excellent descent freespacethe great war which was published by interplay back in   there arent enough adjectives to  describe this magnus opus but here are a few breathtaking immersive  nonpareil magnificent astounding absolutely brilliant
first things  first freespace  requires a pentium mhz with a d accelerator card  that supports either glide opengl or directd
i recommend at least a  pentium ii mhz or higher and about  gig of hard drive space
the  games high resolution artwork supports x in bit color and the  standard x x need not applythe game picks up  years  after the original
the terrans and vasudans the original enemies from  the first gamehave formed an alliance called the gtvc but a group of  renegade terrans called the new terran front have begun to shake things up
it gets worse the nigh allpowerful shivans make a return from the last  game as well and add more fuel to this cosmic conflagration
as a gtvc  pilot you will get to fly new terran and vasudan vessels as well as engage  in epic dogfights against new shivan craft
locales now include nebulae  which interfere with your ships instruments but also your enemies  toothis game has to be played to be really appreciated
on the  hardware side of things eax and ad audio support are present and accounted  for as well as force feedback
and to make things even merrier interplay  has recently released the game
its called freespace  scifi sim of the  year edition and it has  additional levels which brings the total number  to   theres also high resolution wallpaper and a few other goodies not  found on the original cdif you have even the faintest interest in  computer games or enjoy playing hardcore scifi sim combat games then get  freespace   it will totally rock your worldi just got a hankering to reinstall this game
freelancer got a little stale for me and tachyon didnt have enough to keep me playing after i beat it
so after more than two years of not playing this game i am finding it to be incredible
the graphics are crisp sound is incredible controls incredibly responsive gameplay complex enough for me and storyline is pretty darn deep especially for a game of this type
plus the game can pretty much go on forever with the fred editor and there are vast numbers of community created mods featuring both sorte missions and full length campaignswhere to startwell i know i wont make a catch all neanderthal statement to the effect that this is the best game ever that is until the next best game ever comes along because it isnt
freespace accomplishes  many things by providing a solid story line to back up very impressive game  play
where freespace might lack is in two small areaslack of creativity  for naming of vessels within the gtvn and the fact that no military  structure would allow or stand for the sniveling and back talk that gets  carried over in the comtraffic between fighters and capital ships
but  these are minor quibbles to what lies in store for the player
freespace  offers an expansive campaign with several missions that lead  you from a civil war led by admiral aken bosch voice of ronny cox from  robocop amp total recall and his neoterran front faction to a  resurgence of activity care of the shivans whom bosch has somehow brokered  a deal with
where the missions shine is the player is never lacking  anything to do and the game borrows from both the wing commander and star  wars games in mission design
however unlike the other space combat sims  freespace  never suffers from the worry of having to be all over the map  in order to accomplish a mission
the flight model is much improved  over the original game though i think the gtvn fighters could be a little  faster even without the afterburners
flight dynamics are second to none  the ships responsive especially with a good joystick
fighter choice  weapons and missiles are in good supply and each have their different  effects though i would have preferred a little more discretion in  outfitting my fighter in early missions
graphically freespace  is  very strong whether it be the detail on the various fighters to the  overwhelming scale of the capital ships especially the sathanasclass  juggernaught which i think gains its inspiration from the vorlon vessels  from babylon 
however its the little things you notice that really  make the game like when you fire at ship and miss your weapons discharge  flashes over the ship hull with a visible light effect the visual and  aural effect of a capital ships flak guns as you do a strafing attack  across its surface you quickly learn how to skin dance across the hulls  of these big beasts or the spectacular nebula effects of the later  missions as you pilot your way through pea souplike gas clouds
ship  design is also better than in the first game as they play up the more  insectile forms of the shivan fighters whereas in the first they resembled  awkwardly placed slabs arrayed in different angles
human and vasudan  fighters are a mixed bag but they all have a functional look about them  and have much less of a polished look than either wing commander or the  star wars
boiled down in its essence freespace  is a solid shootemup  type game carried on thanks to a solid game engine and exceptional  graphic design and terrific d support i have  meg voodoo 
this is  all enhanced by a great interface that doesnt over complicate the flow of  the game or game play
this is not the best game ever as no game can  claim that crown
however it is the best of the current crop of space  combat sims
it easily outclasses xwing alliance and i feel that lucas  arts really needs to rethink how they design their game missions because  in xwa you are flying practically the same missions you flew in xwing  amp tie fighter
freespace  gives you a vast playground that is not  merely beautiful but ultimately function and very rewardingwhen i first got this game i didnt know what to expect
after playing through the singleplayer campaign i was blown awaythe missions the ships the dogfights the graphics the storyline everything is top notch
i would have to also say that this game is underratedfor all you fs people who have no clue about this one it takes place  years after the lucifer was destroyed and the sol jump node collapsed isolating earth from the terran civilization
the gtva has been formed unifying the terrans and vasudans
suddenly the neo terran front a rebel force led by renegade admiral bosch starts a war with the gtva over the vasudan alliance
not only that the shivans are back but the terrans and vasudans have advanced greatly technologically in  years and are ready to fight them this time around
also we find out why bosch has rebelled against his people and it involves the shivans
as the story unfolds his agenda becomes clear and could have serious consequences for the galaxyi love this game and have played it through a number of times over the years
not only were the graphics really good for its time the game play was intense the story well constructed music was good ships were cool and it had real character
everything about it was excellenti also really liked the mission creator and how you could set up all the ships and events to make a whole scenario
this also allowed various mods to be created including a babylon  mod by some fans after sierra canceled the b fighter game they were makingits a shame this genre of game is dead as i would love nothing more than for someone to make a similar game but set in the new battlestar galactica universe
nothing whets my appetite more than thinking of how awesome it would be to launch from bg and partake in the missions seen throughout the new series with all the things in the game that made freespace  so greati am so longing for a game of this type to be made that i might install freespace  again and give it a play
im sure it will still be goodif by chance you do happen to come across this game for sale somewhere and are wanting a topclass space fighter experience then grab it because it is well worth itdid you ever want to buy a star trek game that offered excellent tutorial functions a realistic onscreen display and d rendering gameplay that allowed you sit in captains chair
well its here so you better click buy now
because this is the game youve been waiting for
play one of  races federation klingon romulan gorn lyran or hydran
all races have their own unique ships and game play which looks pretty close to what you see on the boxwhich is very unusual for any pc games
the opening movies are the best ive seen compared to games of its time and the bugs that are in this game are minimal
having a decent video card is a must   mb video ram is minimal but i say at least  mb
this game will run on an old pentium computer that has a good video card
it allows you to adjust options and tweak it a bit to fit your machine
it has a number of options ships crew selection missions and so forth that you choose from
i have been playing this game for a year and it is most fun i have had with any real time strategy game
this game gets my highest regard so it is highly recommended  you will not be disappointedfor those of you addicted to the star fleet battles board game this interplay game automates all of the bookkeeping and provides a nice ui you can play a computer or your friends
one unhappy note is that it only runs on winxp ideally sp
as i have win  i had to build a winxp vm and play in that
also you may have trouble if mssdll is missing from your system
i was able to find the dll and drop it into the game folder after that it played fineplanescape torment is a cult classic and is considered by many to have the best story in any video game ever made
i recently completed it and im here to tell you that the hype is justifiedthis is an incredible game
it instantly makes it into my all time top   planescape contains one of the most unique and interesting settings and the best writing and plot i have ever seen in a video game
its possible there are some adventure games that can hold a candle to it ive heard the story in the game the longest journey is mind blowing but i havent played themin terms of gameplay this game is similar to the baldurs gate series although it lacks some of the interface elements found in those games or at least in the second one i havent played the first very much
the combat here is not quite as tight as found in baldurs gate but it gets the job done just fine
this game is more focused on dialogue than combat so if you like a very combat heavy game then you might not like it quite as much
that said its pretty hard to imagine anyone who enjoys video games and a good story not enjoying this game
you should also not get the idea that this is just a point and click adventure game with no real combat
there is still plenty of combat and you must do some heavy fighting to get through a number of sequences in the gamealthough there isnt a ton of it the voice acting is another major strong point in this game that i wanted to mention
another thing i like is that you level up a lot in this game
you start out as sort of weak but by the end of the game you are a bad bad man and thats something i always like in my rpgsgraphically this game looks pretty ragged on a widescreen computer at its original resolution but this doesnt matter because there is an easy to use mod that allows you to play it in widescreen
using the mod it looks fantastic in widescreen
the artwork for the levels is quite detailed and lovelyit made me long for the days of d graphics to be honest
i found full on widescreen at  x  to be too zoomed out so i made a custom resolution for  x  and found that to be just about right
in fact there are a number of good mods that people generally recommend you get for the game which you can find using google
most of these simply fix bugs and things of that nature rather than adding entirely new materiala gameplay tip i would like to mention is that most people say that to get the full experience you have to put a lot of stat points in intelligence and wisdom because this opens up more dialogue options and story elements
i am not sure how much is necessary to get everything but just thought id pass that along
i created a mage and had them both very very higha wonderful story and really intresting charecters
here is my pros and conspros magnificent d graphics from black isle studios creators of baldurs gate and icewind dale notyoureveryday charecters such as a floating skull a walkingandtalking suit of armor and a woman with a tailaka
tiefling game play based on dd rd edition rules powerful enemies such as wereratswyvernszombiesghoulsand street slugscons a small game only  mb and  cds birdeye view means medium sized land only can have  other charecters in your partystill not that bad
a good game for dampd fansi admit to stumbling across this game by accident at the local computer swap market
id already played baldurs gate and id felt that the adampd universe wasnt really for me
so i was pleasantly surprised by  planetscapetormentplanetscape has improved markedly over its  predecessor
the most obvious difference is in its user interface
you can  access items inventory and spells using the main interface
in battle you  can access each characters spells or items by rightclicking each  character
in baldurs gate a characters spells and items were displayed  on the bottom window which restricted your view
theres no such problem  hereanother difference is in the graphics
planetscape still uses the  infinity engine ala baldurs gate but the graphics are much smoother  than its predecessor
characters are much larger and some even perform  actions when they are idle
for instance morte the first person to join  your group juggles his eyeballs when hes boredthe main attractions in  planetscape are i feel the most important elements of any game   characterisation and storyline
the characters are not your ordinary  adampd fighters and mages
for example we have morte a floating skull  that uses his teeth as an attack weapon
then there is dakkon who carries  what appears to be a lightsaber as his weapon
he is also a mage which  means he can cast some impressive spells
then there is nordom who you can  find if you embark on an extremely difficult quest who is a robot carrying  crossbows
and ignus a chaotic mage made entirely of flamethe  storyline is also intriguing
imagine playing a character who cannot be  killed who is extremely powerful but has lost all memory of his abilities
the nameless one is probably the most mysterious character to ever be  created in a computer game  and his story ranks as one of the best ever  toldthere are only two minor niggling flaws in this game
the first  is the failure to display graphics any higher than a x resolution
having the ability to display a much higher resolution would allow more of  the buildings to be seen
this would make the map easier to navigate
the  other flaw is the failure to implement aureal  support baldurs gate  had the same problem
anyone with a sound blaster live
should be able to  enjoy eax support however so all is not lostin summary if anyone is  interested in exploring the adampd universe i strongly recommend you  start with planetscape torment
the game is much easier for firsttimers  like myself to play and less frustrating as well
planetscape is not a  violent game instead its emphasis is on problem solving not dungeon  hacking
many situations can be solved through talking with characters not  bludgeoning them to death
i sincerely hope that more games like this are  producedif poetry found its way into videogames the result would be planescape torment the game with as much text as an encyclopedia er maybe thats not the best turnon to this game
there are a lot of reviews that would give away a few of the best moments to convey just how spectacular this game is but i dont think even those spoilers could fill you in on how amazing this game is
if i had to put it succinctly other forms of media such as movies and books and music have had the capacity to change lives for years this is in my opinion the first game that has that powerits interesting that this isnt a game about combat talking through situations will usually net you more experience than killing people left and right
as an experience it is perfect from beginning to end and even a decade later and with black isle studios closed it is the only game of its type that i have ever experiencedyes its old and the graphics are showing their wrinkles the pathfinding will make you sigh in annoyance there will be some crashes it will need some patching but this game is worth it and more
i dont know if this sort of appeal works with gamers who are more interested in wiping out nazis than experiencing a game that contains one of the greatest stories ever told but it has great appeal to those who are ready to discover something astounding
this is poetryplanescape torment is the ultimate roleplaying game that uses the dampd system  a great balance of combat questfulfilling and most of all storytelling
i played the old pool of radiance game baldurs gate and icewind dale
planescape torment is better than them all
but the game is not just a great dampd game
it is a great roleplaying and adventure game
every character trait matters
higher intelligence gives you access to more dialog options
higher wisdom allows you to accumulate memories and experience faster
it is very rare to find a game that puts this kind of value on intellectual traitsas i mentioned the biggest strength of this game is the story
it is eerie dark humorous creative compelling exciting and unpredictable all at the same time
it gets interesting in the first scene and stays that way until the excellent ending
it is supported with brilliantly written dialogue and elaborately painted characters
unlike most games the dialog is one of the highlights of the game
each character that joins the main character is deep and contributes value to the story
the story in most games is hitormiss
this one was a home run
its too bad that there arent more like it out therethe graphics more than two years after the game came out still look good although they are not cutting edge anymore
the cinematic scenes are great and the music is excellent tooif there is a shortcoming to the game then it is the combat system itself
the feedback during combat isnt very good which sometimes leaves you wondering why one of the characters is taking damage or why your spell didnt work
the variety of weapons and especially spells is decent but nowhere close to the variety offered by other dampd games
for instance there are only two fifth level priest spells in the game
the combat is still fun though and there isnt an excessive amount of itif you are looking for a great storydriven roleplaying game and not just a hackandslash game then this is the game for youbest game since sliced bread
better than ultima  or even   great grafix to boot
the character developement is similar to nd ed except for wheapon prof and wisdom attributes big debute for main pc
the game deals with your lost memories and finding your way through dimensional gatewaysaka ultima dr who warriors gate sg ect
if you dont know everything thier is to know about the quotrulesquot then its a lot more fun
the compainions are holes i wouldve preferred the quotkirk spock bonesquot comradery in some of the characters as was present in ultima shamino iolo dupre amp mr a but the skull guy is fun and your undead so sob compainions is appropriate i guess
dont let sum dampd nerd tell you how to play discover it yourself
it also runs flawlessly on xp which is a huge  for a game of this age i think patch to i originally bought this game as something to distract me while i waited for throne of bhaal to come out never have i made a more wise purchase
planescape torment is a remarkable game with a wast array of sidequests and where everything and everyone is somehow connected
the plot is somewhat mature but the rd person perspective makes is much less graphic than games like quake or doom
the npcs are very entertaining and offer a vast array of skills and dialogue i like the fact that the pc can initiate dialogue themselves
i like that the characters actions defined his alignment not vice verse
i didnt like the limitations put on the main characters appearance and sexas a female i like to play w female pcs but i didnt mind that much
i also liked that the areaaffect spells didnt damage party members as they do in the bg series
however the first part of the game was quite confusing and i had a tough time navigating through all the sections of the slums and remembering where everything was the programmers did include a handy mapmarking feature which helps though
i also wish that there had been some expansion of some aspects in the game such as the mysterious lady of pain but far be it from me to complain
since it doesnt appear that amazon has this game in stock at the moment i suggest that you drive to the nearest software storm and buy this gamebuy this game and see why computer gaming world ranked it as the best rpg of   be warned its extremely textheavy so plan on lots of reading
but dont let that deture you from a great computer story with well drawn  out and interesting characters and questsit doesnt get any better than this
the story was the best i have ever played through in any game ever
i was engrossed and could not stop until early morning
i had to play it every day
i cant believe how great this game is
good job black isle studiosyouve probably read about how much story and text planescape throws at you
some might consider this a bad thing but i can vouch that all of verbiage they give you is good
i knew this was a different better kind of game when i started out in a mausoleum filled with zombies
not just repetitive undead attackers though  each zombie had its own description and characteristics and for the first time in a game i got the feeling that these undead were actual former people  very creepy
farther on you are exposed to the troubled pasts of the main character and his cohorts but not all at once your companions react to each other and the things that happen to you
talk to them periodically and different options open up
not to mention all of the existential issues that are explored with the main character who is immortal but cant remember his past incarnations
some people have noted that maybe pt presents you with too much storyline and doesnt let you roleplay enough but there is still ample opportunity to affect your characters standing both with your stats wisdom is important even though your character can only be a fighter mage and thief and with your actions within the gamethen again if all the text bores you you can probably just ignore it and play through a worthy successor to baldurs gate
its obviously very similar in gameplay to bg same company same engine which includes the good strong combat engine good graphics great sound and music with the bad iffy pathfinding and sortof nonlinearity except you are obligated to do most of the unrelated side quests just to build up enough experience to get through the main quest
bg is a good game and is definitely longer than pt but i liked planescape better anyway because of the atmosphere the story added and because there was always something compelling for your character to do unlike bg where sometimes you were just clearing out area after areathe is one of the best add games ever made
this game is different from all the other add games out there
the setting and ideas in this game are the most interesting and involving of any add game ive ever played
this game just rocks the graphics are a little dated and sometimes are hard to make out but dont let that distract you the sound especially the voice acting is awesome
awesome
awesome this is the only plancescape add game available for the computer you can play this game as a hack and slash or with more panash as a wizard or thief
or you can play the game as all three although your character would be too weak to be much good in endgame i love the character generation process
really great deep and engaging story
a real mystery that you cant stop playing you are drawn to find out whats happeningin short this is a great gamethe people at black isle made this for people that want a lot of character developement and story in their rpgs
well they succeeded with flying colors
you wake up on a mortuary table with no memories
as the game progresses you explore sigil the city that joins the planes togetherand recover your memories and realize that you have some sort of curse of immortality
on your journey to stop the cycle of dying and coming back you meet a large assortment of very interesting npcs that will aid you on your quest
all of which have pretty deep well fleshed out personalities and sometimes keep the player entertained with amusing banter with one another
the game also has a lot of replay value since your choices during conversation and actions you take when interacting with people you meet impact the future choices youll have
if youre mean youll get a reputation and it will precede you
the way you assign your scores also makes a big impact
the higher your wisdom intelegence and charisma the more dialogue you will have to choose from
a higher wisdome and intelegence also grants you speedier recovery of your memories
so playing through as a strong fighter will be very different than playing through as a highly intelegent wizard or a smoothtalking rogue
ultimately probably the best rpg ive ever playedfor some reason back when this came out i had no warning
all of a sudden it appeared at the video game store
i must say that i typically enjoy the products black isle puts out and i got quite excited when i saw they had released something in the planescape setting
im probably one of the few diehard planescape fans out there
i own all the add books and supplements as well as the collectible card game
also my friends and i are slowly working through playing them allanyway as for games my favorite genres are first person shooters and role playing games
once and i while ill find a good game outside of those genres but those typically stay my favorite though there are naturally some flops as well
i am pleased to say that planescape torment is not the latter
in fact this even after these near ten years since its release remains as one of the top rpgs ive ever played but that could just be my planescape bias speakingfor those of us out there who have gotten into playing dd  probably wont recognize what thaco is for but you have to remember this is based on the advanced dungeons and dragons rules
regardless it still doesnt really take away from the game play if youre a fan of the new rules
as far as this compares against other rpgs i was shocked that it comes with a premade character
now you do have to choose the class so you have options in that right
at first i was a little skeptical but as you go into the storyline you get really into itthe storyline is what really makes the game
basically you dont know who you are and you interact with a world that you have to essentially rediscover because you have some sort of strange amnesia
you awaken in the mortuary of sigil because the dustmen thought you were dead
in planescape sigil is basically the fulcrum city for access to everywhere else
you get to visit many other planes in this multiverse setting and graphically its all very impressive
i thought this game really captured the essence and majesty that is the planescape setting and they really put it together down to the very last detail
i imagine this was immensly difficult considering how large this setting actually is
naturally it doesnt have everything but it captures the major points at the very least
you come across other characters through your adventures that decide to join you in your path as well and you eventually grow a pretty strong party to face the higher levels
so the game is partially a mystery but there is a lot of action sequences where your character can choose to fight his way through
in this the script is also very well written which was something else that really impressed me about this gamethis is one of the closest games ive come across thats very similar to a true dd campaign
the negatives that some users might walk away with is that it really is only a single player game so you cant join forces over the net like you can in games like diablo
also youre limited to being the nameless one and once his story line is over its pretty much done
however the ability to play in different classes throughout the game sort of makes up for this factor
it was honestly a small negative for me because i tend to play through games only once then start a new and totally different game
there are only a few games that i will play multiple times over and overin the end this is an absolutely enthralling story
i logged a lot of hours playing this game and it easily kept me occupied for a few months
i dont play games all day for long periods of time rather i tend to play for a few hours each day so it takes me a long time to complete epic games of this magnitude
if you are a diehard planescape fan like me then this is absolutely a must buy and if youre also quite the connoisseur of rpgs then this is definitely a game to look intoi was interested in quotplanescape tormentquot because for years ive missed the thrills of playing adampd in my friends basement
 years in fact but i still remember the rules and the spells the races and  classes etcive played other computer rpgs going back to pool  of radiance but none really could bring back any of the real excitement  of adampd  happily quotplanescape tormentquot  doesgranted its not quite the real thing but its close enough  that ive spent many happy hours playing the game working my way through  the remarkably interesting story and enjoying the combatif you  cant find the time or companions for some good old gaming  quotplanescape tormentquot is a good substitutewow
those were my first words after playing planescape torment for the pc
i have to tell you i am an avid fan of the dungeon and dragons planescape universe
i own almost every product made by tsr and was quite shocked to see that they were making a pc game of planescape
at first i thought it might be like baldurs gate
sorry guys i wasnt really impressed by baldurs gate
but like i said after playing it for  minutes i was convinced that this was going to be the best game ever
it was really a well done game and faithful adaption of the dungeon and dragons planescape universe
there are so many good things to say about this game i dont know where to start
well let me just tell you my favorite things about the game
first and foremost the story
amnesia works well in a story if used properly like memento
that in itself is a great hook which will keep the player playing for hours just to find out who he is
and then i loved the different methods you could use for situations in the game
if you had hight charisma or intelligence you were given different dialogue choices that could change the the game
the first time i played i tried maxing out the charisma intelligence and wisdom stats so that i could regain more memories and have more things to say to the npcs
that has to be a first in dungeons and dragons where i didnt try to get high strength dexterity or constitution scores
unfortunately i never finished the game as it was very tough
so i missed out on a lot but what i did play was awesome
i went out and bought the novel which was good by the way and read the whole story
there was no way i was missing out on that story
and what a great story it was all the way up to the ending
so if you havent played this game yet go out and buy it
dont be deterred by the d graphics once your in the game you wont even notice
in fact i just might load the game up and try to finish it this timei loved this gamei played it about  years ago
black isle strikes againwith a fantastic game you can only play one character the nameless one but he issuper cool
he never dies
lol  well he can but then he gets back up again and ready to fight again
so you cant actually get killed for good in this gameyou can join up with several npcs one being a floating skullnamed morte
he is very cool to have around and is very powerful in high levels
there is even a somewhat romance forthe main character  shes got a tail laughs and she is very neat to have aroundthe graphics are superb the storyline is one of the best ive seen and the combat system i just loved
very easy to use controls and has dungeon crawl galoreits been awhile since i actually played it but if i remember right you can play  different classes
a fighter a thief or a mage
the fighter class is by far the best one to go withyou basically start out in a dungeon lying on a hospital table and then are greeted by morte who will help you get started with how the game works your fighting journal etc
he will then join up with you and help you escape the place
there is much to do right from the beginning trying to escape
i dont wanna give away too much because it is a very awesome storylinei will add however as the story unfolds your character finds out more about himself
why is is there and what lies ahead for him
its hard to explain but i am sure you will love itgive it a try you will not regret italso has a nice modding community on sorcerersnetbuy and play this gameciaodefinately a great black isle game which deserves to sit in such high tiers as fallout  fallout  and arcanum
the story makes playing an immortal fun for once so read up soul reaver makers
the characters are imaginative and deepand you can talk with the other characters in your party to enhance the story
find your journal learn of your past and for gods sake use the sphereyou start out as a fighter but you can quickly become a thief or wizard just look around
the story does hit home but it could have used a better ending no offense this game earns  stars just playing it from one end to the other
the payoff is getting there not the endthis game puts you on a bumpy and fun ride
buy and enjoy
btw soul bringer the game this one is hooked to on a duel jewel really bites in comparisonwhat a game
ive just seen the endgame sequences today and that means  my personal torment has just started
since ive already played fallout   how will i ever find another game this goodheavily scarred and  tattooed your character the nameless one awakes on a mortuary slab and  the first sound you hear is the smart mouthed floating skull morte the  first of your companions on of your journey
morte is a floating  repository of knowledge which is just as well since it turns out youve  died come back to life and lost your memory  again
when morte  translates the tattoos on your back you get the first clues about the  cycle of life and death youve become trapped in
in your search as an  amnesiac immortal to find out whats been happening to you and who is  behind it all you get to explore and meet many of the strange denizens of  the planes performing quests in return for knowledge
some of those who  know the most about your past consent to join you  it would be great if  the party size could accommodate all of themalmost as quickly as you  realise this aint kansas it becomes obvious planescape torment is not  your average hacknslash rpg
in fact too much bloodshed will find you  mazed i had to restart
by the lady of pain who watches over sigil the  city of doors the plane which houses the mortuary and which contains  portals to many other planes if you have the right keys
most  confrontations are best sorted out by words and this may be a problem with  some players as you have to wade through a huuuuge amount of text and  dialogue to resolve these encounters in a peaceful fashion
in fact ive  recently read that feargus urquhart of black isle studios said the  incredible amount of dialogue that needed to be written almost killed the  guys working on it and sometimes i thought the bizarre and esoteric nature  of some of it was going to cause my brain to self combust but it all added  to the rich texture and complexity of the game
its a good idea to save  often because its easy to accidentally offend someone while tiptoeing  through the diplomatic minefield and suddenly find yourself in a fight to  the death with someone who shouldnt be killedyou start the game either  as a fighter mage or thief but can change professions during the game as  you need
however its important to specialise sooner or later as there  are only so many experience points to go around
unlike other adampd  games you dont get to decide your characters alignment during character  generation  this changes according to your actions throughout your  travels
and when you level you get points with which you can increase  attributes such as strength and wisdom so you can start out as a pretty  mediocre mage and end up a mental giant if that is your path
like all  adampd games planescape torment is full of items and artefacts often  only usable by certain professions which can temporarily change  statistics
as usual you need these things most in the beginning when  you can least afford themset in the bizarre surrealistic world of the  planes designing planescape torment must have been an experience
how  many times have we played games supposedly set in an alternate reality but  where the buildings look eerily similar to ours
the external architecture  of planescape torments buildings many of which served no apparent  purpose looks like something gaudi could have designed had he been on  crack
the interiors however are usually disappointingly familiar
some  of the spells and there are many are worth learning and casting just to  see the effects
members of your party have their own little  idiosyncrasies annahs tailflicking mortes eyerolling and dakkon  constantly sipping from his flask and like to chat or argue among  themselves  which can be disconcerting just when youre about to wade into  battlealthough planescape torment uses the same engine as baldurs  gate the camera is closer to the ground thus making the characters and  their immediate environment quite detailed
however this makes everything  very close so ranged weapons are useless and by the time some spells are  cast the foes are beating the  out of you some cant be negotiated  with
 or with some of the area spells you get hurt as much as the enemy
you have to learn very quickly what works
the music score although  sometimes tedious after many hours contains some great themes   deionarras theme in particular is so hauntingly beautiful it was worth  visiting her just to hear it
the voice cast containing some reasonably  well known actors is largely wasted since except for a few introductory  phrases most dialogue is text
however among others you will hear  michael t weiss the pretender mitch pileggi x files dan  castellanetta simpsons john delance q in star trek tng and who knew  this is what sheena easton has been getting up to latelyi must admit  that when i first read about planescape torment and read the box i  thought it would be too dark and bizarre for me
then i thought these  other people awarding  stars cant all be wrong so thank goodness i  changed my mind
even so it was several hours before i quotgot  itquot
apparently due to the reason stated above while not ruling out  the possibility the guys at black isle are in no particular hurry to get  started on a sequel
i hope they recover soon and get started because im  already waitingin its latest issue my favourite gaming magazine here  in australia listed planescape torment as the second best game ever  beaten only by deus ex
for me even though its like comparing apples and  oranges its a dead heat for first place  fallout  and planescape  torment but then i havent played deus exi bought this game for my brother and he said it is an awsome game
the graghics are cool
the gameplay is challengingplanescape torment has to be one of the best computer rpg games of all time
it has everything one looks for in such a game from an incredible setting to a highly original plot to excellent multiple roleplaying options to outstanding graphics to extraordinary accuracy in relation to dungeons  dragons and much much morethere is something here for everyone as the variety of challenges is large indeed including battles puzzle solving and dialogue among othersthe game is set in sigilthe city of doors primarily as well as various other locations within the planescape multiverse as it deals with the nameless hero and his efforts to find out more about himself after realizing that he has lost both his memory and his mortalitythe story as a whole is excellent
the plot is so incredibly well written and presented that the gamer feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters seeing what they see feeling what they feel sensing what they sense
moreover the game does a great job of presenting the distinct cultures and civilizations of the inhabitants of planescape sigil the outlands baator etc
this has without a doubt been achieved as a result of a great deal of research that has gone into learning and understanding the numerous and often complex characteristics of the planescape multiverselet me tell you nothing i say nothing compares to the endless hours of gaming enjoyment that i have experienced playing tormentstrongly recommended to both fantasy as well as planescape enthusiasts along with the baldurs gate seriestrust me you will not regret itin conclusion together with planescape torment torment the novel is also recommended
it is based on the computer game therefore it only touches on a limited amount of material presented in the game but it too is lots of funive roleplayed since the s and have probably played every rp game thats come out since that date including recent reviews for bellaonlinecom
my first assumption was that planescape would be a  knockoff of baldurs gate and be fun but not uniqueit is amazingly  far more than thatsure its built on the same great engine that  baldurs gate was
same third person view with the great graphics and  sounds that bg is famous for
however the developers of planescape  definitely knew what they were doing when they enhanced the system
they  addressed many complaints gamers had with bg and took it to another leveltake death
yes that pesky death stuff that seems to happen to gamers  when they encounter a group of basilisks or perhaps a bandit or three
no  problem for planescape  youre immortal
not only that but deaths  actually help you sometimes jarring loose memories that were until that  point hidden
like who you are
what youre about
why youre immortal when  apparently nobody else iswhich brings me to another point  the  storyline is great
they take an idea that has definitely been done before   you wake up with amnesia uncertain of your past or present
nine princes  of amber is a famous story that does this very well
so you learn as you  go with the help of your amusing sidekick the skull named morte
yes  your pal is a floating skull who follows you along the game is  understandably quotdarkquot
you are after all someone who keeps  rising from the grave wandering around a miserable little town full of  unhappy people
its probably not a game for  year olds but most  teenagers will easily relate to the misery of the towns occupants
you  find things like clot charms to help heal your wounds bandages to tape  yourself back up
its the same quests and challenges but its so much  more your alignment actually alters as you interact with npcs
keep  doing good things  your alignment is naturally good
keep slaughtering  innocents while they plead for mercy and yup youre bad
your alignment  then affects how people react to you
even better  your intelligence  determines what you can say or do in some cases
no more of this idiotic  barbarian easily figuring out how to deal with a noble negotiatori was  impressedthere are all sorts of twisted plot items that are clear  indicators of the amount of work the designers put into thinking this  through
you wake up with a note to yourself carved in your own back
you  wander outside and find a notezombie with notes stuck to his body
every  doorway can be a portal to another world if you find the key
but keys can  be anything  a piece of paper a certain person even a song sung in a  certain waythe game is definitely a thinking game  one created for  true strategists and role players who want a challenge out of a game and  not just a hackfest
for gamers who have complained that rp could never be  fun on a computer try planescape torment
you just might have your hands  fullthis disclaimer is for the company who sold the pc game thru amazon
its listed as complete wbig box  manual
it arrived as a regular pcdvd rom movie box plastic case not a big game box and no manual inside the case
you might as well order the game in jewelcase version and save the moneyrather buy from this one
amazon i hope you somehow force this company gamewizard to change its listing
black isle studios games are some of the best rpgs ever made
you cant go wrong with this game
welcome to sigil the city of doors a place with gates that lead anywhere in existence provided you have the proper key
it is a neutral ground and watering hole for races across the multiverse all under the watchful shadow of the lady of pain the enigmatic ruler of the city
it is a place where the word is mightier than the sword where thought defines reality where belief has the power to reshape worlds and change the laws of physics
interplaya true rpg classic in its own righthow to write review without spoiling a game having so great plot
lets just say this game has better plot than most of novels in genre
it will make you laugh cry and even feel scared sometimesgame begins in thrash horrorhellraiserish environment but i wouldnt call it a horror rpg
sure there are scary elements but there are also extremely humorous parts although game is more serious than arcanumwhich is prankbased
story has both phylosophical and absurd humour aspect since in all games you have limited life points and here you are immortal trying to fid out about himselfcharacters are incredible an anarchist who has to be loyal to main character succubus who has bordel for intelectual lust a floating skull who always gives ladies overgenerous comments and so on
each of them is so impressive that communicating resembles talking to people you know from somewhereunlike many games dialogue solves most of quests and intelligence and wisdom are much more appreciated here than in other rpgs
fighting is intensive only at the end of game so story is everythinggraphics look nice even today after  years
the architecture and artwork are stylish and will never be outdatedpick this up it is maybe even better that fallout original sequels not bethesedas fallout  and deeper than arcanuumeditafter slowly metabolising impressions about this game i found out it is a story with a moral or lets say short phylosophycal tale
if you want to play one rpg on pc i am sure this is the one you need to playif you like killing many monsters killing and killing and killing just like in diablo and diablo  or if you usually play rpgs with only one character for more experience then it is not a game for your taste
what makes torment a great game is the interactions between your group members  quests that many of them dont even involve killing and wonderful reflection of the planescape universe
if action is more important for you than nonkilling quest experience if you easily get bored of long text dialogues some of them dont have anything to do with the storyline but very helpfull to understand the planescape universe if you had no experience with it before then buy ice wind dale or diablo expansion
ice wind dale involves linear story line much less interaction with npc s more monsters and more experiencewhat may be a conpro for this game it shows its age
its been about two years since the release of the game and although it uses the same graphic engine with icewind dale and baldurs gate it is not advanced as they are in the graphics
resolution is limited to x but because it had very well designed backgrounds and character models you dont even notice the negatives
what makes it better than icewind dale and baldurs gate in graphics in my opinion is the way the npc s are designed
in baldurs gate and icewind dale if you have a thief character for example unless you buy a different armor it looks like the rest of the thiefs in the town
while in torment each npc that can be added to your group has its own design and sound
believe me in baldurs it really gets boring to hear the same voice from all mages while they are casting while in torment your npc mages has their own voices slowing down bug the game has a bug that whatever your processor speed is under some circumstances the game really slows down
 patch reduces much of it but still happens sometimes possible spoiler
map unless you reach the lower ward you cant click on some place in the world map and go there
you have to run through the whole sigil to reach somewhere far away until you complete about  of the game
it really gets boring sometimes loading scenes in baldurs  and icewind dale loading times are reduced
also in baldurs most of the time entering a house does not need a load
torment uses the unmodified version of the bioware engine and every time the environment changes it loads from the cd
you may reduce the loading time by doing a full install but there isnt an option for it in the installation screen
you have to manually copy some files from the cd s and do some editing in ini files
go and check the black isle web site for that while playing you feel that there is a living city around you
npcs walk around talk with each other react when a fight occurs near them
also for npc s in your group you really feel that they have their own ideals their own stories which are incredibly connected to your characters past nameless one you it is the only reason enough to play this game
an amnesiac immortal in search of his past and his mortality
as you learn more about him and how he caused the things that others called fate it becomes harder to quit playing
suggestion to hardcore gamers if you want to get much more pleasure from the game before playing it read something about planescape universe bloodwar sigil and lady of pain
you will catch some small details about nameless ones past and understand much better what happens to him at the end of the game many people dont understand the purpose of the ending demo and will have increadibly more enjoyable playing time than an average gamer hasplay it as a fighter than as a mage they are much different in playing
whatever class you choose to play always create a character of wis and int even if you are a fighter
torment is mostly a noncombat rpg and these attributes determine your exp level amounts of memories you recalland you learn much more abaout his pastand the number of dialogues that appear during the speech
you gain attribute points as nameless one remembers his past so a low str or con is not a problem for a fighter also dont forget that you are already an immortal
buy it it is an incredible gamewhoever doubts that computer gaming is an artform should play planescapetormentwords fail to describe the perfect symphony of brilliant ideas emerging storyline beautiful environments mesmerizing music fun gameplay and detailed coding that makes this game an unsurpassed classici have yet to meet anyone who has played it and not raved about itnamelessone and his companions are characters that will stay with you forever
the graphics may seem a bit outdated nowadays they are the same as the first baldurs gate they share the same engine infinity however true rpg gamers know that graphics are not a selfsustained aimthis is not a new game
so do not expect an exploding eyecandy or a fastpaced game try youtube to check out whether this may not be your cup of tea
one has to let himself immerse into the world of the planes and the doomed city of sigil
but their magic shall always stay with youthis used to be sold out game and could only be found in old stock houses and ebay
count yourself lucky and treat yourself to this gem
trust me you have to have this onehighly recommendedone of the best games i have ever played
i love all of the baldurs gate games and this one ranks right there with it but perhaps better in my opinion
ok graphics is not all that but the story line which i rate a  is fantastic plus the music is wonderful
if you like baldurs gate you will enjoy this one for sure for anyone who hasnt played this game and is looking for a good roleplaying or adventure game i can highly recommend this game
there is little i can say that previous reviewers have not already covered but planescape is an excellent example of what a roleplaying game should be
even though the graphics are no longer on the cutting edge the game itself easily stands the test of timeplanescape torment represents a fantastic creative achievement with a strange and twisted land that has been painstakingly fleshedout for gamers to explore
the game world features an astonishing number of areas to explore
it is also very flexible  there are many ways to accomplish tasks from using force to smooth talking to magic means
you can choose to be evil cruel or callous
perhaps youd rather be benevolent helpful even generous
unlike most roleplaying games you dont have a fixed class and you do not choose your own alignment
your actions determine your alignment over time and you can change your class at will
the result is a very rare game that gives gamers a real opportunity to role play one where characters react to you based on what youve done in the past
and the story itself is absolutely compelling and fascinating a story so complicated that one playing will not be enough to reveal all its subtletiesthis game is not as wellknown as black isles more popular baldurs gate and icewind dale series but it may actually be the best of the bunch
it should easily run on all but the very slowest computers
i can go on and on about how good this game is how good the voice acting is making the characters seem even more lifelike how original the game world is but you should find out for yourself
if youre a fan of roleplaying games you should not miss planescape tormentover a decade old still one of the best games ive ever played and one of the top  stories ive ever read
thats right read
the games vivid engrossing writing draws you in the way games with full voice acting often fail to do and leaves an enduring impression on youi really cant add much more to whats already been said but like a former reviewer stated one might ask oneself how an old and admittedly graphically dated game is still getting star reviews
i take it its the formula of a superbly fleshedout world memorable characters engaging voice acting a twisting and turning plot and rich visualswith a wardrobe full of style and more substance than you can shake an entropic blade at planescape torment is a classic that transcends the borders of gameplay and becomes a masterclass in storytellingi agree with so many fellow gamers that this is easily one of the best games to have been produced
fantastic story interesting characters and engaging dialogue
unlike so many fantasy games this one is not built around destroying everything in sight
the most rewarding portions are solving the myteries about the main your character  the nameless one fighting is necessary at times but discovery is the name of this gamewhy does this game still end up getting reviews years later
why is it considered a must play and retains that status years later
because this game is an all time classic an amazing experience that has yet to be matchedthis is an amazing work of art
the fact that it gets the recognition it deserves years later is a testament to its utter brilliance
it has an amazing storyline and some of the most beautiful dialogue ive witnessed amazing characters and much more
be careful
it may just change you in various ways
its a terrific work and will stay with you forever
get it nowafter so many years of reading books playing video games  watching movies certain stereotypes tend to get really worn out the save the world and amnesiac hero cliches and the tolkien based fantasy realms of rpgs started to become boring after awhile
there were always some magnificent exceptions like darklands system shock wasteland and its direct descendants the fallouts but all in all by the late nineties i had begun to drift more toward console rpgs their design was pretty formulaic but at least they took some chances with their setting and storiesbut then i played planescape tormentsome of the usually criticisms towards crpgs is how they are all combatcentric and how they lack of real choice in how the game unfolds you had to go to darklands to find the last game that really offered you alternatives between fighting a monster tricking him and sneaking away or talking him out of bashing your skullplanescape torment had this and much morenot since the days of the quest for glory series had a game like this tailored the experience more to your character plus you could be as kind hearted or ruthless as you wanted this game had no restrictions on what kind of choices you could make and literaly having a blank slate hero that had an actual history before begining the game was such a powerful experience that even today its unmatched
i mentioned quest for glory because you could amost play torment as an adventure game where you dont have to worry so much about the next big fight but how the next development of the story was going to affect you
the rich and thought provoking dialogues imagine that in kiddie friendly modern games
of the nameless one and the denizens of the planes you visited during the journey were so powerful that even today they are unmatched in their creativity and ingenuity can anyone forget the brothel of slating intellectual lusts or the confrontation with ravel
in the end how many games can you honestly name that actually made you sad to finish because that meant that the experience was overthe unfolding story of the nameless one and his quest to find himself is still one of my favorite games of all time in any genrei played this for a long long time way back on the original version i purchased when it came out
i dont know what became of that original copy but i was overjoyed to find this republished here on amazoncom
there are places in this game that stick in my memory  the dead city buried under ragpickers square curst and the fortress of regrets
the wonderful city of sigil that seemed to possess so many dark corners and odd inhabitants from all corners of the multiverse
there was something vastly different about this game something that set it apart from the wonderful bgii and other games of the day
there is even something that sets it apart from the games of today such as dragon age and oblivion
granted the graphics are aged but still catch the eye
they possess an art style that still makes them intriguing
the depth of ideas philosophy and wonderful fictional history floating within the text conversations that frequent the game is what sets it above most of the rpgs of years gone and even the ones of today
upon playing it again i am enjoying it immensely but find myself in a way rather sad
this game was a pinnacle from back in the day back when you spent hours delving into conversations and puzzles trying to find the next step to solve the riddle of a man your immortal protagonist that ever struggles to find his scattered memories
however most of what is produced today doesnt seem to come close
i found i greatly enjoyed fallout  a wonderful example of depth with improved graphics
but discouraged with the linear fare typical with many consolepc games such as dragon age mass effect and the latest ff offerings
it would be absolutely killer if someone revisited planescape with something akin to fallout   alas it will probably never happen
if you like rpgs however i highly recommend you snag a copy of this gem while it is still available
one of the finest examples of the genre out therethis is an rpg with style
in fact it has more style than all the other infinity engine games combined
the story is creative enthralling and very astounding
the characters are original and highly interactive
you can see that a writer designed this gamewhat is not happening in this game is combat and action
the player is going along for the ride instead of taking a direct hand
there is also not much customization
character creation is simplistic with only a meaningless choice between three different classes that dont make any difference over allstill its a good game for those who are cerebral and dont have an itchy trigger fingeri loved this game and ended up buying the walkthru guide
had a blast and gave it to my nephews and they loved it toowhat kind of game can you write a paper about for english class and still get a perfect grade on the paper
this kindwhat kind of game will have you thinking about it and replaying it for years at a time
this kindwhat kind of game will leave you literally praying for another game that rivals it
this kindmost of black isles games were really good but planescape torment is nothing short of a masterpiece
the lush gameworld the extraordinarily intricate character interaction and the terrific plot are all things that we have seen before and are likely to see again
but planescape leaves you with something even more than a pleasant gaming experience it leaves you with an entirely new perspective on life
without being brazen about it planescape demonstrates that tiny actions miniscule decisions can change the nature of the universe it also shows the affects of what i believe to be the most painful emotion within the human experience regret
at the same time as all this planescape is successful at being a remarkably good game and it isnt preachy at all in case youre worried that philosophy will override entertainmentthis game is close to godliness definitely my favorite game of all time
highly recommendedive been playing video games for about  years or so
i started on consoles snes n etc
 but i eventually moved into pc gaming
the main reasons i switched are fallout baldurs gate and planescape freaking tormenttorment is by far the best game i have ever played
to describe it properly however is impossible
its a game thats almost like a book
there is a lot of text
there are only three required fights in the entire game if i recall correctly
but ill be damned if ive never enjoyed reading and playing a video game more than i did with torment
all of the characters have welldeveloped backstories that you get to see piece by piece as the game goes on
there is plenty of lore for people who love knowing about the world theyre playing in you get an illustration and a nice description of every single unit you encounter in the game
the towns in the game are alive
the sounds make you really feel like the npcs in the game are actually doing things other than standing around and moving occasionally
the environments are detailed and done extremely well  every zone is unique
you dont feel like youre in the same place everbut its the story the story of torment is truly literature in my eyes
you find out that the hero you play has been around for ages and was actually kind of a jerk to a lot of people youll meet
its an amnesia story so slightly unoriginal in that respect but its still very very original and sad and clever
this game is one of the few games where i felt really bad for one of my party members because the description of the memory you have of how you treated him is just brutal
if it was a movie the scene would be all of  seconds long and really not graphic but black isle studios writers were masters at what they did
and they evoke so many emotions in this game through their writing and descriptionsplease please please play this game
pirate it if you have to because black isle studios is no longer around so the people responsible for the game wont get rewarded financially
but they you and the video gamers in general will be rewarded if you just play this game
once you play the game and get through it you will finally realize how much better games can be
we can prevent halo  call of duty  part modern warfare  or super mario xxixiivixx from being all that is expected out of a game
if we demand that video game makers create highquality progressive products like torment or fallout not that atrocious abomination that bethesda pinched out then video games might be taken more seriously
torment is art
its literature
roger ebert has no idea what hes talking about or hes never seen a game as phenomenal as this oneget it and do yourself a favorplanescape torment is one of the best roleplaying games ever written
the writing talent and imagination that went into the game are impressive equalled by no other game ive played with the possible exception of the classic masterpiece star control  the planescape universe is one of the most compelling and interesting ive seen and the games playable characters are all distinct welldeveloped sympathetic and memorable
the game begins with the protagonist the nameless one waking up on a cold stone slab in a mortuary his memory gone and his body covered in scars and tattoos his senses assaulted by the smell of formaldehyde and rotting flesh coming from the nearby corpses and the zombies that are working on them
this is a dark beginning and the game remains dark throughout which is unappealing to some and is probably responsible for this games relatively poor sales compared to inferior but lighter games such as baldurs gate
while torment is a dark game it does not require you to be evil or immoralthe darkness comes from the games exploration of tragedy
one of its central questions is what can change the nature of a man
its mood is similar but not the same as that of the fallout games
the equation is simpleif youre a lover of fiction who is not turned off by darkness you will almost certainly love planescape tormentplanescape  torment is a great rpg in the truest sense of the genre
you play the nameless one a confused but apparently immortal in the sense of if you die you dont die for good wanderer of the planes whose very flesh tells the tale of his endless struggles
you are turned loose into a world that bears only a passing and vague resemblance to any other dd or rpg realm you may have encountered and that is filled with endless mysteries and characters
ive never played another game where you can spend an hour talking to the other npcs in your party let alone in the rest of the world earning experience and knowledge for what you uncover about their lives and never feel like youre bored
there are plenty of fights but no sense of tedious hackandslash and its difficult to emphasize just how convoluted and intricate both the plot and the game systems really are
as an example at one point my nameless character was festooned with powergranting tattoos dual classed as a thiefmage and clubbing his enemies with a severed limb from one of his own previous incarnations
i mean come onthis is not really an rpg you can power game your way through more to its credit
one of the most important statistics is wisdom tactics are more important than brute force and the puzzles and side quests are to be savored not accomplished as rapidly as possiblelastly in response to some of the other reviews i have to note a few things
first there are plenty of ranged weapons particularly crossbows for a character you can obtain about halfway through in an impressive side quest
moreover there are life indicators under the portrait for each npc so its easy to see when people are hurt
and finally having played baldurs gate baldurs gate ii icewind dale etc the spell names types and effects in planescape are totally awesome and in keeping with the surreal and twisted landscape
this is not a game to be missedyears after its release planescape torment is still the model for computer role playing games
while the infinity engine is now dated and the resolution in this game is poor by todays standards the presentation  setting mood colors effects  is outstanding and should serve as a model for game designtorment is based on adampd rules and an overlooked adampd campaign setting planescape
torment is true to its penandpaper roots automating the cumbersome rules and allowing enjoyable structured gameplay and character development
the game is designed in the spirit of the fallout series black isle studios first smashhit crpg line which means lots of reading and lots of interactive dialogue choices which monopolize a lot of game time
the game uses a modified version of the infinity engine used in biowares quotbaldurs gatequot series also part of the family of adampdbased crpgsthe game puts you in the role of the nameless one a perfect character for customization and selfdiscovery which are what make this game so attractive
the story has several elements of the standard myth but your character is strangely postmodern and existential
you will encounter a wide variety of settings styles and characters as you travel around sigil the city at the center of the universe and the worlds to which it is connected
you will have an enormouse amount of freedom to act and explore which may sometimes have you exploring for hours off the main track of the storyline
because of this planescape torment may take over  hours to complete just for the first time
however with sufficient focus i am certain it could be done in half that timereplay value is high because you can play the game with a different personality play style and different companions
the game may seem to have dated graphics but the sound is still topnotch and the game programming is robust
load times may be hard to stomach but it should be easier if you follow online instructions to move the entire game from cd to hard drive or virtual cdbe careful though this game will cause you to want to talk about its philosophical ramifications to friends who will be absolutely lost after you get absorbed into the world of planescape
the game is best played in really big blocks of time  hours followed by reflection about how great the game is
im serious about thatby all means purchase a copy of this game and play it
play it like you mean it and absorb everything the game has to offer in sound mood setting and storyline
game designers take note this game is what we should be making now with todays audio and video capabilities
planescape torment has the best story of any game made to date and it totally dominates the gameplay experience
thinking about this game gives me hope for the future of rpgs as interactive novels and worldasplayground games that tease the mind and excite the imagination
this is the game that sets the bar for an entire genretoy commander is a very interesting game in that its a lot more fun than a cursory glance would cause you to think
the games singleplayer has you take control of various toy planes helicopters cars tanks etc
completing puzzles against the clock across a bunch of different levels across different rooms of the house
the puzzles range from destroy all of x to get item x to location y without being killed
the levels are all fun mostly because while for each room of the house youre in the same basic area the levels each use the areas differently and restrict you in different ways so it feels like playing in a completely different area every time
if you complete each level in a room under the suggested time youll unlock the boss of that room however the game doesnt force you to do so
you can unlock the next room simply by finishing all the levels with any time
however when fighting the final boss you can only play as bosses that you have already defeated meaning that if you skipped all the bosses you cant finish the game
its a great way to get you to go back through and really think about your strategy in the levelsthe multiplayer is different but also just as fun
it gives you a few basic gamemodes like deathmatch or capture the flag but the most fun i had in multiplayer was just messing around with my friends in the different rooms
whats great about it is that the rooms all have these hidden passageways or different ways you can interact with them such as turning the lights onoff destroying objects etc that you wouldnt notice otherwise
my fondest memory is playing in the living room and greenhouse level and pushing the pool balls off of a ledge and into a fish tankbasically this game is a whole lot of fun and is a great way to use your imagination in a game thats based on using your imaginationwe all played with toys when we were younger
well thanks to the dreamcast we can all play with toys again and not feel guilty
only this time it is war
you control planes helicopters tanks and other vehicles through missions around the house
your objective defeat the toy commander
the game begins with training missions to sharpen your skills
you will need it
then it is off to the missions
the controls take a few tries to get use to them but are easy to master
the graphics are surpurb
it really looks like you are in a toy world house
the game play is good
i would say excellent but some of the tasks are pointless or seemingly impossible
but this does not ruin the game
it is still hours of fun
it can also become addicting
all in all  stars is deserved
i recommend this game if you enjoy war like games that dont require you to have a keyboard for help with the controls or want to see blood and gutsthis game is so great not just for the crazy concept of it but the execution of it is great too
there is just so much to do even if you just barely beat the game you still have so much else to do and the multiplayer is awesome
i recommend this game to everyone its just plain fun and yet challengingtomb raider  is my favorite game in the tr series
it had the most interestingexciting plot the best villians natla is pretty cool and so are larson and pierre and the best puzzles
even though the graphics arent as good as the ones nowadays they were excellent for  though the game is still my absolute favorite and takes the cakei found myself spending most of my childhood playing the first  games of lara croft on the pc after school and on my days off
now i am all grown up and sadly have destroyed lost or sold all of those games and it is completely impossible to find them for newer versions and the old win  computers are all but goneuntil i found the joy of downloading gamesthe site i went to was gogcom good old games and it has just about every hit game from the playstation  to the early playstation  era on it
among these are the first  tomb raider games
this site offers all of the oldies but goodies for a very cheap download for the newer versions of computers namely the vista and windows  and i found my self in tearsbut also shelling out  to buy the first six games againi have to say there really isnt a better series out there
this series competes with silent hill and resident evil in both the fun and puzzle aspect and the fact they have both been releasing games since the s and are still alive and doing better than ever
this first game wasnt the first one i ever played but it was one of the best
though the controls and graphics are both their own version of outdated and clunky it is still pretty simple and backed up with rather decent voiceovers awfulawful lines though and an incredible actionfilled story makes this game one of the best in the series and really one of the top playstationpc games ever released
the series only gets better from this gamei got this game in  it was the first game i got for my new pc
i had never seen anything like it before this was magic
a game that i could explore in d and with a nice looking character to play
the puzzles also had me captivated
it took me  months to complete
then i went and got tr
ok i agree the graphics are dated and that lara dosnt move so well as she does in the latter tr games
but to me this game is still the one that earned the name tomb raider most of all
why
because it deals with tombs long forgatten underground chambers pyramids without the overdone decoand of course atlantis
in the other tr games the levels are less mysterious and even mondane
the story is also more interesting and well thought out than the others
the puzzles are hard but in a less frustrating way
plus this game was made as an adventure game rather than a shooter which is what the other tr games resemble too much
if you havnt played it
play it
it is still good even after all this timei agree with michael below
the original tr is hands down the best in the series
each successive tr game though it may have enjoyed better graphics sound cut scenes etc also became progressively more difficult  and borderline unplayable
trii was fairly strong although it wasnt as  good as the first
but iii and iv introduced problematic frustrating  levels that sent one running to the internet or for the more foolish to  the nearest store to by the official eidos hint guidegamers need to  realize that glitzy graphics and cool sounds do not add up to a great game
i recently replayed tr and loved it
it has atmosphere who doesnt  remember standing way up there on top of the sphinxs head when the camera  pulls back giving you a perspective on the surroundings
it had  originality who wasnt surprised when a raptor came out of nowhere in the  lost valley
most importantly however tr had great puzzles puzzles  that could be figured out through logic
you might get stumped but if you  sat there long enough and stared at the screen the answer would eventually  occur to you
and if you were truly at a loss as i was during the  cistern you never got angry when you found out the solution online
you  never cursed at the game and yelled quothey thats bs
who would have  thought of trying thatquotsadly illogical puzzles plague the  remaining games in the series especially iii and iv
id stick with the  original the best tomb raiderthe original tomb raider while lacking the visual panache of the third and fourth entries and the intricate puzzles of all three sequels is still the bestthe reason is simple
this one is fun
the puzzles  are not needlessly obtuse and you dont have to wander endlessly  backtrack turn up the brightness and look in nonsensical places for the  solution to problems you cant even spot right awaythe plotline makes  the most sense and the level layout is far superior with the emphasis on  striking level design rather than puzzles
has there been any sequence in  any of the sequels to compare with the waterfall plunge and trex entry in  the lost valley
or the tower scene in rome where you battle the rooms of  the gods
i dont think so
this is before you needed a hint guide to  find any of the bonuses and you didnt die fifteen hundred times trying to  solve far too many puzzlesnow its a little tricky to get this to run on vista but i did after like  days straight anyway its a clasic i love the story and the graphics may be really low and pixilated but i never minded it that much
its fun and kinda easy but you do have to get used to the controls before you fight the big boss at the end which took me quite a while to figure out how to beat herso if you like puzzles and hours of adventure based fun get this but be warned if you have xp or vista you may have a really hard time getting it to workthe most remarkable thing to me is that this game has been overlooked by so many in the gaming community
in execution this game is brilliant especially considering that it is several years old
the graphics are as good as anything i have seen and better than many games which others have given high praise
the attention to detail is mindboggling
when running across a snow covered field you will notice that your soldier leaves footprints havent seen that before in a game
even the likeness of the soldiers matches the portrait in their biographical data most games have the same boxlike visage making all sprites look generic
the sound effects are excellent
each weapon has a unique audio as do all of the various vehicles which your team can operate
even the crunch of snow underfoot or rain pelting on the roof of a car will impress
atmosphere is greatly enhanced by a remarkable soundtrack the best i have heard in a game to date not at all annoying or overpowering as in some games it fades in and out as befitting the action
the acoustics from a radio in a train station or a night club singer from an open door will make you stop and savour the moment
the game operates similar to rainbow six but without the need to preplot
the way you conceive your attack is entirely flexible
this is the games strongpoint
if you decide that the selected route is too hazardous it is possible to bypass it
in several missions the route is hampered by steep rock
i have managed to get my boys to climb the sides of mountains and hit the enemy were they least expect it
its like playing a video version of force ten from navarone
each mission begins with selecting your hand picked team and assigning them weapons
these are essential to completing some scenarios as without a bazooka you will not take out a tank
your men can use as many weapons as they are capable of carrying unlike other games were you must select eitheror
thankfully you may also let the ai pick the weapons for you
during play you can pillage the germans of their weapons and these captured armaments will be carried over into the next round and if truth be told it has to be stated that the germans have some of the better stuff
there have been problems with bugs but nothing of a game spoiling nature
in some scenarios weapons will mysteriously vanish from your hands and render your soldier helplessthis happens only in first person view
to counteract this you may either rearm by hitting the enter key or by toggling the point of view there are three available this should make the weapon reappear
when this happens during a firefight it is usually fatal so learn to save oftenwhen negotiating steep terrain occasionally your man will become stuck and begin to rotate like a spinning top
he will not be able to move in any direction and will sometimes fall through the playing surface into the great black abyss and die
to avoid this try getting him to change his stance
i have gotten out of this predicament by making him either kneel or lie down
this is one of the few games which i have not even considered trashing out of frustration which is a rare thing for me
for the price to fun ratio i doubt if you could find a better game indeed im certain of that factwhen i bought this game i got cought up in it for a week
people are complaining that it didnt run good on there system
thats because they have a pii processor
pcgamer magazine said that if you have anything worse than piii  mb ram than it wont work good
that is true it  works grat on a piii but the game is not optimxed for pii
i have a piii   megs of ram and the best graphics board and i installed the mb  compact install and it worked finethe msfs pro edition is worth the  extra buck
the extra aircraft are beech king air  engine turboprop
concorde mach  sstsuper sonic transport
   engine jet  transport
moony bravo  prop speed craftin this game you can for the  fist time in  years of msfs fly from city to city in gps  modeprosgreat game excellent aircraft
consneed joystick bad sys
requirements bottom linebest non military flight sim if you have the  speedage of empires  the age of kings is all about building a small town and defending it against the computer or a friend if you play it online
you create the army thatll protect your village and you can send the army to go fight the enemy
all in all a fun and adictting gameit aint easy being king but it sure is a heck of a fun time in age of kings ii one of the best pc historical realtime strategy games out there
theres not much i can say to extoll the virtues of this extremely fun game that hasnt already been saidonly thing i can add is that i couldnt stand these games till i picked this one up
its hard to describe the sheer pleasure of building a massive army leading them straight to the walls of one of your allies cities suddenly declaring yourself enemy and have your guys raze the place to the groundthis game is packed with options including the requisite multiplayer feature itself loaded with options several oneplayer historical campaigns and a special campaign specifically made to teach you the game
my favourite part is the campaignscenario editor where you can build your own battle from scratchall in all one of the most perfect strategy games on the marketat least till aoe iii is releasedage of empires is one of the best games off all time
you can be one of  civilizations all with diffrent advanges and disadvanges
there are many diffrent units and with diffrent civs you can get diffrent units
the game  has many advantages over age of empires one the biggest being that your  population limit is now as an added bounus the playing online is  great
this game in increadable and a must havethis is an incredible game
the graphics are stunning
the game play is fast paced
the stories are sweet
the multiplay is awesome
graphically as you roam the land you see deer running around birds flying in the sky and other creatures roaming around in the stunning environment
during scenarios you dont hve time to mess around on alot of these as the enemy seems to find you rather quickly
some of the battles are very intense and killing your enemy is no easy task
the stories are wonderful as you have the opportunity to play some of the greatest leaders that ever existed
ghenghis khan and joan of arc are just  of the  stories you get to play
its like a history lesson while your playing as you learn their story and then fight their battles for them
the multiplay is awesome as far as i have seen as i have not had much time doing this
if you like real time games this is a keeperage of empires ii is a fun game as well as educational
its a lot like pharaoh and caesar iii
you take control of different armies and conquerers such as ghengis khan or barbarossa
though it may be difficult controlling huge armies at one time you get use to it
age of empires ii also has a different control interface that you need to get used to leftclick selects rightclick commands
taunts are added to this game they are mostly for fun
some taunts are quotraiding partyquot quotnice town ill take itquot and quotit is good to be the kingquot overall age of empires ii is a great game
i recommend it to strategy game lovers who are quick with their mousethis game clearly wipes out any other strategy game out there
age  was greatage  is better
why
better everything
better graphics sounds ai how smart the computer plays etc
also most popular game on the msn gaming zone
if your a strategy fan this is a game you dont want to  miss
every online game site and magazine rated this game at least  
and people complain about ram
i got  and it runs good with   players
one problem but it can be fixed computer surrenders
just  download an update from microsoft and done
well im off to play aoeage of the empire age of kings is the better of the three launched versions of age of the empires
with great graphics more options and greater control of your game age of the empires allows the player to control what kind of game they like
unlike the original version of age of the empires you can increase your total population to up to  which many times is what is needed in order to achieve world domination
one hint you must have a very fast proccessor in order to play the game smoothlythe campaigns on this set are incredible and allow you to progress from the simplest and basic rules of the game into a situation where you are incredibly outnumbered and you have to resort to every strategic bone in your body to winthe only downside is there is not as much control as i would like when it comes to making your own campaignsscenarios
the fun part of that the heroes from the campaigns can actually be put into your scenario
william wallace joan of arc and even king richard the lionheartedi would recommend this to anyone who likes strategy games
but mind you patience is a virtue and be careful to whom you make your allies and who says they want to be your allymicrosoft actually outdid themselves with this sequel to one of the greatest strategy cd rom games ever
this is bascially the same game as the original only its set in the dark ages
it is also a bit faster paced than the first one
ae ii also offers a multitude of extra features not included in its predecessor as well as a graphics package which leaves the old version in the dust
the buildings on ae ii are much more lifesize and intricate in detail
they are also more varied than the first amp include cathedrals and castlesamong the new features is your ability to garrison your townspeople in buildings amp towers to get them out of harms way
instead of being all men like the first one this one also includes female townspeople as well as joan of arc
also new is the ability to create several types of military units at the same time using the same barracks  stable  archery range etc
in the old version you could make several units of one kind but not several units of different kinds
a helpful  aspect to say the least
another nice characteristic of the game is that you can actually upgrade scouts to light calvery
that means that you can have military units on horseback that dont cost any gold which are actually semidecent in combat not so with ae ithis is a mustbuy game for anyone who even casually enjoyed ae i  the expanded features and updated graphics give you a whole new realm to explore command and conquer
time to move up to the age of kings
good luckage of empires ii has been named on many many pc top ten lists and for good reason too
simply put this is just an amazingly fun and interesting game
age of empires ii will take your breath away its a must own for any pc gamer or even someone whos never played a computer game
anyone will love thisthere are many levels of difficulty which is excellent
once you master one level or strategy you can change the settings and certain characteristics in the game such as what type of terrain you get which makes all the difference
you must manage any one of thirteen civilizations ranging from the turks to the vikings
each civilization has its own unique benefits and drawbacks and their own style of buildings and armies
you collect natural resources advance through ages by meeting requirments in your stockpiles create workers explore conquer build an army make allies engage in trade and battle and so much more
the graphics are some of the best ive seen in a strategy game and always keep you involved with the gameyou can also choose certain types of games
a campaign game involves a certain sort of goal like escorting joan of arc to the king
their is a death match game where you duke it out with other empires and so much more
there is a delightful training game which involves the famous william wallace teaching you the basics of the game i found this to be extremely helpfuli have always been intrigued by war strategy games but never really enjoyed the ridiculous amount of micro managing involved
i also used to think that the games were too long and that after pouring  hours of your  life into building a civilization you can get wiped out kinda suckedok  nothing compared to s of years but
this game is nothing like the  ones i dont like
aoe is fantastic
games are generally no more than   hours there is a little micromanagement but its worth it
the graphics  are wonderful and the sound and animation are amazing
if you are a die  hard strategy fan this may not do it for you but as a person with a life  i love this gameage of empires is along with other games an icon and a mandatory reference of the shining game industry of the s
this kind of games are missed a lot
marketing and graphics have taken over good stories and gameplayi hope we can live another generation like that oneunlike the civilization series age of empires is a realtime stragegy game forcing you to think fast
its for gamers who have brainsmicrosoft generally isnt the first company that you think of when you are looking for a strategy game
but after playing age of empires  you will definitely keep them in mindage of empires  is a realtime strategy game that puts you in control of a medieval civilization as it advances in technology military and economy
victory is acheived by crushing your enemies allying with victorious factions or by constructing a wonder of the world
the selection of cultures is impressive and includes the goths britons japanese chinese and persians in addition to several others
each culture has its own technologies and unique units such as viking longboats or persian elephants
the singleplayer scenarios allow you to become legendary heroes and conquerors such as william wallace and joan of arcthis is one of the best realtime strategy games available and its multiplayer scenarios will keep you coming back again and againage of empires ii has a particular strength its quotstandard gamequot a number of variables may be set by the user or left to random selection such as nationality and geography
this provides a nearly limitless combination of foes allies and landscapes on which to play
each of the approximately  nationalities has unique abilities  imagine starcraft with  alien races instead of  turtling is limited by the trebuchet  a huge catapult  and cannons
if you get the game you will want the expansion as it allows more automated farming and provides new races such as the aztec
ms is on the right track with this very impressive gamemost games are hot when they release and then quickly become old and dated
age of empires ii  the age of kings stands the test of time
this is a game that is fun even years after its releaseyou would think a game created in  would seem blocky and old after only a year or two
quite the contrary
the gameplay immersion in detail and strategic fun in age of empires ii makes it into a game that i envision will be playable and fun for years to comethe game takes you through a variety of situations
you need to be an efficient huntergatherer
you have to know how to manage naval warfare
its a great test of your ability to think outside the box as you investigate and manage a new set of challenges with every passi adore history so it was a treat to be in a scenario with william wallace and joan of arc
you see the real life locations they had to fight through and you save the day with your own activities
the locations span the globe keeping things interestingi realize that some people arent interested in multiplayer and certainly there is enough here in the game to keep a solo player happy
however those who do love multiplayer will be in for a treat
the game does an excellent job of keeping all sides engaged in the battle
i happen to love the multiplayer aspect hereyes the graphics arent super high def and up to current standards
that is quite all right by me
the gameplay itself is well done and really after a few minutes i dont even notice what the details of the various structures look like
i am too busy racing around the screen planning my defenses
as long as the on screen icons are easy to identify and work with thats all that matters to meare there any downsides
i imagine gamers who are most focused on first person shooters who want to aim rifles at heads and shoot probably wont be as keen on the strategy based long term planning involved here
that is quite fine
there are different types of games for different players
for strategy fans age of empires ii is quite a treatwe purchased age of empires ii with our own fundsbrilliant game if you start here
if you played aoe  i am sure you have already purchased age of kingslots of hours of thrilling fascinating and ever changing gameplay in here
i guess it is a musthave for all real  time strategy fans
after playing aoe and aok i will buy the follow up  without hesitation as soon as it landsthere are times in the gaming industry that a certain game will come along and reshape the way we think about how that genre is played
starcraft did this for rts
and aoe ii expanded on the trusted design of that and made a game that is historically accurate fun to play completely balanced and free of bugs which is alltoocommon in games todayyou can choose one of  civilizations to play in a skirmish
or you can play king of the hill
or you can play fortress
or you can playi think you get the point
there are tons of options for single player game play
and the historically accurate missions follow the lives trials and battles of william wallace joan of arc ghengas khan barbarosa and saladin
while these campaigns are somewhat static and quotrailquot they are engrossing and interestingall  civilzations are wonderfully balanced
unique units for each are an especially nice touch
and the ages that you advance through provide a new element of strategy for instance you will never even consider attacking with the turks in the early stages because of their advantange in the later stages likewise the britons and persians are ideal for a quick win because of their advantages in earlier ages
once you advance with them youll find that they dont have the quotstrengthquot needed to pull ahead though i have devised numerous strategies for the britions that will allow victory in the late agesoverall one of the best games ever
you are without excuse to not own this game
even nonrts fans will enjoy iti love this game
it wasnt as impressive as future installments but i will always have a soft spot in my heart for this game
i liked the graphics and gameplay
the scenarios and options were varied enough to keep the game interesting and some of the scenarios were customizable so you could kind of create your own rules if you wanted to
truly an awesome game and more than worthy of five starsits no wonder that this game was rated quotgame of the yearquot by usa today
and although the honor was bestowed upon it a while back it still holds true todayfor those of you who have played or own the first awardwinning age of empires i can assure you that the upgrade is well worth the money
and with rebates you can get the game for what about  now
i will share some of the updated features that make the game more enjoyable and why you should buy itthe gameplay is much better
as you probably know in the first age of empires you could only build one unit at a time per building and the quotrise of romequot expansion only allowed you to build multiple units of the same type
the age of kings allows you to que multiple units of different types up to a maximum of  at a timethe units are also able to move much easier
as it was easy in the first version to block and trap your own units with buildings the age of kings makes sure that your units can always find a way throughthere are also features that allow you to set the stance and actions of your units
for example you can set units to guard another unit to patrol and to follow an enemy unit at long range
you can also set to aggressive defensive stand ground and no attack stancethe units and especially the villagers work and move much faster which i have found as a huge plusthe graphics are much better more detailed and the motions of the units are betterthis game is like rollercoaster tycoon simcity and command and conquer all rolled into one
what a great combination
if i can give you one piece of advice i would say to buy this nowage of empires  is a masterpiece
regardless of any complaints anyone has made about this game there is no arguing
this one of the most fun addictive and satisfying games ever madeyou can play it for months
i played it for over a year then came back and played it for another year
its probably the most addictive game ive ever played
not mario not zelda not the great doom not quake or halflife or warcraft or even grand theft auto has ever had me as hooked as this game
microsoft and ensemble studios hit the nail on the head with aoe the sequel to age of empires keeps everything that made the first one great throws away almost everything that made it bad and throws an amazing revamped user interface that gives the player godlike power if used expertlythe different civilizations are fantastic
the advantages and disadvantages of each one make the game interesting and balanced although some civilizations are better overall than others
i mean really who doesnt love and equally hate the longbowmen
the war elephants
the woad raiders
the throwing axemanthe units are the best part of the game
except for the paladin and scorpion wipeout trick the unit balance is superb
the naval battles are amazing with fireships ballista ships and even ships that launch cannonballsthere are more buildings tons more upgrades and a brandnew unit i like to call the xfactor the trebuchet
this is one of the units that makes aoe  a true delight
as built up as a city can become it can be destroyed in minutes with enough trebuchetsthe multiplayer aspect of this game is what solidifies aoe s standing as one of the best games ever made
it is surreal
ive had hour multiplayer sessions many times
you just dont want to stop
its so fun
its madnessas far as challenge goes youll get all you want
just try beating the entire game on the hardest difficulty and see the headache you get
and if you get through with that buy the expansion pack and eat your heart outbuy this game
play it until youre sick of it
that probably wont happen but even if it does when you come back from your break youll be twice as hookedha
the memories i have of this game
man this is the bestwhen i first got this game i loved it
i played it over and over
soon i wanted to play online i figured with some allies i was good enough
but zonecom would somehow not work
i ran into hundreds of problems
it said aoe was not installed or that the program could not be launched or a number of other things
i got frustrated and went back to single player
however eventually i tired of playing the computer
but i couldnt get zonecom to work so i stopped playingltfast forward a year little lessgti finally picked it up again and tried zonecom
it took me hours but eventually i overcame each problem until a giant barrier stoof in my way
firewall
after  days i got the ports to openthis is a wonderful game in which you control a civilization to victory by conquering another civis city
it is different every time you play
i highly reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the command and conquer seriessimilar to the first gam in this series you are here to dominate the territory you are put onto
whether or not there is  through  playerscomputer or otherwise is up to the player
the computer graphics on this game is far suprior to the previous installment
well worth the price just for the graphics
a novel of a game for any age and gamer leveli think of this game as the ultimate toy soldier set that you dreamed of as a kid only the toys are alive and intelligent
ive literally spent hundreds of hours playing this game  including more all nighters than i care to admit
if you are a military buff this game can become addictive
you can build whole empires here either from scratch from the stone age or with fully developed high middle ages technology which includes gunpowder weapontry
you have to build up the infrastructure for your empire including farms fisheries mines and timber
then you have to build workshops and training schools
only then can you concentrate on the right mix of cavalry infantry archers and artillery
just the complexity of the castles and walled towns you can build is fascinating
yet it is never tedious you really get a feeling that you are actually building up an empire your empire for your subjects
and every single individual unit is fully and believably animated
a major advantage of age of kings over the earlier age of empires is that you can order your fighting units into set formations like squares and lines instead of just sending a mob into battle
the interface here is unbelievable the quotgiantquot map actually has the feel of a huge extent of territory enough for a kingdom or an empire
i prefer this as a single player game the program is smart and relentless enough to keep you constantly on your toes
just try playing against  to  odds with no allies if you dont believe methe mother of all good games has given birth to yet another beautifully done gameaoeii is what one could call the prime example of its genre
most rtss force you to  your oppenent with bigger guns but in aoeii that is not the case
military is simply a defense and in times of need an army for war
the various paths and civilizations make you all warm and comfythe first thing you are greeted with is a beautiful cinematic from yours truly microsoft games
then theres the multitude of campaigns all of which were done excellently
the engine is a truly refined version of ye old aoei
formations for your men and women is a great new thing that adds some strategy to your game and the new game options are just terrificmy true favorite is regicide in which each player has a king character and the last one standing wins
sometimes when others destroy my entire civilization i like to hide my king in the forests just for timeaoeii is definetely an enjoyable game instead of wasting  on starcraft spend it on this better gamethis is the best real time strategy game available and i will explain why if you are into playing with friends and people on the internet and  having a fun time you will love this
this in my mind is by far the most  fun to play game on the market and the single player is just as versatile  and enjoyable as the multiplayerthe various civiliaztions have  their own unique strengths and weaknesses which surpass even the  civilizations of the first game
the combinations of units for attack and  defense is virtually limitless
each unit has at least two counter units  which slaughter it horribly
example pikemen and camels and mamelukes  defeat all types of cavalry with ease
even the ai
in this game is a  challenge to beat on its hardest level and the easiet levels let beginner  players get a chance to get the feel of the game and learn the civilization  attributes before taking on other human playerspeaceim not exactly unbiased here i absolutely loved age of empires
the moment i got word that aoe was in the works i knew i would buy it
aoe had so many great aspects realworld history great graphics intelligent  interface and build systems and excelent and varied resource gathering
everything you want in an rts
their best achievement though was the  random map feature endless replayabilityof course aoe had its  faults bad ai pathfinding not enough distinction between the different  cultures every culture had the same vocal cues big nono some  othersaoe the age of kings is a wonderful sequel for many reasons  the most significant being gameplay
military units now have the  desperately needed behavior and formation commands making combat  infinitely more interesting and fun
garissoning units allows for better  protection of your peasants and better defense of your hometown as well  as allowing for ambushes
farming is now more realistic with farms that  roll over any terrain and that are renewable at a click
plus all the  great multiplayer customization is back with many splendid additions
perhaps best of all the military units are exquisitely balanced against  each other with each society having a unique unit that allows for varied  and exciting combatwhile gameplay should be the number one concern of  any developer the graphics while beautiful are the same as they ever  were
however keep in mind that beautiful graphics cannot mask an  uninteresting or unoriginal game total annihilation kingdoms unreal  quake  arena
great gameplay will always shine through mediocre or  outdated graphics starcraft caesar  prince of persiaaoe is one to  geti recently borrowed this game from my freind thinking it was going to be a boring warcraftstarcraft wannabe what i got was even better than i expected
there are  races to choose from each with different characters and buildings so they is unlimited gameplay
sometimes the battles can be difficult and frustrating but you always find yourself coming back for morethe greatest strategy game of all time
period
with no doubtage of empires is better than other simulation games
age of empires  age of the kings has many features
you can play a random game which allows you to chose how many players who is your enemy what color represents your empire and what kind of land you want
in a regicide you do the same except have to do away with the king of the enemy empire to win
aoe age of the kings has the best campaigns like the william wallace campaign
in the history page you can find out the history from the britons to the vikings
age of empires represents a strong game
only if a rd version would be made
if you have the game or thinking about buying it here are some cheat codes that may help youbefore typing in the code click enter on your keyboard and then type it incheese steak jimmys  foodrobin hood  goldrock on  stonelumberjack  woodaegis build buildings fasthow do you turn this on must be spaced not capitalized cobra car that shootsto smitthereens a sabotuer that explodeshope you like the game
i like it so much i play it practically every dayfirst of all i loved aoe i and was looking very mush forward to the second comming
and what a game
everything that youve been scream about i all these years that where missing in rts games is in this one
there  even a button you can click to cyckle through idle villagers and soldiers
emsemble studios have created in my oppision one of best rts games to  dateand the builtin campaigns are clever though and lots of fun to  playalmost everything in this game is a masterstroke although it takes  cute a machine to play it
but if you have a pentium  or above with a  lot of ram and a videocard  md over more theres absolutly no problem  in playing this even in  x buy it and be preparad to lose some  time of you life because this game is addictivei had been a diehard fan of aoe for about a year and a half before aoe hit the shelves
i didnt pick it up until about march but i loved this one twice as much as the first and heres why  unlike the first aoe  offers you the ability to garrison units which is great for an ambush
  aoe also offers players the ability to place units in formations such as  the box staggered etc
 new scenarios which actually help players  learn to craft and finetune their skills
 the ability to save a  multiplayer game
how many times have you been in an awesome two hour game  when something comes up no more
 great new customizable scenario  building tools that make it more fun then ever
 castles unique units  and all the other new buildings and techs
trading from the market a  simple way to trade for that  gold for the easy castle from the feudal  age
 recorded games a great way to finetune your skills by learning  from a master
more random maps for total playability
 rightclick  farming ah that is what gets me on this game
before you had to click a  villager click the build etc
no more
just rightclick the farm saves  you plenty of muchneeded playing time
age of empires  outdoes its  predecessor by far and becomes highly addictive and playable day after day  after daythe first age of empires was a critical and consumer success gaining rave reviews and selling over  million copies
the first was a success because of the blend of strategy action and historical charcters
the sequel the age of kings expands on this winning formula and in doing so creates the  best real time strategy game avaliable on the market
the game focuses on   major empires such as the persians vikings and japanese
as head of  one of these  kingdoms you must defeat your enemies to gain rulership  over all the land
this is very fun being that each race is varried and  has different strengths and weaknesses
it is also fun because each one  has a different look to them the japanese buildings look much different  than the vikings
the real fun of the game starts when you play the preset  historical scenerios
you take control of such historical figures as joan  of arc genghis khan and william wallace ie braveheart
these are all  historically accurate and can help you learn a great deal about the time  period
there also is an excellant multiplayer game featuring the usual  deathmatch games as well as a regicide game which gives each team a king  and the first one to destory each others king
all of these features add up  to the best rts game on the market for the money
the guide for the game  is also a great value it retails at  dollars and gives you all you would  need to know about the game without spoiling it
all and all this  is the best game you can buy and you will enjoy it for a long long timein age of empires the age of kings you can control one of  different civilizations including the english mongols chinese japanese byzantines and many more
age of empires  is not your typical rts
unlike warcraft and starcraft aoe requires more thinking on your part rather than creating an army of soldiers and storming the enemy base
that doesnt cut it in aoe
you actually have to think in order to outsmart the computer oh my gosh some of you mindless people actually have to use your so called brains
in regards to aoe and the major change i had to go through from playing warcraft and starcraft was the fact that i had to learn how to multitask my characters
in warcraft and starcraft the only resources you can gather are either two or three resources
in aoe you must gather food wood gold and stone in order to keep your civilization alive
also the many different upgrades and research items in aoe was a big change from warcraft and starcraft
in an overall rating aoe outperforms warcraft and starcraft by a considerable amount and is x more fun and challenging
and your also learning a bit about history as you play it doesnt get any better than thatbottom line age of empires the age of kings is loads of fun
get it
you wont be dissappointedfor my money this is the finest strategy game on the market
the balance of the various kingdoms is far better than in the original with all empires having serious strengths and equally devastating weaknesses
one  must learn the value of combining force types into effective mixtures of  defense and offensive units to even have a chance at success
the serious  player will probably take something on the order of a year to master the  game because the complexity level is so highthe campaigns on this  sequel are of a much hgiher caliber than those on the orignal so  singleplayer use is very much improved
in fact the campaigns are  actually historically accurate unlike those in aoe
indeed the  historical section on the cd is fascinating reading in and of itself and  will please those who love the time period as well as the tactical  problems involvedaoks real strength though is like that of its  predecessor  the games extreme playability over network
i heard that  aoe was the most popular network game ever and theres no reason aok wont  follow in its footsteps
this is great stuff to play in real time with  others
be warned though  players in microsofts gaming room are  ruthless to the novice
dont even think about going online until youve  gained a level of proficiency playing by your own
and take the time to  learn the keyboard shortcuts  youll need the time it savesfor most  games i think that strategy guides are a wimps way out but with aok i  highly recommend the ensemble studios guide
its invaluable to improving  the quality of your gameplaying experiencethis is a fun thought provoking game that will have you playing for hours
this game can be played by almost anyone
you can either put a lot of effort into planning your next move against the enemy or just barge your way on through
the only downside is that over time this game becomes a little boring with having the same buildings and people
but there is a solution
the expansion pack is also an excellent game and it just adds to your now experienced game stragedies
both games are highly recommendedaoe is simply amazingive never played aoe so i cant make any comparisons but lookaoe beats out much of the great rts games including my favorite game starcraft by including  civilizations with  infantry cavalry archery naval units siege weapons and all kinds of  defense measures including allmighty castles and bombard towers
the  diversity of units might be less than some widely popular games but you  can understand and feel every single part of this game
upgrades from  cavaliers to paladins and archers to crossbowmen make sensethey arent  just words from nowhere
and if youre looking for a great campaign game  this is itthere are carefully made videos and sounds just as starcraft  for the campaigns and i especially enjoy the diversity of these one player  missions
the st mongolian mission was very interesting requiring you to  befriend the different  tribes by bringing them sheep killing the wolf  pack founding the sacred relic etc
i also liked how this game handled  commerce
there are a variety of types of resources gold stone food  and wood to be precise and you can build trading carts to earn gold by  trading with other players pay tribute etc
etc
this game is simply a  mustbuyits worth every pennyage of empires  age of kings is interactive game corresponding to the medevil times when the powerful roman empirer fell and the world is up for grabs
microsoft did all out job putting this game together
it has wonderful graphics and it doesnt take much space in your computer
i shouldnt be talking i have an windows xp but it can prform on even the oldest computers
it has william wallace joan of arc genghis khan saladin and barbarossa all historic war leaders of that time and you can control some of the most powerful civilizations like the franks the japanese byzantines vikings mongols celts and more
you can choses your own destiny
you can be a little napoleon
will you be a hungry war monster
remember this the best simulation of the medievil timesage of empires ii is a great game and now that it is an older game the price has really dropped
i saw new copies for 
what a deal
many many hours of play
you wont get boring of this game for a long long time
wyatt kaldenbergto keep things brief if you liked the first youll like this one
it keeps the tried and true formula from age of empires and transitions it over into a great sequel
this game is very easy to pick up and play if you take a few minutes to learn the trades of the gamebefore i tried this game i never liked strategy games
now strategy is my favorite genre and age of kings is my favorite game
this game has been on my computer longer than any other game ever
age of kings puts you in the throne of a king there are just so many different things you can do exploring all its features will take you months
this game is easy to learn and anyone can master it
five stars no doubtbefore i bought ac i was interested in ultima  which was a complete flop
then my brother had me play ac and one of the biggest things you notice are the graphics
just clicking on the life stone which saves where you will be teleport to is beautiful
all the magic is fun and most of the people are great
i recommend a video card that can support the modest graphic requirement
i think the ten dollar fee is accurate since the great people at turbin always update the game each month with new world events and climate to new armour weapons quests and new lands
all of which you would have to pay for a new game completely anyways
but with ac you never have to buy a new game because ac is always a new game each month  i recommend this game if you want to be addicted i have been playing for   years and i dont plan on buying anything else until ac thanks turbin for a game you spent making for around   years i believeafter countless hours of frustration and disappointment with ultima online and everquest although uo still retains a great deal of potential asherons call was a great reliefone of the best features is that the  monsters arent quottypicalquot sword n sorcery fare
in other words  dont come looking for orcs goblins giants etc
while the bestiary of ac  obviously derives from these fantasy fiction archetypes it develops them  differently adding to the strong sense that one is truly in an  quotunknown worldquotac is a bit quiet as far as ambient sound  goes
honestly i like that
i usually listen to music while playing and  this arrangement suits me just fine and for any veterans of everquest  its certainly nice to not dream about that incessant and irritating gnoll  barkingthe graphics are a bit basic but again i find that a likeable  feature
and if nothing else it shows that the game developers and  programmers are more concerned about the functionality of the game than the  appearance
however the environment and most especially the night sky  are detailed and quite stunning in their own rightthis mmorpg is also  excellent for the casual player such as myself
other games requiring  endless hours of sitting practicing skills fighting etc in order to make  the smallest headway
acs rewards are more commensurate with ones  efforts and those rewards are satisfyingac is admittedly not for the  power gaming types although they are there
since im not a power gamer i  feel more comfortable with the people online there and have a much better  online roleplaying experienceive played the top  online multiplayer games top  in popularity based on online subscriptions ultima online everquest and asherons call
let me tell you that i have enjoyed this title ac more than the other two combinedfor one thing i never quite agreed with ultima onlines system of player killing
for those of you not familiar with this term that means that any quotjoe bobquot on the internet can kill your character as soon as heshe leaves a town
it doesnt make the game any fun especially when you consider how many kids out there play this game and have nothing better to do than player kill all day longalthough i didnt play everquest as much as the other two titles i found the entire system to be lacking
the controls and console didnt seem to flow as much as asherons call and ultima online
furthermore while the game has better graphics than the other two titles it didnt feel quotdquot  it had a still feel to it and didnt provide much d stimulationof the three i have spent more time on asherons call and found its monthly subscription worth it
every two months new scenarios items and quests are added to the game
they have done fun scenarios such as adding a creature with quotgodquot statistics and having an ac programmer control it and wreak havoc in the world
creative stuff such as snow during the winter real time and quotkiller snowmenquot
the d view that one witnesses while playing the game is impressive
you can stand on a cliff in the middle of nowhere and view the horizonasherons call does a great job in meeting the demands of the game
for instance if a gliche is found that allows players to take advantage of certain rules it is fixed in the next patch
if the world is becoming too simple for players more powerful creatures are added
there are so many good things i have to say about ac asherons call i would waste your time typing them
this is the best online multiplayer game out there make no mistake about ithamha
i think this item will allow you to save in any title of your choice
heres why  it holds  save files at one time
for any title that you save with this card it takes up only  file but you can have more files of the same title like the legend of zelda for example which can only hold  save files on  cartridge  the button located on the top of the memory card opens up a special menu that allows you to saveload your files but only if you have the appropriate title inserted into the slot
however if you load a save file with the wrong title inserted into the slot an error message will read quotcannot load this filequot  for example if you insert the hamtaro  hamhams unite cartridge into the slot and loaded a pokemon file the message will read quotcannot load file pokemonsomethingquot  if youre close to the end but are unable to save this card will solve your problem
just pause it open up the menu save it turn off the power and do something for a while
once youve done all this if you insert the cartridge that wont let you save into the card slot open up the menu highlight quotloadquot select the correct file and exit the menu voila
youll be able to continue at the point where you left offi hope this is helpful for you
just be sure to read the manual carefully and test it for a while on almost every title that you own until you know how to do it right
once you do you can have plenty of fun using it on titles that require the following  passwords battery backup or none of the above
tell your friends and share it with thembe aware that this card requires batteries to operate so use it wisely
goodgoi love it i use it on all my pokemon games you need to get this if you play old gbc and gb games it rules please get this for the sake of all nerdsi baught this because in the dicription sais it works for game boy color but in the instructions clearly states after i mistakenly baught this game for game boy color game boy only it even mentions games like tetris and pokemon red and blue i even tried saving my game boy color games and accidentally ended up deleting my game saves this thing is garbage only worth buying if you only have game boy games and thats laughable most game boy games dont even use game savesff is by far my favorite game ever made
no gaming experience has ever come close to matching the joy i felt while playing this game
i would surely trade in all the halos gears of war etc for this game
from the phenominal storyline to the lovable cast of characters this game is perfect
the only thing wrong is that since this game is now on cd it has load times now unlike its cartridge originalit is such a pity that ff  is getting so much more attention which i feel is undeserved
ff is clearly much more superiour in pretty much every way other than graphics only cause  came out on the ps instead of the snes
they made a movie off of  made spin off games off of  and are now talking about a ff kinda like they did with x
i dont think im the only one who would much rather have a continuation of  instead is also a great game kind of a bland storyline and characters but the job system is cool so it makes the gameplay worth the playall in all this package is worth any cost just for number as a veteran of the bit snes days i can recall countless hours spent playing final fantasy iii and thinking that it was the best game ever to grace the snes platform
well six years later my opinion has not changed
final fantasy vi has been rereleased keeping intact the entire game as it was back then with final fantasy v as a special bonuspeople introduced to the ff series at part vii might not be able to get past the graphics which were fine for them time but lousy by todays standards
but for the less cynical player this is the holy grail of rpgs
this is proof that less is more and the music in these games rivals anything that came later in the series
having said that the later installments in the series are great but it is important not to forget where it all startedfinal fantasy v is a great game its big disadvantage being that it is packaged alongside part vi so gamers will inevitably compare it to ffvi
it is a typical ff game meaning that you are assured a great game at the least
the quotjob skillsquot add a nice twist and the story albeit linear can hold its own with the best of the rpgsfinal fantasy vi as you have read in countless reviews is probably the most engaging and emotionally involved game in the series
the characters all have likeable personalities and their individual stories are very enrossing
as the game progresses the player becomes more involved in their lives
the story is the games strongest point while the music is a milestone for any video game
anybody who dismisses it as quotjust a gamequot should takea closer look
completing this game will become your lifethe really good squaresoft games have an anoying habit of falling out of print quickly making this game in particular hard to find let alone at a reasonable price
anyone who still shops around for snes games knows this as well do the people who have tried to find the ff anthology at their game shop only to be met with quotsorry its no longer availablequot
this is really sad because there are many people who will not get to experience these games and will go on thinking that the ff series never got better than  part vii or ix
all i can say is that is you are lucky enough to find a copy grab it or else order it online
it is a gem that you will be proud to ownthose who think vi sucked obviously have no taste and should be banned from rpgs
vi is by far the best rpg ever
while it doesnt have the graphics of the latest installments to the series remember it was originally released for snes and the graphics were top of the line back thenit still overcomes all others though the incredible storyline and something most playstation games lack replay value
another thing i love is the style of magic use
although it does not remaing true to the originals where only mages can use magic it allows your characters to permenantly learn spells unlike vii with that highly annoying materia  
the spells and esperssummons are incredible
enter ultima
numerous secrets keep you coming back for more
i could write a book on how awesome this game is but i will let you find out for yourself
as for v a good game not quite up to the caliber of the others
i love it simply because it holds the final fantasy name but i do feel that it is definately worth playing
it is a different storyline in the ff world with fairly interesting characters
all in all ff anthology is a must buyyou know everyone seems to be getting into the rehashing and rereleasing of old games on new systems
asteriods centipede even frogger have been updated
well here are two games that havent
they are the same as when they were released on the super nintendo or super famicom
although they have been added to
beautiful cg animations have been added to the beginning of both games
the only beef i have is that the characters in the cg look really really pale
i mean ghostly pale
the music cd that they added was also very poorly planned
they slapped on music from ff and the beginning of the second disk of ffs soundtrack
why didnt they take the themes of the characters
those were the good songs from ff not quotthe magic housequot or quotdark worldquot  now to do the games themselves
ff a solid game
those players that played ff tactics will find that there is a job system in this game as well jobs originated in ff for those who care
after you find one of the four crystals you have the ability to have more jobs come availible to you
there are  different jobs to have from ninja to hunter to the trusty red mage
some of the jobs are really good others are really bad
they arent very well balanced unfortunetly
as you fight battles you can points kinda like job points in tactics
after you get enough you can a level in that job and get another ability related to that job
the music hasnt been updated at all
it is the original super nintendo midi sounds
i hate midi sounds
especially when it sounds midi
the graphics are old school they will remind you of the block backgrounds in the old rpgs
gameplay is very good
the bosses are very challenging although there are some that are pushovers
there are three worlds to explore as well
its a fun game and will bring back a lot of nostalgia to those you remember super nintendo
ff  the best of the final fantasies
anyone who says any differently is a fool im sorry if this offends anyone
the music is absolutely beautiful
it may of come from a bit system but it still is the best ive heard
in final fantasy  you must face the evil empire who is bent on using magic to take over the world
its your typical rpg from the super nintendo era
there are  characters plus two bonus characters that have their own unique abilities
its kinda like the job system only without a lot of freedom in who learns what
examples the thief locke can steal the magic soldier celes can absorb magic and add the mp cost to her own mp
there are many branches and many plot twists
there also battles where you actually act out a military campaign
these are really hard though
magic is learned through beings called espers the beginning of materia and gfs and this could be cool but too many espers have the same spells and too many only give you one and they are the only one that give you it
example crusader with merton
gameplay is standard final fantasy
no surprises there
all in all
final fantasy anthology is a must have game for all squaresoft fans
if you want to get on the rpg scene i also recommend this game
it isnt as hungup on graphics and all these special fetures like the newer games are
it is story and gameplay
the two most important things in an rpg
these are the games that will get you started on rpgsmaybe the best rpg of all time final fantasy vi or iii usa and its japanese predecessor final fantasy v previously unreleased combine to make a great set of games
hours of pure entertainmentnow this is gonna sound complicated all final fantasy games were released in japan firstand still are then they come here
well back when we had nessnes  they released final fantasy  final fantasy iv and final fantasy vi and renamed them to   and  respectively
so once final fantasy viiprobably the best rpg ever created and i dont throw that around lightly came out in  people went whoa 
what about  to 
enter anthology chronicles and origins and the recently announced final fantasy iii remake for the ds
this review deals with final fantasy anthology containing v and vifinal fantasy vstory bartz reina garaf and faris have to take down xdeathdumbest ff villain name ever from controlling  crystals
maybe its my status as a post viplayer but it mustve been irritating saving those damn crystals over and overgraphics theyre pretty standard really i mean this is the super nintendo so theyre not great even for snes standards
the fmvs of course are coolmusic pretty good but not spectacular like iv or vigameplay it excels for one reason the job system
for the first time you can customize your characters rather than just being one particular class
master one job move to another
the story is eh musics ok but play it cause its a fffinal fantasy vistory theyre existed once powerful beings called espers many centuries ago
now theyre gone and the world is in an industrial revolutionlike setting with airships and weaponry
a soldier of the empire terra was used for battle and after being free of mind control joins a group of resistance members planning to take down the empiregraphics for the most part the graphics are great for the snes era
theyre still not as sharpdetailed as chrono trigger or even colorful like yoshis island but they work in the endsoundmusic the music here is usually cited as the best uematsu soundtrack hes done
while personally i go with vii vi is by no means a flawed soundtrack
theres tons of great themes catchy ones emotional ones and epic ones like terras theme forever rachel aria de mezzo caraterre and dancing mada huge cast list with  playable characters still the largest cast in a final fantasy game
while its nice to have variety some dont get as much story as they shouldve
ones like celes terra locke and setzer have substanstial backstory while others might just join your party and thats it
the game brings in the esper system
its not a wild departure like junctioning but essentially you can equip an esper to use in battle and after each battle you get points to learn a spell
learn it and on to the next one
finish them all and you can pick someone elsewhile v is merely playable for the job system and the fact its a ff game vi is required playing for an rpg fanfinal fantasy anthology features final fantasy ff v and vi
these games were originally for the super nintendo however they were adapted for playstation final fantasy v is a game with  characters and uses what many rpg players may know as the job class system
in other words the character can be a knight monk or ninja specializing in skills unique to each class
the magic is bought in stores which i dont necessarily like but the game itself is solidfinal fantasy vi is a game where the job classes are somewhat built in and the game features at least  playable characters
the jobs are built in because each character has unique job commands
locke has a steal command terra can do magic early in the game where it is not readily available
the plot is really good in this ff game and it is easily in my personal top  of video games ive ever playedthis is a great collection and i encourage any vintage rpg lover to try it outthese release was the first time the us had a localized version of final fantasy v final fantasy vi was and still is a masterpieceyou cant go wrong here
final fantasy  released as  on the snes in the us is hands down the best in the series
play through the story of terra now with fmv cutscenes
this is worth playing even if you played the original just for the fmv sequences
then you get final fantasy v long hailed as the best game the us market missed out on
this is truly a great rereleaseat first i was completely dismayed to hear that final fantasy iv wasnt going to be on here but i guess final fantasy v was a fair tradeoff
quotnewquot gamers that rely on cinemas and the everpopular  might not completely understand the beauty of these two games but people who appreciate art will be in awe
if youve played the disappointing  known as final fantasy viii and want that old nostalgaic feel this is the package to pick up
  theres not much i can say about final fantasy vi
after beating the super nintendo version twice this was just number  and i still had fun as they fixed some bugs no more lete river multihour leveling or unlimited items bug where the game crashed and when you opened it back up you had  of all the rare items like economizers and gem boxes was completely random as far as i know since it just quothappenedquot to me while i was playing
final fantasy vi just has a hands down amazing story totally evil bad guy and tons of characters that are all developed and have one part of the story focused on them instead of  lines its rare to see character development like this nowadays
final fantasy v was definitely something new to me
i had just recently beaten final fantasy tactics so i was used to the job system kind of
i liked it because it would take a long time to get everyone mastered in every class
what i liked about ff was that quotoldquot feeling renewed
although the characters werent very developed the story started off simple and became excellent
this was one of the few games where i actually spent hours trying to beat some bosses
the last boss for examplei had to level probably  more hours to even match his power once i got to him
this is what i like to see in an rpg
the optional bossesim not even touching them with a foot pole
the only thing i didnt like about this package was that the music cd didnt have a list of good tracks but it was free so hey
also there werent a lot of cinemas
in fact there are only  in ff intro and ending and  in ff intro and ending and quotalternatequot trailer
considering the games are very small not more than  megs at the most i expected to see a lot more cinemas but thats ok  also there were some translation errors in fflike lines that didnt make sense and stuff like that
i dont remember anything offhand but i know they were there
also sometimes on ff your objective at the time isnt too clear
anyways this is worth buying get it nowthese  games are great if you like older rpg
i have the ps one games and my grandson has the nindendo ds versions
the games have good stories and characters
the enemies are tough at times
it is your classic menu battle system and requires time to level up characters
very enjoyable
would highly recommend you try these is you like the older games
all the final fantasy series games are great in my opinion until you get to the ps  when i feel they start to lose some of the enjoyment and qualityff reviewff never made it to the us when it was released in japan
but now we can finally experience it on the ps
its a great entry that is pretty underratedgameplay the highlight of ff is its job system
you can be a knight monk thief dragoon ninja samurai berserker hunter sorceror white mage black mage time mage summoner blue mage red mage trainer chemist geomancer bard dancer mime or you can just be bare each with a unique ability and weaponarmor choices
you can switch jobs anytime and you can share abilities when you learn them
for instance you can be a black mage with white mage powers and vice versa
its kind of hard to explain but youll understand it
whew that was a  mouthfulthis is also the first ff to feature atb the bar that tells you when its a characters turn to attackthe game has tons of unique sidequests and methods of transportation
this is the first ff to feature a submarine and soon you will get an airship that can be used as a boat and a sub
coolgraphics very good for the time
not as good as ffs but still decentmusic not as strong as others but this game still has some memorable tunes like gilgemeshs themestory not the best ff story but it has a great plot filled with twistsadded extrass just fmvs at the beggining and end of the game
not very good because they get the characters hair color wrong
bartzs and galufs is white instead of brown and reina and fariss is blonde instead of purple
overall dont listen to the haters
this is a very unique gameffvi reviewff was released in america as ff for the snes
this and ff are arguably the best entriesgameplay this game is the first ff to have a long range of characters and hidden characters and it is the first ff to allow you to switch them
each character has a unique ability and you learn magic through summoned espersabout halfway through the game the gameplay becomes sidequestfilled and nonlinear
once you get the airship back you can go to the main villians lair but if you do and dont bother with the secrets and sidequests he will defeat you quite easilyalso who can forget the infamous opera scenegraphics very excellentmusic another high point
from the boss music to kefkas theme it all rocksstory a very great story with lots of twists
kind of reminds me of star wars in some placesadded extras just another fmv scene and they didnt get terras hair color right
its green not blonde
overall an rpg masterpiece no questions askedoverall for package you can probably find it for 
and its a steal for  epic rpgsgreat game now i have final fantasy i ii vx
i just need iii and iv
but this game itself with v and vi on separate discs is quite the adventure i havent gotten too deep into it but it seems any avid ff fan will love to add this to their collectionthis review is all on final fantasy  or final fantasy  when originally release in the us on snes
the game is quite arguably the most entertaining rpg ever made
the characters stories and game play revolutionized the the rpg market a set a bar for all rpgs that followed
the only thing that sets it back are the dated graphics but the entertainment value still exists
the added cut scenes are a major plus
the only gripe i have are the long load times duringbetween fights and navigation of the character menus
that  or  second additional load time is very noticeable and can be an annoyance especially to those who have played the original snes version
the  price tag makes it a deal
a must have game for all rpg fansbefore i begin i am big fan of the franchisegame play and graphicsthe game play is old fashioned graphics are snes stylerpg style gameone of the most difficult final fantasy games i have ever playedno i havent played final fantasy anthology but i have played final fantasy  on the snes and beaten it
the snes version and ps version are essentially the same
this review only deals with final fantasy  i have played some of final fantasy  on an emulator but not enough to do a review
i have played to some degree final fantasies    of all these final fantasy games i would have to say that final fantasy  is the best turnbased rpg ever
some people say that the music is not all that great
i disagree
yes it is sometimes repetitive but it sets the mood unlike lots of games out there
especially the first two tunes when you start the final battle which is really divided into  or  parts
every time i hear those tunes i know that im at the ending boss
the character development is outstanding
most novels would be hardpressed to come up with such an interesting group
locke setzer cyan terra shadow celes edgar sabin umaro relm strago gogo and mog
if youve played the game you just need to look at these names and you instantly know who they are
the storyline is amazing
magic has been outlawed but there are some who would like to bring it back and replace technology with it
there are some parallels to star wars and the wheel of time in here
eventually you join a rebellion against the evil kefka
but two of the best parts in the game are when you get to the opera house for the first time
when the entire face of the earth is changed and you must start from scratch
i love that part
it is so nonlinear
you have to find all your buddies all over again but you can do it in almost any order you want
sure the graphics are outdated on this but graphics dont make a game the storyline does
and there is no denying that the storyline in this game is topnotch
final fantasy  and  come very close but no cigar
nobuo uematsu really put his whole heart into this game turning out some of the best video game music ever written
if i had the money i would buy multiple copies of this game since i knew that id be returning to it again and again great game the graphics are good the music too and the gameplay is awesome i recommend to everybody buy this game i rate this product five stars because it works properly and its just what i wanted
i like this product because im a huge fan of final fantasy video game series and i would recommend this to any rpg gamer stars for ffvi  the port came over nicely
graphics were preserved and some additional fmvs were added always a nice touch
they messed with the sound a bit though
i noticed a slight change in item drops from random encounters as well some items arent as easy to get
other than that its not bad
highly recommended if you cant get your hands on the originalffv was a waste of my time however
i couldnt get into the story or any of the characters
it comes with vi so give it a shot anyway
you might like itfinal fantasy anthology is a collection of two of the greatest rpgs to have ever graced not only the super nintendo but any other console system as well
both ffiv and v are stellar instalments of the epic franchise that video game fans have grown to not just love but obsess about
if youre not familiar with the series they are not your typical us adampd dugeon crawls they are epic stories that usual cross entire worlds and many times involve the destruction of whole continents
your cast of heroes is usually a motley colletion of sword swingers amnesiac wizards martial artists crossdressing pirates mystical moogles you have to see them to understand etc etc etc
they definately are quirky and have a style all their own
final fantasy paved the way for the modern style of japanese rpgs and this set is an excellent way to relive the golden age of square in the  bit era
i would like to note that the japanese version of this anthology included ffiii ffii over here but instead we get a disc of music from the two games included
if the two games were so amazingly stellar it would hurt the review but i just cant bring myself to give this collection anything less than  stars
dont let the archaic graphics drive you away from this wonderful wonderful video game experienceits amazing
fun battles job classes abilities a bunch of bosses  worlds awesome game
keep your same characters the whole game and change em up
just have to play itfirst off this is reveiw of ff in ffa
ff is my personal favorite of the cartrigeera ff titles
i bought ffa on a whim and am glad i did so
the first time i went through it my memory card said  hours
while the discaccasse times are at times unbearable i worked around by using a ps and seleted the fast load option
once you finish the game you will unlock ff artwork and the sound test
the feture i appecated the most was how you could memofilesoftsave your game in progressfinal fantasy anthology features the playstation debut of final fantasy v and final fantasy vi
ffvi first appeared on the snes but was known as final fantasy iii at the time it was the third final fantasy to make it to america but the sixth overall in japan
final fantasy v was only released in japan and anthology makes the american debut of the game
ive been a long time fan of the final fantasy series so i was extremely happy that i was now able to play these games on the playstation
it was nice to have all of my final fantasy on the same system
there have been complaints about the loading time between battles and menu screens and while the loading times are not great or even good they did not distract me at all while playing the games
these were just minor complaints for mefinal fantasy vas i stated above this is the first time that final fantasy v was playable in the united states
graphically the game is similar to final fantasy iv the one with cecil and golbez but there is a significant difference
the difference is that there is a job based leveling system now
this predates final fantasy tactics but it is similar less refined perhaps
as you progress through the game your abilities in battle depend on what job class you have chosen to be and mastering multiple job classes is key to beating the game
the story is somewhat of a let down after final fantasy iv
i feel this is one of the weaker games in the series but it is still funfinal fantasy vithis is my favorite final fantasy game of all time
while i have loved most of the games and enjoyed the rest this one stands first in my heart for the final fantasy series
this game has good graphics for the snes era and a long involved story dealing with magical creatures called espers and the greed of some humans to steal that magical power
the story does not center directly on any one character but a case could be made for terra celes locke and perhaps edgar as the fourth lead
the absence of a true lead character adds to the development of the story since it doesnt follow one character but follows a plotline where character move in and out of the story arc
i found this game to be incredibly fun to play and was by far my favorite of the seriesthese games were the first remakes square released and the most memorable remakes for many fans of the series too
this remake brought final fantasy v to our shores after all and many fans loved the fact that final fantasy vis remake was faithful to the original and it got rid of most of the censorship too
younger gamers like me though only got to experience what it was like to play final fantasy vi for the first time though
both games are faithful to the originals too which many fans of the series will like too
id definitely recommend itit usually takes a year or two for square to release another final fantasy game but anthology is not just one great ff game its two great ff games
sure theyre old and many will be scared off by the bit graphics but those who stick around will enjoy some quality gaming
this package will last you a while too as each game will take  hours to complete
this is well worth your timeif you own a ps or a ps you would be foolish to at least not try ff vi
ff v you can take or leavethis is a great buy for fans of the final fantasy series
it contains two games in one release
although the graphics for these games have been improved upon a little bit do not expect modern graphics by any meansfinal fantasy v  this was the first time final fantasy v was released in the us
for the time it was released  final fantasy has amazing graphics
the story is fun and involving
the game was also very innovative when it came to the class change system and overall game mechanics
i would recommend this game to anyone that is into into scifi fantasy and rpgsfinal fantasy vi this was first released in the us as final fantasy iii for the snes
this was probably one of the most advances rpgs for its time
the graphics were absolutely amazing compared to anything that was released on the snes at the time
final fantasy vi has an extremely involving and well thought out story with many plot twists and a lot of likeable and well defined characters
i would highly recommend this game to anyone that is into scifi fantasy and rpgsfinal fantasy vi was a milestone in the rpg world
at the time of its release the graphics were supurb and used all the resources the super nintendo had to offer
chracter developement was outstanding and the story was excellent
final fantasy vi definately lives up to its name as the best final fantasy game
there are people who dislike this game mainly because of its graphics
many gamers were introduced to the final fantasy series through final fantasy vii
i cant blame them if they cant follow dialogue or customize weapons items and armor and have the attention span to remember what they are doing and where they are goinggamers out there that look for games to have dazzling graphics and quick button pressing and fast paced gameply will dislike this game
this game is all for the storyline and customization of its charactersfinal fantasy v which was first released in north america in the anthology set is definately worth your time
compared to vi i found that v is lacking
but you can see the evolution of the square company through its transitioning games and final fantasy v truly marks their effort before the powerful final fantasy vi and vii
i rate this game five stars because no less can be given to final fantasy vi
seperately i would have to give final fantasy v four stars mainly because although i enjoyed it i also found it lacking in comparison to vi but comparing games is not how you rate them so i rated this one on the fun i had
if you are going to play ff you need to clear your mind of well ff did this better or ff had better graphics  we must remember that final fantasy v came before and we should play it for what it is and admire it as part of this awsome series that keeps changing and evolvingcadefinal fantasy vi or  on the super nintendo was the second console rpg i played
the first was lagoon on the snes which was good
i still believe that ff is one of the best of the final fantasy series
it has excellent character development a good story and for the first time a villain with a background and personality
up until this point most rpg villains were mwa ha ha im evil
villains who were evil to have someone evil in the story
in ff emperor ghestalt and kefka are deeper than that
one realizes too late that his greed has doomed him the other is insane because he was the subject of magicalmedical experiments
i have played this game six times more than any other rpgfinal fantasy v was good
while i think ff was a little better this is the first time ff was released in the us
it was interesting and obviously the predecessor of the job system used in final fantasy tactics
i think it was worth playingi wish there was more rereleasing old classic games for new systems
i suppose some might see it as the companies just trying to squeeze more money from old games but i love being able to play these games on new systems and the addition of new features is always fun to experienceas far as collections go this is a very good one
final fantasy  originally  is a classic game and considered by some to be the best ff ever
i cant say i think its the best but it is definitely an exceptional game that was even more remarkable when it was first released
it does already seem dated in many ways
at the same time this is the final game in the series where you can experience the classic d ff that many fans of the series have grown up withthis game does have an excellent cast of characters and one of the better storylines in the series
the espers the first real summon monsters are really cool and theres somewhere around  of them much more than any other game which i like
each character has unique abilities and weapons which makes for great variety
a very fun old school rpgthe graphics were amazing at the time but already seem pretty dated
the sound as well
the music that was written for the game is some of uematsos best but the sound capabilities of the snes are just too dated
if they improved anything i wish they would have improved sound quality a bit
also the cg scenes they added were disappointing to me
they werent that badly done but i thought that they would be peppered throughout the game at the appropriate spots which they werent
they were only at the beginning and end which i find disappointing
i guess they wanted the actual experience of playing the game to be identical to how it was on the snes
i wouldnt have minded some small improvements personally
overall they did a good jobff  was a real surprise and it was great to play a brand new old style ff never before released in the us
lots of the reviews on amazon say that it is really a subpar game
i have to say i strongly disagreei think its a great ff game
if you enjoyed ff  and  i think youll definitely like  the graphics and sound are similar to ff  the gameplay is what makes the game so good though
you can switch your characters between the variety of job classes like in ff tactics or ff x and learn a large variety of different skills then mix and match them
its a very primitive form of the job class system sure but its still really cool considering the age of the game
i also really enjoyed the story of the gameit was about as good as ff  theres a part where youre navigating through a graveyard of pirate ships infested with ghosts and zombies that is totally classic
i would definitely recommend giving ff  a chance
it is old and outdated but definitely lives up to the quality of the ff seriesnow a quick word about the music discits pathetic
an absolute waste of time
if anyone could actually listen to that disc and get into the music on it id say you have serious issues
its tinny snes sound taken directly from the games
i cant imagine it would have been too much work to throw some real orchestrated versions they are available in japan of the songs on herethat would have been great
furthermore they chose a bunch of the worst songs to include on the disc and left out many of the best
terriblebut you wont be buying this collection for the music disc
the games are what matters and they are quality faithful ports of the originals
highly recommended for people who want to walk down memory lane with some great old gamesi dont like either of these as much as the newer final fantasy games  and  but they are still great games if you missed final fantasy   back on the snes you should pick it up now plus you get final fantasy   which was never released in the us before nowthis is a must buy for any rpg fans
two of the greatest games ever released together relatively cheap
its a dream come truefirstly final fantasy v it is doubtlessly better than the first fourthe graphics sound and storyline are far superior
the characters have better personalities than the first four
basically you take command of this guy called butz who is travelling around the world on his chocobo
the wind begins to weaken and you and some friends are given the task of protecting the crystals which basically control the world
this is an enjoyable game and i recommend you play this one first because ff is so much better
if you play that first then ff will be a let downff is probably the greatest ever rpg
forget the dodgy graphics and sound
this game has the best storyline and characters out of any ff game
it also includes the best villain in any game ever
kefka the psychopathic twisted general
i wont give away too much about the storyline because it will spoil itjust get it
you wont regret itwhen final fantasy vi first came out in the us i was excited as excited can be
it was an incredible game by anyones standards
but it cost  dollars
here we have the opportunity to buy this as well as the neverreleased before in the us final fantasy v along with bonus features for  dollarsthe games certainly lack the graphical polish of the games of today
but that is irrelevant  they offer great gameplay great music and most importantly great stories
it is rather obvious that ff  is the more sophisticated of the two games but ff  has its own charms
in particular anyone who has played final fantasy tactics will recognize the job systemff  represented a new path for square in the rpg department
there was a focus on more mature themes and unlike most other rpgs there was no main character
their stories interwove wonderfully and seeing how the characters related to each other was one of the highlights of the game
the gameplay is solid  each character offers their own distinct traits for use during combat unlike the later ffs ie  and  and there is an incredible amount of stuff to do in this game
the music is also considered by many to be the best of the ff seriesff  was also a great game
while it lacked the indepth characters and the complexity of the next ff it does excel in all those areas nevertheless
plus this game has gilgamesh
its worth playing just to see gilgameshthe bonus materials included on the discs are also excellent
there wasnt much for ff except for the introductory cg sequence and maybe the ending im not sure
as for ff they added a section where you can see dozens of pieces of artwork for the remake of the game as well as convenient tables of skills and monsters in the gamethe additional music cd isnt great but it doesnt detract from the quality of the set at all
if youre one of those that got started on the final fantasy series through  or  be sure to check this set out
its top notchthis item arrived in good shape and in good time
i havent had a chance to play it yet but am looking forward to itthis is definately a must buy for people who enjoyed final fantasy ii and iii on the snes
final fantasy anthology includes both final fantasy v never before released in the usa and final fantasy vi iii on the snes as well as a music cd that includes music selections from both of the gamesfnial fantasy v contains the complex job system that enables you to create characters of different classes such as thief black mage white mage and others all of the classes on final fantasy tactics are included along with a few others unique to this game
the graphics are outdated but the challenge of the game moer than makes up for the outdated graphics and the replay value is high as well you can start over and make completely different customized characters to beat the game with againfinal fantasy vi has got to be the best in the series when it comes to characters catchy music and storyline
the characters are all different and have their own personalities that make the game very unique
the characters are developed very well and you find yourself caring about their feelings and what happens to them
beat the game and then listen to the soundtrack and i can gurantee that you will remember exactley where you were in the game when you first heard the songs
the storyline is very traditional good vs bad no gray area but it is a very well developed storyline with a few twists and turns and to top it all off the bad guy in the game kefka is the most evil and twisted villan in all of the final fantasy seriespros excellent games with new fully rendered cinemas that werent included in the snes versions
a collection of the two best rpgs of the mid s eracons load time the snes plays the games a lot faster and smoother
outdated graphics you will learn to appreciate the game thoughoverall a great buy for any rpg fan or final fantasy fan that is willing to put up with the outdated sound and graphicsyouve played final fantasies  and  before
now you can play them again without having to dust off your old snes or booting your computerand maybe my memory is short but they are the same games as they were the first time around
you might find better translations
there are a couple of cinematics
however all in all youll find the same beloved classicssmell that
no its not a chocobo farm
thats nostalgiathis review is basically for ff vi
it was actually ff iii when i first played it
anyway this game is awesome
its what first got me into playing video games
the story is very good
theres a lot of different characters that you get to play with
it has  player option when your battling
the only real flaw is the graphics
but it came out a long time ago so you really cant expect it to be to mind blowing in the graphics department
other then that awesome game
i only played ff v for a little bit
it seemed to be pretty cool
didnt set up the story for the game very well though
and there seemed to be some bugs in it as well
or in my disc there was
i had to keep saving so when it did mess up i wouldnt have to start over
i never did play all the way through v though so not sure how good it actually isthe music disc sucksunless your into jamming out to old school ff music
good music for the game not so much though for sitting around listening to itfinal fantasy anthology is two great bit final fantasy games in one convenientlypriced package
first theres final fantasy v which while not being one of the best in the series is nice to finally have in the us
also theres final fantasy vi snes players might know it better as final fantasy iii which sells individually at the used game store i bought this at for a much higher price that and the fact that it is among the very best in the seriesthe music in both games is excellent and each ones battle theme has that familiar bassline at the beginning
the visuals are very dated but the new cg cinemas are gorgeous
number v has perhaps the most unique feature of any ff game the job system
true this was made popular in the us first with final fantasy tactics but it was still quite unique
my recommendation is leveling up one job to the max with one character then trying another
the bottom line i cant help but recommend this game for the classic gameplay and the familiar bit final fantasy feel captured perfectly on the playstation
the cg cinemas which are more like the amano art than the normal cg art in other ff games are gorgeous but there are only two in each game one that plays before the title screen and can be skipped anytime and one at the end
overall i highly recommend this game and that being said go to your local usedrare game store and check it outthese two games are the best games two ever come out
they are just wonderful true classics never die
with final fantasy  or  being its wonderful self and  which never came out in america
the graphics are the old super nintendo graphics but graphics dont matter at all
buy this game or you can final fantasy ahahahahahaha
whatta a loserfinal fantasy v  vi is a great revisit for fans of the series or anyone playing it for the first time
hard to believe how far this series has come in the past  years
then again when you can go back play the older ones  still enjoy it its not so hard to believe after allthese  games are probably in my opinion anyway the best ones in the series
i will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itselfff one of the previously unreleased ff games at the time anyway is now in america
i really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof
i literally trained my characters this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game to get to level  or  cant remember exactly just to get my jobs mastered
the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other ff games this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of xdeath rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting himher instead of the one who is destroying the world
the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters theres only  in the entire game you stick with  one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter so be prepared to look at the same  characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change charactersff i think this is the best one in the series
there is absolutly no real main character in this game
for those who are confused what i mean is that well for example ff you have about  characters but the leader character is cloud the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game well in this game you can have  different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader
the characters are excellent in this game i pretty much like all of them gau is funny but he doesnt have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you cant even control them at all during battle
sabin having the blitz ability
for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move no matter which direction your facing you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction
for instance one of the moves is rlr i am talking about right left right on the control pad and if your character is facing to the right then you have to insert that command but if you are facing the opposite direction it is still the same command not the opposite combination
when i first beat the game before beating it i got all of the characters to level  this game also has some of the best music for a ff game at the time anywaythe collection itself you get a music cd the random battle screen is like ff and s random battle loading screen ff has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies has cgi cinemas ff is pretty much like the super nes or should i say super famicom version with just the exception of random battle loading screens and psone style opening cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the usa and square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus featuresoverall if you like the snes ff games this is the right collection for you along with chronicles which includes ff ff in the usa for the snes and chrono triggeri dont play video games much but i have some of the clasicsfor any rpg fan this is a must have especially if you like the old school   and d types of layoutscolorful and simple but not as simple as say mystic quest the baby rpg of yesterday decade
great gift as wellthis is a great set
it gives one of the greats final fantasys of all time vi and introduces ff which has never before been released in the us the music cd is very cool as well
although this is originally a snes game the ps import is still great to playgreat transfers make for a fantastic collection of two of the best final fantasy games
this is a must have for any collectorthese are some of my favorite games
im happy to add it to the collection and look foreward to playing it againboth of these games are classic rpgs
ff was never released in the us you could get it if you had an emulator
the storyline in  is a little weak i thought but the battle system job system and ability system give the game endless possibilities
you can have fun going through the game again using different combinations of jobs
if you have never played ff or ff prior to buying this anthology play  first because it will set you up for  now onto ff
i feel this is the best rpg ever
though the modern final fantasies offer better graphics bigger story lines ect ff is the greatest of all time
when it was released on the snes as ff it was ground breaking
it blew everything out of the water with its interactive story line personable characters and awesome battle system
so for its time ff is untouchable
the story line is linear most of the time you know where you are supposed to be going and what you are supposed to be doing but at the same time you are on your toes because you cant tell what will happen next
the music will blow you away to
it really adds to the effect of the game
ff is also a long game first time i played it on the snes it took me hrs to beat
once you know the game inside and out you can do it in hrs
the difficulty is just right as well
most people will be able to get through this game without having to get a guide
thats how an rpg should be
it should make you think but not make you have to look up answers on the net or in a guide
if you are an rpg fan and have ps or ps buy this game
they are becoming collectors items
i bought mine used for  bucks in nice condition
thats a pretty steep price so just imagine how much it will be in a year or sook no this game is amazing i bought it when it first came out so i have the cd disc and everything now i was reading some of the reviews that gave it one star and said that ff anf ff are way better for one ff is horrible and ff is ok but  is on my top  rpgs everything about it is just amazing and ff is awesome also its really weird but i like it cause its a little different they didnt originally release ff in the us and they should of because its awesome
i highly recommend these games but id go for the non greatest hitsive noticed a couple people complain about the load times especially during battles
theres a quick and easy fix for ps owners  in the main menu under the ps driver theres a setup option for fast loading
when you turn that on the game will load as fast as the original cartridge did
problem solvedand now for the game ff is the best version of final fantasy made to date imho
ff ff and ff are also very good but ff got the rpg formula perfect great characters great story great battle system
if i had to sell all my rpgs ff is the one i would keep  play overandoveras for ff the story is rather weak but the gameplay is really really good thanks to the job system like ff
what i like to do with ff is to experiment what if i had  white mages what if i had  black mages what if i had  fighters would i survive the battles w such weak teamsthanks to its job system ff has a great deal of replayability
even after you beat the game you can go back and replay with a completely different team and new complications trust me beating this game with  black mages is not easybottom line buy final fantasy  right now
if youre like me youll cherish it foreverthis is the best roleplaying game ever made
the world and the towns are gigantic
the music is beautifully composed and the characters are likeable not like the stupid characters in ffx
i bought the game used but the cds are in perfect condition
i play this game on a playstation  and the load times are not that bad
if you like rpgs and missed out on the snes like i did get this game you will not be dissapointeda final note i actually enjoy the bit graphics
i am getting sick of all the games for xbox and ps with hours of moviequality cut scenes
i enjoy playing video games not watching noninteractive moviesfinal fantasy iii was the very first rpg i ever played as a teen in the early s and this is why im hooked on rpgs to this day
before graphics became a bigger deal with the playstation more emphasis was put on storyline
thats why so many fell in love with ffiii its excellent absorbing storyline and array of characters to play
i got this to see the newly added movie sequences and play the other ff game that comes with it
once again storyline makes up for graphics
there are strong female characters in both games
rpgs were the first genre to have female characters worth mentioning way before lara croft was introduced to us all
i was mainly looking forward to revisiting ffiii for old times sake but love both games equally nowfinal fantasy anthology released in  contains ff v ff vi and a soundtrack with some music from each of these two games
look for more about ff vi called iii for the snes in my review for it in the snes section when it was originally released
i will focus this review more on ff v since this was the first time it was released out of japanfinal fantasy v was originally released in japan in  squaresoft was planning on releasing it in the us but it was deemed quottoo toughquot for american audiences
then they planned on releasing it for the pc and calling it quotfinal fantasy extremequot but that idea was scrapped as well
it is now finally available in its original form along with ff vi as final fantasy anthologyi found ff v to be a pretty good ff and if i were just reviewing it without ff vi i would give it  stars
however being that both of these ffs were released together for the price of one i have to give it five stars
ff v has the job system like in ff i and ff iii nes ff iii which has yet to be released out of japan
the difference between the job system in ff i and ff vs job system is that you can switch character classes at any time and you learn new skills based on which class you are currently using by getting ap
the story is above average and as said before ff v is very challenging
music is also up to par with other ffs so what is the minor problem you aski felt that ff v had less character development than other ffs at the time iv and vi
this wouldve been fine if ff v was released in the time period of the nes ffs but thats not the case
dont get me wrong while it does have some character development the character development in iv and vi were much better
besides this however ff v is a very good ff overall and worth checking out especially since you also get ff vi and a soundtrack with music from these ffsbuti have to say nothing is greater than a game that loads you up with good graphics good gameplay good everything and lets you go up against the nazis as an agent in the oss of world war ii
if your a history buff or are too young to have seen world war two this gets you pretty close to the action
you go through missions fighting through and completing objectives
duh
so buy this game and enjoyelectronic arts has their papers in order
this game was the first fps i played for the ps
one of the best fps games of all time
epic campaign fun multiplayer and cool cheats make this game the best medal of honor game of all time
the funnest part of this game is shooting the officers in the head after they asked you for your papers and they said they were not in order
must buy if somehow dont already have this classichow many medal of honor games are on the market these days
more than enough
lets talk about the very first one on the original playstation
this game is a fantastic firstperson shooter and a great world war ii game
you get the best of both worlds with medal of honorim somewhat embarrassed to admit that when it comes to firstperson shooters i am absolutely horrible at them
enemies seem to find a way to come out of nowhere all the time and cheapshot me and then of course i die very quickly
with most games like this you barely have enough time to react to their insane shooting rampage and learn the controls before its quickly game over
with medal of honor i can finally put those nightmare problems to rest
i can actually complete about  of this game which by my standards is a big pat on the back
i never would have guessed understanding a game like this was possible and be able to complete some levels but its true
heres why the buttons are laid out perfectly on the playstation controller
the target button is really easy to use
you can use the directional pad to move it around and locate the enemy
it never fails
the shoot button works great
the jump and duck buttons work great
everything works great
when you aim at something before shooting it actually works
its amazing how many games get this wrong and the whole experience is ruined
the play control is a major improvement compared to syphon filter for example
in that game it felt like i was awkwardly walking or sliding all over the place the challenge in medal of honor is perfect for people who are not professionals when it comes to firstperson shooters
the challenge in each level builds and builds very slowly allowing you to learn and master the controls while you make progress
syphon filter fails to do this
so does metal gear solid
medal of honor is an easytounderstand shooting game for people who normally arent very good at these kind of games
i really want to thank dreamworks the company responsible for this game for making the challenge just rightalso you encounter just a few cutscenes here and there and each one is very interesting to watch because they show you what it was like during world war ii and you may even learn some stuff about the war that youve never known before
good cutscenesthe objectives you have to complete are always pretty fun and not too difficult until later in the game
when i say not too difficult i mean not too difficult to understand and not too difficult to complete
whenever you want to find out what you have to do just press the start button and your short and simple objectives will be given to you right thereas a shooting game medal of honor shines and easily surpasses most firstperson shooters once again
enemies are everywhere and many of them want you dead immediately
luckily they give you enough time to react
when you arrive to a harder level later on well keep in mind that you will have to keep playing certain levels over and over and learn where each and every enemy is located and take them out as quickly and effectively as you can
trust me this is really fun
its so much fun to find out which gun youre carrying is most effective on the enemy you encounter
you will probably lose a bunch of times while you learn but this is all part of the fun
making it to the end of a level doesnt require luck like in syphon filter and you will feel satisfied once youve completed a stage
you can even play the completed stages over and over again if you want
medal of honor is so good why not play the same stages over a hundred timesi dont know what else to say
i love this game
oh yeah the music and sound effects
the music is like listening to a suspenseful realistic war movie
its really good
the sound effects are awesome as well because each soldier you encounter has something interesting and different to say
you will be amazed at how many new lines these soliders can come up with
you will hear the sound of silence while walking around in the dark along with the sound of distant gunshots and other creepy sounds
all this adds up to a disturbingly realistic wartime experienceoh and the animations you will see from enemies falling over after theyve been shot is clearly a notch above the rest
even after killing these guys a million times they seem to find new ways to amaze me with their ability to squirm around and struggle to survive
simply put you will always see soldiers do different things before they die
sometimes they shoot wildly all over the place while falling over and dying
other times they will fall to their knees before falling over for good
wherever you shoot on their body they will react very realistically
shoot them in the foot they hop around
these are probably normal and understandable things that a human being would do if they were dyingthe weapons are what youd expect in a wartime game
very good weapons and very easy to aim and use them on an enemy
no problems herei havent encountered any blood in the game yet but as far as im concerned blood is overrated because the color red is just that a color
it means nothing to the actual gameplaysome very minor problems i had is that sometimes your main character moves around too quickly which means sometimes you may accidentally walk right into danger and the graphics are slightly dark and dated
just slightly
dont forget the occasional playstation glitches
also there are actually loading times in the game
it takes  seconds to load a stage
i thought by  loading times were a thing of the past
despite these problems medal of honor is still a nearperfect gameoverall please buy this awesome firstperson shooter
today in  firstperson shooters and war games specifically world war ii games are all over the place to the point where its almost boring to play one anymore
this is because war time games are a genre that has lost its appeal over the years thanks to overexposure and repeating more or less the same requiredstrategies with each new game that gets released
in other words all war games are basically the same thing these days
its boring
but guess what
back in  when medal of honor was brand new the playstation didnt have a whole lot of games like this and war games were treated with more respect which make medal of honor all the more special
pick it upmedal of honor is an absolutely outstanding game
true it has alot in common with wolfenstein dwhich is also an excellent gamewith the germans and it being a firstperson shooter
but this game is realitybased with real wartime objectives and that is what sets it apart from wolfenstein d
to be honest when i first played it i wasnt expecting much
boy was i surprised afterwards
i mean this game totally engulfs you and makes you feel as though youre actually theregraphically the game may be a bit grainy but it doesnt take from the game
you hardly notice that once you get into it
the sound is what truly shines in this game
everything from germans yelling to one another to shotgun fire to explosions
control is deadon no complaints there
the gameplay is engaging and intense and at times difficult but extremely fun nonethelessi give the highest honor to this game
its one that i highly recommend to all fps fans andor action fans alike
its definitely a classic that will stand for alltimeit all started with this game medal of honor released exclusively for the original playstation all the way back in   its no surprise at all that this game was inspired by the steven spielburg movie saving private ryan given that it was developed by the inhouse video game department of dreamworks studios and published by electronic arts
granted it definitely looks old and outdated and the moves you can actually perform in the game are extremely limited but its still remarkable in some areas and remains the launching point for one of the biggest wwii video game franchises of all time
also its never to be confused at all with the  modern warfare version of the same name which ill refer to as moh 
medal of honor is strongly geared towards the runngun style of fps gameplay that was extremely popular at the time
this is driven home by the fact that you cant zoom in at all with any weapon the sole exception being the sniper rifle when you hit the aim button
you just get a crosshair that shows you exactly where the bullet will hit
you also are unable to move while aiming instead only being allowed to lean left or right
all of this means that youre better off just charging the enemy with an automatic weapon that has a sizeable ammo clip instead of trying to pick them off from afar
if you do manage to acquire a sniper rifle youll actually be able to manually zoom in a great deal and is extremely helpful for picking off far away soldiers or those manning stationary heavy machine guns or rocket launchers
a major aspect thats perhaps the most unforgiving is the lack of a checkpoint system
this means you have to finish the entire level or section in one try
if you die or quit you have to attempt it all over again from the beginningthe enemy ai was actually quite impressive for the time it was released
theyll go prone to reduce their exposure utilize cover effectively make use of savage german shepards to rip you a new hole and actually throw back grenades you send their way
also just like every other early game before the s you have to find healthpacks to replenish your health and on the hardest difficulty the nazis can drain your health pretty quickly
there are some stealth sections of the game that disguise you as a nazi soldier with false papers and a silenced pistol
it quickly becomes apparent that the enemies are extremely deaf as an unsilenced weapon wont alert another soldier whos farther away
its very funny when you show a soldier your false papers then nail them in the head as they walk awaythe graphics are extremely primitive poor and limited but this was the ps one of the first console systems to utilize cds instead of cartridges
most of the game takes place at night time and the draw distance is laughable
the landscape magically materializes into view as you move through it and the overall graphics are muddy blurry and static
the sound on the other hand is absolutely fantastic
weapons sound loud clear and distinct and environmental ambience is wonderfully utilized to slightly offset the awful graphics
medal of honor  is without a doubt lacking in all areas when compared to later entries and even other wwii titles
however it is still good for what it is a runngun wwii fps that offers a suitable challenge surprisingly adept enemies amazing sound design and a healthy heaping of nostalgia
if nothing else moh  should be remembered as the game that launched one of the biggest wwii video game franchises of all timeok everybody this is the first serious ww game to come along and it captivated america
from the scenes straight from saving private ryan to the sound that was almost erie this is an all around gamei personally own this game and can truly testify to the graphics and personna that make up medal of honor
this game takes you beyond what you would expect from an aversge game it takes you to the inner workings of the german war machine
you personally try to dismantle the nazis and try for the right of the medal of honori love this game
bravo well done
the only negative things i have to say is that i wish they allowed you to do more hand to hand combat or knife fighting and that i wish the game had more gadgets like binoculars and a mapthis was a good game it got here in time for christmas thanks to the goodwill of california
thanks so much for a great product
and in a timely mannerthis is by far the greatest video game ive ever played
this is the first person shooter ive been waiting for
youre not killing monsters and space aliens youre actually particpating in historical events killing real enemies
the graphics are solid and the sound is just awesome
and with shock controllers the quotfeelquot of this game is just oustandingim a big kid at heart but no means am i a kid so i cant keep up with many of todays games as they are too fast paced
this game is challenging but not impossible for an old timer like me
the levels get increasingly difficult and offer enough of a varied experience to keep you addicted to the end
a must have for anyone who enjoys video games and is a wwii buffi bought this game when it first came out and i had not heard one thing about it
it was one of those impulse buys
i didnt expect too much out of it just something to do but i was suprised
this game is great
i wouldnt say its on the same level and nintendo  series or perfect dark but medal of honor was very fun
a couple of the things that i think could have been different are features like shooting the germans helmet off
its kind of cool at first but gets frustrating later
perhaps the biggest fault of the game was that it was a little too easy
i like a challenge
althought i finished all of the levels fairly quick i find myself going back and trying them again especially after i watch war moviesthis has to be one of the best ps games around it is awesome the missions are all challenging and very fun and after you beat it youll countinue to play itthis game is excellent
if you are in need of a game to keep you busy and excited get medal of honor
this game has decent graphics but the sound is awesome
music goes on while you nervously walk down pathways and german soldiers pop out from another pathway and blow you up with a bazooka
the game is quite challenging
it takes awhile to finish because as the game progresses the soldiers become very difficult to defeat because they think strategically
very good game
buy it as soon as possibleon a visual standard medal of honor looks great
moh features excellent looking explosions beautifully designed levels and great detail on the bodies
the overall look of moh is breathtaking youd think with that much action on one screen you would experience slowdown but that isnt the case in medal of honor
ive been playing the game nonstop and havent noticed a touch of slowdown
overall crisp visuals great looking explosions and flawless frame rate make moh of the most enjoyable game too look atthe games main stand is its unbelievable gameplay
playing this game almost makes you feel like you are literally in the war
its main idea is to relive wwii all over again you are a us soldier who is the best in his class who was hired by an agency and is out to carry missions
on your missions you will encounter german nazis that need a little lesson teach them one and keep going
every stage has at least  or more missions to be completed and on some you will need to use your noodle a little
since this titles main focus is the realism ea has decided to include an array of weapons
everything from a regular handgun to a shotgun and even to a rocket launcher
besides having tons of weapons to choose from you also can take control over an enemys machine gun
you may notice these powerful machine guns in almost every stage implanted into the ground
you can take over them by pressing square and shot the enemiesnow that we have got the weapons out of our hands i can now talk about tactics
first of i want to mention that the artificial intelience is incredibly smart so you wont be dealing with idiots that dont even run away from grenades
no way if you throw a grenade at the enemy he will either pick it up and throw it back at you or he will kick it away
in terms of gameplay this game can truly be compared to goldeneye
its ai is far more intelligent than that found in goldeneye moh features a more extensive line of weapons than goldeneye and the game moh has a better balance
medal of honor actually features a good story line and the cameras arent bouncy
there is more to be said but in the end medal of honor leaves nintendos goldeneye in the dusthere comes the greatest aspect its revolutionary sound
playing medal of honor will definitely make you feel like you are in a movie theater watching some action flick say something like star wars ep
the games sound effects are truly mesmerizing every shatter every footstep every gun shot can be heard and the clarity is to die for
if you have a big screen tv and a powerful stereo system make sure to hook both up and play medal of honor because i swear to you if you pump up the volume you will be experiencing world war  and last but not least the game also features dialogue during in and out of the missionon the control side the game it isnt really disappointing but control takes time to get used to
this is a st person shooter and their are controls to be learned
the top shoulder buttons l r are for moving sideways l is to crawl r is to aim l is to center view x is to shoot square is to open up doors or take over machine guns triangle is to jump and o is to switch weapons
the lay out may sound easy but it takes some time to get used toin conclusion medal of honor is one of playstations best titles out there to date and it is very well the best st person on the market
mixing the story of saving private ryan and the action of goldeneye medal of honor is truly one of the years best games ever
even if you are not a fan of st person shooters i still highly suggest buying medal of honor  ea has finally made a actionadventure game worth playing for the psin this game you will come across many different types of enemy soldiers through its  missions and  levals
there will be wehrmacht light infantry gestopo police snipers and much more
the missions are well done and provide a felling that your watching a old ww film
the missions range from sobotageing a deadly uboat to destroying a rail gun
the missions never get boreing and always are challengeing
the graphics are the best your going to get on the ps and the replay valu is much greater than that of the  games and most other shoot em up gamesthis game is great and is worth buying for the psthe original medal of honor game is fun to play
despite graphics that are cheezy by ps standards gamers will find a thrilling experience
grade bokay this game may be for the first playstation but the new medal of honors for playstation etc
just suck basically in the newest one medal of honor vanguard you just go around killing things no pointthis one has a story mode theres actually a briefing
and the phisycs are broken i killed a german and his body floated up and disapeered
wtf
the first medal of honor the bodys dont do that
the ai is okay
and i have never had a problem with this game i give it a  out of  oh i love the funky ways the germans die toomy son asked for this game for over a year
it is a fun game
there is some shooting but honestly this is no more that what you would see on the news
there is no profane language
the game itself has interresting puzzles to solve and advance to the next level
just being  is funi am a fan of tomb raider but not really a die hard fan
to be truthful it takes me too long to get through the game without walkthroughs
i end up stuck at a level without knowing where to go or what to do and the game gives very little assistance when it comes to amateur play
well this games doesnt do that
it gives me the much needed support as if knowing that im not a gaming genius who can figure everything out eventually
this game is fun and friendly
just what a semigamer needs
i really couldnt put it down
its easy to play but has just enough challenge to make you feel as though youre accomplishing something thats worthy of a true gamer
oh and i loved how it followed the movie so closely
after i finished the game i watched the movie again
the game actually helped me see stuff i didnt notice the first time i watched it
cool beansas a fan of the james bond games i cant recommend more this game to lovers of action games especially bond games
i totally recommend itas a kid i loved this game but i never owned it
i bought it and it came quickly and worked flawlessly
fantastic gameif your child has played beginning software like jumpstart and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay humongous entertainments puttputt series and freddi fish and pajama sam as well are an excellent choice
these titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items navigate a number of locations and use their problemsolving skills to help their friends and achieve larger goals
along the way kind and gentle puttputt and his dog pep will meet a number of nice characters visit a variety of interesting locations and play games as they complete the larger tasksin puttputt saves the zoo the overarching goal is to reuntie baby animals with their parents so that the zoo can open but along the way he will perform a variety of smaller tasks
i would say that the best titles in this series are puttputt enters the race and puttputt joins the circus but this one is very good toothis is a fine game in a great seriesin this game puttputt has to reunite the baby animals with their parents in the new car town zoo
it helps develop problem solving skills
it is also entertaining
i enjoyed playing it with my daughter
if fact she had played alot of it on her own so she showed me how to play it
a childrens game is well written when a  year old can start it play it and then expain it to an adult without a problem
hats off to humongous entertainmentthis was the first childrens software i bought for mykids
they loved it
i must admit i love it also
this is anexcellent interactive game
now my  year old is addicted to all of putt putt and freddi fish games
he especially loves the songs that are everywhere in the gameyou must see this game to experience it
children love the bright colors and great sounds
there are differences in the game each time it is played
my  and  year old occasionally play along with my  year old
i recommend this software to anyone with children
the price that amazon is selling it for is excellent
you will not regret it and your children will thank youmy daughter loves this game
she started toying around with it around age  and still plays it at age six
a good starter adventure game for the young child you want to expose to your home computer and a good learning toolits been a very long time since i have played this game but it truly is one of the best rpgs i have ever playedthe graphics arent the best especially compared to todays standards
but if you can look past that then youll find an amazing well balanced rpg which will consume many enjoyable hours from you
its not an easy game but its not impossible either
it will challenge you from start to finishand for  at the time of this review it would be crazy to pass up this great deal of a game
a word of note this game is better than might and magic vii and far better than might and magic viii do not buy viii
vi is definitely the best of the entire seriesbuy it you wont be disappointedi love this game way more than i liked newer games with better graphics like diablo or baldurs gate even though i did like diablo and baldurs gate
whats so special about it in other games i sometimes felt as if i were slogging through a level
in mm something is always happening
one goes up in level quite often so there are new spells or better skills or new weapons or more armor or some goodie or the other every time you turn around
most of the monsters have a least a couple of goldpieces so nearly every critter killed gives you something
this makes the game very addictive  just get one more level and you can get that skill you want just kill five more monsters and you can afford that armor
what
its  am one can play battles in real time or in turnbased mode
i have truly miserable handeye coordination and many video games are simply too hard for me and thus not fun
this game lets the dexterous play in real time but the turnbased option lets those of us who are nondexterous play too
i wish every game had a turnbased option
also in this vein you use your characters skills to attack monsters not your own so you dont have to line up a blow with a sword or an arrow from a bow or a fireball from a wizard  you just tell your charcters whom you want them to attack and they figure it out
you figure the strategy your characters handle the handeye coordination
thats why theyre the adventurers and youre sitting at a computer
 the party is large enough that one gets to take advantage of several different types of skills  you can have a fighter a mage a cleric and an archer  but they move as a unit so the game doesnt descend into the chaos that some other rpgs do many recent rpgs seem to be so concerned with realism that theyve sacrificed gameplay  just as one example ive played rpgs where archers are always having to run back to town to buy more arrows even if they buy  at a time
in mm theres some concern with realism but more concern with gameplay
if you have a bow its assumed that you have arrows to go with it  you never have to buy any
there are some space limitations but no weight limitations so if it fits in your space allotment you can carry it the mandate mania website run by a fan not the official site is one of the most helpful game websites ive ever seen
they give lots of information and its very well organized i could go on and on but this is long enough
 the game is fun and charming reasonably easy without being dull and has lots of skills quests places and itemsthis is what a proper adventure game should be
theres a mystery to solve a secret past to discover even a maiden to save
there is also no swearing no blatant sexual themes although the scantily clad woman on the cover of the box might suggest otherwise and very little gorewhat  made this game so much fun was the uniqueness of it all
youre an  explorer out to discover the legacy of his lost father and discover a ship  trapped in the ice
the ship is inhabited by odd spirits and dreams of  people long dead and its your job to find out what happened and set the  dreamers freethe acting in this game is very good as are the graphics  in the game
the characters are easy to believe instead of looking like  disinterested hacks reading from scripts and the story rapidly swallows  your attention
if you love a challenging adventure game with a deeply  involving plot youll adore morpheusmorpheus offers a haunting and intricate story elaborate settings and a significant amount of game play
the dialogue is wellwritten and i found myself drawn into the characters and story and not wanting the game to end
puzzles range in difficulty from easy to fairly difficult but all were  fun to solvea criticism is that the voice acting is a bit hammy in  parts
also the interface is a bit slow at times
however these are  minor criticisms and it is important to note that i didnt experience any  bugs or crashes while playing this game which is an alltoorare  experience with this type of software product unfortunatelythe  thought imagination and hard work that went into the creation of this game  are evident
i recommend morpheus to gamers who enjoyed games like myst or  riven and morpheus represents a good value for the amount of entertainment  and game play it offerstomb raider  is one of the best tr games
it has an exciting plot good graphics excellent villians and a lot of action
i love this game and play it frequently and never get tired of it
a must have for all tr collectorsafter downloading this game along with all of the others a few months ago to relive my childhood gaming memories i found myself really loving these games with a whole new respect
when i was little i got to shoot things climb around and even get scared a few times
now i really love how awesome the game play is the puzzles that were way over my head when i was playing this at  or  years old and the whole story of it actually makes sense
the controls and graphics are kind of clunky but they only get better with each game
having new everything really makes it quite a bit better
in this game you arent confined to save crystals to save your game although thats only for the st and rd games on the playstationidk why they did it this way in the second and decided to go back in the rd and she has several more weapons including the need for flares and a harpoon gun
which really make me happy because not seeing in the dark not really an issue in the first game and not being able to attack enemies underwater were the only turn offs in the original but this game has those and a new set of abilities that all work together to enhance the game play even more
this was one of the greatest in the series you should really pick it upfrom the great wall of china to the canals of venice tomb raider ii is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original
in fact i find this game to be my favorite of the series
in it the legendary lara croft sets out to find the dagger of xion
in her quest she navigates the globe and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worldstomb raider ii offers significant improvements over the original and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series
the game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence
though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions they still are quite difficult
lara has new moves many new weapons and more dangerous foes
what more could a tomb raider fan  or even the casual gamer  ask fori highly recommend this game whether you are an avid tomb raider fan or somebody new to the series
i dont believe you will be disappointed  in fact you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment
and if you do enjoy it i strongly recommend other games in this seriesseller accidentally sent me tomb raider  instead of  but replaced it promptly and let me keep tr besides
  i played this game with my dad when i was a little girl and its held up amazingly well despite the datedness of the graphics plenty of action lots of puzzles decent combat pretty nifty story
will always be my favorite tomb raider gametomb raider  was pure genius
from the great wall of china to venice to the depths of the ocean to the snowcapped mountains and back to the great wall of china again this game was a pure blast of groundbreaking excitementyou first start the game in a very simple yet looong level inside the great wall of china
this was the first tomb raider level i ever beat
it took me a week to beat it but i beat it all right
i must say it was a very good idea to make that the first level
venice the next level was a bit harder but i could beat it thanks to the confidence boost from the first leveltruth be told you do not end the game with a dragon
nope theres more where that came from and theyve even followed you to your house to prove it
yep you get to go inside laras home and fight baddies while doing the assault course
sound like funtomb raider  has to be one of the best tomb raiders of all time
i suggest picking it up
it is worth it i promisei loved the first tomb raider and this one is even better
the story is great very entertaining
the graphics are ok and the gameplay is relatively the same as the first one
its such a great adventure game i love it
it has all the charm as the first one but much more funnessif you liked the first one definately get this one
it may have alot more puzzles but i like my games to be complicated i mean would you like to play a game where you just push one button and theres  hours of cutscenes
no
i would guess so get this and i know youll love itthe first sml game sold so well that nintendo went back to the drawing board and came up with the sequel
in  super mario land   golden coins was released for the game boy and was also a smash hit
mario returns in  the sequel that blends in elements of super mario bros captures the feel of super mario bros  classic nes game and introduces a brand new villain wario now a fan favorite and well known nintendo character
its a great game that belonged in anyones game boy collectionin super mario land  wario comes out of nowhere and kicks out mario from his castle and takes over his land
to face him mario must collect  coins scattered throughout  worlds with multiple levels each in order to regain his castle
the same rules applies just like in super mario land and with more enemies power ups and stages to see the game saves your progress after you complete each levelthe pros sml  is better than sml in every way possible
the graphics are improved new music tracks are here and they sound great
the sound effects are on point and so are the controls
the game is longer now and since it has battery backed memory you no longer have to beat it in one sitting
plus the game feels like an alternate version of super mario bros  which was a great game so it can only help in the long runthe cons just like super mario land sml  is not that hard so gamers had no problems completing the game
they just took a little longer doing so but it was all in funthe sequel was a bigger and better game and thanks to nintendo they delivered a fun game that made lots of great memories
i still have the original cartridge and i still get a kick playing this game every once in a while
for those who are still on the fence super mario land   golden coins is worth tracking down if you have a game boy or game boy advance sp handheld that still worksthe game super mario land   golden coins was probably the first game i received when i got my gameboy somewhere between  i swear when i first got this game i couldnt put it down for hours
the game was hard at first but as you gain experience it gets easier and easier i might have beaten the game about  times nowthere are  different levels in this game space zone pumpkin zone mario zone turtle zone tree zone  marco zone which signifies the  golden coins concept
id say the hardest is the space zone that took me a long time to beat at first before you get to warios castle
some of the bosses are easy to beat also
there are also hidden stages in this game to find and when you beat them the zone setting will change like in the tree zone you will see flowers and suchspecial powers arent really anything too new
mario can still become super mario what happens when you get the mushroom and spit fireballs
the new one is when he gets bunny ears which causes him to float in the air and continously jump when you hold the jump button
which is also good is when you get hit when you have fire power or the bunny ears you just become super mario again and not become smallas i said before i received this game sometime when it first came out and it is still fun to play  years later
if you like the super mario games like i do i recommend this to yougraphics aconcept agame play adifficulty aoverall aps as i mentioned earlier there are secret levels in every zone
i found all of them except the one for the mario zone
is there one for that zone and if it is can someone tell me how to get to it
that is the only one i do not have
thanksi loved the first super mario land but it was wierd
and if it was too wierd for you you should get this
it contains multiple worlds that you can choose to go first megaman style
the graphics are amazing for a  bit gameboy
and if you play it on the gameboy advance or color it adds a little color
this is the best platformer on gameboy maybe its best game this is the best game boy game i have ever played
its a classici picked this up as i started to collect old games which i used to play in my childhood
it is still the best mario platformer game i have played on a console the graphics are really nice for a game made in the s was one of the best looking games on the game boy music is catchy and saves your progress automatically which is very good for a game of its length
if youve never played this id say its the handheld version of the snes super mario world but without yoshithis is a must have for oldschool game boy collectorsmario games are the bestfor those who dont know this is a portable platforming mario game for gameboy
simple controls a to jump b to run or use fireballs and the directional pad to duck and move
this feels like a mix and sequel to super mario world in terms of look and gameplay
they did a lot with the gameboys limitations
this is an amazing game by any standard let alone the original tiny hard to see super mario land for gameboy
this game offers bigger detailed graphics new enemies new moves new power ups like the flying carrot and a whole new land to explore with  levels to beat
mario land is divided into  sections the moon the tree the house mario is shrank the pumpkin which is haunted the sea and the mechanical statue of mario
each of these sections has a few levels complete with a boss
the great thing about this game is the diversity rather than super mario world which recycled the same background graphics in each level super mario land  each level has a different theme like being in a bee hive underground a haunted house a witches workshop a lake the moon and so on
there is no multiplayer mode
its a fun game with all of the new enemies and challenges and there are two exits to each level a normal exit and an exit that leads to a bonus round with one of  games crane game or a mouse hunt game for items and ups
it is also a fairly quick game too when you get good at it the game will only take  hours get up to the boss who is wario
the other bosses are very cheesy and they are a giant bird a witch an octopus and so on
there are no color gameboy features and there are  battery save slots it instantly saves after each levelhello mario fansmario is off to another dangerous adventure through  short worlds meeting many new and creepy enemies as well as for a short while a new boss takes place of bowser his name is wario
this is a great game and you get your every cent out of it i have it and i beat all of the  files on my game
dont sit there any play your ds get an original game boysuper mario land   golden coins if you want your money out of something you buy
ds cards are barely the size of your finger nail and  dont waist that money on a finger nail get something decently sized that isnt too bulky or too small
stop clicking that button on walmart just go on amazon one click ship and there youve got a whole library of game boy games for a fraction of the cost of a ds litehighly recommended
please buy me
dont waist a second buy the whole series super mario land super mario land   golden coins and wario land super mario land  dont waist a secondmario and his rival warioi love this game
if you ask me its the best game for gbc
i love itits sooooooooo awsomewow i love this game
it is the best noncolorized portable mario sidescroller i have ever played
this is one of the best game boy action games out there along with donkey kong land  metroid ii the kirby games and others
the rabbit ears kick but and i love the space zonegraphics almost like blackandwhite super mario worldplay control extremely tight and not too complexgame design it would be perfect but it lacks an ice zone or a desert zone
its a bit short compared to oh say super mario world but it has high replay value
hidden levels toosatisfaction expert players may beat it in a week or two but you want to play this forever
sound the sound is almost as good as smbs but the music isnt perfect but for a game boy game its fairly solidthe good cool enemies powers levels
great replay valuethe bad its a tad shortthe ugly the three little pigs and wariothis game is the best mario ever madeeven better than super mario deluxedx
gamepro would say the samethis is it is best is worst
heres what gamepro saidin a outofprint copygraphics sound controlshow much they respond fun factorhow fun it is
get it now
or elsethis one of the best mario games ever in game boy because you can pick your zone and after you get all the six golden coins then your fight wariothe original super mario land was a great game but it was strange
super mario land  while the setting is stranger sticks closer to the mario series splendid gameplay
along with the mario galaxy games however this game shows how far nintendo can be creative with the designsit turns out that wario distracted mario in the first game by sending alien tatanga to kidnap daisy
so hes the main bad guy whereas tatanga serves as a boss in the space world
space world
yup there are  different worlds and all of them have really weird settings
examples macro zone pits mario into a giant house
mario zone is actually a factory that on the outside is shaped like the plucky plumberalthough the settings are weird that actually allows nintendo to push the companys creativity to their furthest
i mean seriously mario is seen swimming in water that is attached to the ceiling
not to mention he can also run across giant lego blocks float in space and fight actual sharks
never would we have known that mario would be able to go outside the mushroom kingdom by this muchthis game is the super mario world of game boy games and thats saying a lot
the main gameplay is what you would normally expect
you can run jump stomp enemies bash blocks and spin jump your way through about  nicely detailed levels
the main powerups are as you expect the mushroom and the fire flower
yes thats right
the superball flower that was in the first game got replaced by the return of the fire flower
not only that but theres also the bunny hat which allows mario to float in the air for a short period of time similar to the super leaf in super mario bros  but here you can float longer than in mario the challenge is fair most of the time but the problem with it is that once you get a game over you lose a golden coin that you have been rewarded from one of the bosses you fight
so you must go back and fight the boss again
lets hope you dont die too many timesbut overall this is a really great game
if youre looking for a good mario game for your game boy color or advance order this game nowi think this is the best game ever for the old black and white game boy
the graphics are great for game boy there are seven different levels that you must complete to and get golden coins before entering warios castle and fighting him
there are also hidden levels
you can save your game
you can save up to three different games
if you have game boy color it interprets the black and white into some color pretty well
this is a great game if you see it for sale somewhere usedsuper mario land  is way better than its first one
in this quotretro reviewquot were going to look at what made this one of the best gb games of its time but too bad just a year later wed get quotthe legend of zelda links awakeningquotthe graphics were a major step above the first one and were actually stunning visuals for the gb
they look almost like a snazzy early snes gamegameplay actually very closely resembles super mario bros  and super mario world
youve got your power ups that unlike the first super mario land can actually tell you grabbed them
the flower power up and the bunny ears only seen in this one are nice
the bunny ears is like the leaf in smb
except that mario cant fly but they allow him to glide down to safetythe music is great for its time and even now it isnt bad
its been about  years since its release and the tunes still play out in my head at timesthe map is used in this one as well
except you cant go and challenge old bosses which kind of stinksthe story follows that mario has lost his castle to wario no saving princess daisy in this one and he can only get back into his castel using the six golden coins so he must set out to find them in one of the six different quotzonesquot  whats nice about this is that you arent forced to take the zones in any specific order at all
whats not to like about that
however if you get a game over you have to find all six coins againfor those whinning about no saving on super mario land you can finally stop your bitchin because this game incorporates an autosave feature
it works well but there are moments where the game will erase the data on its ownoverall this is still a worthwhile game even so many years later
grab this game if you can and see what happensyes this game is way old
it still hold us extremely well though
playing the old monochrome games on the sp causes them to almost upgrade
this game still looks great and control well
its just old school mario d goodness
the cool thing and reason i bout this is that it has enemies that mario faces that he doesnt face in any other game to date
its a great title to own to play or just collectsuper mario land was really great
you are mario and you search through worlds to try to find princess daisy
its a great game because i hate bowser and bowser isnt in this game
the only problem is no saving
ohwelli love pokeacutemon links awaking and super mario land  but this is my personal favorite original gameboy game
when it came out it blew peoples minds and it still does to me
people may have their opinions but this has to be on any gameboy system
but it has aged no save and no color are the big ones
it is weird mario game with no bowser peach or even luigi
there are only  worlds but theyre hard
everybody should at least try
me  for everyone great game
not a whole to say that web reviews havent already said
made me feel young again thats for surelove mario gameson august  when gameboy was released around the world mainly the us and japan nintendo decided that a new mario adventure to go with it would be a perfect match in heaven
they succeeded
this game has often been considered to be as odd as super mario brothers  was at the time but this one felt more like the original super mario brothers gameshere luigi is not required for this is marios solo adventure
in this game you are not in the mushroom kingdom or the dream world of subcon instead you are in a weird place called sarasaland where a new princess named daisy was kidnapped by an alien named tatanga
here in this game you do  levels in  worlds as you fight goombas koopas with bombs instead of shells chinese ghosts moai statue heads that attack and more bizarre stuffits a fresh and different mario adventure just like the last years super mario bros  game only more true to the original super mario bros formula of the first game
whats cool in this game you get a special flower that grants you a special ball that defeats enemies and collects coins for you theres also different enemies to fight such as killer sphinxes to giant seahorses as in  levels it can become a sidescroller where your in a sub or plane blasting enemies including bosses which makes this a worthwhile mario gamethe graphics are simplistic yet primitive and small for the gameboy but works well on super gameboy for the snes
if you can find this at a flea market pawnshop or online then youll be surprised on how well this holds up as i do believe the sequels are even bettermario is off to another adventure to save the great princess daisy first mario has to zoom through  action packed levels to find that the real princess daisy is in the th and last level of this game
mario rescues daisy and with a happy ending mario and daisy get back to the mushroom kingdomthis is a wonderful game probably my all time favorite game boy game this was the first game boy game i played i first tried it when i was  and then i beat it about  times when i was  and i am a teenager now and still love this game very much
i still play the game everyday and beat it very fast
when i was  i could complete the whole game in  minutes due to many shortcuts i found get the original game boy with super mario land and lay off the chocolate milk while buying a nintendo ds lite
all of the super mario land games the original tetris is so much better than a nintendo ds where the games are the size of your finger nail and cost  please agree with me on this one i still have a loaded wallet and bought  games the other day
i got this one for  at game stop because it was   and then i had my edge card so  and i got it for  if you want to save money please write this down when buying game boy gamestell them i have an edge card number could you please use it and then give them the number it is  off exp please use it because i have barely used it it just saves  it isnt money to me it cost  for a year and you get  magazine each month
please get this game
this is the best game you will have ever bought the fact it doesnt save just adds a big bar of replay value to this game it is the most replayable game i have ever played and that is out of a lot a few hundred games do yourselves a favor and lay back on the couch and enjoy marios first adventure on the game boythanksjr
plattpersonally i really like this game
released around the game boys very first launch super mario land assisted the game boy sales and super mario land also kept selling for at least  years thanks to the sales and loyal fans that are just as great as this game
i wont bash the graphics because what did you expect
p or d in game boy games back then
now the nintendo ds keeps super mario land alive via the virtual console for ds
the music is great and the gameplay is cool
if you have up to  minutes of free time play this game to keep you entertained
fun fact did you know that this game was originally intended to be bundled with the game boy
yes according to someone from a you tube video  a gentleman named hank rogers from bulletproof software said if you wanted to sell the game boy to kids pack in super mario land
if you want to sell it to everyone pack in tetrisi still remember that i bought this game along with the gameboy when they were released in  when i was still a teenager
it has everything a mario fan could expect
graphics are very similar to super mario bro
for the nes as well as the gameplay and no saving feature
in addition there are some new elements like divided road at the end of a stage and could ride an airplane in the sky or a submarine in the deep ocean
thats is why this game is one of my favorites of all timesuper mario land is a classic mario game and one of the first games for the thennew game boy
it features the great gameplay that hailed from super mario bros although few physics are a little bit off
the graphics and sounds were greatlydeveloped especially the musicsml is one of the few games that prove that even the game with the smallest length can succeed
theres only  levels not counting the harder quest yup
this game has a harder quest like in smbalso mario land may be fun and all but who knew it was so strangetheres no bowser peach or even the mushroom kingdom but instead you romp through egypt chasing an alien named tatanga who has captured daisy
and thats just the setting
ingame there are koopas with bombs for shells robots and when you go to world  it turns out that world takes place in japan as hinted by the music
the fire flower isnt even a fire flower
instead you get to shoot superballs which are rubber version of fireballs that can bounce off wallsdespite all that strangeness its pure mario action in the palm of your handalright i know there are those with the gripes cant save only  levels blah blah blah but this game is pretty old guys
this game was released in  and there werent very many games back then that you actually could save on
second there are only  levels and theyre extremely short
you can beat the game in simply  minutes
there should be no reason why anyone should have to save at all
its very easy to rack up several lives thanks to the bonus game that nintendo threw in as wellfor  and for the early years of the gameboy these graphics arent bad
while they look like something seen on a graphing calculator theyre not bad considering its agethe game isnt too hard but it isnt so easy either
the gameplay is similar to the original mario bros on the nes
except that you cant tell which power up youve got
that could be a problemthe game can be played by just about anyone
sure you cant save but youve got to remember the games age
saving wouldnt become a norm until the early s in the day and age of the snesso glad i picked this up
a little difficult but enjoyable all the same
i had the other two for years and never played this one reminds me of the first one but slightly differenti grew up with the nessuper nes and original game boy
getting to play this game again after all this time is great
i watched the cartoon and still enjoy the game todaydefinitely an improvement from the first one
youll enjoy this game as much as i have
i own this because i saw it at a retro game shot and i decided to buy it because ive always wanted to play ninja turtles on a game boywhich i also bought the same day which happens to be the original model a collectors item for sure
i now own all three tmnt games
highly recommended for any ninja turtles fani bought this for my game boy tmnt collection
i now have all three games
i bought this because of the nostalgia that goes with it because when i was a kid it was always a mystery to me how a ninja turtle game can be played on a game boy
yet i was stuck with the crappy lcd tiger electronics hand held version because it was cheaper for my father to buy
he was always a cheap skate
but now that im older i own this and im glad i do
it goes well with my original game boyremember the teenage mutant ninja turtles arcade game konami created
well it just so happened to lead to lots of other games in the series like the nes tmnt turtles in time tournament fighters etc
well around those times konami created a game boy tmnt game
at first i had no idea what the heck it would be like
would it be a platformer like the first nes game
and then it was releasedand blew us off with awesomismfall of the foot clan is a beat em up similar to the arcade games but with the look of a sidescroller
the action is much more atraightfoward and simpler compared to other games most enemies die in one hit but its also very wellpolished
the graphics and music are extremely appealing to the eyeear
in fact some tunes sound like they could be right at home on the sega genesis
konami really knew how to rock out that game boy sound chipthe game may be short as it has  stages and for some reason it has a stage select meaning you can just go to stage  to beat the game and it may have the turtles put on an awkward smile throughout the game but all in all fall of the foot clan is an epic classicrelatively speaking the game boy pocket is an extremely old handheld system
its outdated and quite ancient
however when i owned a game boy pocket actually i lost mine just a little over two weeks ago i had a great deal of amusement with it
why
simply because i felt that regardless of the lack of color or hightech gadgets that many systems had nowadays my trusty game boy pocket was still fun
in fact i hear the new nintendo ds has no game boy functionality  only a game boy advance port which i own not
thats another reason why i may not get that particular systemthe game boy pocket is small
its very small
yet this does not detract from the functionality
another plus is that this system has a contrast slider  unlike the nintendo ds and game boy advance you can alter the brightness or darkness of the screen  perfect for when youre trying to see something thats just too bright to see fans of the pokemon series will remember the fuchsia city gyms infamous invisible walls for example
the contrast slider and its black and white not green and white like that of the game boy screen alone warranted a buy for me back in the dayi admit that now many people believe the game boy pocket seems to be obsolete
thats absurd
those who wish to save money can get one and still have fun
those who wish to put in a bit more can have the game boy color which unfortunately i still do not own but realize the fun of
those who want to blow off if you will too much money  can get some expensive fancy systemif youre a parent though dont get your kids a game boy pocket
tantrums will explode all over the placei love my game boy pocket
it was the first system i ever owned
when someone stepped on and messed up my screen i was devastated
now i got another and its time for an amazing nostalgia trip
if you want a way to play gameboy games use this or maybe a gba sp
i love the size and the yellow one is the coolest
on a budget and want to discover how a whole generation became gamers
buy thissmall note the one i recieved didnt have the power light visible
ill have to swap out the screen plate but its a minor complaint and does not affect the review of the gameboy as a productthis gameboy pocket particular green most awesome color everwas the source of many great memories and likely led to me needing to get eye glasses
i still own this gem and from time to time its nice to turn it on and play some classic games and play some simple but fun black and white gamesmy favorite games were mortal combat the super mario series tetris pokemon red and blue castlevania only the most epic terrifying adventure of the timethere are still many games out there being sold so if youre looking to relive some nostalgia never had a chance to or just want to simple fun id recommend this gameboy  the most because it doesnt as much battery and is very slimi am not sure what makes the gameboy pocket so appealing
the blurry laughable graphics
the fact that a cellphone has better graphics
its superugly design
well i am not sure but the gameboy pocket has something about it
i will just say though that its really cool to play black and white space invaders and pokemon almost as much as playing gta on the go gba version only a goof would skip vcs or lcs or a stupid parenti cant  explain it but this was my first gameboy
while it may be severly outdated its the system that really helped the gameboy line last almost a decade alone without a new release well this was released im talking aout this and the original gameboy
with its affordable price of only fifty bucks it shows how nintendo is so damn good at making portable gaming systems
with that price along with the huge game library i cant help but think why sega even bothered
the nomad and game gear were fine but it showed that they should not have even triedanyway i still would pick it up its a classic
you may not be like me but this is somebody that picked up a fourty dollar game and watch gameclassic game that deserves a play through no matter how you get you hands on this game you need to play this game
if black and white gaming is not your thing nbuy the dx version which has added color yes brought to you in techno color heartsthis is the most challenging game i have ever played
i have had it for years now and i am not even half way through the game yet
its so hard but also so much fun to play
its a classicive beat the pokemon elite four countless times and caught  once
the legend of zelda links awakening is the next childhood game i am still trying to beat
i lost the game and so i bought it here on amazon
it keeps me busy searching for everything that i need to go from one dungeon to the nextfor most fans of the legend of zelda series there are two commonly disputed best zelda game ever titles a link to the past and ocarina of time
while i wont necessarily disagree with this you almost have to look at the portable zelda games in a different category
many of them are while officially licensed and every bit bonafide canon not made purely by nintendos inhouse development teams for those who find this as news most of the portable games have been developed by capcom
this is handsdown the best portable zelda game ever and my own personal second favorite with a link to the past coming first and ocarina of time coming thirdlinks awakening is the first in a long evergrowing line of portable zelda games and i have to say it really doesnt get better than this
there is just that perfect balance of action exploration puzzle solving and a dash of side quest that makes a zelda game feel right
where later portable zelda games fall short by forcing players into poorly executed minigames lengthy and confusing trade quests and generally disappointing level and boss designs links awakening serves up imaginative original bosses and some rehashes of bosses from previous games as well as dungeon levels ranging from short and simple to surprisingly complex yet still fun and manageable
and like any good zelda game the difficulty level is right in the ball park of being just challenging enough that you may die a few times but not so confusing as to make you throw the game aside while you frustratedly search a walkthrough for helpas is to be expected of a portable zelda game theres no actual zelda character involved and the triforce are nowhere to be seen but for some of us thats somewhat refreshing
your ultimate goal in the game is to collect several magical instruments a theme now found in many zelda games and solve the mystery of how link ended up on the mysterious koholint islandi like to consider links awakening the last true legend of zelda game since every zelda game after it has been either in full d or has been some capcom mess that just doesnt quite hit the nail on the head
if your favorite zelda games are the oracle pair minish cap majoras mask or the windwakerphantom hourglass games this may not be for you but for recent fans or longtime zelda fans looking for a return to the roots of the zelda series without being tied down to a console this is undoubtedly the best choicethe legend of zelda links awakening is arguably the best game offered on the original black and white gameboy no offense to metroid iinot many people realize that this game came out after the super nintendo zelda game a link to the past and there are times when you can see the modifications the developers made on the snes version to make it better in the gameboy version
the main example of this and one of the coolest features on zelda games at the time is the ability to jump in this game to get over obstacles and enemies
also the graphics to this game are wonderful compared to other gameboy games aroundin this adventure link awakens on a beach in a world hes never been before
the story doesnt quite go along with the previous three zelda games
you arent in hyrule gannon is not the enemy and zelda is not even in the game
but the game play is classic zelda and theres almost no better thing to do in a video game than play as link fighting enemies to save the dayps
the sidescrolling quotsuper marioquot tunnels are the funniest things nintendo decided to put in this gamei love all the zelda games so i am partial to giving perfect scores to this series
this was the first zelda game i had ever played and i was caught from the first time i turned it on and went down to the shore to get my sword and start my adventure into the world of zelda
the world is large with lots of fun areas to explore and a fun side quest that has you walking all over the world but wanting what was at the end
i made lots of notes and ended up making a guide for it
this is a timeless game that will endear you as wellold skool game
ive had it forever
no collection is complete without it
i may go play it here in a minute
actually no but it was a great game
i enjoyed it
still working on oracle of ages
too fun
zelda has lots of puzzles and mazesi loved this humorous game
link wakes up on a beach and has to get off of the island but to do that he has to collect  insturments to wake up the wind fish
a wierd plotline for a zelda game no ancient hyrule history lessons like in a link to the past this time
the game does not even take place in hyrule
even stranger link walks right past a chain chomp who eventully becomes links sidekick
the whole game got wierder and wierder
goombas crawled in the dungeons shy guys roamed in the dungeons and owls swooped down to tell you something that you already knew
nintendo had some funny references in the game including side scrolling mario levels link had to go through
i found the dungeons to be just right
my biggest admiration of a link to the past was the complex multilayer dungeons but i hated going through them
links awakening had slightly large dungeons that didnt make me flee to a walkthrough like the ones in a link to the past did
also each dungeon had a miniboss that worked as checkpoint when defeated
one of them put the top view to incredible use as link had to jump over a rolling pole the boss had kicked
for the gameboy the ai was incredible
the villagers did their own things some played ball others wrote letters and another took care of her pet chain chomp
the game was also very large i dont know how they fit it into a gamepak
while i admired a link to the pasts creative effects and complex ideas it was simply too difficult and large for me
links awakening has the perfect overworld size and difficulty for me
besides i enjoy the mario references and winning yoshi from a grab machinethis game is actionfilled and fun filled
simple to play yet you cant put the controller down
i loved this game
great disney game
check it outi didnt really mean the title
but i love this
i dont know if i have beat it but i do know that i got to the last level
you get to ride a carpet you get to jump on a giant blue cloud made from a genie
the first couple of levels are pretty easy
its suppose to be a kids game but i give the difficulty level a medium
the funniest part of this game is that when you jump on the back of a camel it spits just like in the movie
there are many places where you can earn extra lives and health
its got nice music and doesnt seem to repetitivethanksaladdin is one of the bestselling genesis games of all time
unlike most games that undeservedly sell ludicrous amounts of copied im looking at you call of duty aladdin actually deserves this distinction
its a definitive masterpiece of a platform game and everything included in its design was implemented to create one of the funnest games on the consolefirst things first and probably what youll initially notice when starting the game is that the visuals here are outstanding especially for the time and it still holds up surprisingly well today
aladdin the game not the character looks as though youre playing the movie on your console
it really is that good
the color palette is constantly unabashedly appealing the character sprites are large and much like the backgrounds extensively detailed and the enemies are all interesting and distinctive due to their aesthetic visual designs
the game looking as good as it does is in no small part to actual disney animators that worked on the film this is based on animating the ingame sprites
this is the very first game to use this style of animation and boy does it show
character movements are outstandingly fluid small background animations fare just as well and allinall this is truly one of the best looking genesis games you can get your hands on
vectorman
whos vectormannow the sheer beauty of the visuals wouldnt mean anything if there werent a solid game backing them up
thankfully there absolutely is
gameplaywise aladdin can be best described as a platformer
however it takes more than enough deviations from the established tropes of the genre to craft a memorable experience
instead of jumping on enemies to dispatch of them aladdin wields a sword to slice his enemies to bits ok its not that graphic
this is disney after all or throws apples at foes which he collects throughout the levels
personally i prefer the swordplay here
i mean who wouldnt
the apples definitely have their uses though and become absolutely indispensable for some of the boss fightsthe other main deviation the game takes from the platformer genre is in its level design
through the use of foreground and background objects aladdin can search behind or in front of these to discover ups health pickups gems which are used to buy more ups and continues or more apples
this works exceedingly well considering it adds depth not only to the visuals but to the actual level design and overarching gameplay
i consider this aspect much like many other aspects of aladdin absolutely revolutionary for its time
this was the very first genesis game i played and at the time i was so used to games that didnt have any visual depth to them that this idea of searching behind background objects absolutely blew my mind
like i said its still impressive to this day
i still think its absolutely revolutionarythe level design aside from the visuals and awesome swordplay is probably the best thing about this game
its hard to say as so much of this game comes off as pure bit gold
the levels here never overstay their welcome and the game moves at a brisk pace
generally levels can take  minutes to complete if youre rushing through them but thankfully youll have so much fun exploring these levels looking for that last up or partial health refill that you can extend this time
despite doing this the game never once feels as though its dragging on
the pace feels impressively natural to the gameplay and the levels and visuals that accompany them enforce this sentiment
youll be running around the streets of agrabah traversing the desert exploring dark dank dungeons escaping a lava avalanche lavalanche
just to name a few and these all feel appropriate from a game design perspective
traversing the dungeon feels more like a maze level with its branching paths and freedom of playerchoice and the escape from the lavalanche see
it works is exhilirating
its a sweaty hand controller squeezing heart racing experience and its easily the most exciting level in the game
the scrolling here is so fast the lava looks as though you can see the heat coming right off of it and allinall every level may not be as impressive as this one but theyre certainly close
i cant stress enough how amazing these stages arethe audio here is just as outstanding as any other aspect in this game
id go as far to say that this is one of the best sounding games on genesis
from the clear melodies full bass tones and nearperfect approximations of the music score this is easily one of the most memorable soundtracks in all of gaming
even the original songs stand out in the sense that they dont stand out
they feel right at home
you could have told me that these original tracks were taken straight from the film and then composed and converted to the genesis fm synth hardware and i would have absolutely believed you
they actually hold their own in comparison to disney songs
they truly are that great
the sound effects fare just as well
the voice samples are outstanding and even put some voice samples ive heard on the snes to shame which for the record honestly isnt as surprising as you would initially think
voice samples in genesis games can sound absolutely superior to snes games if placed in the right handsthe control is nice and responsive though the jumping physics may take a bit of time to get used to
from a standstill aladdin doesnt jump nearly as far as he would from running
its also worth noting that when changing your direction from left to right the screen will snap to adjust to aladdins direction
considering this is a dave perrydoug tennappel designed game these aspects are almost expected  for those that are used to games like earthworm jim its not a problem
however those that are expecting a game that controls like super mario world stop it and accept these controls for what they are
objectively speaking theres nothing wrong with them and they absolutely are tight
nothing here feels slippery at all and jumping though a shallow learning curve is there is absolutely spoton and feels great once you know how to do itbonus stages are also here
there are two main bonus levels one being a small slot machine type game you play to earn extra lives apples gems and the like and the other are stages where you get to play as abu aladdins pet monkey
the great thing about the abu stages is that theyre based on precise character placement jumping sword slashing yes even the cute monkey has a sword  awesome
 and collecting various items
these stages work well in the sense that they enforce how tight the control really is in this game and the animation on abu much like every single character in the game is seriously astounding
for my money this is one of the single best animated games of its generation coming in at a close third to earthworm jim   i sincerely cant stress enough how enthralling this game is to play as well as to look at
it really is beautiful from a visual aesthetic and technical design standpoint and there really arent too many games that matched its level of overall quality
this game is an alltime classic with good reason
its one of the best games from its generation it has that just right difficulty that many of its peers seem to be missing and overall youd be doing yourself a disservice by passing it up
its relatively cheap and considering the quality of this game its an absolute steal
buy this game right now
theres no way youll be disappointed with itthis game came in great condition
i really enjoyed playing it bringing back great memories
i recently beat this game and would recommend this game to playersive had this game for many years and it doesnt get old
the graphics are great on the genesis and there is a load of different environments to fight in
there is even a level where you fly above the city in attack hang gliders
i would definitely pick up this game if your a batman fan or love the old genesis games a must have for any serious gamera lot of people hate this game
mainly because it was just another mortal kombat with a batman license slapped on it
but whats the harm in that
i can see why after batman on nes and batman returns on snes they were trying to go for something new other than just making it a plain old sidescroller gamethe graphics are very very good for a genesis game
the actors are very detailed and stylized and the backgrounds are dark and gloomy just like the movies
its true that the grapple and moving between upper and lower levels can be frustrating at first but once you figure the controls out its no problemyou can play as either batman or robin in single player mode or coopwhich is a lot funner and you have a wide array of gadgets to choose from
its difficult at first but if you play around with different button combinations youll discover how to use these gadgets
one thing that sucks is there is no saving feature and no continues
but it makes the game more challenging and besides there are plenty of opportunities to find hidden lives along the wayits very entertaining for a fighting game
even though it does feel cheap at times
like when some of the enemies special moves take half your health down
or when your on the bank safe flying through the air on the second level and you get thrown or knocked off  or  times
and there are a few combospecial moves
like in batman returns on snes if you are between two enemies and press the right buttons you can bash two guys heads together
or you can also grab enemies and either kick or throw them which does come in handy on certain levels
and ill admit when i first played this game as a kid i didnt like it either because it was difficult
but its one of those games where you have to learn as you go and get better each time you tryalso it is much better than the super nintendo version because you dont have to sit through those god awful hold on  second loading screens every time you walk through a door
even though the game gets cheap and annoying sometimes its not that bad in my opinion
especially if you can get it for  cent on amazon minus the shipping or  at a vintage stock what have you got to lose
so if your looking for some old games to try for genesis you should definitely pick this one upthis game should be a classic
it was wrote and released rather late in the genesis life and if i recall its a port from a pc game
or is the pc a port from thoh nevermind
this is an inneractive comic book alright
for its time it has a nice story line and if graphics are your thing theyre good too
fight your way through an evil comic book and escape using kung fu and your electricallycharged rat named road killto me this is one of the best beat em up games of all time not to mention you can get it for a pretty cheap price
the whole comic book theme is very fun to go through with different panels and pages
they even have those dialogue bubbles when they talk and sometimes the evil guy draws the enemies you have to defeat
people actually think this game is repetitiveare you kidding me
there are so many different enemies that i never got bored playing it
i havent played too many of these sidescrolling more like paneljumping punch kick games but i had a very good time playing this one
if you have a genesis just go out and get it
if you dont get a genesis for maybe  because there is an abundance of good title on the genesis and get this game along with all of the sonic the hedgehog ones
theres only one bad thing about this game and i dont think this one thing should stop you from getting this awesome game
it is just very challenging and i mean its challenging
sometimes its a fun challenge other times youll feel like never playing the game again
this only means the levels take a while to master and i think they should have made the health gauge a tad bit longer
you only get one health gauge and it is very hard to keep it up most of the time
other than that this game is very fun and you dont have to be willing to sit through it to play ityou only have to be willing to have fun
i think this should have been named a classic because its almost as good as street fighter  the genesis versionbut maybe it wasnt named a classic because it wasnt too well recognized
get it play it enjoy itcomix zone is a fighting game where you are a comic book artist and you get pulled into your comic book i didnt get to play it on the genesis but i played it on the psp and the xbox  i wish they would bring a collection of sega genesis games out on the ps vita but if your into comics and beat
em ups then look no further this games for youmany moviebased games franklyare horrible
theyre churned out by companies looking to make the dead line of the release of the movie or shortly before
this game however features nice character design and movement
stunning backgrounds and hours of fun game play
gotta luv itthe sega genesis the lion king is one of the best d platforms available on the console
using the full capabilities of the system it features massive levels and intelligent ai
this game is not as simple as one may think
some levels and i mean the first only you can run through
after that the enemies and obstacles can be a great danger
if you happen to run out of continues you must start from the beginning of the game
dont worry you have many chances in game to get more single lives and even whole continues that in easy mode   lives
if that isnt enough this game does support a cheat menu for invincibility and level select
however the cheat menu is hidden and you have to enter a simple combo at the menu to unlock it
this game is an amazing feat of the genesis era supporting stereo audio and separate music for each level all packed into a small cartridge
this is a great gamemissed this so much i love it because it is based on the real story
not only that it is fun to play just for hours on end
recommend this to anyone who likes segai like the colors in this game
i feel like a free person
i get to play and run like a little cub
way to gothis game was one of the best games ever made for the genesis not to mention one of the greatest games ever created
this game has really cool level designs and the missions are awesome to play through
joe musashi has a number of attacks and platforming moves up his sleeves which makes the action all the more sweeter
you never know what he might be doing next on another level like the level in which he battles ninjas via surfboard
if you liked ninja gaiden youll probably love this amazing retro ninja classic
the graphics are nice and crisp the enemies are pretty cool the gameplay is still awesome the character designs and level designs are awesome and it is an experience unlike anything else youve played
the only problem is the game at times feels too easy but thats never a problem during this wild adventureyeah more genesis reviews well i liked the  bit era this time ill review shinobi  this was the true sequel to the revenge of shinobi   follows up from shadow dancer  story is joe musashi has returned to japan after defeating union lizard joe hears rumours of neo zeed returning basically an excuse to whoop some 
zeeds new weapon is a clone from joes blood line
you need to kill zeed  destroy the clone
the game has difficulty  great game play which has a horse back level  a surfing level
shinobi  was considered a high point in the series
yes i know this game was delayed a lot but it really showed  that the sega of tom kalinskie took time to get it right if they wanted the publics money to give us the best game possible unlike the sega of simon jeffery that thinks they can sell a sonic or shinobi game thats t and theyll have instant credibilityand maybe the best ninja game ever
shinobi  is by far the best of the shinobi series on the sega genesis
both the original revenge of the shinobi and shadow dancer secret of the shinobi is another good game but this one is by far the best
the story line is a little cliche and the plot does seem a bit regurgitated but lets move on to the important stuffthe gameplay is by far the biggest stand out
shinobi can do just about anything a realistic human warrior can do besides summon dragon spirits for fire and using his body like a human bomb and shield himself with lightning
joe mousashi can do air somersaults and climb across ledges has a wide variety of melee attacks that include different dashing and jumping attacks
what also sets this game apart to is it makes use of a hook element like in strider and also you can block your opponents attacks as wellthe levels are very long and graphics are colorful
what also makes this game what it is was the excellent music that accompany you through the various levels
i would recommend this game to anybody
one of the top  or even  i would say for the genesisone of the best retro games ever
very polished and funshinobi
also check out shinobi on xbox live arcadelong story short buy it its highly addicting the soundtrack is amazing and its so simple too who wouldnt want this
sonic the hedgehog for the win
ftwsonics glory may have disintegrated in the wake of his crappy d games the would follow in later years but his sega genesis adventures are still among gamings most classic memories
aside from trying to stop dr eggman there isnt much story to be located in here
its all about speed running through obstacles and to defeat enemies in this surprisingly challenging game
the biggest flaw of the game is the camera
the camera sometimes cant seem to catch up to you when you run at incredibly fast speeds which unfortunately will cause some cheap deaths
other than that this game is awesome and is something any gamer should own because its still a classic
if you own a genesis you better have this gamefans of the first game must buy the sequel
its a must have for any platformer fanthis is the game i played when i was  and growing on up
i still cant defeat the nd to last stages boss on that big airplaneanyway i totally love this game
i dont even know how many times i replayed itnow you have tails on your side to combat that evil dr robotnic
this game has better graphics a new feature the chargeup spin multiplayer and fun levels
a great addition to any genesis librarythis game is off the chain great music diverse levels cool ending the best cheat code ever its to bad they dont make games like this anymore its a must have for a game collector or even a casual gamermy favorite genesis game of all time
arrived on time in decent condition no case or instructional manual but its sonic you go fast
youve done this beforebrings back memories and fun i used to have when i sat next to my brother and played this as a kidas fun as it was when i was a kid and still isthis game is one of my favorite classic games and i was thrilled to find a copy
now i can enjoy the nostalgia all over againi got sonic the hedgehog  back in the day around the early sactually its my first video game to playthis game is so fun and easy to playi always thought sonic games have the best musicits so addictivethe levels are really fun and have different creative enemiesone thing about this game i didnt like is the bossdrrobotnick at the end is hardthe reason it was so hard is that i forgot how to beat himand he was harder than the first gamethings in sonic  that improvedsonic has a spin movehe didnt have it in the first gamethe levels are shortertwo levels instead of three levelsits too long with three levelslives are easier to getive got seven lives on the first levelthe bonus levels are more fun than the first gametails is in the game and and you can play him with second controllerthe enemies are better and more creativei would recommend this game if you like platform games and have a sega genesisif you dont already own itthis game is alot better than the first onebut the first one is really good tooother games that i recommend are sonic and knuckles and sonic the first sonic game blew me away when i was a little kid and when sonic  came out i was first in line to get my hands on the new copyi was not dissapointed by any stretch of the imagination
this game takes what was great about the first one and built on that greatness of that first game and the result is what i consider the best video game of its time
i have such fond memories of playing this video gaem that i sometimes cry for the day when this game is back in my house to play again as its so wonderful and fun to playthe music on this one is another winning video game soundtrack and i can easily remember the music on some of the various video game levels
my favorite of the music was the casino night zone levels with its funky and electric groove beats and colorful melody
that level remains my favorite of the various levels on all of the sonic games
i espeically like how they used pinball flippers to where you can be launched into a slot machine where you can get bonus prizes like rings an extra life or on the negative end you can lose  rings if you get three robotnik symbols from the slot machinethis game does the job of continuing the greatness of the first one and building on ita great gaem that is sorely missed these days where video games have declined into gross gorefestsbefore i get on with the review i have to share some nostalgia with you
i believe my first encounter with sonic the hedgehog  was at the nearest walmart back in the late summerearly fall of  and i remember seeing the game on display in the videogame section and i played the emerald hill zone and i couldnt wait for the game to come out
fast forward several months later and its christmas day and i got sonic   i spent most of the day playing this and even back then i felt it was better than the first game which is still a classic
over the years ive given some deeper thought about which of the classic sonic games is the best i think sonic  is the best of all because it retains a good challenge and fixes the flaws in sonic storyafter defeating dr robotnik in the last game robotnik gets back to work with his usual scheme of taking over the world
like in the last game hes captured a bunch of animals and is turning them into malicious robots and is building a devastation space weapon called the death egg
you take control of sonic again to thwart robotniks plans and this time a twotailed fox by the name of miles tails prower tags along and helps yougameplay improvementsif youre familiar with the way sonic  plays then you know how to complete  of the controls in this game
however they added a critical improvement in sonic  which is the spindash attack
all you do is crouch down holding the bottom dpad and hit the jump button to start spinning and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash
with the spindash you can also plow into most badniks and theyll get destroyedall the power ups like the ring monitor invincibility monitor shield monitor and extra life monitor are in this game
the rules about collecting rings in sonic  carry over into sonic also theres a point in getting points this time around
at the end of each act if you get  points in that act youll get a continue
whenever your cumulative score hits  and numbers with a divisor of  such as  and  you get an extra lifetheres also a point to getting chaos emeralds
if you collect all the chaos emeralds now its seven emeralds instead of six and get  rings you turn into super sonic
super sonic is a yellow juggernaut
other than drowning bottomless pits and getting crushed nothing can hurt super sonic as hes not only invincible but he can run extremely fast and jump over really long distances
the only drawback to super sonic is that your ring count gets deducted at one ring per second and once you run out of rings you turn back into regular sonicthe special stage is different from that in sonic   instead of collecting  rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act you collect  rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post
you also race through a halfpipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint
when you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings you get a chaos emerald
these special stages are significantly more difficult than the ones in sonic  because aside from needed to collect the required rings you have to dodge a bunch of bombs and these can be hard to dodge
it also doesnt help that usually tails will get hit by bombs making you loose some of your ringsyou also have the option to switch between sonic  tails sonic solo and tails solo when playing the oneplayer modeplayer modetheres also a player mode for this game
basically its a splitscreen racing game where you and a second player choose as sonic or tails and race each other until the end of the acts
the acts to choose from in the player mode are emerald hill casino night mystic cave and the special stagegraphicswhile the graphics in sonic  are impressive sonic  manages to improve upon this area as well
theres better color arrangements to improve visual depth on the levels and backgrounds
the finest example of this would be the casino night zone
the background in that level is absolutely beautiful and colorful and makes you feel like youre in a sanitized version of las vegas
the industrial themed levels like the chemical plant oil ocean metropolis and death egg zones have improved from industrialthemed levels in sonic  as well
the architecture and atmospheres in these levels are much more seriouslooking than in sonic  and particularly with the chemical plant and death egg zones i think they perfectly exemplify the way a hightech industrial setting should look likesoundsoundtrackall the sound effects from the first game are carried over into this one so i cant really say much more than what i already said in my sonic  reviewthe soundtrack is even better than that in the first game and masato nakamura returns to create music in this game as well
aside from having more levels and therefore more music tracks a good deal of the music on here is better than in the first game which still has great music
standout tracks on here are for chemical plant aquatic ruin casino night mystic cave metropolis sky chase wing fortress and death egg though for death egg you only hear about four seconds of the music since you immediately go into one of the last boss battles
death egg is the perfect music to hear when youre in a hightech spacecraft
mystic cave is worth mentioning because the opening melody is really reminiscent of the inspector gadget theme and that the music itself is pretty creepy
casino night and sky chase have really relaxed upbeat feelings to themthe player levels even have their own versions of the music
the player version of casino night has a peppier beat to it and reminds me a bit of the last resort club music featured in total recall
i personally think the player version of the emerald hill zone sounds better than the single player versiontheres also a track called hidden palace for an unreleased level of the same name in the game
despite not being in any levels i think this is one of the most elegant videogame tunes ive ever heardminor complaintsmy only real complaint with this game is that in the special stage tails can make it more difficult for the fact that hes prone to getting hit by bombs so you have to be extra careful with how you play in the stagesfinal wordof all the classic sonic games and with the entire sonic game library this one is the best
like sonic  its been reissued countless times and is available with other sonic games like sonics ultimate genesis collection xbox  ps and available as individual game downloads on steamthis game is nearly  yearsold and i still think its totally awesomesonic  for sega genesis is indeed a classic
a game boy advance rerelease would be great
i hope to see one that isnt as screwed up as the sonic  gba rerelase is
on sonic  for gba the spindash move as introduced in this game can now be done and you can also save your progress
but what the gba rerelease on sonic  doesnt tell you is that the game moves very slowly and sonic jumps higher and runs faster
if sonic  does get a gba rerelease i hope it doesnt go as slowly as sonic  on gba does
the only modifications that would be great for a sonic  gba rerelease would be  knuckles  save  a flying tails as introduced in sonic 
anyways sonic the hedgehog  is a classic game and i would love to see it rereleased in more than just plug n play gamesthis was the best selling genesis game
man i really do miss the genesis
i mean for all the high tech superpowered consoles we have today such as the gamecube and ps the genesis had such a simplecharm
the games had great graphics and awesome playability
something you dont get together a lot these daysi remember xmas in  when i was  walking around a snowy edinburgh and seeing this game displayed proudly in all the toygame shops
i really wanted it i thot it was the coolest thing
then on xmas morning i finally managed to get a genesis i got this game with it too and xmas couldnt have been cooler
the music the graphics the highlyimaginative levels and sonics waypastcool pal tails made this game truly great
there was some controversy at the time that the d graphics on the special stage caused epileptic fits but i never got any more than a headachegames like this are what made the genesis indisposable
if you still have onehold onto it dont sell it like i didbetter than the first one
plus tales is in this one and a  player gamehere are condesne speed run static doctor robotnotic total boss endurane is  precent for the firt three fights the player had invulerability shield on for the first fight
total boss damage resintance include metal sonic all the robontic robnotic and the laser cannon is about  percent more or less depending on what attack patterns you use if you know the weak spots when the proper time to attack is
for the final fight boss hit the robot on its button the jump and aim for the vchest and neck area for the second half do this correctly you should not take any damage even though he is swat and punching at you during the battlethis game is so much fun
there are so many levels and they are all different
after  levels you have to fight the boss dr robatnik
the levels have there own unique enemy animals and bugs all of which are killed by different methods
you can power up and zip across the levels as you roll at lightning speeds
there are bumpers and loopdeloops scattered all across the levels
this is a definite buy for owners of genesis
it is worth the 
you must buyi always liked sonic  and sonic  but i just enjoy  the most
i love the bonus rounds and the music from this game can be stuck in my head for weeks
when i was rebuilding my videogame collection this was on the top of the list to repurchasethis game is amazing
its graphics exceed even the great super mario world
its speed is just scary
and the gameplay
well the story is a bit weak but thats the only thing wrong with this game
the levels goemerald hillsa great starting levelchemical plantit is a little hard but its still goodaquatic ruinsa good rd level but the scenery is wierdcasino nightsthis level set the standard for fun levels in sonic games to come
but the boss is quite hardhill topsa good level with good inovationmystic cavesan inovative level but easy to get stuckoil ocean refinerythis is a good level but its also a mazemetropilis citya massive  act level which makes up for the folling  act zonesthe sky chasea new style of gameplay is introduced in this stage controlling sonic and the tornado at the same timewinged fortressan epic chase in the sky
you play sonic running through an airship
and at the end you leave earththe death egg zonealthough a blatant copy of darth vadars death star this is a cool last leveld half pipe stagewow
the best bonus level on any game ever
at firstimpossible
but youll get the hang of itwood zonecut out the final version of the game but its on sonic  betagenocide citythis is on sonic  beta but totally unplayable
they put it on sonic  and renamed it launch basehidden palacethis is another sonic  beta level but the most interesting sonic stage eververdictalthough stuff is coppied from dragonball z and starwars this is very inovativepossibly the best sonic game ever made
excellent gameplay colorful graphics and a long and really cool collection of zones to rip shred and loopdeloop throughthe story line is very simple and the plot is also similar to some of the other games but the massive colorful worlds intriguing obstacles and fast action make this a game for anybody of any age group
ive seen  year old people play and love it and people who picked up a game controller for the first time in their lives loved it
this game is gonna be  years old soon and it still rocks
this game also proves how genesis is just a timeless systemi just found my old megadrive and this game and played on it i realized how good it was and how fun to play it is
i remember when i was  and played on this and still i enjoy it
it is a challenging game and even now i cant get past the second level easy i keep drowning i used a cheat to play on the other levels and they are as hard
the only level i dont like is special stage cause i hate the d graphics for it
the levels all are challenging except for the first one the only ones i completed are casino emerald hill and hill top the others are harder
the bosses are generally easy depending on where you are
the last boss i extremely hard and another thing is you dont have any rings to protect you
overall this is a classic game which most people should enjoysonic the hedgehog  is the sequel the the first sonic the hedgehog game it was better than the first game which is still a classic
it fixes the flaws in sonic the hedgehog plotafter defeating dr robotnik in the last game robotnik gets back to work with his usual scheme of taking over the world

the second genesis sonic gameonce sega established themselves as a worthy contender of the bit era with the original sonic the hedgehog they knew their newly successful mascot shouldnt be relegated to a onegamewonder status so they set out to follow it up with a sequel in order to keep the publics attention on them
although sonic was the true origin of the bit wars between the giants sega and nintendo this time sega had a much greater challenge ahead of them
by  the big n had just released their new snes system along with a slew of outstanding games
therefore sega had to react fast
sonic fast
they had to figure out how to draw people back to the ring collecting speed shoes chaos emeralds and blue hedgehogs in a time when people were absorbed with yoshis simon belmonts fzeros and street fighters
sega started work first on what would later become sonic cd for the sega cd but put it away briefly and made some other graphical upgrades to have a game ready for  what resulted is sonic  did it live up to the original or did the game fall under the inferior sequel curse
im sure you already know my answerthis my friends is a true classic
sonic  not only puts to rest any worries one wouldve had with a sonic sequel but it improved greatly upon the original game as well
id have to say that this is probably the single best and most welldesigned sonic game ever made although sonic cd is still my personal favorite and hooking sonic  and sonic  knuckles together truly makes the best sonic game
sonic  had awesome level structures cool music and fun gameplay but its sequel takes those aspects to the next level of greatness
in addition to whats already established this game adds great things like the speed dash tailsmiles the fox chemical plants  player competition modes the th chaos emerald the death egg ship corkscrew tunnels oil oceans speedy bonus stages coconut throwing monkeys the starpost and super sonic
take a look at all the stuff that makes this game great and the very few small quibbles that it falls shortprosexcellent level designs
sonics main gimmick was that hes fast right
well sega wisely chose to center the level structures this time around his speedy characteristics and as a result the levels are extremely fun to go through
theres still plenty of platforming action amidst the flurry of speed so the challenge is ever present
the zones are extremely varied as well so youll never get bored with the levelsenter tails the fox
joining sonics then latest adventure is this small orange fox who sports  tails allowing him to fly
in single player mode he accompanies you in collecting rings and rescuing you from the clutches of robots
another person can control him as wellawesome  player mode
this mode is really fun because it pits two people against each other going through one of  zones from the game
theres some cool powerups that make things extra difficult for the other playerthe music soundtrack here is some of the best in videogame music
seriously
this ranks up there with mega man  gradius    castlevania   sotn and turrican as far as jawdropping video game music goes
not a single one of these tunes is bad and all are very catchy probably some of the best that youll find on the genesis
my favorites have to be the chemical plant aquatic ruin player mystic cave and metropolis tunesmuch better special stages
this time around youre put in a dish tunnel in which you have to collect a certain amount of rings and avoid the spike traps
its still very challenging like the first games stages are but thankfully it eliminates the frustration by offering you a lot more chances to tackle them throughout the gameeven better assortment of enemies this time
there are a lot of cool enemies youll face like the aformentioned monkeys with coconuts armored crabs lava dragons claw mantis and the extendable catepillarbefore i forget the speed dash is a much welcome addition
this aids in the speedy level design because now you have a new way to  take off turbocharged from a standstillsuper sonic
okay so even if this idea is somewhat ripped off from the super saiyan of dragon ball z its still awesome to be able to transform into this fiery yellow superfast invincible flying blur once youve obtained all the chaos emeraldsconsdespite being able to control tails in the single player mode its not nearly as much fun for the second player because they cant really help out much
whats worse is that you cant make tails fly and lift sonic to higher places yet wait til sonic while the zones are a lot of fun to play through and there are a lot of them it comes with the price of there being only  acts to complete per zone instead of  except for metropolis zone
some stages later on are only a single act longsome of the bosses are far too easy
its true
unlike the first games bosses in which some were fairly easy many of dr robotniks latest contraptions can be taken out in a pathetic matter of secondsthats all the minor complaints i can think of
everything else about this game rules
it goes without saying that sonic  is a surefire classic and most every sonic fan already owns this one
it makes as a great introduction for new fans and it never gets old even though it technically is an oldschool game
whether you decide to hunt down the genesis version or would rather have it through the sonic mega collection buy it nowthe sonic titles for the sega genesis were some of the best in the entire franchise and this game certainly is no exception
one thing i really liked about this game was bonus levels you could unlock after getting  rings
winning these bonus levels and getting the chaos emeralds was so worth it because of what you could do once you got all of them become super sonici actually liked this game better playing as knuckles
for one i got to keep my rings after playing the bonus levels and knuckles gliding ability added an awesome new dimension to the game
my favorite level out of all of them had to be the casino level handsdown
i loved playing the slot machines and getting as many rings as i could making for more points and longer tenures as super sonic or hyper knuckles
overall all the levels within this game are fun and diverse with plenty to please the eyeof all the sonic gamesthis is the one that will always be my favoritewhile this one kept the elements of sonic the hedgehogit also improved on itof courseit also introduced everyones favorite flying foxmiles prower aka tailsthe story is fundrrobotnik is kidnapping animals againwhile on a search for the chaos emeralds so he can activate his ultimate weaponthe death eggsonic is on a quest to stop himaccompanied by his new friend tailsthe zones are bigmy definate favorite is metropolis zonethe music is greatdefinately better than the first sonic gamethe best new addition is the spin dashyou should definately get this game for your genesisyou will love itobviously highly anticipated second sth game that is revered as the best sonic game ever but thats up for you to decide between all the others that follow
introduces you to a seventh chaos emerald along with the ability to become super sonic and a new playable character tails miles prower miles per hour hahaha
robotniks at it again and its up to sonic and his buddy tails or not depending if you play without tails or as him have to stop him by collecting all the chaos emeralds and stopping robotnik from completing his ultimate weapon the death egg
travel through new stages and special stages in the second installment in the sonic series which are sure to give you a run for your money
again to own a genesis is to own all the sonic gamesthis is one of the greatest video games ever and there are only a handful of those
it has to be the first video game i ever played and also the video game i played for the longest time
it kept me entertained for years no other video game i had lived up to my expectations as this game did other than road rash  super mario bros and sonic  and knuckles
like sonic  isnt cool enough already theres also player
and player mode isnt just a small addition eitherits just as fun as single player
sure there are only four small stages for player but those four stages pack a real fun punch
the new special stages are also funner than the special stages in sonic s prequel
although tails cant exactly use his ability of flight its still pretty fun if you play with a friend because tails can really help sonic
he can make the boss fights easier he can kill badniks before sonic can devastatingly crash into them and he can also collect those rings that sonic doesnt want to get because he doesnt want to destroy his ring total
this game is purely amazing and i think its more of a classic than the first in the series the one and only sonic the hedgehog
out of all of the sonic characters out there tails and knuckles had to have the most awesome debuts
i actually still play this game from time to timeit just never gets old
sometimes i dont even have words to describe how fun it really isthe good fast paced d action great level design amazing musicthe bad tails is annoying not so hot multiplayer can be very difficult at timeswow this game brought back so many memories after beating it on sega genesis collection
i remember this came with my genesis when i was just the ripe age of  of course that was the first year i started gaming and this game just brings back many memories
the best part about this game is the level design themes and music
its so wonderful and unique
the addition of the bonus stages was great
the only problems were the addition of tails which was completely pointless all he did was get in the way
the biggest problem is that the game is so incredibly difficult its almost impossible to play thought this completely without some type of save feature
if you play this on the gensis then good luck because youll never make it to the end
this game just gets to extremely frustrating near the end
its great non the less though so play it nowif you enjoyed the first sonic youll get a major kick out of its sequel
while we all know we get to play as sonic theres a new kid in town and he helps sonic in his second outing
tails is supposed to be sonics sidekick
characters aside lets talk about the gameplay
the gameplay is identical to sonic s but with several differences going on ingame
the spin dash move is introduced
 full zones with  act ones
tails
different special stagesthe special stages are entirely different from the first game
now you must run through a halfpipe collecting rings to get chaos emeralds
however this is easier said than done
the sound and music are once again excellent
the graphics are also great as they are an improvement of sonic swhats really great about this game is the multiplayer mode
while you do have to compete against the other player in finishing the levels first or getting higher scores you guys also have to beat those  multiplayer zones altogetheroverall the game is awesome and challenging
this is the sonic game all fans should getupdate i found out a really cool easter egg
in player mode someone can actually control tails as the second player
this is pretty much the closest thing to a player coop mode
although sonic still hogs the camera your friend can help collect rings defeat the bosses get rings in special stages and heshe can just plain goof off
after all tails is invincible so he wont lose rings or lives for sonicsonic  has some of the best levels bosses and soundtracks ive ever playedemerald hill  okay it is a green hill zone remake
i still prefer green hill zone or angel island to this level but it is a good design
the theme was rather weak and the fight with eggman was the funniest moment of my life
he swoops down and gets in a bulldozer and tries to run over sonic
it only took  seconds for the tires to pop off while eggman tried to retreat
i guess emerald hill was okay but ive seen betterchemical plant  sonic had a ton of speed in chemical plant
if this were a mario level you would never complete it in time
the level is so massive but sonic made it look like a trip to the local market
the theme is one of the most catchy things ever produced as well but the boss was a another lol moment
eggman spends half an hour filling up a tiny bucket with chemicals and then tries to dump it on sonic
poor eggmans eggpod exploded before he could even finish filling up the bucketaquatic ruins  aquatic ruins was the first bad zone in sonic  i never said that every zone was great
the main issue with auqatic ruins was its distorting and glitchy layers
plants blocked my view the scrolling was funky and i could never really tell what i was doing
the boss ended up being better then the other two but eggman was a little too difficultcasino night  the colorful graphics giant slot machines and jazzy theme really gave casino night a lot of charm
even eggman decorated his eggpod with a ton of flashing lights
casino night is definetly one of my top  favorite zones in sonichill top  hill top did not impress me very much
it felt like a remade marble zone and that feeling was only heightened when the eggman fight was the same thing as the marble zonemystic cave  this level focused more on puzzle then speed
unlocking rock doors got really frustrating
ive seen sega have better ideas then a cave but it was not that badoil ocean  the first sonic level with a sadder tone to it
every other zone was boosting with peppy music and bright colors even in a chemical factory
oil ocean had a orange background that showed a shaky sun
the entire levels bottom part was covered in oil
oil ocean is one of my favorites because of the sadder pace thoughmetropolis zone  i hate this zone so much
its dumb factory theme dosent fit its name the musical score is out of tune and it is extremly difficult and if that was not enough sega made it  acts instead of 
all of my friends agreed with me metropolis zone is awfulsky chase  many people did not like this zone
i thought it was a nice change of pace though
sonic gets in his airplane and chases eggmans flying fortress
that was pretty much it
i liked itwing fortress  eggmans base is a unique level
the theme was a very peppy bugel theme and the design of the level was very good
after wing fortress it came time for the final leveldeath egg   not so much a level as it was an area for the final boss
the death egg in sonic  and knuckles was really amazing full zone but the sonic  death egg only had  bosses
metal sonic looked strange and no rings made it hard
the final boss was another lol moment but not because it was too easy
eggman built a huge overweight eggman robot that looked just like him
one of the reasons eggman is my favorite video game villan is because of his ego
after defeating eggmans eggman robo the ending plays
a beautiful d ending that was really worth the playthrough
the end
sonic  is awesome
no genesis will ever be complete without sonic probably the most known genesis game of all time as well as possibly being the most known sonic game of all time sonic  is well deserving
this was actually the only game i owned for years when i was little and it kept me busy
i still play it quite alot
my genesis is still working but i also have it on sonic mega collection which is how youd play this game if your genesis doesnt work
sonic  is probably the best classic sonic game i just wish tails could fly here and is pretty much what defined that series in the first place high speed action and frantic gameplay requireing good reflexes
you can either play as sonic or tails or you can play as sonic and have tails follow you around and mimic your moves which can come in handy in bosses
its much more effective however if you have a friend control tails with a second controller
the fustrating thing about that is that the screen still scrolls with sonic the player controlling tails will often get left behind and not reapear for a few moments
it also has a decent  player mode
this game is just about right challenge wise and is great for any age
and in my opinion tottaly beats any classic mario game hands down
terrific classic game an absolute must have if youre a sonic fani gave this game  stars
why
im partial to the guy in the spider suit
i find meaningless dribble that just take up time such as side scrolling bashnbeat games the punisher streets of rage ect fun at times
this game teams you up with spiderman and venom
both characters have the same talents but its fun to play a bad guy for once
its a good waste of time
reallyi liked this game i alot reminds me of a side scrolling beat em up double dragon game there were some scenes in new york that looked pretty good like fighting bad guys in the crown section at the statue of liberty you get to choose to play as spiderman or venom  depending on which one you select thats the route level your going to play   there are cameos of marvel characters like black cat  others that make an apperance you can use there special attacks to defeat enemiesspiderman maximum carnage is a very fun game to play
i love this game i am a huge spidey fan
i was looking for the super nintendo version of this game thats because thats what i have
but these guys dont have it on thier list so im accualy reviewing the super nintendo version of the game and it rules
i have not played the sega one yet but i will
have fun playing both versions of the gameif you liked this game check out all the cool spidey stuff out therethe game was fun to play again
it a game that people that like the movie should get to play on the segathis not a bad game its not perfect becuse of the driving levels but it has  levels which all do a good job of following the film the controls are good but not great st level your at the bar then you have to drive to john  sarahs old house get an id drive to the galleria to get john drive to the mentel institute to get sarah drive to enriques compound to get explosives and the routary cannon ect ect ect of course you know how the rest goes
its not a bad game if you play it properly im amazed how many people run around like retards and dont even go into the bar during the st level
this aint a masterpiece but god d its not a bad game like action  awesome possum sword of sodan shaq fu xperts or the nes version of t even though the nes version had better music and that was an  bit systembecuse in t on nes you basically got clobbered by a bunch of drunk wife beaters in level  as a terminator fan this game was done very well but its no masterpiece either so its all about preferancewhat can i say this game was awsome before and it still is
me and my brother have so much fun playing itthe first xmen game is a classic but i also say the same for the clone wars video gamethe levels are even more complex than those on the first one and the music is even better as wellmy favorite level is the final one with the spinning discs that detach from the ceiling and explode on impact
the other favorite is one where the guy has to fight bad guys and then open up the floor opening to advance
what was really hilarious is when you pull the switch when there are still bad guys the bad guys just simply blow up
so funny
the graphics are slightly cartoony but are really great toothis game has a special place in my memory and hope that they rerelease this on computer someday to playthis is one of the greatest genesis games ever and is worthy of anyones collection with its great gameplay and soundmany years ago i remember there was an arcade game that had a lot of the same characters in this excellent video game
i was small and used to play that game and hang out with my friends at the arcade and had a lot of good memories
i found this game also a very long time ago at an old video rental store and figured to give it a shot
i knew it wasnt based on the arcade game so instead i was really impressed and surprisedit turned out to be a very challenging yet entertaining game
when you start the game you begin in the frozen siberia no press start options select your character it really began just like you were flipping through the pages of a comic book
also as the game progresses you have the option of choosing between different xmen such as cyclops wolverine nightcrawler gambit psylock and beast
later you can even use magneto but you have to beat him first hes a boss character you can use now that was another original idea of this game that made it great
each character has very unique abilities so as you progress through the game you will find some are much better than others at getting through levels
another interesting thing about using the different characters each one makes the game feel different
playing as gambit it feels like your playing an adventure sidescroller like strider or castlevania
playing as beast kinda gives it a feel like an incredible hulk game magneto feels like your playing vector man for those who know about that classic game also for the genesisthis is a game with replayability and also has excellent music and very colorful graphics
remember though this is also a very challenging game and thats a good thing to because i dont know anyone who has beaten this in one sitting or playing it for the first timeone of the best games ever created for this franchise
the animations are smooth the game play is exceptionally good and there is a fantastic character roster and level design
there is a good balance of easy and hard stagesprobably the best xmen game before xmen legends was released
its a side scrolling beat em up with light puzzles
you can be several of the characters including magneto which makes it very fun and interesting
i would highly recommend this to any sega and xmen fanwhen one looks through the history of bit video games they will notice the unbelieveable number of comiclicensed side scrolling beat em ups spiderman batman spawn and the xmen among others funny because most of them were from acclaim most of which all played the same and really didnt offer much in the terms of fun and replayability
segas original xmen game was an exception that captured some of the intensity of the comic and fox cartoon and its sequel xmen  the clone wars also excells above most of the other comic licensed games
you can choose to play as beast cyclops gambit nightcrawler psylocke and wolverine and after defeating magneto on asteroid m you get to play as him as well and he is the best character in the game
the levels are huge and expansive and include siberia asteroid m the amazon jungle and the phalanx clone laboritories
the bosses are tough and range from apocalypse brainchild tusk a sentinel brain clones of the xmen and the huge rampaging brood beast that chases after you in the final level
the characters are nicely animated and are large  pixelated and colorful and resemble theyre comic counterparts
the control scheme is simple and the background music is actually great and that is saying something considering the genesis didnt have the best sound chip in the world and the difficulty will make you come back and play it again and again
all in all if you still have your genesis and are an xmen fan then find this game quick or if you still have this hold on to itthis game is cool so much better than the first one
you go through all these levels
 i hate the level where everything is blowing up around you and you have to get out before time runs out the best thing about this game is that you get magnetothe strongest mutant in the known world on your side and its really easy to beat him too but once you get him youll have no problem beating this game
a great sequel to an even greater serieshaving been a mk fan since the first one i was anxious to see where midway would take the franchise after the frenetic mk iithe goodthe run button and the accompanying growling noise from the running character is highly amusinggreat graphics slightly less frantic gameplay than mk iimore emphasis was placed on dial a combos instead of the juggling in mk iiit was cool to watch someone pull off a huge combo string but it made mk a little less skill based than mk iithe fatalities are back as well as the animalitiesmore characters sub zero unmaskedloved the new comers kabal cyrax and even the ultra cheap strykerall in all a great follow up to mk ii and it took the franchise in some interesting new placesrecommendedmk  is one of the funniest and most exciting games id ever played
i already had beaten it a few timesit is retro but very good
it had a classic look to it and still looked very good for being  bitthe computer is cheap as it gets but mk is still a classic starsi like the blue king kong great fighting game no flaws what soever recommend this to kids and aduldts you will ahave a lot o friendsstory this game actually has a story to it
a fighting game with a story who knew
the story is a meteor struck the earth and caused great chaos
seven gods from ancient times awoke and are now attempting to take control of the postapocalyptic world
these seven gods are giant dinosaurs and apes which is pretty cool
now as one of these crazy blood thirsty monsters you are set out to conquer the earth
the story is pretty good in my opiniongameplay this fighting game is unlike any other fighting game youll ever play
i say that because you get to fight as dinosaurs and giant apes how cool is that 
in this game you play as one of seven dinossaursapes five dinosaurs and  apes to be exact
you can either play as diablo a hellish looking trex blizzard a cold blooded killer ape sauron a crazy telepathic trex talon a crazy fast and deadly raptor vertigo the poisonous long necked dino chaos a crazy king kong like ape and armadon a vicious crazy triceratops
well just like any other fighting game you got your basic moves like you got your high and low attacks
but instead of punching and kicking like humans do in primal rage you get to tail whip bite slash with your claws and kick slash with your claws too
mixing some of those moves up add up to some deadly combos
if you do these fast enough you can make your enemy brain dead for a couple of seconds which means they cant move and its your chance to get more attacks on your opponent which is very helpful
each character has there own special moves like blizzard has his ice breath attack and chaos with his weird fart bubble attack which is weird but cool sauron has his telekinetic force field diablo has his fireball attack which is pretty rad and those are just some of the cool special moves you can pull off
after you have beaten your opponent in two rounds you can choose to humilliate them by performing a finishing move on them
like a fatality on mortal kombat
for example saurons crusher he just jumps really high in the air and then he just stomps on corpse and turns it into mushy guts
its a pretty awesome finishing move
primal rage has a player versus mode which is pretty fun to whoop your friends atgraphics the graphics look great with its awesome looking levels like diablos level that has the raging volcano is nice to look at as is armadons cave level which looks too cool
the dinosaursapes themselves just look fantastic
blood spraying out of your opponent and yourself is just plain brutal and awesome to look at as is watching your opponents heart explode when you just beaten himsound the music in the game is interesting with its tribal tunes
the roar and yelps of the dinosapes sound outstandingreplay value this is one of those fighters that you come back to in like a week or so
the player versus mode well definetly bring you back as well as the single player
all in all its a great fighting game that should be played from time to timeahh primal rage
im only  and this oe takes me back
i still remember the arcade game
im not sure how big this game ever got but i ranks it in my top  genesis games
right next t umk and clayfighter
whats better than an oldschool side scroll fighting game
one that allows you to be a dinosaur full of p and vinegar
gamers collectors this is a must have in the collectionprimal rage is a great old school fighting gameit was also very underratedthere were some really cool characters you could play as that were dinosuars and even a couple of huge apes tooi am talking about blizzard and chaos of coursethey were kinda like the subzero and scorpion of this gameeach character had some really cool special movesalong with some killer finishers as wellmy favorite finishing move was always chaos golden showerits just so funny to watchespecially if youve just performed it on a friendtheres nothing better then taking a leak on your opponet after you just kicked their butt hahanote that the genesis version had that finishing move and the snes version didintthe graphics are very good and so is the soundthis game may not be a huge hit with every gamerbut it does have a nice little cult followingoverallif you love fighting games and you never played primal rage beforethen i highly recommend buying itits a must for your sega genesis collectionyou must solve the mystery of your brothers deathyou must go to seattle of the middle of the next century and interact with dozen of unique charactersyou are a shadowrunnerin all honesty shadowrun is an console rpg that is as unique as they come
it is fairly nonlinear since you can accomplish subplots in no particular order
you select one of three classes a samurai brute an agile mage and the hacker
instead of increasing in level you can and must
tweak your atributes and the preequipped skills with mana points which accumulate slowly over time preventing overkill
you can hire partner shadowrunners to cancel out your failings hire a mage if you are a warrior or hire a proficient hackerclass character if you are a mage who doesnt want to get quotequippedquot
if you have the equipment you can even go into the d virtual reality and hack private files for some extra funds that is if you can avoid the traps
you can ally with gangs and hunt hellhounds for pelts
since seattle and its surroundings are the quotoverworldquot the game places an added emphasys on plot
there are literally dozens of unique character throghout the game innkeepers quotcontractorsquot gang members everyone you could think of in a megacorporationrun darkfuture seattleyou can equip yourself with a variety of realistic firearms and bulletproof jackets
spells are purchased and upgrades are available
you can even purchase cybernetic upgrades
combat is in real time directly in the field
money is usually earned by taking on certain jobs  ranging from simple deliveries to complex vr heists from quotmr johnsonsquot some of whom pay particularly wellthe best part of shadowrun is the ambience
some equipment is illegal and you can get into a runin with the law
most characters are complete with portraits
the game keeps tabs on you shoot a passerby and you have a higher chance of being questioned by the police although you can delete your police record not for free of course
you may gain certain useful contacts over the course of your investigation
the music fits exceptionally well
the menus glow green like lowquality computer screens
the denizens even have a jargon of their ownif you dont mind the unimpressive graphics and you can appeciate the charm of a genesis game shadowrun will make for an unbelievable experiencethis game is based on the pen and pencil game of the same name
it keeps more to the game play as the pen and pencil game more than the snes version which has a totally differnt story line
this is a very fun game to play
i just love the cyberpunk genre
you start out as a dead beat spending your last cash to go to seatle to find out why your brother was killed outside a shrine
well with back rent due at the motel your brother stayed at you gotta make some fast cash
how do you do that
dive into the shadows and become a runner
you will encounter magical creatures and beasts as well as gang bangers and cops alike
surf the net to download info or run the streets
your choice most likely youll do both
i pity the person who misses out on this truly great gameback in the day for a short time our cable company offered something called sega channel
it offered unlimited access to a new set of sega games each month
one day while checking out the rpg section i discovered shadowrun
i found it creepy and mysterious compared to the other games of the day like ecco the dolphin
instantly i was hooked and eager to complete the gamei loved the freedom to chose your own path picking what kind of character you would play and selecting team members from seedy bars in the worst parts of town
spending hours working missions hunting gargoyle like creatures in abandoned warehouses running mysterious packages from criminal bosses to businesses and avoiding getting jumped by the gangs just to earn enough money to buy the equipment to do larger missionsgoing into criminally run corporations and hacking into their terminals to steal info was thrilling
you never knew what you would get and if you would set off an alarm or be able to disable the system nodes
this game was way ahead of its time when it was created and i can only imagine what they could creates with todays technology ps xbox pc using the same storylinefor years i was never able to find the game to buy and when an old blockbuster video store went out of business in the midlate s i was able to finally get this game to keep for myself
i loved it and all these years later still have the game with my old sega genesis systemsimply put this is a top  game of all time on any system
from building a character going on shadowruns and running the matrix each aspect was as fun as the other
not like some games that focus on one aspect this one was pretty balanced
cant wait for the reboot from hairbrained schemes this summerthis is a old classic wrestling game
you can choose from shawn michals undertaker irs bret hart and a couple more
for it to say wwf and genesis both mean that it is a very old gamethis game was amazing back in the dayand its still just as good as it was back thenwrestlemania the arcade game contains some of the wweswwf then bestduring that timethe digitized graphics look very goodthe wrestlers look so much more realisticcompared to the other wwf games on the genesiseach wrestler has got unique special movesthat fit them perfectlyits so funzapping your opponet with doinks hand zapperor using undertaker and smashing a tombstone over your opponets head with itthis genesis version is somewhat better then the snes portsurethe graphics are a tad bit better on the snesas is some of the soundsbut for some odd reasonthe snes version has removed the late great bam bam bigelow and the late great yokozunabutthankfully they are included in the roster right here on the good ole genesis versionthat alonemakes this version so much more better than super nintendosoverallif you are a longtime fan of wrestling andor love a fun old school fighterthen this game is for youwhat would you say if i told you that an automated nuclear carrier was carrying  nuclear warheads and they started to leak what would you say if that carrier had locked in the most direct path in order to detonate the weapons at the safest point possible yet if the warheads are hit they will explode destroying everything within a close radius
that is the premise of blast corps
and yes it is as much fun as the title could possibly imply
this is one of the first games i bought for my nintendo  and im still not sorry that i bought it
it is possibly one of the funnest games ever on the nintendo  what kind of game gives you heavy vehicles and man piloted suits in order to level city after city to clear the path for a truck carrying weapons of mass destruction
the game graphically is fine looking and the controls make the game a joy to play
i strongly recommend this game because there are times when you need to just blow something upgame developer rare has done a great job of creating a unique and fun game for all
this is a game that requires you to hone your skills and patience in order to complete the challenges
it has a wide variety of challenges from clearing a nuclear trucks path to finishing laps in a certain time
there are three different difficulty levels  easy medium and hard  that you earn by beating all the levels in the preceding difficulty
there is a lot to do in this gamethe plot is simple  a truck with a defective nuclear bomb strapped on it needs to be detonated in a safe place
the main problem is that the truck is continuously moving at a set speed and the slightest bump will set it off
its up to the blast corps to clear its path using a variety of vehicles
some missions are too easy but still fun while others are incredibly hard
many of the levels will require you to try them over multiple timesthe camera uses a birdseye view and follows your vehicle
this is acceptable for the atmosphere of the game but it becomes difficult when you need to look for extra buildings or rdus
all of the vehicles are well made and fun though the dump truck levels can be the most frustrating because the only way to destroy buildings with it is to smash them with its back end skid into them
the controls can be frustrating in crucial moments as well
since the camera is above the car left and right become mixed up
i also noticed that with the two mechs that rollcartwheel into buildings the controls wouldnt always respond when i wanted them to attack
otherwise the controls were very fluiddespite these complaints there is a lot to like
destroying buildings and collecting rdus is a lot of fun
its a satisfying feeling when you see your bulldozer driving through structures as though they were roadkill
the ability to destroy buildings and the patience required is what makes this very fun and rewarding
its also very rewarding to finally complete those very difficult levels  especially if you do it in the nick of time
receiving a gold medal on the toughest of levels is a great feeling
too bad the game is shortlived
it may last you any where between  and  hours but just when you think its over its not
a lot of levels take place on other planets and after you get all gold metals its time to head to the time trialsgraphically blast corps does only what it needs
it adds all the right colors and details nothing more nothing less
the sound is welldone especially the horns of the racing vehicles
the music is a bit childish  kind of a strange technolike beat  but it is aimed at kids
about those horns my favorite was the vans horn which went get outta my way
and thats what you should be saying while racing to your nearest video game dealer for this gamethis is one of the best games for the  and it sells for a fair price
we all know rare made some of the best games on the system and this was no exception
to sum up the plot you are a driver is a set of various construction  destruction vehicles tasked with clearing the way for nuclear missiles
if you dont clear the level the rockets go boomas simple as the plot is the game play is as well
its as simple as driving and using a few cool moves and special weapons
there are some basic puzzles at times along the way that challenge you to think aheadwhere the game really excels in my opinion is how you choose to way to end the game
you can end at getting the weapons to their final place and launch the space shuttle or you can go and get all the collectibles and open planetary travel
going through the planet levels is fun and trying to earn all gold medals and then platinum is very challenging and will really up your skillsbuy this game and have hours of funthis is one of the smartest and most demanding games you will ever play
it is tetris but with little men that get into special vehicles that you operate to move objects around a city path to allow a runaway nuclear bomb on a truck a clear path
it is not as easy as it seems is very addictive and some of the best fun i ever had playing any game
there was nothing quite like
i played this for thinking and turok for shooting
i remember this impressed quite a few brain friends i had
they loved it
it is quite a thrill also
tense when you get near the end and the nuclear lorry is right on your tail
amazing concept
thanks for these memories and happy timesi believe this is a rare game
and i do not think that the rare game company is around any more
i an never selling this game
the little red cap like thing with it that is to extent the memory i believe
and you do noy got that you can not play the game at allwhile modern games often get boring and feel exactly the same throughout the entire game donkey kong always has something new around the corner
its so fun to go explore
while its a tiny bit dated it was ahead of its time
this game showed the the n was capable of
too bad microsoft ruined the chances of us getting another donkey kong like this
imagine what they could do if they did something similar on the wii u and put in as much effort into that gamedonkey kong is one of the greatest gaming characters every to grace the face of the earth and when i got this game i was not disappointed for a minute
the minute i began playing the game i knew that donkey kong truly did belong in his place on the nintendo  when i first bought the game i was cautious about the game as it seemed like another recycled game brought back from the dead simply to make money
when i played for a few minutes i quickly ate my words
the game is great and fun to play with six different quotkongsquot to play as each with their own individual style in all forms of gameplay but this just adds to the variety of fun the game truly offers
the graphics are great calling upon the expansion pak in order to show this game in all of its graphical glory
the game was designed perfectly with fun totally in mind and it pays off incredibly this is one of the game that makes you want to keep your nintendo  up and blazing despite the new systems out there
buy this game and you will not regret giving donkey kong a home on your nworks and is one of the best games of all timefrom the moment i turned it on and heard the dk rap i know i was in for fun fun fun
this game so good i dont even know what to rave about first
all five kongs rock
lanky is awesome this is ssssssooooooooooo much better than any other n game
the battle mode is awesome fans of goldeneye will love it
i love this game
rare did one hell of a job making this one dont believe me look at the others reviews
dk  is the best game yet
dk  for president
ohhhhhh bannanathis vide game is actually my rd personal favorite out of allmy nintendo  video games
but i am very concerned about mylittle sister
some material may be not appropiate for childrenunder  years of age
but this game is the coolest of the cool
donkey kong always keeps his cool
the coolest of all the membersis tiny kong
she spins with her hair
her ponytail power couldbe helpful when she is falling off a high place
that way shewould not take any damage
the best thing about this game isthat there is a beautiful realistic d graphic of the islandso if you are under  please do not buy this game
and rememberbuy this game as soon as possiblehi my name is brandon stolt and i had donkey kong  for a long time and i think this is the best game in the entire worlda very well made game
it has so much to do if you put it down half way through its like playing a whole new game when you get back to it
its also true to the series which is always good to see
check out the donkey kong country series for more funif you have kids and want to play a rd person beat em up instead of conkers then this is the game for you
yellow cartridge is fun to see tooa simple game tons of fun to play
i recommend it to everyoneeven though this title hasnt received the worldwide success that mario  has had it still is a vital title for your n collection
tasked with massive worlds and challenging collectibles this game will have you going for hoursthis game requires an expansion pack but ohh is it worth it
in multiplayer mode you have the chance to brawl it out with other donkey kong characters
while in single player mode you are donkey kong on an adventure saving the donkey kong world
awesome classic game
a must have if you still have the nfirst of all you might to need to know this game is made by rare the same people that made the awesome donkey kong country series for the super nintendo
this game is one for puzzle lovers
in order to get the much needed quotgolden bannanasquot that unlock new levels you must solve many hard puzzles
and yourll need to master the skill of changing from one monkey to another early on since yourll need to use it a lot
if you have banjo tooie super mario  or other games of that type and you like them yourll most likely like donkey kong  toothis game was and still is awesome
im still amazed at the sound and graphics quality of this game and i always have fun playing it
some mini games are a bit confusing and incredibly hard
the golden bananas which act like banjokazooies jiggies are sometimes also extremely hard to get
theres actually over  bananas in the game
to be exact theres  bananas in the game counting the giant counts as  banana that you get for getting all of the banana fairies
this game took me about  years to beat i still havent gotten all of the bananas
with other games inbetween including getting a gamecube
overall this game is awesome
a must get for any n ownerfrom the mid to late s through the early early s rare was on fire
when teamed with nintendo they were a powerhouse developing blockbuster games  after another
donkey kong  is no exception to that
while its totally different than rares original donkey kong country series this game definitely holds it own
first off this game is huge
its basically an open world platformer
very comparable to the banjo kazooie games on n
lots of exploring collecting defeating enemies and bosses to advance the storyline
the graphics are beautiful and actually required the nintendo  to have an upgraded memory pack installed which was included with the game
while the music isnt quite as memorable as the dk country games its still very well done and fits the specific environments
i would highly recommend this to anyone who was a fan of banjo kazooie or mario  type gameplaydonkey kong  is great game that ive played onandoff since the early s
its fun
you play as five characters
you dont see that much in games especially today
its family friendly and offers a pretty difficult challenge of getting a  ive never done it to this day
the game starts out simple and gets more difficult as you progress through the areas
another thing this game is very long so dont expect to finish in a few days
it took me almost  months to get half way done upon first playing
with a guide it may not be so hard though
nevertheless its very enjoyable and will keep you playing for hours straighti bought donkey kong  for my nephews birthday
i owned and played this game when i was little
this is the game that really got donkey kong going and recognized
the levels in the game are great and you get to tag along with diddy kong in certain levels
i love the classic game and i recommend the game to anyone who likes donkey kongthe background is cool the colors pop up at you
the plants the trees and bushes looks great
the kongs are great to
you get to have powers and guns and you get to play music in the gamesome of the levels are pretty and nice looking
and some are dark and where are some of the lights
you know lights that shine in your eyes well anyaway good game i wish some of the game that i playden where like is onedont yousome of the levels are easy and some are a little hard so thing careful
i playden this game so any time thats funny haha ha
i dont know why thats funnyin the water you dont need air is that cool or what
well you play the game and see for yourself
write me back and tell me what you think ok good luck on the game its fun to playi love this amazing game it was the last donkey kong adventure before taking a break
i strongly recommend thisthank you so much for this game this game was for a birthday gift for my niece
she completely loves her game she plays it everytime she gets home from school
thank you so muchi love the game it has awesome features you can play with four players in a showdown as ether donkey kong diddy kong  lanky chunky and tiny the game can be challenging however over all i enjoy the game
this game is good game and worth playingfirst of all the price of this game has dropped from  to 
when i first brought the game i thought the graphics were great
on top of that the game is very fun
there are  huge worlds and you have to get bananas with each of your  characters
after beating the  worlds and obtaining  bananas you will then enter the final world
the sound effects is in surround sound and it sounds as good as the movies
the only minor problem with this game is that on some areas the graphics seems to get smaller
your view might be more of a top view
i think it should get a  but besides the little graphics problem it is a perfect game for the nfast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
a you need a expansion pak and a save cartidgecollectibles collectibles collectibles
this game is all about collecting stuff
its very different from past donkey kong games
no more are the pleasant sidescrolling levels of dk island
this game almost feels like it should have been a banjokazooie game
a solid platformer with a killer introduction rap song keeps this game out of the firefun fact grant kirkhope the composer of donkey kong  provided the voice for donkey kong in this gamemy mom bought this for me for my birthday when i was turning  it comes with the only donkey kong  which is probably the biggest platform game of nintendo  it has great graphics and the music matches each world perfectly
i love how you have to use each of the  characters to beat the level instead of just picking your favorite
each character brings different strengths to the table and have different weapons moves and instruments
the boss battles are clever and creative and the final battle against king k rool is one of the best in all of video gameswe originally bought this for the multiplayer portion
we started doing the adventure and love it
i generally do not like role playing games and most adventure games but this one is a keeper
this place is hugedonkey kong is one of the best adventure games on n
as the game proceeds you unlock different kongs
my favorite is tiny
the levels and areas are complete and fully developed
its not one of those games where you can finish it in a day it takes months and months
i havent even completed it
i think this is a great game for kids and teens theyll enjoy long hours of fun and enjoyment
the graphics are very good too
i highly recomend itmy son loved how fast his order was taken care of he placed his order and it came in way befor the time it said it may take the game was in very good shape and it said it would be and package with great care to get it to him he was very happy with his order 
thanksthis is a pretty cool game
its really fun and i think people will enjoy it i didthis was a family fun game we play this game often together so its considered a classic for us
especially loved being able to beat up people using anything in the roomfighting force  is one of the best beatemups on the n
there arent many but this game single handedly more than makes up for what the system lacks in this genre
theres something so old school about playing this that when you begin the game it will fell reminiscent of streets of rage and double dragon
i think ff  is the spiritual successor to those games
it just puts off that vibewhen you start the game you can choose from  characters  girls and  guys
i like to play as smasher the huge guy you see on the front cover of the game
his punches are legendary they can be heard from miles away
when you begin the first stage it really lets you know what you are in for
a couple of random guys come out of nowhere at you and you dont know why you are killing them but you know it must be done
you punch and kick your way through endless waves of baddies until you reach the end of each levelone thing i like about this game is you can never get lost it always makes sure to let you know what you are doing
just beat everyone up and either more will come or you will move on to the next area of the stage
the environments are highly destructible for example you can go up to a random coke machine and punch it until it explodes
or you can pummel a car until its tires fall off
you can then pick those tires up and throw them at enemies
a shotgun conveniently pops out of the trunk of the car which you can also pick up and blast the life out of your opponentsi like the way the game recognizes how damage is dealt
for example i picked up a knife i found on the ground
i sliced a guy with a shirt on and he fell back but didnt die
after i did that a shirtless man charged me from behind
well i quickly turned around and shanked him right in the chest and you know what
it killed him right then and there
the game realizes that not wearing a shirt would obviously hurt a lot more than if you had one on strangely enoughthe game has  bosses and the first two are simple
the last guy however is hard as hell
this is mainly because that by the time you get to him your lives and health will be drained severely so it will be a very big challenge for you
there are multiple paths you can take in the game something i found interested for a game of its time
you choose your fateone flaw i would say is the game loses its momentum as you progress further
when you begin the game its so awesome and great and you just love it
but as you make it to the final few stages the enemies get harder and start blocking a lot more and they keep on coming and coming
it can get aggravating
but nothing will top those first few levels
the rd stage the elevator is epic
you walk over to the glass box and punch it open to get the axe out which you then use to chop your enemies up
its very violent and bloody but yet only escaped with a teen rating
well deserved i saysadly the n never got the sequel to the game but its still a blessing to have received the first one
its a great beatemup and will be looked at as a classic in years to come
this is the kind of game they dont make anymore
and its a shame because this game is greati havent played this game since i was very little and it was wonderful to be able to reexperience the magic
great game and arrived in the promised conditionlooking back most people didnt expect much from this game boy where they wrong as this game has a unqiue play style story and enough action to keep one glued to the endmischief makers is one of the most underrated titles of the nintendo  it is an excellent platformer with some nifty controls a large scale secret to unlock and a lot of unique gameplay
i just wish there was anotheri will admit i am biased about this game
i got mischief makers for my th birthday and for whatever reason sold it sometime between now and then
i was delighted to find it on amazon for so cheapthe game is fun plain and simple
the basic gameplay takes little more than five hours to play through but the addition of the gold gems makes sure this game will last you a long time if you get into it
you play as marina liteyears an android created by prof theo
naturally prof theo gets kidnapped and its your job to go rescue him
its not much more than your standard platformer fare but it has some fun gameplay mechanics that make it stand out in my mind
for example rather than shooting or jumping on your enemies the standard way of defeating your foes is by grabbing them and throwing them
theres something undeniably enjoyable about grabbing an enemy and throwing him against the groundthe graphics arent impressive by any stretch of the imagination but they serve their purpose
as for the audio youll either be driven crazy by marinas constant cries of shake shake
when she shakes something or like me find it one of the games many inexplicable reasons that it makes you smilein conclusion this game while certainly not the best on the n is a solid package that is worthy of a position on the shelf of any n fani became interested in this game when i heard about it from nintendo power years ago but i could never find it when i was little but after learning about it on amazon i found it even though it was in the age of wii and wii u games i still found it enjoyable and i would recommend this for people who are a fan of these styles of gamesthis is a pretty fun adventure game i think people will enjoy this game very much
its fun challaging and intensei love this game i rented it a long time ago and have been searching to purchase it for  years finally i found it
for the price of only  this is one of the most rare nintendo  games ever nobody i know has it
i even heard bad reviews about itwell those peole dont understand excellent games when they see one
treat yourself and buy mystical ninja starring goemon trust me you wont regret itmy personal favorite entry in the series
the music is flat out awesome its like tranceelectronicdubsteptechno
combined with the vivid flashing lights this makes for a trippy fast paced ravelike arcade experience
does chug when loading new levels sometimes
the game is awesome period
if you dig retro arcade games grab it i doubt youll regret itthis is the first star wars title i ever played on a video game systemandthe goodeverythinga simply stunning storylineamazing graphics for its timethe levels are incrediblethe fight with boba fett had me sitting there with my mouth hanging open goingis this really happeningam i really fulfilling a childhood dream of fighting fett
granted over the years the charm of this has worn off with countless other wars games but that one moment was one of thosethis is so awesome moments that it stays with you foreverthe badthe main character controls like hes on ice skatesthere are plenty of cheap deaths and the camera is pretty crazy at timesbut stillthis was one of the first d platformers out there and they did a superb job at bringing the star wars universe to life in danother of my all time favoriteshighest recommendationsbesides the farily difficult to master controls this game is a blast
you play through the game as dash rendar
it puts many elements of star wras into the game and many added bonuses such as views of worlds not shown in the movie
many levels and a high difficulty make this game a must have for any star wars or gaming fanthis game is very creative and imaginative
i think the story is magnificient and the styles of gameplay that drastically switch to tell the story are great
dash rendar is a great character that is believable in the star wars universe
the soundtrack is beyond amazing even though not all of it is done by john williams
a great game and i for one recommend this game to any star wars fanwell this is still a pretty sweet game
now that ive played the game i want to read the book
this might be the first book related game ever made
this game is sweet
if you are a star wars fan you gotta have this gameif you liked this game check out all of the other star wars gamesi love this gameits just like i remembered it from back in the s when i first played itwhat a great game
you sould own this
i beaten it so many times that i keep play it over and over again
the game is cool you get to use a gun and some stuff with the gun they will be around somewherein the game you get to fly a ship and walk around in buildings and valleys and so onin the game if you look careful you will fine a jetpack somewhere in the game
this will help you to fly in very hard places that you cannot reach on foot
and high places that you cant reachin the game you get to talk to people that you seen before in the moives and other video gamesthe color of the background is alright and you get to hear people falling to there death after shooting them in the face the bad guys not the good oneshave funok let me just say this game i awsome
i love this game
when i was like  or me and my dad would take turnes playing this game
my two favorite levels are the gall space port and the ord manteil junkyard
the junkyard level because you jump from train to train and at the end fight ig
the space port because its the longest and the coolest
and at the end of the level you fight boba fett
i also love the sewer level
over all a great gamestar wars shadows of the empire is the best action game in the history of gaming
the levels are extremely challenging engaging and action packedhonestly if you enhanced the graphics to new standards this game would be the best game on the market right nowif you love star wars intense fighting puzzle solving and difficult gameplay you will love this game
i beat it around  times
i never replay games that many times so that is saying a lotbuy this nowthis is one of my favorite games of all time it stands next to conker live and reloaded mario kart  and san andreas
and for its time it was groundbreaking
when i was about  or  i went to my local market to rent a game i then saw this i said this looks cool ill give it a try
it met my expectations and then shattered them
i really cant explain how astonishing this game was and still is today
now im  and i still love playing this game it is one that will stand the test of timeright this game can be either the easiest thing youve ever done or a hellish nightmare
it all depends on the difficulty
on easy the enemies are weak and your vehicles are practically invincible
on medium the enemies are more numerous but still you take a while to kill
on hard enemies are tough and you arent that great
on jedi enemies are weak but so are you you can die very fast if youre not carefulbattle of hoth   this is great to start but gets boring after a while
i still really like killing the atsts thoughescape from echo base   on jedi this levels a bch
but its very fun to see those damn snowtroopers fall into oblivionasteroid belt   now were talkin
its really fun blasting the tie fighters and bombers into space dustord mantell junkyard   this whole level takes place on hover trains except the boss and its very fun to kill enemies on moving vehiclesgall spaceport   this level carries on for way too long but the fight with boba fett rocksmos eisley and beggars canyon   yes finally star wars gets into racing
kill the swoop jockies before they reach luke but dont crashimperial freighter suprosa   fun level thats swarming with stormtroopers
the final boss is pretty long and monotonous thoughsewers of imperial city   fun but is hard as hell on jedi
you fight huge spiderlike creatures called dianogas herexizors palace   the hardest level in the game but really fun and the gladiator droid is very toughskyhook battle   by far the best damn level in the entire game and star wars series even
you get to fight xizors fighters which are very tough and also destroy an enormous sopace skyhook tooin conclusion there are minor flaws here and if you like star wars first person shooters and adventure games then buy this
nowthe title says it all
it is a awesome star wars game but it is hard as ever
i mean really hard
if you have problems and get angry at hard things i dont recommend itif you dont buy it nowi still love playing these old n games and nes and snes games for that matter i had a lot of fun with this game in the past and always willi love this gamethe only thing i hate is moving dashthe way it is stinksother than that the game rocksthe game starts out flying a plane and destroying the empires tanksyou journey then leads you to a junkyarda moon basea sewer with who knows what is living down therea palaceand then a space battlethis game is really cooland everyone should play iteven if you hate star wars try this outyoull be happy you didthis is a classic to keep around
it is all about the real men of outer space
it made my childhood ever so complete
rent it outnostalgia
this was the first game i ever played and i remember beating itgetting the black and white yoshis and all the levels done etc but now that i come back to it  years later its a lot harder than i remember
i still like it though even if its childish and simplistic i just cant help but enjoy myself playing it the art and combined music kinda makes me justhappy
i know its not a favorite for everyone or even enjoyable for everyone and i am a bit biased because of my past but oh well
its a cute game if you have kids it would be very suitable for an introduction into the gaming world
it was minethe fiancee loves the game
she used to love yoshis island so when we were browsing amazon and she saw this she immediately wanted it and shes thoroughly enjoying it
great old gamereally fun i bought it for my sister and she likes it too
similar to mario but yoshi so were goodif you love yoshi this is the game for you
this game is pretty fun and kinda challanging
its a really good gamei really enjoy playing this back then even now it is a bit challenging but it is a fun gamei bought this as a birthday present for my sister who is a huge fan of the character yoshi i even bought her a yoshi plush later on from a japanese store at the brea mall
she cried with tears of joy
yoshi is really important to her life
now i know if i get her anything too do with that series she will like
she used her plush to be her car buddy
she doesnt have a lot of time to play video games but she was happy too get this game so i dont think it was a wastethis game is really cute and fun
baby bowser stole the super happy tree and the baby yoshis have to go get it back
basically you go through the levels collecting  pieces of fruit and fighting an occasional boss
the only down side to this game is that it is very short and pretty easy
but if you like yoshi or enjoy cute games buy thisyoshis story is one of my favorite games on the n
it has a lot of replayability great level design and large open environmentsexploring is really the core of this game
branching paths allow you to open up new routes for you to explore
secret areas are everywhere in this game and it pays to look for them
once you complete the story mode play it again
it gives you new levels to try out each time
once you unlock those levels you can play them again instantly with a quick level select option
replayability is high in this game
i had played the story mode a dozen times before i discovered a boss i hadnt fought beforethis game isnt that easy not if you really take the time to seek out all the high scoring fruit and hearts
im not sure why people are saying it is
in fact levels in the last world can get pretty challenging with all kinds of traps
it makes you want to grab as many fruit as you can to fill your quota before you losegreat music compliments this game
as i explored i was wildly entertained by all the unique sound effectsthe controls are rock solid so you wont have any trouble with thati really dont know what other game to compare this to so i cant really say if youll like it
its a one of a kind game that deserves at least a look
my recommendation is to look up some gameplay videos and decide if it looks like something you would enjoythis game is aimed towards a younger audience
that much is a given
what you probably dont know however is that older people such as myself love this game
yoshis story succeeded in bringing the world an original fun game with amazing graphics
yes you do eat your enemies but hey if theyre tastyanyway yea
get this game for your own good and find out for yourself how much fun it is
you wont regret itthis is a very good game and the grapics are good but there is only one problem it isnt dbut that doesnt take away from the excitement of the game
you start out with six yoshis but as you progress you can unlock a white yoshi and a black yoshi
the game itself has many levels and areas to play ina few of them look sort of alike
but i recomend this game to any age if you are a super mario fan than this game is perfect for you
highly recommededi luv this game
hes cute cuddely and funny
i like the egg and stuff
i dont care what you dumbos say yoshi roxkiller to the bone the way an arcade game should be
although im not entirely sure if it ever hit the arcades its a good running game all the way around
love itthis sequel to ki is awesome i was very impressed on how well the characters were im kinda disapointed that they didnt keep cinder in it he was my favorite in the first ki
i love all the characters
my favorite one in this game has to be jago  saberwulf
if you enjoyed ki  woull enjoy this gamethis is a master piece of a fighter
i love mk but this is just entertaining and the stereotypes are greatback when d fighters were a dime a dozenthere were only a select few that stood out in both the arcades and the home consoles and ki in my opinion was at the very top of that list amongst other brawlers such as street fighter alphathe king of fighterssamuri showdown and of course the insane fighting mechanics of guilty gear
ki imo was one of the elite games of this genre due to the fact thatyou cant just press buttons and expect to beat the came its much more than that and takes skill patience quick handeye coordination and sometimes splitsecond timing just to perform some of the most basic movessuch as blockingcountering and so forthdont let the dated graphics turn you away from this one its a true gem and rightfully belongs in any fight fans collection if you can find a copy
i searched the web and when i did find a copy  which was rarelythe price tag was very steepso if amazon has any left buy a copy 
whether its  or  ki
has stood the test of time and will always be as innovative as evera classic in its own rightimagine this redone right on the xbox  or ps
holynightlately ive been grabbing old n games to play on residence  my brother and sister wanted the gamecube at home so i began hunting through video game stores for any n gems worth filling out my collection with
id avoided ki gold on its initial release because it got mixed reviews and was horribly expensive remember those first gen n games
exactly
 but since i owned every other rareware game i decided to grab it
after grinding the controllers to a bloody pulp in allout tournaments with my roommates im left wondering why rare never followed with a kithe fighting engine in ki gold is completely insane
its ridiculously fast brutal and fully animated
ki really puts other n fighters particularly the mortal kombat series to shame
the engine has some preprogrammed combos and also allows you to invent your own
ill admit its not as deep as street fighter  mindless button mashing can create some intense crowdpleasing combos whereas street fighter is more skillbased  but youll need all the help you can to survive
there are a slew of onehit finishing moves that can instantly deplete your second energy bar and the ai isnt shy about pulling these on you every chance it gets
whats also interesting is that while the fighting is strictly d the arenas are full d and certain moves such as throws will change your character positions in that spacethe graphics are excellent  its a little odd at first seeing d sprites on a d arenea but you get accustomed to it
the soundtrack wouldve been worth releasing another cd for like they did with the first game and the controls are sharp
if youre like me and still go for a little retro gaming killer instinct gold is probably the best fighter you can get for the nthis is the best fighting game ever
there are loads of characters to choose from all with loads of special moves
the best thing about the game are the ultra combos with hits in excess of  hits
the graphics look like they are straight from the arcade and the game play in two player mode has the greatest appeal than i have seen in any other gamethis is one of the greatest tranfers from arcade to home system
the graphics indeed look almost just like the arcade and the sound is the part where it will shock you because we all thought the  couldnt handle such quality arcade stereo type of music but the  was able to handle it
everything is there except for jagos spirt move and some back grounds were altered
the bad thing is that due to nin s limited capacity of memory the cool cinemas were taken out and each character is limited to one ending instead
but still alot codes and secrets make this game worth playing and of course when you unleash the ultra combossit back and watch its gonna be a bumpy ride
have a nice dayactually liked this one better then the original for the super nintendo blew the first one out of the water in my opinionwhile i have played this game in the past and absolutely love this game this particular one doesnt work at all
i came home from training and tried to play the game and it doesnt work
i thought it was the system but all of my other games work with no issues
so i havent been able to enjoy it at allthis is a fun game something like mortal kombat
you get a about  charecters something  around there  and you fight till you destroy all of them if you are still standingloved playing this when i was young
no more quarters down the slot
there should be a mace  somedayi bought this game used a couple of years ago  im not quite sure why these guys are charging their price though
in this game its cool cause they do all the normal punches kicks and combos of normal fighting games but then they all also have weapons such as swords axes spikey balls on a chain etc
this game is tons of fun for years and even though i own an xbox and a couple games for it i still place mace occaisionallythis game rocks
the funnest part of the game though is trying to figure out all the characters special moves by randomly pressing button combinations
i still dont know how to do all the moves but most most of the characters in the game have a special move where you press down and then forward  ab at the same time
with subzero it shoots an iceball dragonballz style at opponet and freezes them
if you see this game around id buy it
it has crap loads of characters and  secret unlockable ones smoke human form like scorpion shao kaun and motarro
motarro is the coolest he is a huge centitar and has a special move where he picks up the opponet with one arm and slams them against the floor
and another where you hold b and he spits a green energy ball at opponet
this game is very adventurous and you can set it so its not so bloody for the younger audiances or turn the blood green so they think its snot or somethingi loved mortal kombat since the late s
bought it a few weeks ago and its fun playing against my friends
so many characters to choosei loved all three originals in the arcade and this combination of all three is incredible for its time period
love the game works greatfighting games were scarce on the  but mk trilogy was a really good one for it
it took all characters from all  mks mortal kombat mk ii mortal kombat  and ultimate mortal kombat  and also made some of the bosses playable characters like goro and kintaro
more or less all of the characters that have been in the game this whole time ex liu kang shang tsung scorpion and sub zero were the ultimate mortal kombat versionsits pretty good
the graphics are good the game play is smooth and you get to use pretty much every character that has been in the series up to umk   the umk  combo system is used in this so if youre not up to speed on the umk  combos you might want to brush up a little firstlike i said seeing as how fighting games were very few on the  id check out this one because it was a good one
that and how can you not want to play as goro or kintaro
if youre looking for another good fighting game on the  check out killer instinct gold and for you wrestling fans check out wcwnwo revenge and wwf no mercythis game how can you go wrong
you get the ultimate fighting game there has ever been easy controls difficult fatalities brutalities babalities friendships combos
you start up the game and first when the character select screen comes you are blown away
an uncountable amount of characters secret characters like knameleon smoke kahn motaro tons of kombat kodes and secrets
there is even a  on  mode  on  mode and an  person tournament mode in the game
no other non d fighting game will be the sameive watched the film and played the very first game and this was satisfying because there are many characters
the cartridge was clean but i had to use rubbing alcohol on the contacts for it to work happens to old gamesloaded with everyone of your favorite mk fighters pre mk
mk trilogy was out dated in appearance the day of this versions release
however i never played trilogy for its graphics
the game play is very addictive i think
dont get me wrong i do like the look of this game
i wouldnt call this game anything less than perfect just the way it is
even tho i dont play this game nearly as much as i did i did play it for  years  years of which was everyday
mortal kombat has been my favorite fighting game series for over half a decade now
so what does this great game really offer you  playable fighters moves and alities never seen in an arcade brutal brutalities and  pit like stage fatalites
starring scorpion subzero kitana raiden cage reptile sonya sheeva smoke cyrax liu kang kabal nightwolf jade sindel rain stryker kano amp jax
just to name a fewas you can see yes i am a mortal kombat fan
i used to obsess over everything that was mortal kombat all the games
both of the movies i am awaiting the rd movie next yearthe outworld arena
anything elsei just love how the blood flies everywhere when a guy is punched or killed or uppercutted
i recommend this to any mortal kombat fanthe proper game has some of the best characters
take a look at the artistry behind some of the characters
youll have funout of all the bomberman games out there that ive played id have to say bomberman  is my most favorite
dont ask me whyit just is
i rented it out from blockbuster video and liked it so much that i bought it
i never was a big bomberman fan til this one came along
i wish i could explain how much fun this game is to play but youd just have to find out yourself
the single player mode is challenging but its multiplayer mode is where this one shinesyes indeed
just let me say i highly recommend this game to all
its definitely worth its asking pricethis game basicly goes like this
there are  worlds two of which you have to unlock first
so you start out with  worlds a grassy world a lava world a water world and the icy world
theres no order on how you go to the worlds so you pick which world you go to
each world has  levels level  is a normal stage level  is a semi boss stage level  is like level  but its bigger and more complex and level  is the boss of the world
once you beat the boss you beat the world
beat all  of em to unlock the th world the fortress
once you get all the gold cards you get a new world i like to call the rainbow worldbut anyways bomberman is a game where you click a button and a bomb pops up right where your standing
you can either kick it at your enemy throw it or pump it up to make a big bomb which causes more damage than a normal bomb
sometimes you have to do a tricky bomb jump puzzle which i still have trouble doing
this game can get complicated to so its very tricky
took me awhile to complete it so if you want a long game i think this is for you espicially for the expert
i love the variety of enemies in the game
i woundnt call this a game for a begginer at alli find it fun to look for body parts in this game
its hidden and i mean hidden in each normal stage there is  of em
its tricky to find so you need lots of luck to find emi think thats all for this reveiw in the end i hope you get it
bomberman is a star in nintendo and your about to find out why i presume bomberman  is a really good game
i rented it about a week ago and then i got it a few days later
it has a great multiplayer mode and the player mode is really fun too
its got a lot of puzzles that take a while to solve
i think its really worth the moneyknow is a real classic bomber man  people all over the world go nuts over classic  games trying see who will winthis game was my favourite when i used to have an n
infact i think it still is my alltime favourite game nothing else has managed to beat it
i miss this game alot and it infact may be worth buying another n just for this game aloneif you like adventurepuzzlesolving games this is absolutely the bestthis game rocks
i always liked bomberman but this game is the bomb
the levels are fun and provides hours of gameplay
the other thing is that the multiplayer rules
you can battle with up to four of your friends
if you want a great game by a copy of this game nowi bought this cheap at a pawn shop
figured if it wasnt any good then not a big loss
its one of the best nintendo  games i have though
well worth the six dollars i paid for itthis is one of the best titles you can possibly find on nintendo  it has great action plenty of blood and excellent mission variety
what also makes this game so much fun to play is when you kill someone youre not supposed to it will not make you start from the beginning of the mission
so you can be merrily on your way continuing your killing spree
i love the creative weapons as well like the gun you literally feed ammo to
so if you own an oldschool console like an n pick up this game immediatelyas i once read about this game skip the easy quotagentquot level
the real fun in this game lies in sneaking around the stealth part
unlike other first person shooters fps this game isnt about mowing down everyone in sight
instead its a gorgeous game alas with the traditionally poor rare framerate especially in multiplayer where you have to think about every single move you make
along with majoras mask its the reason to get an expansion pak
if you dont have one and want this game i strongly suggest you get one either by itself or with another great game donkey kong  which is now a steal at  if the expansion pak is  by itself you do the math
the controls are superb and its very easy to get the swing of things
however it is very bloody and the deaths are realistic
parents should let kids under sixteen rent it then watch them play it to make sure its ok other than the blood there is some mild swearing at about the pg level its nothing too bad
multiplayer is fantastic with capture the briefcase the best scenarioacthis game is so cool
it is just like goldeneye except newer and better
it also has more guns and more levels
it has better graphics and has more features
i would deffinately buy this game
also you need to have an expansion pack to play the full version so buy oneand this snowboard kids  super smash bros mario kart  goldeneye  wave race  diddy kong racing pokemon stadium and mario  even though ive overplayed the latter three are worth owning a n again for
even if you have to buy it used from somewherelet me start off by saying that this game is so fun
and i mean its exceedingly fun
even alone
you play as a character named joanna dark
the oneplayer mode although ive only played it once since i rebought the game is pretty solid
you have a few select objectives to pull off on each and every mission
it gets harder as you go along
the music is solid and memorable but the graphics arent great
theyre slightly above average at best for the nbut the game shines in its combat simulator mode
it is a mode where you make your way through over  missions completing random objectives from uploading a terminal with a data uplink to king of the hill which pits you against one or more bots to take on a challenge that has you having to stay in a certain spot for  or so seconds claiming that its yours
if you do so while the enemy stays away you get the point and move on to the next hill to my favorite capture the case
capture the case is a mission where you must go to your opponents hideout and get their little case bring it back to your hideout and make it back to your own case
however if the enemy has already made it to your case before you get back you must chase them down which is hella fun in order for your case to return to its original spot
there are more missions such as just killing your opponent  times or holding onto a briefcase for as long as you canlastly im going to list all the weapons which are mostly guns in the game
ill also list my top  favorites and explain their functionsfalconmagsecmaulerphoenixdy magnumdylx magnum goldcmpcyclonecallistorcp dont have this gun yet dont remember it eitherlaptop gundragonk avengerarsdragon dont have or remember this one eithersniper riflereaperfarsightshotgundevastatorrocket launchercrossbowslayer slayer  launches missles just like a regular rocket launcher
however it has a twist
although you must stand totally still while using its flybywire feature you get to actually follow the bullet as you search for someone to kill
talk about innovative
go rare laptop gun  an extraordinary gun that performs fast shooting bullets in its normal use
however if you throw it on the ground or onto a random wall the next time someone comes within its sight they get shot at
it will use all its bullets if it must dragon  acts as an ordinary gun that shoots speedy bullets on its initial function comes alive as a grenade launcher on its second cyclone  one bad as hell gun
its very very fast and its second function lets you empty out  bullets one right after the other at a blazing speed ensuring a better chance at killing a weary opponent ar  a fast gun but when compared to some of my other favorites it just doesnt measure up
has a very closeup scope functionworst
gun
everreaperprosgraphics are manageable but nothing special
sound is pretty cool
it has a decent range of types of music
lots of missions to keep a single player busy while not around friends
decent realism when you get killed falling to the ground
maybe a bit slow but decent nonetheless
up to  players which is pure pandemonium
different personalities for bots keep the gameplay interestingconsstarts off pitifully easy gets painfully impossible somewhat towards the end
some missions come down to luck when youre actually revived after a death near a helpful weapon
graphics arent anything to scream about
ai is extremely cheap on some missions where there are expert bots
at some point for about  of the people who play this your blood will be boiling at how impossible this game can really seemoverall this is the best first person shooter that ive ever played think goldeneye  and then improve it in almost every way and one of the best and most complete experiences ive ever had
the only real letdown is the insane ai as you move onthis game has kept me sane on days where im usually boredwhile not perfect it has very few shortcomings so im giving it a perfect  i hope you enjoy it at least half as much as i did for that will surely be saying somethingfrom  to  for the day i will say a eight or nine
see in the game you have to kill your friend or be buddys and then go after the computer characters
there is like  weapons at least ant you get to choose the weapons the mission ect
good game for the daythis is an excellent followup to goldeneye
as critics and gamers alike have said before everything you thought was missing from goldeneye is in perfect dark
the attention to detail surpasses that of goldeneye by far and the gameplay with the help of the ram expansion of course is twice as smoothhow do you describe this game
think quottomb raiderquot meets quotgoldeneyequot meets quotthe xfilesquot and there you have it
you are joanna dark a top agent with elite carrington institute researching and investigating the mysterious datadyne corporation and thier evil conspiracy to assist an alien invasion
gameplay is very similar to goldeneye moving targeting shooting and using items will be all to familiar for fans of the  calssic
the new weapons ranging from small handguns to automatic handcannons to alien xray guns the quotfarsightquot gun is so much fun its silly are fun to use and much more useful as well
each weapon has a primary and secondary function
for example proximity mines have a secondary function to act as a homing device for proximity mines and other hidden threatsmultiplayer levels have me thoroughly amazed
there are several new multiplayer arenas and two classics from goldeneye the complex and the temple  each with a few new surprises
the new arenas are incredbile ranging from huge mazes that make the classic complex look not so complex to smaller arenas for the fans of the basement and archives levels in goldeneye
you also have the option of adding any number of computercontrolled players of several different skill levels to add to the challenge
the high tech weapons with all their new gadgetry make the game really fun to play in multiplayer modesolo missions follow a gripping storyline filled with conspiracy intrigue espionage and yes science fiction
your battles take place on air force one deep beneath the desert at area  under the ocean aboard alien vessels and deep within alien ruins
newer puzzles obstacles and secrets await you in just about every level
the dialogue adds to the realism of the game both during play and between levels in detailed cutscenes which develop the overall story
but be advised this game is rated quotmquot so the graphics and dialogue are not recommended for our younger playersof all the new features my favorite is the new cooperative missions option
thats right now you can complete a level as a team via splitscreen during what would normally be a solo mission
imagine how much easier this would have made the control room mission in goldeneye with an extra person to watch your back and natalias
likewise you can play conteroperative missions as well and play against each other during a mission
this is just as much fun as normal multiplayer except now you are part of the story as wellthis is a great game
if you are trying to decide between this and the new bond game then buy this one
it is much better than quotthe world is not enoughquot in every possible aspect
the weapons the levels the gameplay and the graphics cannot compare
if you liked goldeneye youll love this gameyou cant beat the classics nes snes and now even n is considered classic
perfect dark will be fun for the rest of my life
the game itself is in great condition and i will be playing this one frequentlybeing a gamer used to the slower paced moods of rpgs puzzle games and the like i did not expect to overly enjoy this gamejust goes to tell you first impressions aint everything ehbeing extremely similar to  goldeneye another rareware game on the n that still sells well this  game is not only fun for its involving and often humorous plotline but  also for its ridiculously fun multiplayer capabilities
going head to head  with your friends is fun but the fun adds up even more when you see the  new gaming modes rare has added in
veterans of the genre will recognize  themes like quotcapture the flagquot and quotking of the hillquot
in addition the option to play quotcounteropquot is included  where  one player takes on the role of the heroine and the other player takes  control of the enemies in pretty much any of the single player  missionsin addition players have to work to get all the fun stuff   most game modes weapons and difficulty levels are only unlocked after the  player has played through a significant portion of the single player game  and possibly completed certain tasks
its well worth it to do so trust  me
with well over  different weapons to choose from multiplayer is the  main reason to buy this gamethe one downfall is the requirement of the  n memory expansion pak to play more than  of the game
without it  the standard n doesnt have enough ram to handle perfect darks intense  graphics
serious gamers wont find this a problem though as they should  already have one and those that dont will find that some places will even  sell you the pak amp perfect dark together for a cheaper pricei loved this game as a kid so when i had the chance to get it later in life i just had to
classic bond shoot em upi bought this game having played  quite a bit which was made by the same people and is one of the greatest n games ever made
the advantage that perfect dark has is in the multiplayer combat
in addition to friends you can have up to  computers playing in the game with any combination of teams that you want
this is fun with several real friends or just for playing by yourself against others
the ai is smart enough to be extremely challenging at the hardest difficulty levels or slowdumb enough for a new player to learn against at lower difficulty levels
newer systems have better multiplayer capabilities online or hooking up multiple xboxes for halo parties etc but for the n this is as good as it gets and if you like to play against computers instead of real people then this is as good as any newer system games that ive seenthis is definatly  of the best games for the n i dont think i can think of any other ones as good as it make sure u have the expansion pak to get the most out of the game otherwise u can only play the multiplayer ive had the game for over  a year now and i still love it
and check with ur parents if its ok to get it if ur under ages  here are just a few reasons why i still love it the graphics control sound are all great and belive me u wont get bored of this anytime soon unless u get perfect dark  that they say is gonna come out for the gamecube if u like st person shooters this is the game for youwowthis game brings back a lot of great memories
this game is the reason why you bought an n  controllers and bothered with investing in the expansion pack to unlock the entire game itself
this is perfect darkthe spiritual successor to goldeneye
rare was the company behind such favorites as donkey kong  the banjo kazooie games jet force gemini and diddy kong racing
perfect dark set out to be better than goldeneye and provide everything that you needed in a first person shooter
they succeeded and went beyond thatperfect dark was released in  and you control joanna dark a secret agent who sets out to investigate a shady corporation and it is set in the future
it packed twice the punch of goldeneye in the way of better graphics awesome music smarter ai
pretty impressive at the time better weapons and nearly limitless customization of multiplayer matches and fun multiplayer modes
perfect dark was so much fun to play with or without your friendsthe single player mode has a great story and keeps you motivated while playing through it
the graphics and sounds are great
the enemies are smarter than in goldeneye and depending on the level of difficulty will bring the fight to you
the music sets the mood and keeps you going as you shoot the enemies
the  player cooperative mode has you taking on the enemies with a friend and with the split screen you can take out objectives together or opt to pick out which objectives you and your friend to do and meet with them somewhere else in the stage
it works very well
the  player counteroperative mode puts a twist on the  player coop mode the first player takes control of joanna while the second player takes control of an enemy walking around in the stage you choose to play
the nd player must take out the st player by any means necessary
if the first player eliminates the second player then the second player assumes control of another enemy in that same stage and tries to eliminate the first player etc
etcthe multiplayer modes are the reasons you keep on playing after you beat the main game
you can customize just about anything the music the number of players the time limit the kill limit weapons you can use the character you use as well as the name and attributes handicap settings and the number of simulants the bot controlled characters as well as the difficulty level and role of the simulants itselfso many great things to say about this game but there is one flaw that made me give it  starsthe graphics get crazy ass choppy when there is a lot of action going on
this is especially true when you have  human players and  bots playing in the same match or when you get punched in the face as the screen gets blurry to mimic your vision after it happens to you in real life
if you dont have it and you love fpss get this game and be sure to have the expansion pack or you wont get to play everything
highly recommendedi totally missed out on this one during that fabled era when the n was a modern console
fps games were never my cup of tea but out of vague interest i picked a used copy of perfect dark up for my collection of n gamesstory its hard to follow at points
basically this corporation called datadyne is up to no good aliens are involved and its to joanna dark and the carrington institute to save the day
the story is resolved at campaigns end but im told that the full story awaits those who complete the game on perfect agentcontrol perfect dark is a firstperson shooter and the controls work pretty well by n fps standards
theyre completely customizable too
i prefer to play it with the analog for aiming and the cbuttons for moving but you can do the opposite which is the default setup or even flip the thing around and use the dpad
theres also the option to use two n controllers to simulate analogs but i find anyone doing that hard to imaginegameplay its easily some of the best fps gameplay to be had with this console
its very similar to goldeneye but perfect dark has some finesse that goldeneye did not
there is voiceacting reloading animations guards that hobble when you shoot them in the leg and probably other things
just think goldeneye  and youve got a good picture perfect darks gameplaythe multiplayer is top notch too
you can add in bots as you try to shoot your friends
i prefer goldeneye because of its golden gun mode but perfect dark is right up there for those who lack that preferencegraphics age has hit these rare fps games like a ton of bricks but they were quite nice at the time of release
even now perfect dark has moments of visual niceties
the carrington institute the datadyne level the submarine level and the one where youre on the alien craft all look pretty decent even now
the plane crash level alas i dont think it looked good then
p outside of those highs and lows youve got your standard n quality graphics which have a certain charm about them to us retro gamer typesmusic its nice
the individual tracks all fit the levels to which they correspond
there are many moments of awesome within the soundtrackas with all rare n games theres a lot of replay value to be had with perfect dark
there are higher difficulties with additional objectives seemingly smarter ai and less available ammunition
im not sure if like this game enough to see it all the way through on perfect agent but id certainly attest to its star quality
recommended to anyone who collects these sorts of older gamesi really like this game
the deathmatch has had me coming back for more and i thought that i would never ever quit the single player mode
i can still hear my friends yelling at me to get the hell to the deathmatch or they were going to hit me with a chair
they did too
even though the sixtyfour is sinking like the titanic it has a library of awesome games
including this one
buy this one off this site
it is only twenty bucks
trust me that is a deal
buy it todaythis game is cool
but you need an expantion pack to play the missions
you need a memory card to play the challenges and save
this game is a tiny bit like  goldeneye
but its story line is very different
at firstyoure killing bad humans
but later in the game you kill bad aliens and help good aliens
it has two levels from  that you can unlock in the challenges but the actual story line is about aliens
the good thing about this game is that you can beat the missions with other people
you cant do this on  golden eye
this is a cool game and if you dont have it then you should get itthis game is perfect
perfect firstperson shooting perfectguns almost perfect graphicsits a challenging game not like shoot everything you see
you have to protect people and things like bigheaded skinnybody aleins an idiotic wreakless agentand the guns theres more than i can count a handgun youstart out with has lasersight and can be used with a silenceror a scope its called a falcontheres all kinds of missions i havent even beat the wholething and i sit in front of my n day and night and did i mention nightvision and on three of your missions are in area  infiltrate the base rescue a bigheaded englishspeaking smartalic alein namedelvis escape with elvis also known as protecter oneanyway if you like firstperson shooting kickbutt guns andshooting guns out of your enemies making them surrender and wettheir pants youll love this gamewith a game made by the same developers as goldeneye  for n it is nearly impossible to go wrong
perfect dark does not disappoint
in fact i am going to go out on a limb and say that perfect dark is better than goldeneye here is whygraphics  goldeneye set the bar when it was released and perfect dark surpasses it beautifly
although the graphics are very similar in nature everything is much clearer and smooth looking
the guns look much more realistic and the special effects are upgraded
it isnt a dramatic difference but goldeneye had graphics far ahead of its time to begin with and this game still satisfies
in fact it does much more than satisfysoundmusic  the music also is quite similar to goldeneye
it has the same unique sound to it and every track suits the level
the music in perfect dark has much more of a technoesque sound though
the music in goldeneye set the mood quite well and so does perfect darks except now it is much more noticeable and louder
the sound effects are great especially the reaper and the guns sound realistic
there are some voiceover moments that are laughable but thats about itcontrols  the amazing control scheme that made goldeneye so great has made a flawless return
you use the r button to aim and the control stick to move the cursor around and its easier since your screen doesnt always move with the cursor a flaw that ruined every ps shooter for me
i absolutely despise the double control stick aiming scheme used in halo and killzone the games werent that wonderful to begin with though especially halo avoid that one at all costs
anyway no complaints here either
so far so perfectstroylinegameplay  if i were to complain about anything this would have to be it but only on a minor level
the gameplay is flawless and retains that goldeneye feelingbut the storywell i wish i could say the same
while definitely not a bad storyline it isnt at all memorable
basically it is the generic  aliens are attacking and we must destroy their base ruitine
during the first half of the game the storyline is well executed but the horror begins later on
basically you meet up with a cute little alien named elvis later onand discover some interesting things
the first half are spy missions similar to goldeneye just more featuristic
but later on it turns into a halodeal something i wasnt looking forward to
actually when i played this game when it first came out i hated the solo missions but loved the multiplayer
after playing through the game again i can say that the solo missions are indeed very fun but i never found myself getting attached to them or wanting to finish the game on the perfect agent difficulty setting
overall the solo missions arent the masterpiece that was goldeneye but given the fact that the gameplay is the same as goldeneyes it still manages to be funmultiplayer  the multiplayer is so good in this game that i decided to give it its own category
unlike goldeneye where you had to pick a weapon scheme this game lets you custon design the weapons selection
theres a whole array of sims too and you can put up to  on at once
the nostalgia of this games multiplayer is just amazing and hard to fathom very difficult
you can also choose from a whole plethora of sim types venge sim turtle sim they get a barrier for a long while but they movem extremely slow making for hilarious moments
difficulty settings for sims are meat easy normal hard perfect and dark
dark sims basically can do maneuvers that humans cannot kinda like robobots or something of that sort
add  friends yourself and  sims to the mix including teams colors and a whole array or multiplayer schemes king of the hill license to kill etc and you are setting yourself up for a indefinite blast
i cant even begin to explain how fun this is you just have to experience it for yourself
i have played killzone and other newage shooters and can still say pd surpasses them to extraordinary lengths
also lest we forget the challenges
the challenges are extremely fun missions where you have to accomplish a certain deed and if completed you unlock new stages weapons and sims for multiplayer
you can also play the challenges with up to  other people but the difficulty level goes sky highmultiplayer stages  i wish rare would have designed more goldeneyeesque multiplayer stages
most of the new stages are rather generic and not very innovative
there are a few great ones sewers ravine and some others whose names i forget but overall the stages have a rather dull and uninspired look
dont fear however because the goldeneye favorites are back
facility how called faculty or some other odd name returns as basically a ported but slightly upgraded version of the goldeneye level
another favorite complex is back and the same can be said about complex basically a ported version
temple also returns although unfortunately i am not a fan of this multiplayer stageoverall  solo missions asside perfect dark is arguably the best first person shooter ever made
the multiplayer is worth it alone and for a petty  or  bucks you cannot pass this game upmade by the people that brought us goldeneyethis game takes place in the future with a super spy by the name of joanna dark
with the same control sceme graphics engine this game brings the same amount of fun as its predecessor
this game has an awesome multi player mode plenty of unlockable cheats
this game is a shining example of how great the nintendo  really isthis is one of the best and funnest ever nintendo  game
this game is much better than james bond  the object of the game is very fun and easy to learn
you go around and pick up different kinds of guns
its not like in some games where you ahve the same lame old gun
there are simple shotguns or huge sweet guns
you also go around picking up ammo
then you walk around in a huge building with many doors ladders stairs and pipes to go through or cross to try and find you opponent and start shooting at them
once you get killed you have to look for more sweet guns and ammo againw hich makes the game so much more challenging and funner
if you own james bond i wouldnt say you should buy this game because it is basically the same but if you are deciding between bond or perfect dark definitely get perfecft darkif you read my review of rainbow six on dreamcast you may remember me saying how it was a huge downer
you also may remember me saying to quotskip r and go immediately to perfect darkquot
so now im reviewing perfect dark
this is the best reason to have an n
first off the graphics are really good
after conkers bad fur day this game most likely has the best n graphics
the frame rate is smooth and ultimately very playable for the player and multiplayer modes
the characters in the cinemas dont move their mouths at all but so what
their faces are usually looking at another character or somewhere that the player cant see
the sounds are also very good here
very realistic sound effects for the guns and other objects and weapons are helpful for creating the perfect mood
but the best parts about the sound are the voices and the footstep noises
when you walk you hear your feet moving along any terrain you are on whether its snow carpet chain link floors or ladders and they match the speed you are moving at
the voices also are very well done
usually voices in games are so melodramatic or silly and unserious that they make you hate the characters or wish you were back in the day when voices didnt exist in games
but here the voices suit the characters so well and they are so serious that they make you care about these characters
youll feel bad when cassandra de vries gets her comeuppance when you fail a mission resulting in elviss the alien of courseor daniel carringtons death and youll shed a few tears when dr carrol make his incredibly noble decision late in the game
another good point is the story
it reminds me of goldeneye meets the xfiles and its like watching a movie
and like a good flick it keeps you engrossed and enthralled until the end
all these points i made are good but how does the game handle
even better then goldeneye did
if youve played goldeneye before youll feel right at home with perfect dark
im not kidding i had the controls down the moment i started moving around
even if you didnt play goldeneye youll still get into this game with relative ease
plus the new control methods like the popup weapon menu and simulant command menu are easy to learn
the best part about this game though is the mutilplayer mode
there are so many options to choose from and you can play the game however you want to
along with four human players you can add up to  computer controled characters known as simulants and again you can edit anything you want to with these guys
want to mix body and head types to make for a funny looking character human or simulant
you can do it
want to make enemies so skilled that they exceed the performance of real humans
you can do it
one thing though make sure you get an expansion pak sold seperatelywith the game cause youll need it to play  and  player and  player story mode
if you have an n you must buy this game
youll love itparents note as good as this game is its not for the kiddies
it contains strong language and lots of blood so it earns its mature rating ages  and up
but if your kids are too young for this game and they still want to play it try goldeneye and the world is not enough instead
theyre less violent then perfect dark but still be aware of their teen ratings ages  and up
if your kids are still too young for any of these games let them play banjotooie
theres a segment in the game that plays out a lot like perfect dark albeit much less violent with its everyone rating ages  and up and you can still play it mutiplayer
but even if your old enough to play perfect dark give all the games i mentioned a try goldeneye the world is not enough banjotooie
but back to the main point perfect dark is a classicif you have never heard of perfect dark or have never played it then you are missing out
this is the only game in its genre for the n to match the gameplay and graphics of goldeneye   i swear by this game and name it one of the best games of all time
great replay value multiplayer and single player missions makes this game worth purchasing for any amount of moneyi like alot of fpsand perfect dark is one of them on top with other games like doom and quakeperfect dark has some of the best graphicsbecause they arent duke nukem enemys who just fly or move like chess pieceswhere you dont see there legs movethey walk and talki think the story is pretty goodand the weapons are very coolmy fav being the farsightsingle player will have you staying up daystrying to figure out how to kill thisand multiplayer has  modesjust like alot of other fpscoop and a deathmatch style thingin death matchyou can have simulants or humansor bothin cooplets say theres nothing like shooting you friend in the back when they are shooting enemiesoverallthis game rocksand if you like thistry doomquake and wolfenstineok no no
there is only one goldeneye   nothing else can touch s spot in gaming history
but
perfect dark has its own place in the fps hall of fame
while  it uses the same gameplay engine as  it has its own charm
goldeneye is based on a movie which came from a character created in he s
perfect dark is all futuristic
and this was the first d futuristic game to be done right in my opinion
the single player missions have kept me coming back for years with their well done themes story  gameplay
besides blasting away at overarmored fancy gun totin space dudesthe story  surroundings will engross you
or at least they did in the early s
and the best yetat the time was the fanfintastic multiplayer
having  player death match would have been badas  but the option of adding several drones to the game made it soo much better
to me its the first preonline console multiplayer to capture the feel of current online gaming
ltdoes that make sense
what im saying is adding all those drones to the game made it much more chaotic which equals more fun
all these random enemies mixed in with your friends it really just made the game somethin else
hadnt been done before this well on a console
love this game absolutely would recommend it for n owners looking for another classicperfect dark is  well perfect
the graphics are some of the best ive seen on the n
and with  different guns count em
 its no wonder how it came to be on top  or at least close
and if each gun has a second ability you could tally the guns at  since each gun has two modes
i love the simulents and how with them you can do oneplayer singleplayer and ive never really been able to do that i used to have to plug in the second player controller and beat somebody just standing there not a actul person
this is a great game
so stop looking at your computer screen and buy itthis game is still the king of offline fps even  years laterbotsyescombat simulator with a character editor complete stat tracking challenges up to  players and a ton of options for bot ai
and weaponsyou betno replay value short single player campaign strictlyonline multiplayer and the fact that youll probably have to be buying the sequel that gets crapped out next yearheck no
the ai
is no pushover characters react like they should and limp around when shot in the arm or leg
death animations add to the realism so it doesnt seem like youre shooting wave after wave of cardboard cutouts like in many of todays fps gamesthis is one of the best fps ever made this is an example of the quality one game can achieve and is a great alternative to the quantity of short games that lack options and force you to buy the sequel year after year this is prevalent in console games these dayswrestling games of today are having the same issuesthis is my favorite game of all time need some insight
check out the review on ign or read up some of the other reviews  reviewsi have had this game for years and have just finally beat it
perfect dark rocks
this is the best n game out there
the gameplay weapons and battles are all good
im waiting to get perfect dark zero but that will only be when someone sells an xbox  for less than somebody says that video games makes killers and adds violencei disagree that comment because if that be a whole truth then i will be a serial killer
on the other hand there are a little human group whom video games can make more aggressive but generally this sentence is not trueperfect dark is one of my all time favourite games because its challenging interesting beautiful addictive funny and awesome
one player game you have survive many missions which are not so easy at all
use guns your brain and be careful especially if you play on hard or dark difficult levels
there are many humans and monsters who are trying to do you in
be fast and smart girl because you have survive all these difficulties
one level you have to protect the president of united states and other level your mission is kill all alieswhy i like this game so much
because twofour player game is an unbeliveable great option
there are so much good weapons for exemple slayermissile that you can lead straigh to your enemyproxy mines  blue mines that surprises your friend golden magnum one shot and your head is redyou can play without computer players and your friedsyou can lead computers players agaist your friedsyou can choose your player clothes and headthere are so many options that it takes many pages to write them downfinally this is must game for all shooteraction games friedsnotion
dont take this game too seriously because you are killing only visual characters not real humansperfect dark is the all time best first person shooter for n
it has awsome gameplay
the graphics are good not great
and the only problem is on multiplayer
if you hav a bunch or people playing it gets really fuzzy and slow
i highly suggest buying this game if you like stp shootersthe best fsg in the world
lots of missions on different difficulties will make you play this game over and over
multiplayer is way more advanced than goldeneye which makes it easier to setup and more extras for multiplayer to
so go buy this game it is a mustperfect dark is an incredible game it is one of the best fps ever
you are agent dark the carrington instututes best secret agent
you are sent out on a mission to try to find out what the evil datadyne corporation is up to
the game pushes the n hardware to the max which is the reason for some minor slowdownperfect dark has more replay value than any game ever created
the combat simulator is prcticaly a game of its own more on that laterthe solo misions in perfect dark are great lots of variety not too hard but not too easy
the ai
in the game is superb
the guards are incredibly inteligent if you shoot there gun out of there hands you will even hear them say oh no my gun they will pull out a pistol or may even go for your gunon to the combat simulator the best part about the game
you can customize every single thing and minor detail to youre liking
you can even create a profile where all youre multiplayer stats are savedlike killsdeaths etc
one great thing about the combat simulator is that you can add up to eight simulatscomputer controlled players which makes it even more funprosgreat replay valuelots of completly custimizable optionsgreat aigood storylinelots of diverse weaponstons of unlockable cheatsconsexpansion pack is needed to play most of the gamesome minor slowdown in graphicaly heavy situationsjust remember parents this game is quite violent definitly not for enyone uder thanks for reading my reviewthis game is just plain awesome in every aspect imaginable
many characters options stages weapons game scenarios and single player modes are abound
the nearinfinite replay value alone means that this game deserves five starsthe only problems i noticed were a sometimespicky framerate and some poor multiplayer stage designsthe graphics are definitely impressive
the control scheme works perfectly
i also found the story to be fairly impressive
tremendous improvements over goldeneye in perfect dark are obvious
the addition of simulants and a challenge mode add exponentially to the replay value
the difficulty levels vary greatly which increases the potential audience greatlythe indescribable amount of options weapons etc
is by itself reason to give this game five stars
the great graphics sound and control also highlight the games abundance of features
a recommended buy for any fan of the shooter genreperfect dark is awsome fun
oh the graphics and the game play
this is nintendo s best game yet
perfect dark was made by the same people who  made the popular game goldeneye bond
they must have lost the license to  bond yet they were still able to make a very cool and very graphial spy  oriented first player shootem up action packed video game
do yourself a  favor and buy this game i love it and my friends love itjames bond sucks compared to agent dark
shes the best spy in the world
this game is so hot that it would literally take you about an hour to read my review
the missions multiplayer and challenges are awesome
i havent beaten the game and i have about  weapons already
there are about  characters to choose from
you must get this game or i will come to your house with agent dark and shoot you if you dont have itperfect dark is without a doubt the best firstperson shooter the n has to offer
moving along the lines of the great n game goldeneye perfect dark has made what goldeneye a success and added on to it to create a great game with much help with the expansion pak
for me without a doubt the best oneperson level has to be the first one
where else can you go through a office building shooting practically everyone you see
the music and the tone of the level reminds a person of the terminator movies
the other great level has to be chicagostealth
this is another great level that the music and dark tone which is hypened by the rain makes a great level that youd wish the developers had made into a multiplayer level
the other levels are not as good as these two but are still great in their own ways
the sound of the game is another highlight
i love listening to the bad guys yell quotive been shotquot quotis that a bulletquot quotholyquot among others
these are just classics
the multiplayer of perfect dark is good and bad at the same time
the good is that you can play with bots
the bad is that you can play with bots
unfortunately the developers havent given the player the best multiplayer levels
the first level on the game itself inside the datadyne office tower would have been excellent
anyway perfect dark is a game that helps those who complained that their wasnt enough adult games for the n
perfect dark is in that category and is a great gameperfect dark is an awesome game and has very good control but the story is questionable
dark is the pefect agent at her academy but she hasnt  even been on an actual mission
anyway the graphics really take advantage  of the expansion pak
the sound is really good and the difficulty is  moderate and the last level is really really really hard even on agent
well no matter what games you like perfect dark will satisfy any gamer oyu  cant go wrong with this onebefore i had perfect dark i had  goldeneye
since at the time i had no idea what perfect dark was i had no idea goldeneye was crap compared to it
then i got perfect dark and i felt like throwing goldeneye out the window
this game blows it out of the water
pd is an amazing follow up to a great game and in what pd has that  doesnt is  multiplayer challenges test your skills against a bunch of meatsims incredibly easy or a few perfectsims uh perfect
 and there are thirty of them  multiplayer sims as i said before you can choose the difficulty and even type of sim youd like to face
from meat  perfect and even venge sim peacesim and fistsim amoung many others  complex arenas this what goldeneye failed in
the multiplayer arenas in that game were at most very small and it was easy to spot your adversary quick  carrington institute this is your base you can look around and even try the shooting range combat training and item training  perfect dark has incredible n graphics perhaps some of the best the system has ever had
goldeneyes graphics were horrible  cooperative play you can either play with a human or even a sim to get started on the mission  counteroperative play this is by far the coolest addition to the game
one of the two humans is the good guy i mean girl and the other is one of the soldiers in the stage the soldiers can even take suicide pillspd is also a great  player game with i missions to play on agent special agent perfect angent and another to unlock if youre good enough
i like stages        and  the most only  is bad in my opinion
well im doneperfect dark is one of the best st person shooters of all time if you can only buy one game for the n get perfect dark they dont make games like this anymore get this game you wont regret itthis is a well done game
the game play is smooth the weapons are a lot of fun and the variety of game modes is really nice
some of the maps are quite large which makes for a lot of running around looking for other players to kill
i especially like the fact that the bots in this game come with different skill levels
the more advanced ones will definitely give you a run for your money
switching weapons or using devices isnt always as smooth as id like it to be but overall this a great game to add to your collectionperfect dark is a simply amazing game
i know im writing this almost  years after the game came out but i assure you i beat the game years ago
i was rummaging through some old games several hours ago when i rediscovered this gem
to think i had almost forgotten how good this game was
sure compared to games like doom halflife  halo  and golden eye rouge agent this game has horrable graphics but this is very easily overlooked
the story is engrossing the weapons are fantasic and the multiplayer is the best thing since online play
the controls take some getting used to ive been spoiled by these controlers with two thumb sticks lol and the n controls are a little too sensitive for this game corrected by some autoaiming functions but you will get over this
the guy before me who wrote his review  years ago isnt entirely right
is the game difficult
yes
is it impossible
no
i beat the whole thing on medium difficulty and got half way through hard before finially retiring the game i hope to one day beat the whole game on hard though
the game will actually require you to practice if you want to beat those higher difficulties thats why there are tons of training ops and a combat simulator and you will have to try missions over
the game is not nearly as hard as you may be led to believe if you want it to be though the game can be set on some insainly hard difficulties were talking about so difficult that they could be concived as a cruel joke rather than a difficulty level but thats only if you want to set the game this high
the game offers so much variety you will hardly get bored with single player and enough customization options for multiplayer that it rivals most modern games which is pretty sad
from stealth to hostage rescue to defense to assault to reconance to assassination to infiltration there are so many things you will do in single player
i some how get a feeling that this review will never be read but if by some chance your wandering eyes glance over this review and you are still the proud owner of an n with and expansion pack then believe me when i say that if you find this one you cant afford to not pick it up
this remains one of my alltime favorite games dont miss ita solid fps
some people prefer  goldeneye over perfect dark
i love both games because they were made by the s gaming powerhouse studio known as rare
perfect dark was no exception  rare had struck gold again with this gamedo yourself a favor and buy itit is really great to call your friends to play a multiplayer game
perfect dark really deserves the title of the best multiplayer game for the nthe graphics are amazing specially using the expansion pack that is required to access most of the games features
sound quality is remarkable
from dialouges to weapon realoading sound effects everything is very well reproducedthe only problem that this game has are the slowdowns
if you want to play with  other friends and some ai with hires youll have some problems
the solution
turn off hires and have funyou have to get this game
let me tell you how it worksplay as secret agent joanna darkup to four players can play in a deathmatchthere is coopreative campaign which is excellentgraphics are so amazing it looks like you are really killing real peopleblood animations are excellent cause blood splatters all over the walls floors and ceilings

this is one of the best n games next toconkers bfd and loz ocarina of timelatesthis is my favorite spy game in the world
its based in the near future where there is flying cars ufos and anything else futuristic you can think of
it has awesome weapons a creative variety of characters an interesting story and many levels to complete
to top it all off if you dont like playing major missions alone invite a friend to play coop or activate how many simulants up to that you want to help you out
however its more fun with a human player
also there are crazy combinations of multiplayer combat
you can have up to  human players and  simulants and give them a specific personality
believe me when i say that it gets crazy
its a game that will forever be a nintendo classic
perfect dark zero may have better graphics but perfect dark for the nintendo  has the best story and gameplay
i recommend this game to those who like bond but feels there is something important missing  the whole idea of perfect dark is what is missingthis was purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday weekend i had her check it out
it works perfectlyafter rareware made the stunning shooter game goldeneye gamers everywhere hung their heads in disappointment when the decision was made not to accept the offer to make tomorrow never dies
but rare without the inherent limitations of a movie license created something much bigger much bolder something that few companies could ever pull off perfect darkjoanna dark is a futuristic secret agent who gets tangled in a plot involving a corrupt business corporation a plan to kidnap the us president and an alien partner named elvis
rare packed so much into this cartridge that its hard to find a place to begin
graphics are stellar with massive levels and real lighting
all characters are motioncaptured and move with realism and the reloading animations for the weapons are some of the coolest youll ever see like the alien sniper rifle that absorbs its clips or the submachine gun which reads ammo like a scanner
the oneplayer mode alone will keep a person busy for hours
enemies have strong artifical intelligence  they dont run into your gunfire they hold back wait for reinforcements or dodge and attack from another angle
mission objectives increase as the difficulty level increases and real stealth is required to make it through alive in short the only way to win is to completely immerse yourself in joanna darks world and pretend everyone is fleshandblood real
aiding in this virtual reality is dolby  surround sound so you can hear bullets whiz by or track enemies by the sound of their voicethen theres multiplayer mode which is the game that never ends
four players and up to  computercontrolled opponents can participate with bucketloads of options
custom set the various weapons you want to appear around a level including what weapon appears where
you have portable sentry guns sniper rifles that shoot through walls and a guided missile launcher to name some of the more unique weapons at your disposal
set the timer for  kill  kills  kills or unlimited
activate a matrixlike slowmo choose from varied arenas set up colorcoded teams mixandmatch bodies and heads to create the perfect character
with regards to the computercontrolled opponents you can adjust their difficulty level so that theyre either meat for you to gun down or invincible enough to make you wet your pants
this list does not even begin to touch on all the options avaliable or the possibilities for fun when they are mixedbut wait theres more
other modes of play include a twoplayer missions mode and a counterop mode where one player jumps between bad guys to stop the other player ala matrix
the games overworld is also a training center which has several tasks of its own to be completedif you must know the game isnt technically perfect
for one the framerate can be pretty bad at times but usually youll be having too much fun to notice
the storyline for all its hype feels somewhat undeveloped
finally the expansion pak is required to unlock most of the game but the extra money to buy the pak is well worth it
overall these are insignificant complaints
sorry that this review is so long but nothing else wouldve done this game justice
your jaw will drop when you see what rare has accomplished this time
this is a game that can proudly sit alongside your nextgen console shootersperfect dark has the best multi player mode
this is not just because the graphics rock or the weapons each have a weapon option
its because of the ability to use simulants
they add an extra spice to this game which gives it almost unlimited replayability
you can actually play a multi player mode where you and your friends are on the same team
sims too easy
just crank up the difficulty until you dont think that anymoreyou can even play the missions two player
i cannot emphasize what a cool feature this is in this truly great game
if you only buy one more n game before you switch to a new system buy this onethis game is the best game that anyone could play on any console and i swear it is
the graphics sound controls weapons and multiplayer all  by a long shot
people who say that this game  dont know the meaning of a good game
what i have described above is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help you gamersinstead of blabbing on about how much i love this game im going to list the awesome features of this gameweaponry there are  new weapons  and even when completing all the weapons training with gold medals on each  weapon some of the old geoldeneye weapons cool huh
heres a list  of the pistols available in the game falcon similiar to the trusty  walther ppk the pp from goldeneye this is your average weapon  avaliable on almost every single level
its accurate it has a laser sight  for even more accuracy its got a quick reload about  seconds an  eight round clip and quick fire
although i dont get why for stealthy  missions they give you a shiny gunfalcon silenced see above same  as the falcon but with a silencer for even more stealthfalcon  scope see falcon same as the falcon listed above but with a scope  to hit distant targets great for a distant kill with the power of the  falcon pistolmagsec the magsec is not a grand weapon and is only  available once on single player but its certainly not a bad gun and is  terribly deadly when paired
its not extremely accurate but it fires fast  and loads quick just like the falconmauler the mauler is one of  maybe the best pistols in the game
it not only has a huge clip   rounds
 but it also fires quick and loads almost as fast
its secondary  mode yes
guns have secondary modes just hold b
is a charged up shot
you just let the ammo go down by  from  to  for example then fire  your opponent will be killed in one shot
very convenientphoenix this  is a maian the grey alien race pistol that fires out quick laserlike  shots and its secondary mode great from a distance fires out large  fiery shells that do great damage to an opponentdy magnum similar  to the old cougar magnum from goldeneye but much better
it has great  range and absolutely no scatter damage
it can even shoot through doors
a  great allaround weapondy lx magnum this gun is not available in  single player but it is the weapon of choice of the fictional nra head  trent easton
very similar to the dy standard issue magnum in looks but  it can kill in only one shotthose were some examples of the weaponry  now on to the multiplayermultiplayer there are  new multiplayer  challenges
plus the addition of simulants computer controlled enemies  and  new multiplayer levels
along with six multiplayer  settingschallenges these are mulitplayer challenges that can be played  with one or four players and has rules for each match which when  completed may unlock a new setting or weapon or level which is then  available in multiplayerlevels  totally new and original multiplayer  levels along with three modified levels from goldeneye which are now as  fun as ever facility now dubbed felicity for copyright reasons  complex and temple which now actually looks like a temple
not all of  the new levels are great but some are better for different settings then  others although some of them are pretty bad the majority are good  thoughcharacters tons of characters are now available although the  face mapping feature was taken our probably because of the columbine  shooting which can be gained by defeating a multiplayer challenge
you can  also switch heads and put them on different bodiessimulants there are  now simulants you can fight in multiplayer on different settings meat sim  self explanatory easy simcomparable to an amateur normal sim  combarable to an average human player hard sim comparable to a very  good human player perfect sim self explanatory dark sim created by  the fictitious data dyne corporation this sim is almost impossible to  defeat
the sims can also be set to  different  characteristicssingle playerthe game is now seperated into   missions with seventeen levels plus three extra levels available when  defeating the game on different settings and one bizarre shooting level  called quotthe duelquotthe levels are split very well and some can  be more fun then others
some will seem like a tedious chore when playing  although the majority of others are a blastmore multiplayer
you can  also play the game single player missions against a friend
yes its  true
youre friend plays as an enemy and when killed respawns as another  enemy opponent until the level is completed or until joanna dark is deadthe game can also be played with a computerized ally your first choice  is velvet dark joannas sister but more are available when the game is  defeated on a different settinganother cool option is how you can walk  around your headquarters the carrington institute
here you can talk to  your boss daniel carrington although not much
and you can learn how to  fist fight be more accurate with each weapon learn about other characters  and ships and learn how to use cool gadgets like the camspy a hovering  little camera that is controlled by you by just moving it around with the  joy sticksome good features the game is clearly aimed for a mature  audience although it has both a paintball mode to filter out the blood  and a language filter to keep out all that bloody swearingmy only  grudge with the games are the casts american accents
although the  voiceover cast tried to put on their best american voices you can still  hear hints of british accents in there but who really caresps
be  aware of the dreaded voice of the head hacker in hacker central and listen  to how the president pronounces assumeperfect dark is hard to review because in many ways it is the same as rares previous shooter goldeneye  but in other ways it is so much better
in short perfect dark is the perfect nonofficial sequel to goldeneye   sure the settings are different and there are some different weapons after all this is a science fiction based game but overall you can still see the loving touches the developers brought back from goldeneyethe game is set in a well developed science fiction environment and many of the levels provide difficulties that are handled by the new features added to the characters options
the wide range of weapons is one of the major improvements over its predecessor goldeneye as well as the unique plot after all this one isnt based on a movie
so the plot is an interesting one involving alien invasions and government conspiracy and does keep the gamer interested throughout its run but without a doubt my favorite feature of this game that i found lacking in goldeneye  is the actual use of voice actors
joanna dark and all the other characters in this film have a voice we can link to their image while with goldeneye wed have to go back to the film to recall the voices of our charactersof course the major improvement over goldeneye  is the multiplayer feature which is fun and do to a wider range of weapons the gamer is allowed to execute new strategies so overall perfect dark really is an expansion of goldeneye  as well as being a great gaming experience by itselfthis is a game that is great to play backtoback with goldeneye  because you should probably learn the controls from goldeneye before you play this game because it makes it a lot simpler but i suppose you could play this before you play goldeneye but im someone who likes to playview in chronological orderso if you enjoyed goldeneye  as so many other people have over the years you should certainly dust off the nintendo  and come back to this perfectly worthy successorthis game is very sexy
it makes james bond look much better
i do not have the need to shoot like a maniac when im playing the manperfect dark had excelent graphics and phenomenal ideas for its time
unfortunately it has been overshadowed by the playstation  and newer shinier first person shooter games
but enough of that let me say what this game has done for fps fansperfect dark brought decent graphics for a  bit system and many new toys to a genre that is very difficult to make upgrades on
although i know a lot of the things in pd werent really quotnewquot and that pc games used a lot of the techniques before pd came out pd was the first to bring it all in and oneuped it by putting it on consolesecondary weapon fire i dont think there has been a console fps since that hasnt had a secondary weapons fireai bots yes you have always had that in single player but not in multiplayer
and the ability to not only conrtol their level of skill but also roughly how they would act
now that is something to be proud ofplay options sure goldeneye has capture the flag and a few other little games but pd brought in more games better options and just overall a lot more funweapon select getting sick of those crummy little guns in your weapons set
you and your friends just want to blow each other up with rockets
well then just make up your own set
go ahead select all the weapons you want or then again dont
slap each other silly its up to youcustom characters  this is something that was left out of timeslitters ive heard that a lot of the staff that worked on goldeneye left rare to become free radical
i happen to like my alien wearing a scubba mask and a trenchcoat
i think that although this option does not have much playability value it is kind of fun to see what sort of odd creations some people will come up witheven the newer ps games with all their fancy graphics cannot match up to pd in all aspects
lets just hope that the next installment of pd is just as good and has all the fun fun toys that the original has remember now kiddies that although rare is making what is being called quotperfect dark zeroquot at least some of the rare team has gone off to play on the free radical team well just have to sit and wait i guessi got my  in  at that time everyone was rating the playstation to be the best game console ever maybe they are right
but game like donkey kong  and perfect dark  zelda  turok mario and  some how keep the nintendo fans loyal these games were fun enough for kids yet challaging enough for and adult i love perfect dark and at that time i felt like this was the best fps ever i still think so i have a ps now yet i have never gotten rid of my  its that good perfect dark is one of my perfect collection  i will tell any one even if ps mauled  because of its games variation  is still the console for a true gamer most play station titles are easy by far so maybe thats why it was more popular perfect dark is the gamers gameit may not appear to be the best n game to everyone but quest is definitely a gem left behind by the bygone era of disc gaming
if you have an n you should check this game out at the very least
ive been obsessing over this game since i was a young child
buy this game
at least try it
its oldschool rpg for the n that was very rarely seenquest  is not only the greatest n game of all time its also the greatest video game of all time a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a n fan you wont be sorryamazing just like i remembered it from the s when it came outi loved this game and the stylequest  amazing
really
ok this game is so much dang fun i just couldnt believe it was so much fun
now nintendo  isnt suppossed to be an rpg system but this one just plain out blew every other rpg out of the water
quest has amazing graphicsthe best i have ever seen in any system
some dont like how enemies will pop up out of nowhere when you are outside but hello peoples
i think if you have a problem with that then you shouldnt be playing the game eh
after all the entire game is pretty much fighting those very enemies
eh hem now back to the games shining assests
the fighting system is wonder ful i love shooting fireballs and ice rays at enemies or just whacking the living daylights outta them with my staff
the last thing i have to say is that with all this nonsense coming out these daysplaystation and  xbox  psp that weird fly thing and other garbage it is a pure blessing that nintendo has the respect to make classics that are amazing and never get old
nintendo in a world of scams and stupid junk systems you guys rule
the best games are quest 
 yoshis story and super mario  dont buy into this new crapaka xbox  get the old classics that rule in gamingsome people dont want to admit it but the n had some of the coolest fps ever
doom is the best version of doom to ever be released for any system console or pc
perfectly rendered bulldog demons snarl at you in drones and theres nothing like the old chainsaw to mow them down
a classic that belongs in every n owners collectioni have a large collection of games but doom  is without a doubt one of my favorites
its one of those games thats addictive
gamers know what i mean the kind that you think about at school or work or anywhere else and make you anxious to get home and get back to playing it
i enjoyed the other doom games but this one really keeps you on the edgeif you love fps games or you just love doom you need to check out this version
its definitely alot better looking than anything that has come before it
but dont expect it to be quake or quake  because it isnt by any means
quotwhy would i be interested in it thenquot you may askwell its doom and id software made it so you know it has to be good
anyone whos played doom knows youre in for some intense gameplay when you play doom
and this game has it in spades
trust me its a difficult one but if youre a fps fanatic like meyoull make it through with only a few scratches
dont let the majority fool you there is alot to like about doom  its not like quake or quake  but then again its not supposed to beim not much for these types of games but doom kicks the rest to the dirt
the game is so much fun
i love the idea of shooting up demons
i have had the pleasure of playing any of the other doom games but i bet they rocki am another one that has recently pulled out their old n to play
looking through the bag of games i found doom  my love of doom began again
i have been a fan of doom ever since the original came out in  when i was ten years old  years old now
this is game is immense funman did this bring back old memories
doom  is a then updated version of the classic series
the demons looked better and still had the eeriness the series has always had
this game is also very challenging i find my self dying every now and then
luckily i have a n memory card that i can load so i dont have to start over without all of the weapons i have picked up along the waythis game is surprisingly lengthy hours of game play for the doom fan that will bring them to a state of heaveni recommend this game to anyone who still has an n and a video game store near by that sells oldused video games
this is definitely something to pick up
if you are just now discovering the wonderful world of doom this game is for youi love the doom series and the old ones are the best i have the gba version of doom and the ps version of doom and i also have doom  but the n version is the best all the great guns from the original are here and there are new levels with better graphics and the enemies are smarter and meaner than ever get this game doom fans like me wont regret iti remember freakin out when i got this game back when n was in
the game is so awesome and is the perfection of the original doom series
the weapons are nicely redone as are the demons
its a little difficult playing a game like doom using a controller rather than a keyboard and mouse but that is a small price to pay for playing a masterpiece like doomthe music is just plain eerie and the lighting and graphics are pretty good
i was also quite surprised that such a game would be on a console that mostly kids used the n
but anyways the game is cool and you should buy itthis game worked like a charm
it is a gift for my daughter and she was tickled that it works perfectlywhat i like most about this game is the new look of the weapons and monsters
this was the first doom game to really look different
the new weapons and monsters have an awesome design
the only ones that i think looked better in the original are the lost souls and cacodemons
every other monster is streamlined to look real nicethe final monster at the end is some kind of big ugly rat thing
an interesting new characterthe levels are pretty darn complicated i think even moreso than the previous doom games
it might only be because its harder to cheat on this game than the computer doom gamesi thought the music and atmosphere made the game creepy and the goofy skippedframe way the monsters moved made the game funny
its an interesting mixthis game is fun to play
if you like doom youll like this
theres cool levels and secrets just like in every doom gamethis game is an awesome first person shooter
i wouldnt say it is gorey and that bad well as for me i am  so i dont think so but i dont recommend it for childern under  they dont have much of a selection for guns but the ones that they have are pretty cool
the levels are quite hard and you are prone to die it level  and  level  is easy and simple and the enemies arent advanced yet
in level  you get to see more enemies
warning this game may be scary when played at  pm at night with lights off
this game has awesome sound effects
the music isnt much but it definately makes it scarier
when i first got this game i thought it would be like doom stupid really dark and bad graphics
i was totally wrong
it may be a little dark but its easier to see than doom
the graphics are exceptionalla and its defintely not stupid
it is somewhat addicting
the multiplayer is okay but it is only compatible with  players
you can die really easy in multiplayer
pretty good but could have been better
overall good game with an okay set of weapons and great levels
i recommend buying this used
im going for quake ii nextthis is the one game that got me into firstperson shooters
this same exact one
i didnt know what they were til this one came along and im glad that it did
talking about one intense experiencei would finish playing with my stomach all tied in knots
its that intense
but well worth it believe meif you like firstperson shooters you owe it to yourself to check this one out
definitely worth your hard earned bucksquake  is one of the best st person shooters i have ever played the game is very similer to doom so doom fans will like this game the game has multieplayer mode  player and  player with the expansion pack installed the multieplayer is a great feature and ads great replay value does the multieplayer feature make quake  better than doom no but its closeprobably the best game ever created by humans
i love killin me some dinosaurs in disco mode
you have to get lost in this game to really enjoy itlittle do people know that while quake was the first fully d firstperson shooter for the pc the first one for the console was turok dinosaur hunter
like quake it was a game that was totally immersive in which you felt like you were part of the action going on
you could look up or down jump and other things that you just couldnt do in fps at the time
while turok might not have turned heads quite as much as quake did for nintendo  owners this game deserved ever bit of the credit it deserved
i remember playing this game when it first came out and being totally in awe of the graphics and how deep this game was
it was like being on a huge jungle safari but instead of lions and tigers you had dinosaurs and other enemies you faced
keep in mind this is before goldeneye perfect dark or the quake series itself came out on the n
i really enjoyed the game myself and eventually bought it as well as the other three turok games that followed to add to my collection
as i play so many gamescourse if youve seen my long list of reviews youd know that from time to time i get out my old systems and play all my old favorites to see how they stack up to games today
if i find that i didnt write a review on them at that time i write one and give my feelings on it
which is why im writing one on this gamefor its time turok dinosaur hunter was one of the better games released for the n and is definitely one fps that every n owner should have in their collectiontirok is a great n
anyone should buy this game
too bad its not scary and dosent have real big dinosaurs
but the real let down in this game is that there is no multiplayerthis was a pretty good game
i dont like one shooter games but this one bit the dust
it was entertaining and it wasnt dull
this is a pretty good game
i recomend it to the gamer in youthis is my favorite game of all time for the n
i can play it for hours without getting bored
it is just so much fun and it brings back alot of memories of when i was younger playing it
this time i wont lend it to anyone so they can not give it back
awesome awesome gameive played this game for a long time and its one of the best shooter games
it may not have an obvious story but its still fun
the graphics arent bad the characters and creatures look great
the levels get harder as you progress through the game but its not impossible
the weapons are really cool especially the ones that you find later in the gamein  acclaim brought the very first arcade quality first person shooter to the n with turok a primordial theme that defined future genres that would have to actually animate the end level bosses making them more realistic trying to match what speilberg did four years earlier and come very close meaning turok was probably some of the best animation ever seen in a st person shooter
the story the levels the enemy ai all of this was very impressive for its time and acclaim have stayed ball players because of it
the graphics had people in awe
this was the end of  start of  i had never played or seen anything like this before
the n was an awesome engine
acclaim delivered a stunning entry game
never forget it
wowturok is friggin awsomeyou play as a dinosaur hunter and you basicly kill hunters andweird looking dinos
is awsome
its fun and action packedthe violence and gore in the game is very raw and gritythe blood looks like crushed cranberry sauceturok shows the people why he kicks assfilled with engaging weapons and more
itll keep you playing till the end
the bosses are amazing
i cant believe acclaim made this
great job
its a little to late to review
acctually i got this game when it first came out and same with all the other series
this is one of ns best games ever madethe music is awsome and the graphics for that time of year are awsomebottom lineget the gamei really have a lot of reasons to thank this game since it inspired me to want to become a game developer one day and for what ideas i already have lined up
this is one of the best scifi adventures ever created in gaming and it still retains it mastery of scifi adventures
your enemies are more intelligent than in the previous snes starfox and the graphics are far more detailed than in the original
the voiceacting is actually good which gives the game an authentic feel than it already has in sciencefiction
the explosions and all the other action is splendid and lucious in how good it really good it is
the missions are still exciting and lots fun and still compete with todays games
i love this game and nothing will ever change such a thingthe game that brought us the rumble packi cant really say the pack brought a whole new element to the game playit sort of did but the pack itself was so heave it made the already awkward n controller that much more difficult to controli usually all these years later just play the game without itthat saidi love star fox fun and very challenging game playespecially if youre going after those medals on every missionthe game can branch in different directions depending on what actions you take during certain coursesbeautiful graphics for its timecreative and difficult boss battlesthe characters themselves are a tad annoyingfalco being my main annoyanceother than that another top rate nintendo game for a system that belongs in front of everyones tvrecommendednot sure bout rumble pack as i didnt get the option in my game but this is one of the best games made
its flight sim tank sim and sub sim
multiple stories that shape difficulty multiple game play and multiplayer with secret third person shooter
tons of stuff to do with awesome levels such as id alike or train saving so many bosses and secrets
tons of story not bad grphx and training for controls
all in all the most you can get out of it for the money
definitely buy this game oh and lots of replayi first played this game in  and ive been hooked since
it is not excessively difficult but it is not easy either
different stages with different vehicles and hidden stages with hidden benefits provides hours of gameplay that will keep you entertainedi may not be as young as some of the players that wrote reviews here but i played the original starfox for snes as a kid
at the time the fx chip was marketing hype for some new d technology
nonetheless it has become a classic at my home
my dad was hooked on starfox since the beginningi bought some old n games and a n system about  years ago and starfox  was one of the games
naturally im hooked
the graphics are fairly prest century but its a very natural progression for starfox snesthd d graphics are colorful and saturated
there is also voice acting and some interesting levelsi missed the original twin blaster and wing damage voice effects
the new music also sounds rather corny as are the villainsstar fox is a game of strategy for me
you have to focus a lot or else you cannot beat it
you have a team of  fox peppy slippy and falco
you have to sweat onto a lot of different courses and meet certain objectives to win
i like the endings of levels toomultiplayer can support  player action
best used with rumble pakthink of cousin usa but the world i suggest for all n fans to have great condition full of funthe game worked perfectly fine but after a while youll notice this game is simple and repetitive
its fun though since i cleared the pak and im working my way back up again previously owned it early in my childhoodthis is a great racing game for the n and gave you car customization in one of the earlier game sby rewarding you for the more you played with a better car and graphics for itthis is a game filled with beautiful scenery
this might be a game for little children to play around with for an hourrareware set out to conquer marios hold on the kart genre and they did it in some truly epic ways
its not just the number of colorful tracks with unique challenges its that they make a racing game out of every element to this adorable adventure
control is smooth and tracks arent too difficult and you can play as any number of familiar rare characters some of which you wont ever see together again now that microsoft owns the developer and the music and sound are superb
while mariokart  is tearing up wii u homes this summer its nice to have this one in the background in case i want that old school feel behind the wheelyou cant beat the classics nes snes and now even n is considered classic
diddy kong racing will be fun for the rest of my life
the game itself is in great condition and i will be playing this one frequentlythis game is an original masterpeice
it has a large variety of both characters to race with and courses
the graphics are great for such an old game
this is a must have for n
especially if you love diddy kongdiddy kong racing is one of my favorite games on n
i love the coureses and the cool battle mode
i love the charactors and i would reccomend playing with  players or  to make the game more exciting
here is some games i would buy for n
diddy kong racingsuper smash brosmario kart and zelda gamesone of the best racing games of its time
i wish they still put as much thought into games so they can turn out like thisone of the things that sucks about wiis virtual console library is the fact that it does not have this game
conker and banjo both belong to rare which in turn belongs to microsoft and thus nintendo is unable to bring us the diddy kong racing in all of its bit glory
i played this game with friends when i was a youngster for nostalgias sake i picked it up again about a year ago
im happy to report that the game is not only still fun but that it holds up remarkably well even todaygraphicshow were they then
they were amazing back then
its hard to believe that rare was able to make such an impressive looking game
the environments are varied and the characters have a surprising amount of detailhow are they now
theyre still among the ns best and only a little age can be detected
diddy kongs face could use a little polishing which im sure they did in the ds remake as could a few of the other characters
but as the tracks themselves they look good
the only things that look like real relics of the past are the occasional d graphics in d space and given that ive seen a few wii games employ the same effect maybe it doesnt look all that bad by todays standards
hehmusicthe music is in the upper echelons of n sound
there are a surprising number of melodies and to the best of my knowledge few if any are reused on different tracks
its all highgeared racing music with the exception of some the frosty village tracks which sound like christmas racing musicgameplayin the end retro gamers look to dkr for its awesome gameplay
its the only kart racing game ive played that has a proper storyline and an actual questlike adventure mode
the multiplayer is still intense player action which also allows you to put ai racers alongside you and your friendsand once youve beaten the game theres still more content
theres a second adventure mode with the mirror tracks and after that theres a very challenging time trial mode which allows you to unlock tt and after that there are cheat codes one of which turns the oneplayer mode into a two player mode and another allows you to bolster the ai of the computer kart racers which extends replay value well into foreverthe only thing thats missing is an online mode which rare was kind enough to give us in the ds version
but what that version lacks is conker and banjo
any game called diddy kong racing without a redneck bear and a drunken squirrel is not diddy kong racingkart racing is not even my favorite genre of game but i really believe this is the finest title the n has to offer
its even better than goldeneye or ocarina of time
so dkr is far more than a mario kart  clone
mario kart  wishes it had even half the depth and quality of this gamei loved this game
i passed it  within a month of having it
the levels gameplay and characters are super creative like any rare gamethis is one of the fewest racing games a really like its cool you go through levels and even have a boss to beat
its cool
its a game i think everyone will enjoyif you liked this game check out mario kartthe adventure game is a lot of fun
it is a decent challenge and there is a lot to do
when you finish the four worlds you may think that you are done but there is a secret space world hidden in thethere are two secret characters to find drumstick and tt
in order to get drumstick you must run over  and to get tt
you have to in the time trial mode
the characters and plot are great as well as the special weaponsthe multiplayer challenges you can play by yourself in them too the secret codes the fact that you must defeat every boss and level twice with two kinds of challenges the fact that you can use  and instead of just cars the secret challenges and other surprises
there is also a special second adventure mode where the courses are and the coins are hidden in spots you wont expect to find them  there is also your basic tracks mode where you can play any unlocked level with any unlocked character or vehicle with up to four players
the adventure two mode tracks can be played here once they are unopened
if you like games by rare and you like racing and or adventure games this is for you taj says that in the game every time you get years after this game came out it is still as fun now as it was then
fantastic game
i love that it contains rare characters as welldiddy kong racing will forever be looked at as a kiddy title and in some ways rareware did go overboard on this one
the character designs are very sugary sweet accompanied by highpitched voices that you want to slap in the face pipsy im looking at you
bright cheerful colors bright cheerful soundtrack
yeah kids love this stuffbut strip all that away and this is a very welldesigned and challenging cart racer
it kind of does the opposite of mario kart  and offers a strong singleplayer mode and a fun but somewhat bare multiplayermode
similiar to platform games you race through courses and collect balloons which in turn open boss fights and other worlds with more courses
there are three fullytuned vehicles to choose from your kart a plane and a hovercraft
each has its pros and cons controls differently from the others and takes skill to master
you can even race different vehicles against each other often taking different routes in the same course
like other kart racers this one isnt about speed but the tracks have lots of detail and animation and are consistently interesting to race through one even looks like the death star trench from star warswhere the game starts to frustrate is rarewares typical way of extending play time
beat the courses once then race through them again and collect  hardtoreach coins while still maintaing first place
this leads to a harder boss encounter and must be done to unlock the final levels and the best ending
little kids will probably throw the controller down right here but anyone whos worth anything in video games will find it immensely satisfying to clear rares requirements and unlock all that the game has to offer
seperates the men from the boys and all thatif rareware hadnt made the characters so sugary this couldve easily topped mario kart  in recognition among the older crowd
definitely worth a purchase used and good luck to all those up for the challengea very good motocross game
i recomend it for anyone who likes n racing gamesi race dirt bikes and really enjoy dirt bike simulation games but until excitebike  came out i was left unsatisfied
i bought this game and pretty much continuously played it until i finished it which was no easy task
the controls are easy to master after a little while but the different difficulties of the track and computer races keeps the game challenging
has a great diversity of different race modes including edit your own track soccer and hill climb
the game even has a training mode to get the driver used to the controls
i highly recommend this game to anyonepull up your pants and staple your mullet to the back of your neck because things are about to get exciting
knock your socks off d graphics combined with intense and realistic sounds makes excitebike  is one of the best titles for the nintendo  years had passed since there was an official sequel to the original nes game excitebike
fans of the original game rejoiced as they got to experience the sweet taste of the speed and power that excitebike  had to offer
and if i remember correctly the game featured reallife dirt bike brands which in the end made the game feel more realisticexcitebike  was head and shoulders above the rest when it came to other motor bike games released around the same timedont be a doofus  pick up this game and make your nerd friends jealousthis game used to be really popular
it is worth the fifty dollars to look better than your friends on a motorbikei got this game as a gift and i have had it over a year
the graphics are good even for today
the difficulty has  different modes on novice i can be up to  seconds ahead of second place but when i got the game st place was a treasured moment
the sound is some of the best on a game ever and when i first listined to it i turned it up and everything else off
the controls are different than most games since the z button is used as the gas
but i think this is a better thing because you have you thumb free to fire weapons nitro and change view
the tracks are great and i wish there was more
over all this game is great and i not typing this for no reason
so take my advice and buy it
no game collection is complete without itwzzzzzzzzzvvvvvvvvvvvvvvooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmthat is why we bought extreme g for the n
october  the end of a great summer playing golden eye you knew you needed a break and heard that the fastest game ever made was coming out on the n and so what did you get
extreme g racer
great speed in this game
nothing like it
however i played the most recent g racer on the ps recently and games like this are great but have had their day
the next best game to this in terms of speed fun is ssx  for the ps
i turned to moto gp racer simulations now instead
moto gp  is out soonthis one is really fun
i see so many neon colors
the mazes are neat
the cars look interesting
buy it to be differentfrom circuits to battles to just plain awesome maps fzero x has consistently given gamers a classic futuristic racing style to turn to
right up their with the n bests fzero has been a game that has continually been remade and reworked but it all starts here
pick your copy up todaywhat a great game sure the tracks are a bit bland and the cars have a low poly count but the simplicity of them gives them a kind of sleek feel
all that sacrifice adds up though and the framerate is amazing with all  the cars zipping around at kmph its soo cool
the graphics are meant to  be functional it is not a sightseers game anyway youll be too busy  going hyperdrive to stop and look at things
the xcup is especially great  because it randomly generates a track every time so you never get the same  track
also the pure selection of cars is great and the tracks are so  well laid out especially big blue the tubing one where you race  on  a tube
it rullles
the best racing game on the nthis game is full of great stuff for anyone
with  machines to race with you are bound to find one suited to your racing style
it has  starter quotcupsquot serieses of  courses with the  other racers and  difficulty levels
beating the same cup on all  levels will get you a new row of machines to race with you start with 
once the starter cups have all been beaten on standard difficulty the quotjokerquot cup will appear
it is another set of  courses much more advanced than the others
the  starter cups plus the quotjokerquot cup must be completed on all  difficulty levels before all  machines will be available
then the quotmasterquot difficulty level will come up and it is extremely hard to beat with all of your rivals in the games storyline attack you and basically do anything they can to stop you from winning
altogether this is a gem of a game with lots of game play variety multiplayer and one player
this is definitely the best racing game made for the n and is strongly recommendedi will come straight to the point
fzero lacks the graphical wonder of other racing games in order for it to be a triumph
i will ask you do you really have time to enjoy the scenery when you are travelling at kph
of course you dont
this is a point argued time and time againmy argument is that it is purely a gamers game
the pleasure arrives when you actually play it
so many times i have heard people say it doesnt look very good
this is nonsense
they miss the point
ever heard the phrase never judge a book by its cover
i tell you nintendo have achieved a phenomenal aim and morehow
well i will start with the fact that the game moves at an unparalleled velocity
the speed alone is a thrill
as you improve you drive faster and faster
as you get faster you crave more and more speed
you become frustrated when you make a mistake which causes a loss of speed
it is all involving
the handling is also unlike other racing games
you need not fiercely pull the stick left or fight
it needs a deicate hand subtely tilting it round a corner to achieve the optimum linethere is no scenery because everything is geared to making fzero as fast as it is
there is the xcup which really offers an unlimited array of randomly generated tracks
this is the crowning glory on what is a perfectly controlled and weighted racing game
whereas the snes version pioneered graphics the n update pioneers the use of amazing momentum
it is that simple
nintendo have once again stayed true to their roots and produced a game of outstanding quality
take no nonsense of reports that they have fallen short of their best
quite the opposite
they have bettered the original and once again redefined high speed racing gamesif you think all racing games are about running around in a circle you will be really amazed if you give this a chanceits awesomethe speed is breathtakingthe music is great and the graphics are cool tooin other words its a trip and a halfyou play as well known star captain falcon and you race across the galaxy and plus you can choose the difficulty levelsmust buyit will change the way you look at racing games foreveranother hit by the famous shiguru miyamoto is that the correct spelling
and this one really might be a mixed bag for some
if your part of that  zero g racing crowd you might want to check this out before buying it
the biggest flaw with zero g racing was that is had bad framerates and you  could blow others up which was really unfair since it was just dumb luck
however in this game you are actually pitted against a certain skill  that hasnt been used in a while racing
yes you actually have to use  your racing skills in this game to succeed and you have to try many  different ships in which your skills are of use
going against  foes in  other games were nice but imagine going  other opponents
you can kill  them but skill is required in which to do so
first you must wear down  thier shield and then put in the final blow but if your not careful you  could be the one ending up dead
besides racing against all these foes  you also are going at neck breaking speeds which you must conquer before  you claim your victory
with  ships to pick from each unique in speed  acceleration and traction you will find fun almost impossible to avoidthis one is the one players select
it is not the best however
the other games have more detailed scenerythis game is better than the other really popular games
take it for a spin if you dont want to spend your whole life with the nintendo systemwith this race game same as any other game there are difficulty levels for the experienced or the starters
a whole bunch of different types of maps to racethis is an excellent racing game i dont care if it is on a dated console it is still one of the best
shows how good the game was made and how the n can stand up to the test of time
but i do wish they would create a version for the ps though
anyway this is an awesome game and i always play itmost of the time while listening to rammsteinand it never grow old
you cannot say that about alot of games but this one you definitley can
it is a must have if you own a n and if it comes out on a next gen console like the ps i am definitley gonna buy it
higly reccomendedi think this game is a fun game
there is cool shortcuts throughsan franciscoi remember the first time i saw this game what a beautiful memory
even though the nintendo  turned out to kinda bust it was my transition from d to d games
my first experiences with d were with mario   i first played nintendo  at a friends house and wave race  was one of the first games i played
my jaw was hanging for about a half hour
the first thing i saw was dolphin park  swimming dolphins fish splashy sounding music backflips barrel rolls and beautiful water
it was too much
what a surreal experience
after i got back up from fainting my friend and i played this game for hours and hours and hours and hours
we would go to southern island and tried to find what we could ramp over go under and crash into
it sounds pathetic but ive had some of the best times of my life playing wave race  with friendsi never actually bought the game
i was around  or  at the time and  was hard to come up with
but boy we would rent it and made use of the whole  hours we had it
im  years old now and being frustrated with todays gaming experience i decided to take a trip down memory lane and finally buy wave race   i hoped to experience some of the joy i did so many years ago
i found it for  on ebay
its still a great game but it was a little sad to play it again  to see the outdated graphics and all
i beat all the circuit classes in no time
also the guys i used to play it with arent around anymore
makes me yearn for the good ol days
but ill quit sobbing
this game is without a doubt a classic
it is one of the best racing games of all time
do not disagree with mefor a game that was released in  those graphics are pretty darn good
the physics are real and the control is tight making it feel like youre actually racing a jet ski
best race of alltime until its sequel comes  out on the dolphin systemalong with mario  wave race was one of my intro games to the ngorgeous graphics for its timeexcellent controla new breed of water racer that made you feel like you were right on the waterinventive and challenging coursesa commentator that was funny instead of annoyingi really dont have any major complaints about this game
even years later its still funits one of those games you put in play it for a half hour and youre done with itits still fun its just not one of those game you have to invest serious time ini give wave race my recommendationits not gran turismo on water its just a fun way to kill a half hour or so racing aroundi had this game back in  for my nsince then i have played this game quite ofteni was  when i played this game a lot
the one mode that i always liked was time trials
i love trying to beat my old timesthe physics in this game are spot onn  dreamcast are  of the better syetems ive ever owned and ive owned just about everything besides a do  gameboysim still a videogame head but with  kids  a woman i cant play as much as i want toi still get in my nightly game of madden or bf but my n  dreamcast still get a lot of usepretty easy game to pick up  play yet more time will have to be put in to become a masteri would recommend this game to anyone who owns a n along with a few other classics goldeneye sm sm kart pilotwings ocarina of time gauntlet legends  wcwnwo revengethose are the only games you need on n that are worth itthis game is one of the best games for the n
this is among the best games and probably one of the top  racing games for the systemi dont play the  much anymore and even thought about selling it and all my games to my brother but i kept them and once in a while i will get it out and play it and this game is really fun
i like doing a hand stand on the top of the ramp while my brother flys up the ramp and nails my character off his machine and he goes flying
its really funny
we also play chicken and race toward each other and try to do a trick right before we hitokay a penny plus  shipping
thats the cheap price i see right now on amazon for a used copy of this game bucks
this is a fantastic game
i know copies are plentiful but four dollars
okay majoras mask was a game with a huge print
but that commonly goes for over 
wave race is a top notch a title
and it is yet to have a proper sequel
the gameplay was amazing back then and this is a n game i can still go back to that still blows my mind
the wave mechanics are near perfect
especially for an early n title  years later it still works
over all the many n games i lovei find myself casually coming back to this game for a quick game more than any other on the console
and this is strange because i really dont play racing games
what makes this enjoyable to me is the ability to do tricks and show off stunts when you dont have to
in a on race tricks dont add to your score
but its a ton of fun to speed past your opponent needlessly doing back flips off ramps  handstands through the finish line
great game
im fiendin to play it right now
also the music is classic
this game is an overall a triple zillion plusexcitebike beetle adventure racingdiddy kong racingmario kart fzero xsan francisco rush these are all more exciting and have more depthvariety but none can be distilled down to the hyperpureness you get riding your jet ski in wave race this game is  years old  the graphics gameplay  music still hold upas the rating suggested this game is great for both kids  adults alike but if you hate things from the past like an idiot youll hate this game
so all in all this game is awesome if you arent a past hating hipsterdo not hate a game for its agethe first n game i ever owned
it was way ahead of its time
still the best water sports game ive ever played and one of the few ive ever even heard of
a game that is an absolute blast and something that all people who still get out the n here and there should have
it definately brings back great memories and is still a blastone thing i liked about this game was the lack of foes villains and the like
there was no good or bad guy
just water  lots of it
i plated this back when the n first came out and was impressed with the graphics
i still am after all this time
i couldnt even begin to count the hours i spent playing this game and the various levels and modes
theres several different modes you can play including one where you rack up points with tricks
this game is a heck of a lot of fun whether youre alone or playing with friends
the various different skies and surroundings made the water on each level look different and that was pretty cool it kept the levels interesting
two thumbs up for a fantastic gamewave race is a childhood classic
from the memorable soundtrack to the fun of its gameplay mechanics to really great graphics theres no doubt that one could have a lot of fun playing this gameit may consist of a handful of tracks but you get to unlock some if you play a harder difficulty mode in a similar fashion to how the mario kart series handles unlockables
plus the tracks themselves are actually thought out well and are fun to race in dont believe me
watch some gameplay videos
for something thats supposed to look realistic the courses are pretty imaginativereally one of the major things that make this game stand out from other racing games is how there are symbols floating on the water telling you which direction you must go relative to it to avoid misses
if you collect enough misses you immediately lose
its simple but it works much better than it may soundthe game wrapped in bubble wrap and was shipped rather fast even with the road conditions being so bad
no delays in shippingi love the old games sometimes better than the newer games
it is fun to see this old game againthe game is really hard for me and never manage to finish it but i have enjoyed the graphics and story plot this game is perfect for  to  year olds in my opinion
this is like metal gear because of the story cutcenes and memorable charactersthis game wont be hard for people who are very good at action games because i completed it in  to  daysi was  in why havent they made a sequali havent had this much fun since i played dragons lair or enjoy watching my brother this game
it made me shake amp laugh havent done that for a while plus i was rooting for andy too win just like dirk the daring
so if youre a fan of dragons lair  space ace  brain dead  then youll love this one
for the arcade kid in all of us 
highly recommended
ps
kids under five may have nightmares so be careful 
good buy for money
its a two disc so its long good luck with itgreat game play and visuals sums this game upwhat makes this game worth play
i hear you ask well alright thenthe main plot has you taken prisoner to another dimensionall the elements of great platforming is here rope swings and swamps a variety of entertaining baddies luscious environments and the classic ingredient a challengeyou get a lazer cannon and hoduken style projectiles to dispense with foesthe overall feel of the game is superbthe death sequences the character andy suffers are hilarious typical of the games charm evident throughoutit might be an old game but its definitely worth a playing for any platformer fan its up there with the best of them and certainly surpasses most of the rd gen platformers available todaytake a look at my lists and other reviews by clicking my profile name little john abovethis game can try your patience
if you are good at playing older mario games then you will have more than half a chance to beat this game
i found it very hard to say the least
in some levels especially toward the end i would try a level for a couple of hours and when i would advance i would quit and try some weeks later when i mentally wasnt spent
i could not forget about it every time i beat a level i would think maybe i could do the next one
i could not beat the boss at the end and had to be satisfied with that
almost at the end of the game i found a cheat it is the first time i have used cheating and it helped me mentally to keep trying and to see the ending
i wouldnt use this until you really really need it because it would ruin the satisfaction level for you
to see all cinemas and levels  with the game off hold l  l  r  r on controller   you must be in the second controller slot keep holding those buttons and access the options screen then the tree house then load game
you can save and keep your progress after using thisfor all the frustration i had i still can say i had a great time playing itjumping flash  may not have graphics and animation that hold up for generations but the gameplay and music more than make up for it
based on the price i paid for this game this is an underrated classic and a timeless gem that any adult or child can immediately get into and enjoycontrol you feel completely in control with smooth command responses as you jump shoot and maneuver enemies and platforms
you can change the button controls in the options menu at any timecamera you are the camera as at any moment you can even look before you jump by holding the r button and guiding your view with the dpadgameplay robbit takes you through a new adventure rescuing a distressed world from a new villainous threat
not one level appears the same with different challenges and goals throughout
complete three stages before saving your game is highly recommended
bonus stages are spread throughout and different achievements are rewarded with  completion and medals
beat the game to unlock time attack
the only thing that would ensure greater replayability is if the game were to have a split screen p vs modegraphics as far as s polygonal graphics go its still a sight to behold with colorful worlds and beautiful views
the cinematic cutscenes are still impressivesound the music in the game is nothing less than enjoyable and even worthy of your ipodthis game is a must for any collection original playstation games and for anyone who just enjoys gamesdo you want to soar heights that no human has ever gone before
is it your dream to touch the sky watching the whole planet gradually increase its size from underneath your feet
me too and the jumping flash series is the best thing in doing that without having to jump out of a plane
the basic premise of its gameplay is a doom perspective on completely d cartoon worlds where everything and anything can be airborne
the object of each level is to find the  muumuus scattered across each massive world and then to find the exit launch pad
this isnt as straightforward as it appears on paper because the muumuus can be  feet in the air on mysterious floating platforms sometimes even floating whales that soar way above the rest of the level
no sweat though  your character a mechanical bunny named robbit has extra special jumping powers that will allow robbit to reach those platforms
the triple jump of robbit is so effectively used that it will make many gamers feel queasy
its one of the most thrilling feelings you can experience on your playstation
my only complaints are that the game like the first jumping flash is both a bit too easy and a bit too short
but thats because the game plays so smoothly and offers so much in pure fun that you wish the game could go on forever
dont be turned off by its cutesy appearance  this game is an absolute musthavestraight up one of the best of all time
certain videogames at their best become a work of art
this is one such example
original fun challenge for the mind and the soul
everything that was possible with the playstation one is on display here in rare form
they certainly couldve continued this series on the ps
the only drawback is the lack of various camera angles like viewing robbit from another perspectivethis game is actually pretty difficult to complete but i remembered it as a child and its just as fun as i rememberedan underrated game that meets the requirements for espionage sabotage and elimination
or murder death kill
either way this game is amazing for your playstation libraryif your an older gamer or just someone who likes older game series you have probaly played megaman the original series not xlegendszeroor battle network i remember when i first got my nes when i was  and megaman  i loved that game and still do so i saw megaman  for playstaition decided i should check up on this series im more of a megaman x fan from the opening movie which is shown in stunning anime to the ending credits this game is flawless the story begins with  strange robots fighting in the deep reaches of space when they injure each other so bad that they crash land into earth and megaman heads to investigate when he gets there dr wily for you noobs megamans main enemy is carrying off one of the robots which has very evil very powerful energy wily is harnesting so megaman helps the second robot and heads after wily so the battle begins with your standard  bosses clownmangrenademanfrostman and tengumanmy personal favorite and after they are done your next four appear swordmanastromansearchman and aquamannot to be confused with the dc comics hero you megaman veterans already know where this is going even though the game is standard megaman format that same format is perfect and if it aint broke dont fix itgraphics wise the game rules its d but very good looking d the enemies and backgrounds are very detailed i could just stare at them all day but i wont but anyway you older gamers will admit this is a huge step up from nes and snesremember the old square shots that would pass off as bullets in the old games
megamans graphics megas little pellet shots even look good his charge up shots have detail and just the basic movements of running jumping and sliding look pretty goodsound hows the sound you ask
great the music for each stage is good and even the voice acting in the cut scences is nicely matched also having the cut scences in anime was a great idea seeing bass and megaman duke it out in anime is really great to see it really makes the carnival level more fun when you have carnival music as your background all also when youre going through a labyrinth in astromans stage the music really sets the mood for how strange the level is these are just some examples as all the music really does a good job of setting the mood for funfun factor is what makes this game so great is that there are so many diverse challenges in levels and ways of getting around such as snowboardingflying via the rush jet and even swinging on vines in a jungle so many robots to destroy so little time also there are added challenges like finding  bolts that roll once again for you noobs megamans sister will make upgrades for megaman with and its not as hard as some other megaman installments so if youre rusty on the series or new to it this would be a good place to start basic megaman formula still is around if you beat a boss you obtain his power example if you beat clownman you get his power the thunder claw even though i have beaten the game several times i still find myself playing itthe bottom line here is that megaman  is another perfect megaman game that seems to just get better with every installment that needs to be in everyones playstaition collection by the way for those of you who agree with my review lets hope for megaman  soonevery mega man title appears to have its own unique quality like the original mega man series the mega man x series and the mega man legends series mega man  was a great game even if it was an original port of mega man legends so dont say its the worst mega man title just because its for the nintendo  with rich highquality graphics smooth animations and addictive gameplay
mega man  came out perfect when it released on the playstation
the d graphics were flawless
the animated sprites look cool mega man looks better than before and the d animated worlds look great
the control and playabilty still resembles the old mega man series from the snes
the voice acting is superb mega mans voice matches his character considering the fact that he looks like a little boy except for that annoying tutor that tells you continously what to do you know 
the one that tells you when to jump and when to slide under something
if only there was a code to shut that tutor up by shooting him down
you will see some familiar faces like mega man noduh 
hes the main character 
 bass from mega man  rush protoman dr light and the main villain dr wily
and finally mega man  has highquality anime scenes that describes the story and plot of the game
capcom is pretty good at doing anime scenes but cant they make any mega man anime series based on all of the mega man games 
if only it were possible
bah 
maybe in the future 
with superb highquality d graphics cutting edge anime scenes and breathtaking gameplay fans of the series might want to waste their money on this game note there is an import mega man game for the super famicom japanese snes called rockman amp forte mega man amp bass and it is exactly like mega man  except for the controls
theyre a little slower than that of mega man s controls rockman or should i say mega mans buster doesnt have any speed
three shots then it stops for a second
its not really that great unless you can get used to itwhy do people give this less than  stars
i mean there should be a  star rating so i could give this game   how could capcom make a better game
easily
i really hate this game
its my favorite
why would any one buy this game
it is so horrible
i love it
what is up with mega mans voice its like a millon nails scratching against a black board
i like his voice
overall how could hi capcom make such a food game
poop smells good
i lkie the taste
ummm
lunchtimethis game is greatall the classic elements that made megaman shine among games in the s and s return with upgraded graphics sound and overall aesthetic presentationdr
wily is at it again and its up to dr lights finest creation megaman to stop him
this time the blue bomber will enlist the help of his friends rush beat eddie and auto in explosive action against enemies and battle bass and treble dr wilys counterparts to dr lights justicekeeping robotsthe icing on the cake are the awesome fullyanimated sequences between the key parts of the game which show some nostalgic moments of megaman battling some wellknown robot masters that might just spring tears on seasoned old veterans myself includedi recommend this game to players of all ages and especially those who like me have enjoyed the past megaman games with relish
it will transport you back to the old days when gaming was a question of just grabbing the controller and playingeven though the playstation is known more for producing d games its great to know it has plenty of good d ones as well
mega man  is a little easier than the nes games but still offers a decent challengethis game is greatthe difficulty is hard thoughbut a little practice and you can master it with easefor me it took about maby a month or so to beat the very last bossanywaysthe animation is not the greatest but it still looks neatthe plot is great and it has a great background to hold up the plotyour mavric enemys this time is very cool such as magma dragoonstorm owlslash beastfrost walrusjet stingrayetcthis time you can be zerowho i always pickif you ask me id tell you to be zero instead of mega maneven though mega man has more weapon capabilitieszero is more supirior in speed and plus he has a close range weapon and i choose close range over allalthough zero may not be for a new playerzero is more for expierienced playersi sudjest that eather you train with mega man for a while or even betterjust buy mega man x and train on that since its so easythe last boss on that game would be as challenging as one of the simple mavrick hunters who guarded the secret weapons such as web spiderlolseriouslythat game is that easy but its perfect for practice to get better at these far more supirior mega man gamesnote that each boss has a weakness to a certain weapon that you may carrytry em out
unfortunately megaman xs bosses are weak to every weapon that you havesopass up megaman xunless you need it to train to get ready to play this great and fun gameps
megaman x will be realeased sooni here it will be even more challenging than megaman x
im gonna check it out some timecya later fellow reviewersive been playing mega man games since the late eighties and this is one of my favorites
in fact it may be my favorite in the x series
ive had it since it was first released in  and i still play it occasionally now
this game is so cool
you get to play as x or zero you get anime cut scenes that tell the story plus theres even blood and a little mild profanity despite the ka ratingnow e
the challenge level is just right
i never found this game too easy like x but it was never too hard either
ive literally beaten this game dozens of times so the replay value is pretty good toothe story was actually very interesting in this game
i dont think x zero and the irregular hunters were actually in the right
you seem almost like tyrants in this game and even more so in the next game
if a reploid has his own ideas thenwell im probably one of the few fans who is so interested in the story
isnt this just the blade runner story anywayat any rate this is the last great d mega man game
i highly recommend it
the megaman legends games are really funny in their own weird way but its not the same as good old fashioned mega mannote this product was actually the first product id ever reviewed when i was  but amazon deleted it for some reason
so im writing another onethe other day i ordered the mega man x collection to relieve old nostalgic memories and one game i was ready to play was this one
i can say that this is probably the best of the x series though i still need to play the others again firststory basically sigma manipulates repliforce to fight against the maverick hunters and its up to x or zero to save the day
not too complicated but on zeros story it digs deeper into his originsgraphics its quite interesting to see d graphics on a system that mostly is d as the sprites are clean colorful and fluid
even though they look outdated by todays standards
the game also has several anime cutscenes which all flow smoothlymusic unlike the first three the music isnt really guitar oriented but still nice to listen tosoundvoice acting the sounds well what can i say
gunshots explosions all that good stuff
the voice acting is awful especially xs voicegameplay its the first game where you can fully play as zero who is more melee than x zero uses his z saber and instead of getting weapons from bosses he learns new moves
basically its like your average mega man game but it has new twists such as the ability to save the fact that stages are divided into two parts and there are more types of tanks to collect
the weapons and bosses are fun and innovative especially when playing as zerobuy
 i say get it whether its an emulator in the x collection or on a regular psx disc
although its short it packs a lot of punchi had played every mega man game up until x came out and i can safetly say this is the best one ever
xx just had pictures with words which i thought was totally lame
with x they had complete cartoon anime scenes with full dialogue and how awesome was that
the game play was fantastic the graphics were fantastic you could play as zero all the way through the game mega and zero had their own story elements
awesome game
one of the best evermegaman x a game rivaled only by the snes mmx titles
this game is definitely a well polished piece to have in your collection of megaman titles
gameplay is great with lots of quotmove too slowly and diequot areas cool bossesalthough capcom apparently ran out of cool names interesting levels and a very interesting plot
one of the more notable features of this game is the ability to play as zero
this was originally introduced in x but then he was weak and couldnt fight bosses
but this time hes back and ready to kick some arse
in this game you can choose between megaman or zero
who ever you pick is who you are the rest of the game which means zero has more than one life and can kill bosses
woo
anyways this game has a good level of challenge being delivered more in getting through the stages than the bossesalthough some can make you wanna bite a chunk of your controller off and spit it across the room ie
final boss
the weapons are really cool this time around
capcom apparently had some real thinking time about weapons after two games worth of dull weapons
the plot of this game is awesome the repliforce forms a coup and they are labeled mavericks
and in this gameand unfortunately only this game unless you look outside of the x series and count mm you can see the plot come to life in awesome anime cutscenes
capcom went lazy after this and made x into an unfortunate slide show with subtitles
i havent really listened to the music in this game cuz i was too busy blowing stuff up in the enemy filled levels so i cant rate it lol
anyways this x and the snes titles are all great games and i would suggest you stock your gaming library with all of themgood luck on x cuz youll need it unless youre made of money
this game is a definite must have for someone new to the series and someone who grew up with the series
at least borrow it from a friend or your life will be shrouded in misery and pain
muah hahahaif your looking for the newest game to add to your collection look no further
mega man x is the bestin my opinion of mega man games
you can play as x and zero and has slightly different endings for each adding replay value
great cut scenes that will leave you shouting for more and a story line that will keep you hooked from the startmega man x 
the fourth episode in the seven part spinoff series and first one to be released on playstationnot many decadelongrunning series of games stay true to their roots but for the mega man series keeping the same oldschool d platform nostalgic gameplay is a given
critics hate the neverchanging evolution of mega man but real fans like me love it and take it in any form it comes
here we have x one of the best and my second favorite x game x is my favorite
this was my first x game ive ever owned and so it holds a special place to me
now i will go over the pros and cons to x in terms of gameplay graphics sound etc
prosfirst of all the anime cutscenes are phenomenal
they not only have quality japanese animation but they also enhance the storytelling of the game
sadly this is the only x game you will ever see anime cutscenes in unless you track down an extremely rare copy of x for the ps or saturnsecondly the story itself
xs storyline is very well put together
it starts out with magma dragoon destroying sky lab and bringing it down on a city full of people killing them
x and zero of course demand to know why a reploid of the repliforce caused this terrible catastrophe
however colonel nd leader of the repliforce refuses to surrender to x and so the entire repliforce wages war against the maverick hunters
this was all really caused by sigma who was playing both sides to get them to fight each other
i like the addition of the subcharacters double and iris and how they play key roles in each of the main characters storylines
i wont reveal any more of the story so as not to spoil the game endingsthe new feature of playing as either x or zero
simply awesome
you could do that in the previous game but here is where you can choose who to play through the entire game
x is better for shooting long range whereas zero is more of a melee fightergameplaywise the action in the series couldnt get any better
there are certainly plenty of enemies and things to shoot no matter where you go
most arent too hard but they do provide enough challenge so as to keep you busythe sound effects are a major improvement over what the super nintendo could do
likewise the music here is perfect for an x game
its sort of a japanese s style technohardrock soundtrack
i love it
most every track is memorable and goes well with each stage and the pace of the actioni like how many of the stages have new elements thrown in that were not used before
for instance in cyber peacocks stage you must race to the end and if you make it fast enough you get a bonus
slash beasts stage is on a moving train
plus i thought it was clever to reward the players in magma dragoons stage in letting them use the robotridearmor to fight the boss if they make it through the stage unscathedconsthe only thing wrong with the anime cutscenes is the voice acting
like in mega man  and in a lot of anime the voice acting is terrible
it comes off as annoying especially xs voice
why do they have to make him sound like an  year old girl
still having anime cutscenes with bad voice acting is better than having no anime at allwhile the action itself is outstanding i thought that xs stages in comparison to other games are way too short easy and linear
theres only one path and the continue points make all the stages shorter
jet stingrays stage can be beaten in less than two minutes which to me seems like the programmers are just being lazy
plus there are not very many secrets and all of them are rather easy to find
not bad but a letdown from xs more complex level structures and secret collectingi think that there should have been a way to switch back and forth between characters at the stage select screen
fortunately this problem is remedied in x and x
its not really that big of a deal thoughoverall even though there are minor setbacks which keep it from being perfect x is still by far one of the best in the series
its very easy to find and a great way for newbees to get into the x series
the next two games turned out to be a mixed bag of sorts x was made for beginners and x for hardcore fans
go figure
so what are you waiting for
get equipped with bubble lead and go buy this game right nowmega man x is the second best game in the x seriespros different scenarios play as x and receive various armshot weapons or play as zero and learn various sword techniquesbeautiful d graphicsnew parts systembosses are new in stylebeautifully animated anime cutscenescool new charactersconsa little easy sometimeshorrible voice actingthe bottom line this is a very fun game to play but there is one thing you might want to hear zero is not for beginners
his moves are much harder to learn
however masters should challenge themselves playing it with zero
if you enjoyed the first three x is the best then i highly recommend thisit took some armtwisting but sony finally caved when capcom demanded it release the next chapter of the x series on their instantsuccess ps
so with that in mind did capcom have what it took to bring this franchise back to life in the bit world
the answer is a resounding yes
x kept to its d platforming roots and not succumbing to the increasingly dimensional nonsense that was the name of the game near the end of the th century and instead used the added bits to paint a vivid and visually amazing canvas in its awesome level structures graphic effects and huge powerful bosses
add on the ability to play as zero in all his saberswinging glory full time a tragic story line that divides itself depending on who youre playing as a few new hidden items to find some of xs best weapons and capsule effects and four countem four different sigma forms and you have one of the best x games made
it wouldve been even better if capcom was a better judge of character when getting the voice actors for the anime cutscenes though as i said ruth shiraishi was better as x than mega man in mm but i guess beggars cant be choosersthis one of the best mega man x games capcom has ever made
the anime cut scenes look great and the story is amazing as you play as zero you learn his a lot about his past in this one
this is a definte must have for mega man fans and if you play this for the first time you will be a mega man fan
man oh man i love this game so muchbathed in darkness  with a decidedly eerie atmosphere permutating into many morbid manifestations the player is brought into a horror world of gore  mysticism
the scenery is gloriously gothic covered in shadow with many lurking abominations thereinyou have the choice of being one of two characters father ignacius blackward a man of god combatting evil or nadia f a microbiologist
the latter character whos father was murdered mysteriously probably as a plan of the brotherhood of hecate a mysterious dark order dedicated to dominating the earth using these mutant monsters
they are led by adam crowley former legitimate scientist who now masterminds the secret brotherhood of hecate
unfortunately their bodies were immolated in the fire of  crowley only desired to create a race of supermen can you say ubermenschten
 but things didnt quite go as planned
still this was still a great opportunity to realize their plans anywaythe plot is basically based around their grimoire which was written by pepys a mystic  black magic magician
the legend is quite intriguing  quite ingenious actuallywerewolves firespewing demons spiderlike creatures zombies  knifewielding faceless men are only some of the inhabitants of this truly nightmarish dimensionnightmare creatures presents a forboding challenge for all those who wish to enjoy a bit of eustress in this descent into a veritable hellh v h jok i will start with the bad
the controls and camera angles are a bit jumpy and hard to work with
now the good
this is just an extremely fun game
enough saidthis is a fun gamei like the items like the gun that kills monsters one hit
this game is different than most games where you kill monsters
usually you have like a gun or something and just blow their heads off
you can do that on this game but you can also deliver a little handtohand combat
it surprised me that you can fight the monsters with your bare hands
at first i thought you just fought them like in matches or something like you do on mortal kombat and other fighting games 
this game has good graphics and is fun
if you like severing monsters and zombies limbs youll like this gamethese were the days when graphics and online shooters werent the main concern of the casual or hardcore gamer
tomba
 is a gem of a game which involves elements of d and d levels and platforming with some slight rpg and adventure in it as well
you dont need the first game to enjoy this sequel but if you have it lucky you
the characters all speak aloud in classic storytelling dialogue keep in mind some games to this day lack voice acting forcing you to read with some games having small font let alone barely having decent voice acting
youll backtrack to unlock chests and reach for other goodies you  couldnt get previously in the earlier stages of the game thanks to gifts and items you receive along the way for helping those in need out
almost reminds you of mario  with all the different suits and gadgets tombi gets some cool weapons and tools of his own
puzzles and challenge await along with nice graphics for this games time beautiful colors and worlds such as islands snow underground and more
get this and you will not be disappointedhes the unofficial sony mascot in my book
then again im also waiting for shenmue  hope this helps amazoniansthere were some big shoes to fill when creating a sequel to the best side scroller on the ps and they pulled it off
this game does everything right and only has one realy flaw
some parts of the game feel like a real chore
when you first arrive at the mining village you will be doing miniscule tasks and errands pushing around a wheelbarrel full of coal for one for a while this happens in another town as well
while there were central hub areas in the original and you would receive quests there you didnt have to do boring jobs in town while you were thereother than that its just as much fun as the original classic even the switch to blocky d environments holds up in this day and age as the areas are just as unique and inviting this time around
the game plays just like tomba youll be slaying evil pigs climbing around and picking up side quests for hours
im not sure of the exact number of quests this time around but its somewhere around with the loads of areas enemies and quests youll be busy for hours
you pick up new weapons and abilities almost constantly so its pretty much impossible to get sick of this series
its a classic
its one of the best platformers on ps and if you enjoy d platformers at all check out this little gem now before it gets even more expensivetomba
 is just as great as the original with more d action adventure and addictiveness
they should have made a  but simply put as the popular saying goes all good things must come to an end
i got  more ps classics to goi play a lot of games and it seems like since ive played tomba nothing compares to it
its an extreme strategy game that takes some brains to figure out
its an absolutely incredible game and now that its so hard to find it really stinks
my cds keep wearing out from playing so much and i have to buy the game over and over again at  a pop cause its so rare
play tomba
and love itwhat do you get when you get the best aspects of rpgs platformers and adventure games
you get tomba an open ended masterpiece
its filled with dozens of unique areas to explore and creatures to deal with
packed with  quests youll be busy for hours and they arent all necessary to finish the main game many side quests and activities to keep you busy long after finishing the main story linebasically you play a wild caveboy with pink hair and youre trying to stop the evil pigs and their plot
yeah
pretty random   theres tons of lore and backstory behind the world you explore but in many cases you need to discover that for yourself by talking to various friendly characters in towns and other areas you learn about them and pick up a quest or two along the way this is where the open ended adventure comes in the entire game world is streamlined and fully explorable with only a short load time between certain areas and more areas become available are you finish the quests
you can upgrade your health multiple times throughout the game and you find new abilities and weapons very frequentlyas crisp detailed and colorful as a bit platformer could be tomba looks and plays great for its time its pure fun
this is the mario of the bit era
and thats saying a lot
a classic in the strongest sense of the word
its a shame how much you have to pay for a copy of this fantastic game anymore but its worth every pennyeverything about this game is was and will be fun was highly underrated yrs ago but now collectors are buying them againtomba
is one beautiful platformer
i first played it a really long time ago on a demo disc
i knew i had to get the full game as the demo offered a lot to do and it made you want to do more
fitting for any age andor any gamer or nongamer tomba
is original fun and addictive
i got  more playstation classics to get one of them being the sequel to this game tomba
i feel that its never too late to aquire a timeless ps gemsthis game is sooooooooooooo awesomeit is the best psone gamei actually have a ps but i rented this gametried it on psits greattv similaritiestv intro  beginningmulderscully more than just cameossame types of casesdifferencesdifferent agentsbuy this gamewhen i bought my playstation one of the first x files was the first game i bought
i was amazed by how i could play and interact with a real episode of the xfiles that included some of the conspiracy i loved to follow so much on tvothers may be put off by the fact that the game is not a cartoonish violent fest of murder and mayhem
maybe im being too harsh and they really miss the art of a game
however for those who love the tv show here is a chance to interact have fun and be a member of the cast via your consoleso ive repurchased this game
i was so excited to have the game back in my hands and see the old quicktime videos play through
man what a rush to add your own interactive episode to your collection
i only wish they had waited to put it on dvd with a few other episodes also
i imagine this was an expensive projectmy only issue is that this disc doesnt play right in the ps
the cursor is messed up and you need your old playstation to see it as it was designed
real bummer
if anyone knows a fix please feel free to comment it on the bottom of this reviewfinal note yes this is less game like and more interactive tv but the game is well worth it
for fun there are many kinds of endings
its the only full motion video ive ever seen for psps
if youre willing to watch a stupid overpriced movie on your psp why not interact with this xfiles game
some people are just never happy  if youre an xfiles fan love movies and tv this game was designed for youi missed it so much i repurchased it and ive never been happier to see an old game back in my hands
fun fun funxmen smash into your home in this flashy and entertaining fighting game
the graphics are well above average almost perfect sleek well detaild  interractive backgrounds make it enoyable just to watch
character voice  overs from the cast of the cartoon series and easy to learn moves for the  most part make it a must have
the only thing about the game i was not  impressed with though is definately the very limited selection of mutant  heros and villians to choose from
you can only pick from   to begin and  have to unlock the other four evil mutants
i havnt played long enough to  see if there are more characters but so far theres not many
but even  with the small number of playable characters this game will surely be one  of the hottest titles this summer and beyondah those xmen
this game is so much fun
how did i live without it
i will admit that the graphics could use updating but it moves smoothly
dull backgrounds
fun powers and characters
lack of movies and storyhaving solved the first ja and playing ja deadly games a lot i couldnt wait till ja came out
well the wait was worth it to say the least
im a big first person shooter fan and games of this type never interested me until ja
you gotta try ja it may not be first person but it really  takes tacktics to kick some slimeball butt
you wont be dissappointed  with this game

then everything began to tumbledeidranna killed chivaldoris father and framed him through a large amount of circumstantial evidence
she turned him over to his political enemy miguel cordona in the hopes that cordona would kill him instead they helped him flee
deidranna has since turned the peaceful country of arulco into a destitute land ruled by the whim of a rutheless dictator acts of genocide are common and anyone not of value of swiftly removed from the populationnow it is time to remove hera shadowy figureyoumeets with exiled enrico chivaldori in the czech republic he explains what he wants you to do build an army out of mercenaries and topple deidrannas regimethis shows how rich and deep the story is but it would be irrelevant if the gameplay wasnt good
thankfully the game play is brilliant
using an ingenious laptop interface you take the money given to you by chivaldori and hire the best mercenaries you can
you figh from town to town and in the rural areas killing deidrannas forces with firepower and tactics
this is no mere quotshootemupquot the player must train militas guard mines take down sam sites to clear the skies make sure your mercs interact well train your mercstalk to characters some of whom can be recruited to your cause some of whom will attempt to kill youbut you also get to take on deidrannas forces with over  weapons and other items
there will be weapons you havent seen and creatures native to arulco more so if you choose the scifi option
combat is great fun and there is a lot of it
moreover the game is completely nonlinear so if you wish to make a run on the capital city of meduna and deidranna herself only  hours into the game by all means do so just dont worry if youre sent back in a body bagi cant reccomend this game highly enoughit has funny interesting characters outstanding gameplay and a story that the game adheres to throughout the game something that few games can claim credit to
buy it buy it nowi just got this game and am still figuring it out but wow is it great
this game superbly incorprates many aspects of tactical combat that have been attempted in other games but were done poorly
this game is sort of like a hybrid betwen xcom swat and its own unique spin on roleplaying
it is a rtstbsrpgthe game is set in modern day pseudocental america and you are a mercenary that has been hired by a dissident of this wartorn region to come in and eliminate this evil warlord and her army
to do this you must hire other mercenaries via quotthe webquot and bring them in to help with the task
you also train militia as you gain support of the local population and various nonplayer characters join your army as well
you gain income from seizing control of numerous gold and silver mines in the region and from selling weapons and stealing money
there are also other side questsbounties etcthe game play is really excellently designed
you play in real time isometric view most of the time until you encounter an enemy and then the game goes into turn based tactical mode which is excellent
i personally think some of the interface could be cleaned up a bit but once you memorize the hot keys for common commands this is less quotclunkyquot  there is also an overhead map view wherein you canb check the status of your various troopssquads and direct them around the large grid map to different sectorsanother aspect of this game i love is the depth of development of the npcs and your own special merc or quotplayer characterquot you in the game
there are various attributes like in other rpgs strength agility etc
but then there are random special abilities your pc will obtain based on a psych profile you fill out at the begining
these include stealth martial arts handtohand night ops knifing ambidextrous heavy weapons electronics automatic weapons teaching camouflage lockpicking etcthere are too many features to list but this an engrossing well designed game with no bugs to speak of
i only hope they come out with a ja with fancier graphics and perhaps some more portrait options for your characteri will stick to the point with this review this game is excellent and is  one of my favourite gaming experiences along with outcast and the fallouts
the graphics are dated but they never dissuaded me from liking the game
the fights although they may be long are exciting and fun and the depth  of the game is on par with fallout  maybe not quite as deepthe  story is a basic but perfectly fine affair and the level of humour  throughout the game make it even more playable
get it nowthe classic rainbow six games is what started the series and seem to be the funnest in my opinion
ive had some issues running this game on win xp and i have been able to tweek and get it to run somewhatthis game is great for the gamer whether they like strategy or action its got both
its no kind of shootemup game but rather a game that relies upon the players quick wit planning techniques and response under  pressure
this game is fully playable with training missions and   playable levels
eagle watch the expansion pack comes with five extra  levels including two extremely good training missions they help alot
its got an extremely playable multiplayer game which is completely  shootemup although you can play coop on levels
if you pick up rainbow  six pick up this gold version because it comes with both the r missions  and the eagle watch missionsthis has to be in the top ten list of games ive ever played and im really not even a fan of stperson shooters
this game has a perfect combination of strategy and action and the expanded choice of weaponry and  equipment from the r is a welcome additionadd in the terrorist hunt  option for those people who just want to kill things and not worry about  irritating hostages and this game has massive replayabilityi did  experience some major bugs with the multiplayer version the darned thing  never loaded well
add to that the fact that i had serious lag issues with  the original r and this seems an iffy area but it was still a lot of  fun
best to have cable or isdndefinitely a must buy for your game  closeti would surely rate this game as the best tactical game ever made
what is striking is the succes the red storm has had in blending top level realism and good playability
the game is structured around a basic storyline where  the rainbow antiterrorist organisation is hunting down a terrorist  organization
you have to complete  levels too few from my point of  wiew in order to accomplish your mission
each level has a planning phase  where you select the team members from a force pool choose theyr equipment  and decide the action plan
a nice feature is the quotdefault  optionquot so that you can go thru this phase in as little as five  seconds and jump directly into action
once the game has started you can  swich between any one of you teams a feature that enables for an  incredible flexibilityfrom the realism point of wiew this game lacks  almost nothing exept for the flexibility of the ai
when you have played  the same level a few times you realize that the terrorits are always in  similar positions and it is very easy to simply pin point every one of  them
anyway i believe that this is not to be considered a major shorfall  in the game since you are not be supposed to try over and over a mission  before getting it right
another thing i believe is great in the game is  the great variety of weapons avaylable all of them with different  characterisics
this feature gives you the opportunity to customize you  team and the action plans very easily giving you the option of trying the  same scenarios over and over again experimenting different tactics
also  very interensting are the tons of mods files avaylable on the web
you can  get anything from an automatic grenade launcher to a star wars stormtrooper  laser blaster
even if these weapons are not exactly what you would find in  antiterrorist units they nonetheless add a completely new level to the  gameanyway i believe that the best feature of the game is the  multiplayer option
this is absolutey pure fun
the game is incredibly more  interesting once you are playing against real humans on the web
the  multiplayer version actually seems a computer paintball game
having played  paintball for a few years i guarantee you that by playing this game you get  most of the experience of paintball
you soon end up playing hours after  hours of totally different games finding players of different skill  levelsthe mission editor included in the game adds another level of  flexibility to the game if you have the time and the will to learn how to  use it
however if you are interesetd there are some free manuals on how  to use the editor on the webi also suggest you buy the expansion packs  avayable from red storm since they give you completely new levels a  little too few actually 
and weapons to play withmy suggestion
buy  it now and see ya at mplayercomrogue spear is the most packed action pc game that i played yet
it takes you misson by misson saving the hostages and killing the terrorists
i have to explain how awesome it isthere are new places you get to travel around at the airport in buildings etc
see its much better when you play online to tell you the truth
meet new people and even play with your friends
go one on one with each other or teams
get to pick out your own weapons and gender and even vote which level to go to
this is pretty much like socom on psim a girl and i think its still cool even if im not a guy
this is not waste of your moneyrrs is one of the best fps games out there admit some real compition in the genre
the graphics are very good oddly it did not make use of all the shading effects possible
it also sports some really good voice acting in the briefing missions
the game play is awsome the ai is almost perfect
while most of the tangos simply stand around their reaction to your team is very real and intelligent
however too often i would step through a door way and get killedonly my squad did not notice they would contiue to the waypoint
even if the tangos are in the path of the waypoint your teammates can get cut down fast if one of them does not have clear los
while the enemy ai is so good it is starnge the friendly ai is a notch or two below but still better than the first r
there are lots of little things that are cool there is extreme attension to detail here
i really liked seeing the charactors breath and see their breath in the air
the weapon selection is really big but only a couple of the weapons will you use
the ai is so sensitive to sound that to use something with out a silencer is asking for failure
most of the weapons are too loud to use on most of the missions so they are basicly useless in single player
also how each weapon sounds is very authentic and i loved to hear the smgs just firing away
a new feature are the snipers while this is good to use they have the same problem as above the sniper rifles are too loud
i gave my snipers the mpsd rather than the rifles they were supposed to use and it still works rather well
the learning curve is sharp and much of the planning phase is worthless till you have played the mission a few times to understand the map
however it pays to have a good plan and that is what really wins the game is good planning
it is extremely rewarding to see your plan work perfectlythis game is the best real life simulation  combat game ive played well not  realistic but its as close as it gets i guess
actually its the best game ive played period
i tried rainbow  once but didnt like  it too complex and took too much time to plan and set up a mission
this  one is awesome missions are already planned and all you have to do if you  want is just plunge in the action
on the other hand if you like you can  reject the default plan and come up with your own
moving around is soooo  much easier than with rainbow  you can move crouched and peek around  corners and these are both great enhancements
i use them a lot and saved  my posterior in more than one risky occasion
and of course theres  quotterrorist huntquot you can replay a mission with thirty baddies  around and no hostages its the ultimate shootouthunting match
its  worth every penny it costs
good job guysthe first online game i played was rogue spear
this game is so fun
of course there is higher technologys and better games now but this game is still one of my favorites
its a great fun doing the single player campaign and this game isnt a sleezy game where is takes  shots to kill you
this game is realistic
you get shot once in the arm you are inqured and slowly dying you walk slower and all that
you get shot through the chest or head you are dead
its not letting you get a whole mg round to the chest and survive like other gamesfor any military lover this game is and will always be a fun gamei still jump on my monitor when im shot
the variety of weapons the reality of the game the maps from all around the world turns rogue spear in to a habit
the only complain i have is the bad ai that causes problems sometimes but most of the time they are my planning and coordination mistakes
great game that all collectors should haveforget everything you have ever learned from anarcheous first person bloodbath games
you will need a totally different strategy for this game because when youre dead  well youre dead
you cant just reappear and  keep playing
one shot  one kill  realism
you will have your back  against the wall waiting to peek around the corner without making too much  noise
your heart will race and the adrenaline will flow as the dramatic  music heightens the suspense of who lies around the corner or behind the  closed door ahead
you will dim the lighting in your room and turn  everything else off so you can hear which direction the footsteps or the  gunshots are coming from
you will be surprised scared shot from behind  sniped outnumbered or outshot
the replay value is extremely high  because of the online play terrorist hunt and lone wolf options
some  missions are nearly impossible on the highest difficulty setting which can  get very frustrating
the online play is very addictive because getting  killed is more cause for revenge than getting fragged
i would recommend  getting the expansion pack as well because of the custom mission option
this option creates at least another month of replay value alone
can you  strike hard and quietly enough without being seen and alerting the  hostages all at the same time
its up to you to find outrogue spear is a very cool game its gamingstyle is similar to delta force but it has much more depth interaction and is more exciting
first  of all theres the wide range of uniforms weapons and characters to choose  from
also after each successful mission you get an awesome full sized  screen shot that you can print out by pressing print screen on your  keyboard and pasting it into any document
its realistic with enemies  that duck hide surrender and much more
the missions are preceded by  briefings that you can actually understand and profiles of the enemy  organization
the environment is just like being there with sandstorms in  oman and rain and thunder in kosovo to name a few what can i say the  only thing that could possibly beat it is actually joining the army i bought rogue spear because i bought rrainbow  and finished it but i wanted more
i heard they were coming out with a sequel and i thought it would be crumby like all sequels are i was wrong this is x better than r first  more missions than r 
there are more guns in rogue spear  which r really needed  in total  primary and  pistols when r only  had  in total  primary and  secondary and in this game you actually  need to use the flashbangs or the terrorists might kill the hostages when  they see you
and let me tell you this is not one of those bs st person  shooter games like doom where you have health packsnooo in this game the  st bullet shot at you could be the last
and for all the parents buying  this for their kids let me tell you this game teaches you strategy and how  to pay attention because if you let your guard down thats it game over
the ai in this game is also the best in any gamesome people might think  that it is a tad expensive but this game takes first person shooters to the next leveland this game is  from tom clancy who made quotthe hunt for red octoberquotnow the  last hing i can say is buy this game or you will definately be missing out  on something bigsequal to the  action game of the year rogue spear is a perfect mix of action espionage and stratagey
the game picks up with your team rainbow trying to stop the terrors that roam the world
you select from  over  memebers to create your team and than select weapons and outfits
you can also plan your own attack but i found it funner to use the  premade plans
once in the heat of the action you can switch between  teams which carry snipers assualt and electronic experts
in  player if  a memeber dies he is no longer accesible
missions range from a stranded   to a tv station
the replay in the game is unbelivable
i got it the  day it came out and still have even more fun playing it
each time  unlocking new stratagies and tips
there are a variety of modes ranging  from lone wolf just one character to terrorist hunt
the game plays out  like the tom clancy films quotclear and present dangerquot and  quotpatriot gamesquot and if you pay attention to the films even has  some of the same charcters
graphics are superb and sound is amazing
if  you crank up the speakers the game contains moments of absoulutely no  sound to matrix style shootouts
the suspense is amazing
the game uses  little music in gameplay to amplify the sound of footsteps and gunshots
when youve been playing a mission for  minutes trying to beat it and  you barely escape a sniper the thrill is amazing
and to later get shot by  a terrorist in the shadows is a crushing defeat
if you pick this puppy up  i gurantee it will become one of your best friendsthis was the first first person shooter i ever played that used a mouse to aim needless to say it got me hooked to the genremy favorite thing about this game is how realistic it is
its definately probaby the most realistic first person shooter ive ever played next to day of defeat
but not only that it was achieved without sacrificing gameplay or limiting fun
its hard to do yet it was achieved in this gamethe graphics are also very nice my older computer i dont know the specs was able to run the game quite well when it had problems with most other gamesi cant really think of anything negative to say about this gameit deserves a chancethis game is a great gamethe graphics are goodthe gameplay is incredible and very tactical
exccelent story linegood soundsbest cd music everjust buy this game fps fans  i recomend itblood omenlegacy of kain is an excellent video game in all aspectsa gripping storyline with many plot twists set in a very bleakgothic enviromentthe voice acting in the game is superb and very convincing with an errie but very appealing music soundtrackthis game is also original by breaking the mold of playing the typical good guy in video gamesthough in all honesty kain is not the evil monster that you might assume he isthe later installments of this game emphasize that and also showhow the supposed righteous forces of this game are in fact sinister and corruptit is absolutely necessary to play and beat blood omen in order to fully enjoy soul reaver and to understand the massive plot twists of soul reaver this game is a must haveintroduction blood omen legacy of kain is the first game in the legacy of cain line produced by chrystal dynamics
it was created by them with the help of silicon knights and is a gothic fantasy game about a vampire named kain and his quest to save the world and come to terms with what he is at the same time
this game is one of my personal favorites it has a wonderful setting a fantastic story and amazing characters
and even now many years after its release when its graphics are outdated and far more advanced games are out there to thrill the senses
i am still blown away by the powerful beautiful story and fun game play of blood omen legacy of kaingame play this game unlike the later games in the series is not a tomb raider style d game instead it is a classical fantasy game where you see your character sideways and down like in zelda
the setting is very nice a typical fantasy world with inns strange creatures swords magic and evil sorcerers
the game play can become a bit repetitive there are unknown hoards of enemies and you hack then to pieces with your sword or ax or mace and whatever you got or blast them with spells and artifacts
you do not get exp in this game your character kain advances when he finds items along the story line so all the slaughtering get a bit boring after some time you get no reward for it except a more cool title at he end of the game
instead of whelp your title might say prince of darkness if you find enough secrets and kill enough pepole
one nice feature of the game is that you have to drink blood from your enemies to keep your strength up
and your health meter is how much blood you have in your body in keeping with the vampire theme
you also learn to turn into a bat and a wolf and so on later on so you really feel you are playing a traditional vampire
this game was also one of the first computer games to use the legendary weakness for waters that vampires in myth have rain and ordinary rivers can be deadly creating something a bit different
the game is huge with an massive story line so you get allot of entertainment for your money with this game
the game is also not so difficult that you become frustrated the game flow easy so you can enjoy the story but it is not so easy as to not be challenging eitherstory i will not say to much about the story in blood omen legacy of kain so i do not spoil it for anyone but i will say that it is wonderful extremely detailed and would make a good book or a movie
in a way the story is rather typical of a computer rpg
there are some magical pillars and some evil sorcerers that have corrupted them and it fall you you you lucky bastard to defeat the sorcerers and bring back some artifacts to save the magical pillars and by that the world
rather standard but it is the story woven into this that is rather breathtaking
the characters are so good and the voice talent of simon templeman just bring the tragic and powerful character of kain to life
the story will suck you ingraphics at the time it was released legacy of kain had mediocre graphics they where ok but not really great the cut scenes are nice and while the graphics are not fantastic they do manage to capture the mood of the game and i think they do the job
the important thing in this game is the story and the graphics are good enough even if they are not exactly a selling point for the gamesound the sound of the game is really good from the talented voice actors many of witch are known cartoon voice actors or even regular actors to the mood creating music and sound effectsconclusion blood omen legacy of kain is a wonderful game
if you like deep and involving computer rpgs then this is the game for you
all is wonderful about the game the setting the story everything
the only thing i could say that pull it a bit down is that it is a bit to repetitive it is cool to hack pesky villagers and monsters like to bits and drain their blood but there is a limit to how long that is fun
i would give this game  out of  with only the bit repetitative game play and the sub par graphics pulling it down from a full  still if you own a playstation or a playstation  and like rpgs and fantasy games then get your hands on blood omen legacy of kain
you will not regret itany true fan of the legacy of kain soul reaver series must place this game at the top of their list in the series as not only did this entry set the tone and the pace for the rest of the series but it was a turning point for well done voice acting incorporated with a twisting and turning plot which leaves you guessing until the very end
first things first though this game has some of if not the worst loading times of all time in my honest opinion
however if you can imagine the top down perspective of legend of zelda a link to the past with the graphics that were full of drab dark colors creating an almost gothic overtone you might realize why this game was pushing the playstation  to its proverbial limits
the music is equally as enthraling with a mixture of orchestral quality dynamics and haunting sounds that will stay with you long after the game is turned offoverall the game is one of the best role plaingaction games on the system and combined with one of the most engaging storylines ever devised as well as some of the most gut wrenching and blood filled cinemas  the game pushed the limits of what could be allowed on playstation look at the censoring of the original resident evil for example
but it is not just this eclectic mixture that gives this game top honors in my book it is more so in its ability to draw the player into kains soul witnessing his will being torn apart at the seams as he attempts to confront his own personal demons upon being turned into a vampire at the beginning of the game
upon awakening in his sanctuary kain finds the world much more to his liking although the further he continues into his quest the more he questions his original willingness to become a vampire
epic in every sense of the word i dar anyone who says they are a videogame junkie to complet this game  as this is a true test of patience as well as utter skill
its shortcomings are easily overlooked once you realize just how engaging this game truly is with completly different weapons at your disposal you just cant forget the hum of the soul reaver the first time you acquire it to the numerous types of armor and magic you acquire this game is an overlooked gem
stick with it and you will not be dissappointed
enjoy your nightmareslooking back on the past  years there have been numerous sequels to the blood omen game
unfortunately none of these sequels follow the formula of the original great
they either tried to be more like tomb raider or devil may cry and missed the point entirelylets take another lookgood progressive action adventure semi linear gameplay
ala zelda find a semi secret unlock a spellweaponarmoritem later use that newly found ability to openexplore more areas incredible voice acting for the entire game top down hack and slash  spells items puzzles traps drain blood from victims without having to bite them first  deep gameplay switch weapons or spells depending on your circumstances  in game secrets engrossing mature storyline challenge in terms of combat and puzzles change forms at will become mist a wolf a humanbad horrible loading times on ps version low res graphics confusing menu system only  spellability at a time must go to loading screens to switch confusing map system difficult to pick up and play if you are not actively tracking your quest progress some puzzles are not solvable until you go back and find previous itemsabilities in other areasi am still playing this game today i keep coming back as the core gameplay and story are more interesting and varied than  of action adventure games released in next genthe is the very st in the legacy of kain the is an epic must own in order to understand the story of how kain even became a vampire so if you own this game enjoy itthere is absoutly nothing in the video game world that is more satisfieing than being kaini am a fan of the entire series and this is the one that started it allmatterof fact this game was the reason i ever bought my st playstation years and years agoi may download it on my psi would have already had i found a singel person that confermed for me some of the old features were kepttoo many words exist to describe this masterpiece game
the original playstation had quite a few hit games in its time but this would be one i would rate within the top  best games ever
the sequels not so much but this game had it all  the capturing storyline the incredibly clear and believable character voices great sound effects but mostly the true darkness this game entailshell on earth in midevil times and youre a vampire with a cache of weapons and spells out to deal justice
the view was interesting for its time d from above but its amazingly easy to navigate especially once you can morph into animalsthis game will never die its truly a forever game and ill own a copy of it just like ff and castlevania sotn til the end of time
buy it if youre into older games from one gamer to another  its worth itblood omen legacy of kain  circa good mature and dark foreboding story voice work is really goodbad graphics may looked dated to some game play may feel dated for some who never played a topdown rpgif it fits your taste topdown rpg an original take on the vampire story takes place in a medieval type of world similar to dungeon and dragonsgame its most assocated too the legend of zelda a link to the past alundra beyond oasisadditional notes this game was made by silicon knights who also made eternal darkness and metal gear the twin snakes on game cube silicon knights lost the rights to the franchise and eidos made all the sequels called soul reaver blood omen and soul reaver are two different franchises that fall under the legacy of kain franchise  a version of this game was also made on the pcbecause of game design
this is and isnt rpg this is and isnt  hack and slash this is and isnt adventure gamethis is a very good even excellent game that cant classified as a genre  a game where you neednt read faq in fear of unrecoverables where you have to think how to beat puzzles and even how to beat enemy groups where there is time for hacking and time for strategy too
voice acting is perfectly suited to misanthropic and revenge hungry main characterbeing curious usually pays with sweet bonus items story is really good considering it is a fantasy game with goth elements and what are you waiting for
go get it
i didnt have than much fun since first metal gear solid i ever played
psbad side if you dislike elements of horror too much maybe you will not like itto put it simply
i am not hardcore into vampires i am not a goth and most things vampiric these days are more annoying then cool in my opinion
so for me to say that legacy of kain is by far one of the greatest series of games ever made is really saying something about the quality that this game puts out
it is an older game so obviously the graphics are no longer going to impress
however i thought that the way the camera was set up really set the stage for this game to succeed as greatly as it did
when it comes to the story i am just truely amazed at the people who wrote the script to this game
it is truely an amazing story
kain is such an interesting character and he has many abilities
so many abilities and items and transformations in fact that i would be willing to wager that present day games dont allow you to do as many things as kain is able to in this old playstation  game
it really gives you the feel of being an amazing vampire
the character kain is more of an antihero which is something i think is refreshing since it isnt seen very often in video games
the game is presented very well with the start menu where you select your armorweaponsspells being very well drawn out
this game however shines most in the voice work
simon templeman the voice of kain is by far the greatest voice actor ever to work in the business
he even outshines tim curry and with the level of respect i have for tim curry that is saying something indeed
i find that my favorite thing about this game is listening to how the conversations are worded
they present it in an old english sort of way that really does well for the game
so in closing if you are looking for a game that is truely amazing and can appreciate an older game legacy of kain will not disappoint
i am the type of gamer who has such a low attention span for video games that i usually cant play a game for more then  hours before i quit it and never pick it up again
i have beaten legacy of kain blood omen several times as well as all the other games in the series and never find myself growing tired of them
they are just that well made with the intention of the game developers clearly indicating that they wanted to make very good quality games over just something to turn a profitthis is the only true game in the series created by silicon knights
its also the best deep dark and classic
a true console game overhead view like zelda the only game you need to play
id pass on the rest of the seriesas for the other socalled legacy of kain games and series they are created by a different company and even different people
those games are tombraider with vampire made for tomb raider fanboys not even worth looking at unless you liked the stupid pc gamesamongst all the mediocore games that are released year after year one game stands out as a true masterpiece and that is blood omen legacy of kain
the game has everything a true gamer would want
it has an intriguing plot outstanding voice acting amazing characters superb gameplay and possibly the best use of blood and violence in gaming history
maybe its just me but its use of gore is so good you actually get excited whenever you see blood fountains or blood sprurting out of people when you attack them
the weapons and armor you find throughout the world actually matter and have really cool effects ie
when you rapidly press the attack button with the axes equipped you spin around like a top destroying nearly anything that stands in your path
it has nonlinear gameplay although you must beat certain areas to find weapons items or secrets that are necessary to get to another part of the world
youre probably wondering quotwell what about the bad graphics people have been talking aboutquot well for one thing its birds eye view so naturally it just doesnt do what other games do
making it birds eye view was actually a very good idea considering what d games looked like in  but the movies which are d do have great graphics
in other words the people arent pointy so to speak
the world of nosgoth is very detailed using incredibly lush animation and realistic looking figures houses people castles etc
if any bad came from this its the loading times which you must have heard about by now
they are long and frequent but its not that bad
theyre really not that long but they pop up all the time
you have to wait  seconds every time you pause the game
you do get used to it though
one of the reasons that it has such annoying loading times is probably because of the size of the game
the world is absoluytely huge and it has  minutes of video footage which have great graphics
while the truth is that this is an amazing game possibly the best of all time it would have made a better book if it was written wellsaga frontier is an essential part of any gamers collection
with  different charactersfull storylines the replay value is stellar
find out how fates intertwine with this ps classicvery good game been collecting ps games and this has been on my list the case is a lil cracked but game works finelove the game
many many hours of great play
fun game
should have the strategy guide with you as wellbeing the first rpg released for the playstation and from a company such as konami which i had never seen make an rpg before really had been wondering how this would help the success of the newly found playstation game console
me being the game guy i am got playstation the day it came out and was looking for the best games around
i first rented this game and i was amazed
a rpg that has more then  characters in the game
in this game you have the capability of getting  no joke folks characters that are all different some how way or shape
along with a great storyline will have you sucked in for hours on end
take my advice i have beaten this game  times and im still not tired of it go for it
goodluck shoppingbrowsing everyonepsin suikoden ii you can load the data from suikoden which allows more characters
so besides konami being total genius you should get out there get this game and get all  charactersi absolutely loved this game
i thought the storyline was extremely original and it went it a different direction then most rpgs
for its time the graphics are very good and the plot is very developed and interesting
the fact that you get to have your own home base and go out and recruit people for your own army makes it in a class by itself
i loved going around and finding new recruits and though it can take some time it was well worth it
the only downfall i can really think of is the fact you had so many characters to choose from to put into your party
other then that i think its a solid game for rpg loversi remember getting this game when it came out
i didnt hear anything about it but my mom was willing to buy me anything
im glad she bought it for methis game is truly epic
the music is awesome
its no par with ffs music
it truly is some of the best
the battles are great
there are normal ones which are fun
you get to use  characters
your party is up to you
over the game you get  different characters of which rds are playable in battle
there are also duels
duels are fun
wars are awesome in this game
there is alot going on
the graphics are well done
for a d game
there are tons of different good looking sprites
the story is also magnificent
my favorite story ever
you come to love the characters
the game also ends perfectly
it is a tearjerker
right after the final battle i may have teared a little
the game is fun though
if you see it buy it
the game is well worth it because it is my favorite game of all time
it beat out mgs on my list so its goodi highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rpgs
the added tactics of the oneonone and army battles are a great addition to the game
its also really fun to collect all  charactersi love it
i played this game when it was first released and i loved the story line it reminded me of a movie i got so caught up in this game back then when new game systems started coming out i lost the game
later years i played suikoden    and suikoden tactics on psx but something was missing from them while looking thru amazomcom i just happen to run across this game and the memories came rushing back to me and so i purchased a used copy and it looks like new plays fine but no manuel which is fine i dont need it anyway all the packaging and case was with it
i know some out there dont like this game all i can say is great game 
norris gi love this game and series but the first and third are my favorite
this game is a stragedy rpg that features rich characters interesting game playside stories and many hours of game play
i am still waiting for them to put out another one and always check boards to see if there will be another onealas i still wait  highly recommendthe konami we all know is back
remember all the good quality games we used to get from this company
well konami is trying to get back into shape and suikoden the years best rpg is a step in the right direction
the story is simple
you are the son of the general teo one of the emperors most powerful generals
immediately your father leaves to fight a battle up north leaving a few of his trusted friends to watch over of you
soon after you come to realize that you and your father been serving on the wrong side
the emperor and his generals minds have been brainwashed
the result is unhappy subjects and an enslaved country
knowing this you join the liberation army and when their heroic leader is assassinated by the baddies you are chosen as leader
your job now is to recruit thousands of men to join the liberation army and restore peace to the countrysuikoden is full of beautiful backgrounds especially your castle which you can name not to mention outstanding effects for magic spells
the music is incredible rivaling the soundtrack of squares final fantasy 
some of the sound effects used in spells are reminiscent of those taken off old heman episodes which oddly enough sounds terrific
all this plus intricate plot twists and an inspiring storyline constantly push this game forward
suikoden is undeniably one of the best rpgs ever made
not only that but suikoden isnt a game that can be finished in a few days either
suikoden is long about  hours and it doesnt get boring everthis was the first nonsquare rpg i really got into and ive loved every minute of it
this game has several things that i personally enjoyed the most its a cartoon ive always preferred cartoony animestyle characters to realistic characters
the appearance of the people lightens some of the darker parts of the story very innovative the battle system is a mixture of good old fashioned spell menus and item lists and fastpaced roughhousing with button combinations its like mixing quotfinal fantasyquot with quotstreet fighterquot awesome story the story isnt anywhere near as developed as something like quotfinal fantasy tacticsquot but its solid and ensnaring
i was on the edge of my proverbial seat the entire time voices this game hasnt been butchered by lousy english voice actors and everyones sound bites are still in their original japanese
for some reason game voices sound cooler when you dont know what theyre sayingso if youre looking for a great game this is definitely for you
i extremely recommend this oneoh tales of destiny another underrated game very few persons have really played it other judge it by the coverthe people nowadays look at tales of destiny as a ugly and old d game without even give it a chancethe characters are the best features of the gameand now i try to answer at the most frequent critics ai is stupid the characters attack only the enemies in their directionare you dumb or what
the ai is perfect
what you never try to understand is that tales of destiny give you unlike other tales game the total control of every characters in battle
simply press l button your party move from a direction to another to attack the enemy at your choice the story is badthe story is at personal slant but magically in the remake the perfect same story in japanese is great  graphics is everything eh
 the game is too easytrue but no so easy the enemies dont fall down in two or three blows every battle has a good balance but then what are you talking about
theres a ton of rpgs more easy then tales of destiny as chrono cross final fantasy  grandia grandia  golden sun legend of manathe positive most epic characters ever  after xenogears excellent characters interaction perfect ai the spells are cast always at the right moment fantastic combat system that give you the total control of all characters in the battle story is well written with many plot twists old fashioned d rich graphics many puzzles in the every dungeons great city design rich exploration of a vast world unlike other rpgs realistic houses in the cities with bathroom bedroom kitchen ecc infinite sidequests almost every townspeople has character development
fantastic npcs very high fun factorthe negative casual encounters rate is very high easiest tales of game story is too slow at first awful awful conversion wheres the skits
the extra playable character food sack is totally useless a major bug in the last dungeon no titles simple but effective game system colors are dull namco could have made better use of the playstations color palettegraphics soundtrack story characters development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  long game with many sidequests easily more the  hoursdifficulty  easyreplay value  below avarageok i know this review is coming really late considering the game has been out so long but when i read the other reviews first of all the graphics
they rock
they are d yes and the people are small chibi style is what they call it
but the small people rock
they look like cartoons
when battling every character looks different you can equip different weapons besides the swordians and each weapon looks different
what really bugs me is that some people say the graphics are bad yes mabye the terrains do and mabye the outside world does but the battles
hundreds of animations for each character can describe it
there are so many different moves and spells for each characterwell so many different spells for characters with swordians ill explain that later
it is amazing that they have about  very different looking spells per character with a swordian and about  different special techniques per characterwhich is alot once you play through the game
i have beaten the game and yes the terrains for the outside world may be bad
but each town looks different
each dungeon is there for a reason and not there to get a special bonus item
trust me the graphics for battles are awesome and probably the best d graphics out thereas for plot and characters the characters are all good with unique personalitys
the hero really acts like a hero and everyone else acts like they should
there is plenty of dialogue and mystery behind everyone
sometimes like  times ive gotten bored of reading and skipped all the text but otherwise it isnt too bad
the plot is basically randomated at first
i didnt have a clue
you like need to go to some town or something
but there is this whole backstory about the these wars involving swordians and monsters and stuff
its complicated and i havent played the game for a while
but once you beat it the entire purpose and outcome of the aether wars become clear
so anyways you gotta save the world or some nonsence the storys good though
i mean you do stuff for a reason then theres a plot twist
seriously its like a spontaneous story so it isnt too boring
as for characters i read one review saying there was only  characters but that person hasnt even beaten the game
there are  if i remember correctly
a couple leave then come back then may seem lost but you find them later
 of them you gotta get on your own and wont be hard to find
one of them was said to be left out of the american version by some but you can get her
but yes there are  different characters that you can obtain
if you think i am lying beat the game
actually read the manual or a strategy you will seebattling i have sort of hit a little
many different animations in battle tons of spells techniques and so forththere is strategy to it though
you can move back and forth slash stab chop and swing upwards
this makes it fun and not the same old hit x select a command hit x select a command hit x but ok if i run up and do a stab i can hit the guys behind the bird too then i can have rutee do her bloody rose on the guy under me while i am in mid air so once i hit a guy up into the air rutee will continue the attack and destroy him
there are tons of things you can do to have fun
sometimes trying to see how many chain special attacks you can pull off
or mabye you want to test out all the tons of magic spells you have
it is fun to mess around and fun to use some strategy rather than do the normal final fantasy select and click battle
as for magic there are  swordians
you get quite a few
like the hero gets dymlos rutee gets atwight and so oncant spoil it
with these swordians you can develop magic
but only if you have it equpied
i mean you will always learn new magic but if you dont have the swordian equipped you cant cast any
still some characters dont get a swordian and rock
like at the end of the game only  of my characters including the hero actually were using a swordian
i dropped  of my high level people because they were getting boring
then i got this guy with a bow and a bard
it was very fun to see all new attacks and strategys to useoverall you will like this game
as you can see battling is top notch even though it can get frequent if you buy items to ward off monsters you shouldnt have a problemsure the graphics can be corny but hey the game itself is awesome
you dont have much choice on characters having to have  perminant sword characters and  extranonsword characters
am i spoiling
maybe notstahn is cool rutee is probably one of my favorite game characters of all time leons pretty cool though heuh nevermind
chelsea was my optional character and she became very powerful  and she didnt even have one of the talking swords
not only that by the time you can get her as a perminant member her level is so  low itd take hours to level her up to the others
level  when i got herthe character selection is a downfall
the graphics are corny but cute
bad vibes to the translators who removed the voices and removed the song
yeah for namco in bringing us a wonderful game with cool characters
the battle systemis wierd a near reproduction of tales of phantasia tods predicessorsome of the puzzels are difficult but are solveablebasically though its graphics resemble the snes tales of phantasia the game is still good
graphics to me dont make the gameits the storyhavent play long time like play game as enjoy that all as better than boring

and come get some
plus all these other outragouse and notforamazoncom thingsplay the game to find out whatalso this game has strong sexual themes for those of you that are sensetive about that but you can turn the gore off if you wantthe bada little difficult near the endammo depletes fastand health seems to deteriorate in gun fightsit goes from  to  and youre like wha
that is all i see bad in this awesome game and i hope you enjoy it as much as i dothe game works on pspsps and playstation emulators with no issuesmy first copy stopped working from playing it so muchi love this game
i remember playing it when it first came out in the late s
the graphics for that time frame were excellent
gameplay itself was really fun and the story line was cool too
time to kill was the rd person shooter that paved the way for others to follow
this it typical alien ass kicking duke nukem at his best
there are even some cool secrets in the game for added perks like upgraded guns
this is definitely a great game for the semivintage inventorythe ultimate shoot em up fantasy
this is a game for the hostile psychopath in all of us
graphics are okay but the sound is better
above all else we have a grade a all american hero with a twisted sense of humor
sometimes i just kill things i dont have to kill just to hear his comments
but be warned the game can get increasingly frustrating as you go deeper into it
you just wont go to sleep as youll find yourself in a new mantra just one more level and ill go to sleep
just one more level and ill go to sleep
just one more levelduke nukemtime to kill is a great game
however its not the best duke game out there but is one of the better ones
ttk offers you a huge variety of weapons and with over  missions youll be occupied
it feals as if is a cross between tomb raider and duke
overall it kicks serious ass
this is one to buyive read some of the reviews of this game and wondered what was going on
ive played the game and found it to be quite a great game
sure the challenge is there
this game is like a cross between tomb raider and duke nukem
there are puzzles and platform features
but there are duke characteristics to the game such as his humorous oneliners and antics
the learning curve is quite steep but after playing it for a while i got used to the controls
the controls are unorthodox only because the designers tried to fit a lot of moves etc
to the playstation controller
but you will get used to the controllers if you keep at it
for those that complained that the game is too hard maybe they need to play games that are more suited for them
video games are supposed to be challenging
not the spoonfed garbage that pass as video games but are in actuality interactive novels
duke nukem time to kill is simply put a great game if you are willing to put in the effort to learn the controls
if you do you will find a fun game that is worth your timertype gradius raiden whatever square looked around at the landscape and saidthe world has room for one more scrolling shooter
so they made einhander
this game gave all the previously a fore mentioned games a run for their money
well done graphics solid controls spot on hit detection and a sharp soundtrack make this title a wonder of the psx era
a second player option would have been nice
i have always felt that this doesnt get the hype it deserved
it was squares finest non rpg title
not to mix apples and oranges but i thought einhander had a better story than final fantasy  i dont know what that is but the stories to the recent ff games are always a mess
i also give this title props for not resorting to lame final fantasy character crossovers to cover for weakspots within the title as there are no weakspots found in einhanderrating ayou would honestly think that any game made by square in the era right after they relesed final fantasy seven would have gotten more recognition than this game did but unfortunately it did not easily becoming an underground type sensation that few could argue is not only one of the classic shootemups on the playstation but one of the best side scrolling shooters of all time
taking place in the all too distant future we find ourselves jumping into the helm of three vastly different ships which upon receiving different weapons mount themselves on your ship in different ways depending upon which ship you have chosen
each level is vastly different from the next and each boss requires a methodical and increasing harder approach to defeat it learning the patterns and timings of each boss is a must if you even want to get past the third level
with secrets galore and  unlockable ships if memory serves me correct the game is loaded to the rims with extras that will keep you glued to your tv for hours wondering how in the hell this game is so addicting
well in one sense the exceedingly difficult gameplay drives you to want to see what the next level has to offer while the actual process of figuring out the best route through each stage while acquiring the best weapons to be used against each boss comes down to a science and literally you have to become one with the controller and basically let your senses take over as this is probably right up there with contra shattered soldiers in terms of overall difficulty
but let me tell you the second you step foot into the final stage in the midst of an all out war against you and only you this game turns the world on you as you battle in space and fight off against one of the hugest robotech inspired bosses ever
phenomenal music accompanies this blissful experience as the pounding techno music even made me import the soundtrack from japan as i just could not get enough of the game and its music
it is unfortanate that the game never really made the waves it should have stateside as im sure squares reluctant to release a sequel due to the games lackluster sales but then again it just moves it right up there with radiant silvergun probably the best shooter of all time in terms of one of those games you mention to someone and there either like what game
or oh my friggin god that game is so amazing
praobably one of the best games youve never heard about or will get a chance to play good luck finding it and even greater luck trying to master it and beat it
impeccablei had this game back when i was a kid
at first i didnt know what the hell i was doing
but now i unlocked everything and now its fun to play
stars to the childhood returningthis is a fantastic game all around
from gameplay to graphics at the time anyhow
even one of the very best game soundtracks ive ever heard
i still play it to this day
this game has an unreal amount of unlockables and hidden paths
getting everything can be insanely challenging but the standard player should be able to at least get all weapons on the normal planes
id recommend this game to people who like contra and those raiden or  games
well worth the  dollars thats being charged for it now
i own a copy and i would never sell ittheres a reason why this game is held in such high regard among true blue shooter fans
einhander has the trappings of a legendary game within its genre
dazzling graphics tight control outstanding music and sounds and a strong variety of weapons
theyre all here but thats not where the fun stops
theres also an art gallery that grows as the quality of your performance increases and an intriguing story much different from the usual quotan evil alien empire wants to destroy humanity lets send one fighter pilot to stop all  of themquot fare
in einhander youre on a suicide mission and youre painfully aware of it
beautifuleinhanders visuals are beyond reproach
the backgrounds are vibrant and detailed without being garish or distracting especially stage five
ship designs are cool all around and every enemy from the mightiest boss to the lowliest peon goes out in a blaze of glory when you destroy it instead of merely blinking out of existence or disappearing in a bland red puffon the audio front the sound effects are excellent
launching rockets shattering neon signs and of course explosions
all well done
the intentionally emotionless female voice that addresses you after each stage is very credible and the german commands you hear during boss encounters lend a terrific sense of atmosphere to the game
moody and catchy techno tunes provide the musical backdrop and for the most part complement the corresponding areas perfectly
the operatic female vocals at the beginning of stage one clash very effectively with the destruction that ensues and let you know your ears are in for a treat from the start
and the music for the sixth stage end boss after the rocket with the time limit is so rousing you wont even care when he kills you  times in a roweight special weapons are readily available and theres something for every taste from the heatseeking wasp quotyou can run but you cant hidequot to the lightsaberlike blade quoti dont need no force to kick your sorry buttquot to the nononsense walloppacking cannon quotjust diequot
plus there are four others each a sort of variation on one of the ubiquitous eight hidden throughout the gameeinhanders developers hit the nail squarely on the head pun absolutely intended where the challenge level is concerned
the game can get pretty rough but its the good kind of rough
no shields or defensive powerups are available one of the games very few flaws so one hit will kill you but it has to be solid direct impact
enemy bullets that travel at  mph and just barely graze the little ball on the top of your radio antenna dont count
the last two bosses are tough to beat and some of the earlier ones arent exactly a cake walk either but the only one that i think crosses the line between quotchallengingquot and quotfrustratingquot is the robotic ape midway through stage five
oh how i despise that bananachewing abominationyou get three lives per credit and nine continues for a total of  lives though youll earn an extra life or two along the way when you attain a certain score
however there is one point in the gamethe rocket you approach from behindwhere if you fail to defeat it within the given time limit its game over no matter how many lives or continues you have left
so unless you want to see the quotbadquot or should i say quotworsequot
ending id advise you to get yourself killed if it looks like youre not gonna get the job done in time
then youll get another shot at itif proof was ever needed that d games can still be plenty of fun einhander is that proof
i revel in the fact that it outshines many more modernized games on all fronts despite the oldfashioned d gameplay
the only exception is the wasp missile being able to seek and destroy onscreen enemies that have yet to align with your ship and certain objects in the background toothats a hint
some might complain about the lack of a twoplayer mode but in my opinion the gloomy suicide mission aspect of the game would be jeopardized if it werent played solo
with three ships to select from and no shortage of secrets including two additional ships the replay value is strong but even if that werent the case youd want to play it again and again anyway because its crafted with such tender loving care and on many levels its flawless
i have no qualms about calling einhander one of the alltime great games for the playstation
square would be well advised to rerelease it along with final fantasy tactics and xenogears
dont hesitate to grab a copy if you come across one as i for one am not selling minehands down the best side scrolling shooter ever
i still play this on my ps
you know a game is a classic when no stores can get it and people are selling it used for one of the most epic  d shooters i have ever played
its so good it even has its own ost album
read official critic reviews and watch videos on this because this game cannot be explained on hereyou know at first when i first started the game and i was trying to learn it as much as possible and being shot down a lot i thought to myself that this thing is way too hard as you cannot save your progress at any time during the game
all you save are essentially the game info when you have completed it and the scores you racked up until all the continues have been used up
speaking of which you have  lives and  continues giving you a grand total of  lives
now you see this and say oh should be a piece o cakenot so fastthe story goes that you are a daredevil of some sort who is from the moon
youre sent on a one man suicide mission to right whatever wrong is going on down on earth
this is where not being able to save comes in
its a suicide mission meaning you essentially have one shot at it to take care of things or else you start over
you are given three distinct ships in which to choose from that has different weapon styles associated with them
for firepower you have a mix of a regular machine type gun that squaresoft calls the manipulator and a host of other special weapons like the vulcan machine gun the cannon or riot which is an electrical charge type of gun
when you are playing shots come from everywhere
the deeper you go into the game the more hectic it gets
if you play it on a ps youll notice that when there is a lot going on in the game the machine slows down the action on the screen
on a ps this problem is absolutely eliminated
at any rate when the action picks up your reflexes and quick decision making skills will be put to the test
especially when you fight the bosseseach stage has two bosses
a miniboss and the real deal
at the onset the bosses are not too tough but as you go along square makes things a little more challenging
seriously if you can beat this game the first time through you are a video game pro
this thing gets hard real hard from what i remember
it stinks when you get far into the game only to run out of continues and have to start over again
but i suppose this method forces you to bring your a game because towards the end is where it gets hairy
speaking of which what would a classic video game be without a little bit of a twist to go with itplay it and youll see what i am talking about
a video game classic not to be missedvideo games are not made this good anymore
rtype  is eight levels of shootemup fun
if you have never played this game before you will be amazed at its level of difficulty
luckily the beautiful graphic awesome music and addictive game play make starting over over and over agian more digestible
rtype ii  offers six levels of shooting entertainment
three new powers ups have been added and your main beam weapons capability has been increasedthis a must have collection if you can still find a copy
to play these games in their orginal arcade version is a dream come truethere have been other rtype games but none of them have reached the level of perfection of the first two gamesthis disc contains the perfectly emulated arcade releases of rtype and its sequelthe games are punishingly hard unless you can power up to the max and then never get hitlike the classic castlevania series these games will chew you up and spit you out if you let themnot suitable for children due to the profanities they will likely hear you scream while playing and for the new profanities they will make up while they playplays on playstation if youre looking for a fancy new shooter with jaw dropping graphics and modern styling rtypes is not for you
on the other hand if you want arcade perfect ports of two of the best shoot em up games ever created definitely pick up a copy of rtypes
it is a must have collection for any real shoot em up fan
it features both rtype and rtype ii as well as some bonus features and options
i particularly like the additional difficulty settings and the ability to start with more ships
anyone familiar with rtype games knows they will need them
the difficulty level of these games is very high especially in rtype ii
to my knowledge there are no better console translations of these games currently available
prior to this release my favorite and arguably the best arcade port of the original rtype belonged to the turbografx  pc engine
the original rtype ii wasnt even available in america
thanks to rtypes for the psone we get both in one nifty little packageanother treat is the rtype gallery and history bonus section
for fans of the series there are lots of additional goodies to be seen here
one of my favorite features of this title are the helpful cheat codes irem included for us
there are level select ship speed up get all weapon upgrades and invincibility codes to be had if the games prove too difficult for you
i had to give this collection the benefit of the doubt with  stars because of the perfect quality of the arcade ports the additional difficulty options new fmv sequences and cheat codes availableif only irem willing to remake rtype on ps or ps  that would cure my boredom of first person shooter syndrome
we need more games like rtype gradiuscontraeinhandergreat but very difficulti suggest rtype dimensions that came out on xbox live arcade
its a version of these  games rtype  and  that makes it playablefor people who dont have superhuman reflexeshighly recommendedby the way xbox live arcade and the psnetwork store are greatthis game is awesome it takes hours and hours to play but youll love every second thinking about your next move and conteracting your opponet to save europe and the world will keep you coming back time after time i have played this game for about  years and i still love itwas a gift and is thoroughly enjoyed
thank you
sorry it took me so long to leave feedback i thought i had done so by now
my apologiesto bad the dont hd this game
that would be an awesome game to bring back
it would be greatthis is my third copy kids destroyed the others now they are grown so this one has a chance to survive
highly addictive and you get lost in time when playing several hours will go by before you know itmy game is in mint condition now i am not saying that your game will be but this most likely is a rare game now
especially in this old card board casebut havent yall heard of an uldn but a goodnthe panzer general series is truly an incredible step forward in turn based strategy
not as simple as such games as heroes of might and magic  but much more simple than the battle of kursk
in this middle nitche players get to feel like they are running an army but they dont get saddled with the  to  logistic systemand as quaint as panzer general may seem it is a very deep game
even panzer general  avoided have the polethera of units and tactics as are in   you will be able to use navies strategic bombers and just about anything else one might expect to see on the wwii battlefield
play is challenging and rarely stale
getting the coveted decisive victory is never too easy but it remains attainable and rewarding
the prestige system is also useful giving players points for taking cities eradicating units and so on
butmost importantly your army carries over from level to level meanng that the game can be played several times with different units and the outcome will be differentthere are also branches based on the speed of victory
trust me this game is timeless and endlessthis can be considered the ww strategy game for the pc which singlehandedly revived pc wargaming and forever changed the genre with its continuing influence
even by todays standards the game is fun challenging and accessible and still provides hours of gameplay even after all these yearsfor those unfamiliar with it panzer general is a turnbased ww strategy game that allows you to fight out the major and hypothetical campaigns of the second world war at the roughly operational level with players moving around units of tanks infantry aircraft artillery etc
while historical accuracy is not paramount as in other more grognardoriented titles it does boast a wealth of historical vehicles aircraft and troop types for the player to command
while the graphics and sound may be dated the gameplay at the heart of pg is still rock solid and engrossingplayers can try their hand at a number of individual scenarios but the heart of the game is in the campaign
in the grand campaign players start out with a handful of core units at the beginning of the polish campaign and from here the player fights out the entire war to either its triumphant conclusion or bitter end
with each completed mission the player has the opportunity to upgrade existing units for their core force and also purchase new ones
units also acquire experience throughout the game an excellent concept that forces players to think strategically and play smart to avoid loosing these precious units
win or loose though the campaign is a blast
win marginally and loose some throughout the campaign and you could end up defending berlin from the soviets
win big every time and you could be invading americathis game is still on my hard drive today after all these years and for anyone that has not yet played pg it is well worth the time and effort to get a copy and experience it
later games in the generals series added refinements visually and tweaked gameplay but none had the instant immersion appeal and charm that this game still possesses
this is simply one of the greatest strategy games of all timeythis game makes you use your head and it makes it fun
their are many paths to victory and it is cool to be able to fight your way through dc but remember to beef up your air force because america wont hold back their jets justs because you only have stukas big mistake on my partwas a gift and is thoroughly enjoyed
i am sorry it took so long to leave feedback
i thought i had done so by now my deepest apologiesthis game not only entertains it also educates
i learned a lot of stuff about tactics such as the effects of both offensive and defensive artillery upon infantry tanks etc the uses of different types of units and the elements of blitzkriegafter playing a hundred or so hours it will have you feeling as if you are a compitent general capable of changing the course of historyof the many things i learned from this game was how effective an army could be held at bay at a natural barier such as a swamp by a dugin force with artillery
after learning this i heard of many true battles which used this exact same tactic such as the marines holding on for their lives during the early stages of the korean warthe game even inspired me to write a bookyoull play this game for hours and always find something new this game is very cool and you wont be sorry to play it their are multiple endings and it is fun to just explorethe sega saturn as we all know did not have the greatest game library in the world
even smaller was its collection of exclusive games with most being ported to ps
astal is a gem being one of the few games to be saturn exclusive and never having been ported to new systems
this game is an amazing adventure filled with beautiful hand drawn graphics a one of a kind sound track a full anime opening and a story filled with love disappointment and redemption
for those of you out there looking for an amazing saturn game this is itastal nights into dreams burning rangers the panzer dragoon trilogyso many games in the saturns short lifespan same with the dreamcast
sega was the goto company for quality gaming experiences in the s
most people would say otherwise that nintendo deserves that title
however sega held their own in the software department
the companys bad marketing decisions were endless but at least we got some great games out of their selfdestructive tendencies
the saturn like the n and the playstation would easily have been a mainstay in my home if only it was more affordable back in the day rather than nearly double the asking price for sonys playstation
oh well at least i can play these games now as an adult
too bad the game prices mostly are so high due to greedy sellers and annoying collectors
i blame them for the outrageous jackingup of the prices
shame on you people
pthe saturn system strong points is d hardware
just look at this game beautiful graphics colors and game play from astal
but thanks to bernie sega president at the time said no d and rpg games for the saturn
thanks to him not many great games like this came to us
get this game and plenty d import gamesastal for the sega saturn is a one or two player game thats similar to the likes of rayman but is a ss exclusive and a one of a kind game
im not comparing the two they are just similar
astal is an anime type game that has beauty class cool graphics and also great replay value
i just love the way the japanese can come up with the craziest story lines for their games
 and cartoons  astal comes from the planet quartalia and he was created from a red jewel
the girl he is trying to save came from a green jewel and they both were created by the goddess antowas
 who takes a lot of naps  and what self respecting anime game would be complete without an evil demon to chastise the hero
well this ones name is jerado ohhhhhhhhh
astel must now save his world and his love intrest leda
he also has the help of a bird companion that helps him out a lot
in the two player mode the second player plays the bird  never tried the two player mode  but it looks like fun
the control is not bad and astal can perform a breath attack pick up and throw heavy objects the ground pound and the air punch
you can also make the bird search for items attack  perform special tasks and you do this just by whistling
 on the controller  there are fifteen levels of d platforming bliss in this rare sega saturn jewel
the worlds are colorful the bosses are cool the story is strange but fun  the artwork is great and well drawn the gameplay is top notch and the music  fx are fantastic
 the voiceovers are cheesy but i like cheesy 
if i had a complaint  but i dont  it would be the control could be tweaked a bit tighter but still its not too bad overall
if you like anime japanese humor and solid platforming games this ones for you
astal is a must for any ss collection 
happy gaming now listen when i was  years old this was my absolute favorite game at the timei wrote about it for schoolwork projects and homework
so then my teacher knew all about it haha
i wrote about it in my journal
i played it all the time
his voice is stuck in my head for life and it was an amazing experience
the videos in the game are wonderful and the action characters and graphics suck you in
i remember it as being the best experience one could find on a sega system at the time
if only they had also ported princess crownthis is a wonderfully made game
its full of whimsy fun and beautythe saturn was so underappreciated in north americanext to nights into dreams and burning rangers astal was sonic teams other super impressive sega saturn game
sadly due to the changing landscape in gaming which happened to favor d gaming over d gaming astal suffered from poor sales in north america
regardless of its sales astal received a positive reception from both game reviewers and gamers that actually gave it a chanceblessed with beautiful handdrawn art and animations astal is truly a thing of beauty
even on its aged hardware astal still impresses because of its attention to detail
the environments are so well done
this is some of the most beautiful d art ever conceivedin addition to its wonderful art style astal has an amazing soundtrack which was something to be expected from sega at the timethe gameplay is simple and pretty much exceptional
astal at its core is a d platformer
all of the mechanics work exactly as they shouldastal really is something to behold
if you dont already own it youre doing yourself a great disservice
buy it immediatelyanyone who says that video games are just games have to be out of their minds
welcome to nightopia the land where your dreams are a reality
whenever i play nights im reminded why i grew up loving video games because the world i was taken into seemed so real it reflects the world ive always wanted to live in
this review will be in a dreamers perspectivegameplay the object of each stage is simple collect  blue chips defeat the ideya captures and return to the ideya palace
there are four parts of each stage and destroying all four ideya captures ends the stage and sends you to the boss room
each part of the stage is played like a lap around the course each is different than the other and has the chips and ideya captures in different areas
nights can attack enemies by using the drill attack or by doing a paraloop around them
you start the stage as one of the dreamers elliot or claris and walk your way to nights to officially start the stage
nights is entirely controlled in the air he flies through each part of the stage doing all kinds of loops and acrobatic techniques all the way
anyway its a little hard at first but the more you play the better you get at it nights moves so fluid in the air heshe never feels stiff or robotic
graphics one of the few d games in the era that felt alive
flying in dreams is a fantastic idea and couldnt be pulled off any better
nights claris and elliot are fully d along with the bosses ideya captures and environments
nights leaves sparkles wherever heshe flies and when making a paraloop fills his loop with sparkles and firework effects
the enemiesitems and menus are d but are never out of place and blend perfectly
the environments and scenery are great very dreamlike and are very pretty as you circle around them
also youll be given fantastic cg cutscenes during the opening and endings an excellent feat for back then
sound each track is excellent though i didnt like the credits song dreams dreams but thats just me and fits with each area of the game gate of your dreams is one of the coolest tracks ever it plays during the stage selection
childhood dreams and voices echo through the purple clouds and a very highpitched melody plays
all the stage tracks fit with the themes of the dreams perfectly
the cutscenes have no voices to fit the dream perspective which is good
and the more i play it it seems that the stage music changes a bit and even changes into a different song i think its part of that alife feature
good thing the disc doubles as a soundtrack
story the story is simple but extremely effective elliot and claris are having trouble in their daily lives and it gives them nightmares as they go to sleep at night
but trouble brews not just in their lives but in nightopia too
the evil wizeman plans on taking over nightopia and turning all dreams into nightmares
all but one of his minions are loyal nights discovers claris and elliots power of courage and show up in their dreams to help conquer their fears and save nightopia
the story is a great match and cant be rivaled for a game such as this
nights is an excellent game and needs to be in everyones collection
though a little rare its worth every penny i advise buying the d control pad it makes the entire experience all the more fun
the game has plenty of replay value
its all based on getting better scores but youll never get bored
whenever i feel like not getting into a game thats heavy on gameplay i pull out nights and have the time of my life
final review sweet dreamsthis game is one of the most beautifully crafted games i have ever seen
the controls are very natural and comfortable
the graphics are outstanding
the plot is entertaining
sure to delight anyone who owns a saturn a definate must buy
loads and loads of nonstop fun
untill you turn it offi just bought this game last week after having not played it in  years
the moment i booted it up the memories just came flooding back
the graphics havent aged too well but the design and controls were still great
i love this game
im just glad my saturn still works after all this time
now i just need panzer dragoon zwei and my nostalgia fix will be meti remember getting a saturn when sega was trying to liquidate their merchandise at toys r us back in  and im sure the games were cheap so this was the one i remember vividly from its music  whimsical graphicsagain im sad that a aaa sonic title wasnt on the saturn but this is just as goodgraphics  music  it mixes d sprites  d environments into  game thanks to the saturns  cpusthe pop up is almost not seen the enemies are creative  look actually thoughtful  not genericcontrolsyea this gets a  mostly because a d control pad is the best results you can get
i tried both model controllers and they seem to be so sensitive  haphazard
the smooth and st analog controller is recommended for thisreplay value  im not a gamer who cares all about points im more of getting to the end  story type of guy
but this is like a arcade gameplay with a time limit  scoring system that keeps me playing this several times a weekbut the way it scores you is incredibly hard ive played this game for  months and i rarely get a b or a repeat gameplay is needed if you want to get anywhere in this gameso to sum it up this should be in the saturn when you buy it
make sure you get the maual  case at least becasue this game almost doesnt tell you nothing when you start itthis is without a doubt the best game on sega saturn
this is what childhood is about innoscence
mine was taken from me when i had cancer at age  and when my dad was  years in the air forcehow many adjectives can a person come up with to explain nights into dreams
lets see awesome beautiful cool groovy  im old  strange colorful and     aw shucks there are way to many of them to mention
when i first started to play this game i was mesmerized by the sheer beauty of it
i bought the boxed set with the new d controller and fell in love with them both
i really think one of my all time favorite bosses is in nights and her name is puffy
you fly up to her and grab hold then throw her through the walls of the levels its great fun
the boss jackle i hated the most with his insipid laughing and mocking as he throws cards at you
 aaaurrgh  
the head boss at the end of the game is called wizeman
he is way cool with his six arms and eyeballs in the palms of each hand trippy
using the d controller is great fun and it helps you fly through the air with the greatest of ease
 wow that would work in a song  nights is a d  not true d  game that was created  by the sonic team and it has the heart of a sonic game
i guess you can call part of the game d because when playing one of the kids before becoming nights you can walk or jump around on the ground collecting the chips you lost when the timer ran out
i just cant stand that overgrown egg  alarm clock that chases you around when your exploring or collecting your lost blue chips
you can also play in a two player mode after beating the boss reala
reala is nights alterego that looks similar to nights but is evil oooooh
another reviewer did not like this level but i think its a blast and it adds that much more to the game
sega also gave us a christmas present called christmas nights its very cool
nights into dreams has some of the most imaginative gameplay and  visually stunning graphics i have ever seen and that counts for todays games too 
sweet dreams i only got to play this game a few times at a store when i was a kid and that was enough to leave an impression
i have always wanted to play this game and it alone is reason enough to own a saturn
yes they released it on the psn but it doesnt look the same nor does it have the same charm as the original
buy a saturn this game alone justifies the purchasea game informer editor not all that long ago reviewed this game as part of their past reviews section
he said it was his favorite game of all time
when egm magazine made their list of top  games of all time this game was higher on their list than any other game by sonic team
i love this game and would not part with my copy for anything
why
so glad you askedfirst of all this game has some the prettiest graphics to be found anywhere
no not the smoothest not the highest polygon count not the most astonishingly technically ect ect
this game may be old but the graphics have style they flow and they are fastsecondly the music of this game is some of the coolest ever produced for a video game
from the neat intro to the music played after you defeat a boss or a level the music in nights is pure magic except perhaps for the terrible end game music
and not only that the music changes in the levels depending on how you interact with nitopians and how well you dobut of course the real thing that makes any game great is gameplay and this is the area where nights is mindblowing
every level is a d on tracks wild ride morphing spinning zooming and zipping
through these levels you are constantly trying to at a brisk pace in order to keep from running out of time
and you are trying to rack of bonus points
and then you reach the only part of the level and wondershould i go around again for more points or should i play it safe and exit the level now
youll only get good points if you exit before times up and get tons of bonus points
and then theres the bosses
they may be pretty easy to beat but youre timed
beat them faster to rack up more points
beat them slow to welllose points
it all becomes quite addictive quite quickly
and controlling nights is breeze with the saturn d analog controller i do not recommend using the standard saturn controller for this game
its not nearly as intuitive and just takes too much away from the experience
about the only major negative point that can be made in reguard to this game is that its too short
if it had double the amount of levels it would be perfect
but even at its tragicly short length nights is an undisputed classic
every level has replay value galore thanks to the grading system and the previously mentioned interactive soundtrack
and even when youve long since beaten the game and played it to death youll find yourself picking it up once in while for one more try at breaking your highest score
all in all its worth buying a sega saturn for this game alonenights into dreams is a game that is both nostalgic and amazing to this day
the music the gameplay and graphics all bring back tears of joy because games like this just arent made anymore
however even though it may be a nostalgic trip down memory lane nights into dreams still holds up entirelyflying through the beautiful levels in nights into dreams is a sheer joy even though they may look pixelated in this day  age
the gameplay holds up so welleverything about nights into dreams screams classic
this is a game you play and never forgetits rayforce er galactic attackdont know why they changed the name but heyits a nearly arcade perfect port
there are a few little graphical differences but overall its deadonthe good excellent graphics
its a d shooter but its full of scaling zooming parallax and all sort of pseudo d effects
very cool
 controls well
 fun levels and bosses
you have a homing laser weapon that can lock onto enemies that are beneath you
 pumping soundtrack with higher quality instruments than the arcade versionthe bad its hard
the last few levels are extremely punishing
 it doesnt save high scores to the backup ram
or at least it hasnt done that for meverdict
if you have a saturn you need galactic attack
visually impressive and a blast to play its one of the better shooters on the saturn
sure its not radiant silvergun but an outstanding game is still outstandinggalatic attack the very first installment along with ray storm and ray crisis is arguably the best installment out of   its so depressing for the fact that shooter genre is no longer mainstream in video gaming however if you are looking for a really goodi said really goodshooter and you still own sega saturn then please get this game because you will thank me tremendouslythis very first installment also known as layer section in japan set the standard way to high for its sequels to catch up with
the second installment ray storm did managed to catch its magic with substandardgraphicbutwithbetterending however last installment ray crisis falls flat on the groundthe game is obviously very challenging most challenging out of  and graphic is just sweet just sweet
the music was done by zuntata whose work involve with darius gaiden and ray storm and you can really tell and will be gratefulif you look at the title of each stage you will feel almost feel that this is not just a mere shooter game but because of that title you can almost sense the story line flowing as you go along
i think thats really something being able to convey the feel of storyline just with title of each stage
you gotta play for yourself to see what i meani remember playing this game again again and again to finish its really tough you will have to put lot of time into itto be honest with you ive literally played all the shooter games available on all the dominating console systemsok may be not all of them and im not being proud here strictly d and i would pick galatic attack as the best shooter in domestic gaming without any hesitation
what about graphically superior games like silpheed for ps
what about classics like gradius amp
what about so called innovative einheinder for ps
what about arguably best game for dc mars matrix
really mark my word galatic attack will just dominate them not necessarily because it has better graphic or more innovative feature its will just blew away the competition because of its tight gameplay and all the thrill you will enjoy out of this shooter
everyone has different taste on different games but i love shooters  i love shooters than any other genre and im proud to admit thatok again not being proud hereso if you are looking for a shooter now you will have to be really wanting for a great shooter herewith awesome graphic intuitive music palmsweating gameplay and makingyouplayingitagainandagain challenging factor with everything in balance to give you that masterpiece feel look no further and pick this one of the best shooter of all time really im not joking herewell im truly honored truly honored to be the first one to review this game and i dedicate this review to galatic attack one of the best shooters of all time
i know no ones gonna read this review since its the game for deceased sega saturn however if you happened to read this and own sega then you know what to do right
mild smileenjoy itlike shmups
dont want to jump through hoops to play import games
this is the game for you
galactic attack has great graphics and solid gameplay to back it upgalactic attack also known as rayforce gunlock or layer section depending on which region youre in is a vertically scrolling shmup
in addition to normal shot you can lock on to enemies in the background using an onscreen cross hair
using the lock shot is also tied into the scoring system as waiting to lock on to multiple targets increases a multipliereach level leads directly into the next from outer space to breaking planetary atmosphere to descending into the depths of the underworld
this makes the game feel like a journey instead of the random level structure found in many shmups
levels also incorporate the lock shot well allowing you to damage and collapse structures in spectacular displays of firepower
from a design standpoint galactic attack was really well thought outthis is also one of the least expensive must get games youll find on the saturn
dont miss this gamegalactic attack for the sega saturnis a intense hardcore shooter that delivers the goodsthe graphics are stunning and crisp
the controls are smooth as silk  whats there not to like
get ready to spend some time with aching fingers with this oneits that goodwith games like this is proves that the sega saturn was and still is an amazing systemgalactic attack is a memorable game for me because as a kid it was one of the first games that i bought for the sega saturn
shooters were always close to my heart since i grew up near quite a few arcades
galactic attack was a lot of fun since you could shoot down enemies in the background in addition to the foreground
it had an added layer of nuanced depth that made it feel more tactical than other shooters
other than that unique element galactic attack feels very similar to raiden because its a pure space shooter without any of the odd or quirky elements or art direction that you might find in other games in the genre
its a really tight and well made shooter for any fans of the genre
if you have a sega saturn and youre not looking to spend a lot of money this is your best choice
you should also give darius gaiden a look which is another superb shooter that acclaim published for the sega saturn and its very affordablepanzer dragoon is a great rail shooting game
it is easy to play and has a lot of cinematic qualities
i highly recommend itthe sega saturn was a colossal failure in both sales and actual games
however in the ashes a few gems sparkled
panzer dragoon defined the rail shooter genre which is long gone
this game is one of the few reasons to even own a saturn
with an in depth story line and the best bit graphics of the era this game will not disappoint you
you will come back multiple times to save the mysterious land you fight for and ride the blue dragon to victory against the evils of the empire that took everything you hadi have very fond memories of panzer dragoon
it was the first game i bought for my sega saturn back in may  meaning it was my first taste of  bits
it was such a different time then because the sony playstation hadnt been released yet and the  bit systems were still reigning supreme
a real clash of the titans nintendos snes vs segas genesis
it was hard to declare a clear winner back then so the idea of sega dominating the  bit era didnt seem so absurd
i remember seeing a few tiny pics of panzer dragoon screens in magazine previews and that was enough to get me interested even though i couldnt really see what was going on
when i finally played it i was completely blown away
segas team andromeda did an amazing job of creating a unique fantasy world
well sort of unique it was heavily inspired by the mangaanime nausicaa
as for the game itself its a d onrails shooter
it followed in the footsteps of space harrier and star fox
the bulk of the simple game play was controlling a crosshairs and locking onto targets with guided lasers
one feature that was new at the time was the  view control
enemies could attack from any direction so you had to be quick with those l and r shoulder buttons
another thing that set panzer dragoon apart from other shooters was the presentation
it opened with a beautiful cinema setting the stage for a war and showing just how you come to possess a flying dragon as your steed
it had its own fictitious language increasing the player immersion
it was a true masterpiece
about a year later the sequel was released panzer dragoon zwei ii
redundant i know but that is the official title it stayed true to the original but threw in some new elements and improvements as well
unfortunately by the time the third game in the series panzer dragoon saga was completed in  the saturn was already all but dead in the us
the sony playstation which was initially met with a great amount of suspicion and distaste from the gaming community had become the most successful game console in history and absolutely crushed its competition
panzer dragoon saga came very close to not being released in the us at all but in the end sega saw fit to produce a severely limited run of  copies
it was extremely hard to find a copy
those who did find it were treated to one of the most enjoyable and unique rpgs ever made
after pds was released members team andromeda declared that the panzer dragoon trilogy was complete and they disbanded
they went on to work on other projects
one of them was omega boost a d shooter for the playstation that plays almost identically to panzer dragoon
edit since writing this review ive been told that no one from team andromeda worked on omega boost and now a playstation  game called rez is on the near horizon
supposedly there are no less than seven former ta members on the rez staff and would you believe it it too looks to play much like the panzer dragoon shooters
finally oddly enough a fourth panzer dragoon is on the way to the xbox
i would have loved another rpg in the series but apparently this too will be another shooter
oh well good enoughi didnt expect to ramble on this long
if there is anyone out reading this who owns a saturn but doesnt own the games in the pd series do yourself a big favor and get them
all of them
theyre well worth it
but get this one firsti remember playing the demo for this when i first got my sega saturn at  it was amazing
the music was also spectacular i could listen to it by popping the disc into my cd player even in  it still works
i finally played the full game much later
its challenging but the visuals are magnificent
this isnt just nostalgia talking this is a great imaginative gamepanzer dragoon was one of the best if not the bestest rail shooters till this day
i still play it on my original saturn
the graphics might be outdated for todays gen systems but the gameplay is still at its best
the music score on these games were epic all of the boss battles and encouters were memorable
if you can get this game i would
it is a gem indeed
panzer dragoon zewi was the prequel i believe but came out after the original
that game is a gem also
and i think everyone knows how good of an rpg panzer dragoon saga was so no need to give the breakdown on that
if i had any negatives on panzer dragoon and panzer dragoon zewi was only the few hours of gameplay
but till this day it feels the fun never left it actually feels like i played the game for the first time every timethis was a launch title in the early s for the sega saturn and it still holds the test of time
a d rail shooter with a great sound track
you have to play this game through an entertainment center to get the full scope of this gamethere have been so many onrails shooters and offrails shooters since the original panzer dragoon that sometimes it seems like a forgotten relic ironic given the setting of the game
but like those ancient weapons of panzer dragoon lore the original is one powerful old piece of technologyi remember when the saturn came out
i was a kid and i had no money
but boy did i want one
and the game i wanted was panzer dragoon
a d shooterwhere you ride on the back of a flying dragon
if that doesnt get your imagination going nothing willat any rate on a trip to disney world i stood there and played panzer dragoon for i dont know how long through the fourth level i think while my family enjoyed all the other exhibits at inoventions
i could have sat there all day transfixedmany years later i was finally able to play the panzer dragoon games on a saturn of my own
for many years panzer dragoon ii zwei was my favorite game of all time
and yesi owned and beat panzer dragoon sagasince this game came out ive played star fox  rez child of eden and sky gunner
ive played panzer dragoon orta
and ive cried silent tears that crimson dragon was released for xbox one instead of for a currentgen system
buti will always remember the original panzer dragoon
it has outdated graphics a beautiful orchestral score and its hard
but thats the stuff that nostalgia is made of
ill probably be playing panzer dragoon games until the day i die clutching them in my cold dead handsfirst of all i heard the pointless review from the irate gamer avgn copycat on you tube and i thought he was just plain pathetic at trolling this game with his boring humornow for my review
the game has great levels fun platforms and for collecting diamonds are more fun and challenging to do i never could collect em all
my most favorite levels are the cave of wonders and inside the genies lamp and the music was excellent for every level but my slightest complaint was beating jafar at the end was such a piece of cake it wasnt even challengingoverall great game and i give it a  star ratingone of the better licensed disney games ever made
great music good controls and fun gameplay this is a game you will want to replay over and over again
one of the better selling super nintendo games for good reason and with a price at around  dollars its well worth the purchasei have had this game ever since i was in high school
it is a nice game
it is not too difficult and the graphics are pretty good for snes games
i give this game a  star rating for fun and a  star rating overalli played this alot when it came out was really glad to have it again
its a really great gameit was a blast from the past from putting it into the snes to finishing the game it was way worth it was advertised as good but arrived in less than two days without the extra shipping and handling and the game itself came in the original packaging with the game booklet
very impressed with the buyi had this game for a long timethe music and graphics are still pretty goodthis game is for every onethe one for sega i think is more harder and this one is mediumthe game gives you livesbonusesand cheats as you go alongyou can throw apples and jump on the bad guyswith the help of jenieabu the monkeythe flying carpetand the pretty princess jasmine beat jafar in maybe it is childhood memories but i enjoyed this game when i was a kid and i still do
the game is somewhat repetitive and robin looks retarded but the gameplay and amount of different weapons at your disposal is rare for a batman game back in this days
this is a solid game and deserves a  star ratingthis game is amazing i loved playing this back in the snes days
this was an extremely fun game playing with  people
in this game you have  characters to choose from  being battletoads and the other being double dragon
this game has a pretty good soundtrack in my opinion especially the first levels theme song
you have pretty average fights in this game punches kicks super punches which make your hands grow big if you punch while running towards the enemy
this is an excellent game the best on the super nintendo platform
one of the funnest things in this game could have been riding on those cars that was very entertaining
so the answer to the question is battletoads amp double dragon is one of the funnest super nintendo gamesthis is an amazing game
it was awesome to relive my childhood memories
this game is in excellent condition
thank youtook me forever to find this game in good condition and it immediately brought back childhood memories the first time i put it in the console
i forgot how hard this game was i never beat it as a  year old and i still cant beat it as a  year old
grab a friend and coop till ya drop
thanksgreat game but hard as hell
use a save state or cheats to beat it but still play the game its awesomeif you loved donkey kong country  or  or both
then you will definately love this addition to the beloved snes franchise
it takes what the first two have done and runs with it to make a spectacular third installment to the revered trilogy for snes
you play as dixie kong and kiddy kong
we have been introduced to dixie kong in the second installment but now we have kiddy kong
rest assured what this toddler lacks in age he makes up for in sheer strength and size
think of him as a toddler version of donkey kong
it ends the snes trilogy in a very good way
it is definately a fun and addicting addition to the beloved franchise
i highly recommend it i love this game
it is definitely a classic
i highly recommend picking this up after completion of the first two in the seriesthe donkey kong series was a very big part of my childhood
i was obsessed with trying to beat all the levels find all the bonus barrels and beat all the lost world levelsand donkey kong country  is no exception
its hard to pick a favorite of the  but i think it would be this one
you play as dixie kong and the very strong toddler kiddie kong bc donkey and diddy have been kidnapped
you start out swimming around a lake to find wrinklys save spot and the general store which you can buy special items from
also theres funkys place and now he has a motor boat for you and as you find special items he can make you better forms of transportation including a hovercraft and a jet ski
unlike the other games you can now travel in a non linear pattern for the most partsometimes you can choose which world you would like to complete first
the levels are fun and challenging and each one has  bonus levels and a hero coin to collectwhich consists of a croc with armor and a shield which is the hero coin and you are given a barrel and have to find a way to make him guard the other way so you can throw the barrel and knock him out thus collecting the hero coin this is sometimes hard to do which adds to the fun
there are bear coins to collect throughout the level and sometimes you have to search all over the level as they may be well hidden
you can spend the bear coins at the general store or and the mini game spot called swankys sideshow
i remember this was the most fun part for me when i was a kid bc its like visiting a carnival and you play a little game where you have to throw balls at croc targets and you play against cranky
if you win you win tons of bananas and bear coinsso much fun
this game takes a while to complete and can get frustrating at timesbut is a great pick for anyone who has a super nintendo
if you like mario and the other donkey kong gamesthen give this one a try youll like itthis game is so old i have played this game when i was a kid
i lost it at my grandmas house a few years ago and we have always wanted to play with it again
i am a adult and i love this game
its a classicall i have to say about this is get this gamenow its up to dixie kong to save the kongs and taging along is her baby brother
well you would think alot of bad stuff but having him around actually helps he makes up in strenght but not speed
i think he is a pretty good character
this was just as good as the first two and the animal friends are pretty sweet
and if you really want to beat the game you have to collect all of the bananna birds
this game still rocksif you liked this game check out dkc dkc  and the dkc    version of the games for gbadkc was released in  near the end of the sness life
it has been regarded as the worst of the three but in my opinion its just as unique as dkcgraphics  this is probably the bestlooking one as the graphics look spectacular for an snes game with crystal clear almost d like sprites and pretty backgroundsmusic the music is another high point as in all dkc games
a lot of catchy tracks in this onestory not that original but when was a dk story original
basically dk and diddy get kidnapped and its up to dixie and her little cousin kiddie to rescue them while uncovering the mystery of kaos a robot who is leading the kremlingsgameplay it is similar to the others but there are also a lot of innovations
you get to the areas by boat and when you beat the bosses you usually get parts for a better boat which allows you to explore the world further
in all the areas including places around the world you encounter bears in homes that can help you if you help them usually
they mostly can be helped by giving them items you acquire
also around the game
also hidden in the areas and the world are caves where you play a minigame where you have to repeat a pattern with your buttons
they get more complicated as they go along
the reward for winning the game is a banana bird which stays at wrinklys
what do they do
youll find outheres a further breakdown of the gameplaylevels the levels in the game are some of the most innovative in the game with much variety
for example one level  you are swimming in poisonous water that reverses your dpad
in another level you have to kill all the mice running on wheels
this doesnt make the game superior but you have to admit that it has original levels
and the bosses are original as wellanimal buddies besides riding them you can also get into barrels that allow you to transform into one until you run into a noanimals sign
many levels require you have to transform into them
they got rid of rambi and rattly and replaced them with three new ones
one is elly a small elephant who is similar to rambi
many people dont like him but i think hes a good new addition
he can suck water up and shoot it out as well as suck up barrels and throw them
the other is a different colored squawks that cannot shoot eggs but he can grab barrels with his talons and drop them on enemies
the last one is some kind of small bird who follows you from above
he cannot fight and he dies if he touches an enemy but if you managed to get him to the no animals sign you get a good prizebonus coins bonus rooms make a return as well as the coins
like the previous game they are used to unlock levels in the lost worlddk coins now they are carried by an armored enemy called coin
he doesnt attack but he tries his best to protect his naked back
to kill him you have to find a way to throw a steel barrel and hit him in the back
this time dk coins actually have a use as wellswankys  in  swanky hosted a quiz show but this time he hosts a carnival game that involves throwing balls at targets
you compete against cranky for bananas and silver coins which are used at the general storetag team in  you could throw your partner up or at enemies and you can do it here as well
but this time its slightly different as while kiddy can throw dixie high dixie can barely throw kiddie up in the air but he can break cracked floorsoverall this is a great platformer for the snes and it kind of makes you sad to know that there will be no fantastic dk games like these anymore since rare left for microsoft
pick it up or get it on an emulator or virtual console
the game is also a gba port but that version kind of sucks imoon a side note why is the cover for the original dkc shown for this game on amazonafter having great success with donkey kong country and dk nintendo decided to make dk for the super nintendo and make it even better than the previous two versions
nintendo had a very tough task to do in making this game even better but they diddonkey kong country  includes two new main characters dixie kong who was also in dk and kiddy kong to to replace donkey and diddy kong
it also includes graphics that are a lot better than many other snes games
there are also many new bonuses and great secret places you need to find to beat the gamethe object of dk is the same as dk and  you need to beat every level and world in the game
after each world there is a boss that is more challenging than the regular places in the world
but in dk you need to collect all of the bonus coins and dk coins as well as beat every level to beat the game which makes the game more fun and challenging
you also need to collect all of the banana birds
you need to find them in special areas in coves by playing a game similar to simon where different lights light up in different orders and you have to repeat it in the same orderdixie kong and kiddy kong have a lot of friends along the way
wrinkly the old monkey at the save cave is always complimenting you
funky kong is at funky rentals where he gives you cool new water equipment like motor boats waterskis jetskis etc
and a another great addition to the game is swankys sideshow a tent where you can play games headtohead against cranky kong to earn bananas and coins to earn extra lives and buy stuffif you are looking for a great adventure game or want to get the newest dk title donkey kong country  dixie kongs double trouble is the game to get for your super nintendoi love all the donkey kong games
i have played them all
im a hardcore gamer and have played all the playstation xbox gamecube sega  any other console there is
i have played hundreds of games
but the nes donkey kong series are my all time favorites
they are fun challenging and provide hours of game play for me
they all have so many hidden things to find in them
and each game introduces new player characters
i could go and on about the wonders of this game but i dont have the time because i have to get back to playing it myselfbuy this game you wont be sorrywowwhen rare was relevant
man i love this game to death
i always remember the christmas morning when i got this stayed up waaay too late playing really love it
but this game seems to get a lot of flack from the youtube gaming community
i see a lot of people calling it childish or weak compared to the first two
a big problem according to people are the main characters kiddy  dixie
they say oh kiddys too slow and looks too childish
first off kiddy controls exactly to dk in the first dkc
hes a heavy weight moves a bit slowerbut he can take out the larger enemies with a lot less effort
and dixie was in dkc we all seemed to love her there  and as far as the childish aspect goes the whole dkc series was always very youngin friendly
this isnt yoshis story n by any means
this game has a lot of challenge and only improves upon 
the controls and gameplay are basically the same only with added mechanics
my only complaint is the music on occasion isnt quite as memorablebut thats just my opinion
it still has great great original tunes
otherwise dkc holds the high standard
anyone who played  please
if you havent play dkc
and good luck completing this 
a very challenging featreally fun game i have it on my nintendo wii that i downloaded from the nintendo eshop but i wanted an actual copy for my snes and im happy that i actually bought a copy
this game is so fun and a little challenging and its great to play with friendsthis is a great game to end the donkey kong trilogy on the snes
i am a bigger fan of the first two games but as a collector of nes and snes products this game is a must have
good condition works perfectly
aa fitting end to the donkey kong snes era
was never a huge fan of dixie or kiddie kong but this is a donkey kong country game so you know its going to be awesomedkc was the last installment of rarewares monkey series for the snes and was basically the game to get your child for christmas of  if you didnt plan on tracking down the thennewlyreleased nintendo overall dck is a solid platformer game
it suffers in reviews because it lacks the originality of the first and the huge gameplay leaps of the second but nothing about this title is remotely buggy or broken
lots of levels and environments to traverse and rare included some interesting scenarios this time around that mix up the normal run and jump gameplay reversed controls riding a rocket that needs constant refueling dodge lightning etc
there are memorable boss fights and an overworld filled with secrets that is explored through upgradable vehicles
theres even a family of bears scattered across the world that will help you if locate the right items for themgraphics are as sharp as the first two installments and the music has a catchy laid back tropical flavour also seen in the brighter design of the enemies
the only nitpicks are the lack of story rare poked fun at this in the first two games here they just dont try and the character selection
its odd that the series is called donkey kong country and donkey and diddy are reduced to mere cameos here
kiddy kong brings back the heavylight dynamic of the first game but overall dixie is still more useful and maneuverable
in the end though this is a wonderful platformer that holds up well by todays standards
if youve still got an snes its worth tracking down a copythe price is great and when i ordered this game i received it within four days which is pretty quick
the game works great with no problems however the game did arrived a little dirty but no biggy i cleaned it up and it looked like new
the game it self is around  years old and even though it was a little dirty the game still works like new
i recommend buying from coreys used games because he responds to the customers promptlyi love this game i first played this game when i bought my snes console this was the game included with the system
after having it stolen i didnt play it for about  years
i recently bought another snes console and this was the first game i picked up
its challenging and very addictive
a must for any snes ownerthis is one of the best rpgadventure i have ever played  a link to the past is long full of surprises the difficulty is medium  my favorite and after you play you always get some urge to play it again many many timesmany gamers will openly acknowledge that the zelda series is one of the longest running and most beloved video game series
when one think of nintendo one not only think of mario metroid donkey kong one thinks of zelda
if you love a great quest game this is the game for you
still as playable as it was back then and still deserving of all the hype it gets
there would be no oot if this game didnt bring the seminal series further
it is a major boost to the epic series and deserves the credit it is due
if you are craving a fantasy adventure quest game and still love the  bit look then this is what you are looking forthis game is in my opinion the best of the zelda series
the storyline and the gameplay are superb and the graphics are really good for the age of the gamezelda another great video game series
while the original zelda and zelda ii rank among the top nintendo classics the third installment in the longrunning series is not only a classic as well but the best in the series
i really liked links awakening for game boy and ocarina of time for the nintendo  but this is the best of links adventures
the music gameplay everything about it is topnotch
the level maps were also very unique and challenging
if you are new to the super nintendo get this game
i cant stress that enough for those of you who read egm zelda  was rated as one of the top  in the best  games listin june  two of my dads work friends took me out to dinner
we had little caesars pizza
that wasnt the only cool thing to happen that night
i also was allowed to pick out a present
nothing too expensive just a little something to keep me entertained
we walked to a video store that was ready to go out of business
they had some wwf wrestling videos back then it was called wwf not wwe like today and i was about to buy a video because the prices were cheap and i was a big wrestling fan at the time
but then i noticed a nearlyempty shelf to the left of the wrestling tapes where the legend of zelda link to the past was sittingit wasnt in the best condition
the cardboard box was in fine shape but the instruction booklet was all screwed up
looked like a dog went crazy on it
all the pages in the booklet were there the print was certainly readable i could turn the pages okay but certain pages were crinkled
in fact the front page of the instruction booklet was so crinkled it was as soft as toilet paper
the price of the game was reasonable and the game cartridge was in pretty good condition
so i asked my dads friends for the zelda game and they bought it for mebut i made a mistake
a few days later my cousin came to my house
i was thinking about hiding it because i knew my cousin was a big zelda fan and was extremely eager to play the one and only zelda game on the super nes
i wanted to play through the game and then let him borrow it
i thought about it for a few minutes but decided not to hide it
if i had done that i wouldve felt guilty about it after he walked out the door
hes my cousin and i love him and we get along great
so i just couldnt do itso i prepared myself for what was to come my cousin begging me quotplease please let me borrow it
pleeeeeeeeease
quot  i gave in and let him borrow it
he borrowed it for a couple weeks and beat the game before i hardly even had the chance to play it
but im glad he enjoyed it because his enthusiasm over the game got me more excited to play it when he returned itive since lost the game and dont know for sure what happened to it
i think i gave it away to a high school friend in   i figured im done with the game
i dont need to play it anymore
time to move on to other thingsstupid me and my big wrong mindi plan on buying it again because lately ive been having severe urges to play it
you know the urges are getting stronger when you begin dreaming about iteven though i had a lot of fun playing the legend of zelda link to the past in the mids and probably went through the quest at least  times i dont think i appreciated the game as much as i should have
i dont think i realized back in  that i was playing a classic nintendo game
i didnt realize zelda link to the past has a perfect balance of rpg action and adventure and not many games can successfully pull off such a daring idea
i should have known that if anybody could do it itd be nintendoits a very colorful game
i think the colors help make the graphics look better
i wouldnt say the graphics are bad though
i dont think nintendo could have improved on the graphics because this is an early s game after all and nintendo was in the beginning stages of finding out what the super nintendo could do
nintendo found out the super nes could do much more and go much further than originally expected when star fox and donkey kong country were createdi dont think zelda link to the past is a very challenging game except in certain places but it does have its fair share of tricky moments
i guarantee you will beat it eventually though and its much easier than the original legend of zelda on the nes
as for the music everything sounds very clear and ahead of its time
the music plays in all the appropriate places too
the dark places have quiet spooky music
the music in the lighter happier areas of the land give off an energetic and confident feeling making it feel like link is on top of the world and nothing can go wrong
expect to hear mellow themes which might bring you to tears
ill have a tissue box waiting for you in case it happens
supposedly the guy who created the music in this game is a master of coming up with incredibly fitting orchestral themes
and i believe that to be trueyou probably wont need any kind of strategy guide
i didnt need one except to look up information for a couple heart pieces i was having trouble finding even though its not necessary to find all the heart pieces
i also needed help reaching the third castle in the dark world which is necessary to completing the game
but thats it
and i didnt have the internet in the mids so i had to ask friends for helpnot many weapons and items are hidden in crazy locations except the flute maybe but its not that difficult to find
so you wont often be looking at your tv screen with a confused look on your face wondering where something is because most of the time you just have to walk around talking to people and experimenting with your weapons and items and eventually you will find what you need to progress further into the quest
so if you come across something unusual and dont know the purpose of it try some of your items on it to see if anything happensexcellent game in every way and hopefully when i buy it again ill be able to appreciate all the time and energy that went into making it
you can count on wasting many hours playing through this exciting adventurethis is my favorite zelda game of all time
i had it growing up from ages  to about  which then i sold my snes and games i hated that stupid mistake
now i am starting to build up a small collection of retro games and this one is the icing on the topthe gba version was cool with all the neat little features that were added but i just didnt enjoy it as much as the classic zelda on snes
as they say classics never die which i stand by in everything cars song video games ectbought used for only  in very good condition i am very pleasedi use it in my rertobit duo and the picture is very nicetheres just this certain feeling you get when you play your favorite game in a franchise that makes you wanna cry tears of joyoverall im very very happy to have this game againzelda fans are the most dedicated when it comes to one of nintendos longest running series
who knew that back in  nintendo was about to release something so epic onto the gaming community
the legend of zelda a link to the past was a zelda classic that graced the snes years ago
it was and still is revered as one of the best snes games and one of the strongest entries in the zelda seriesmany reviewers have already broke down the gist of the game so i will simply add my two cents to my review of it
this game brought back the gameplay mechanics of the first nes title and expands on it in every way imaginable
top it off with the graphics and sounds capable of what the snes can put out and an even bigger quest than the previous two games before it and you got a classic that you wont be able to put down
everything about the game is perfect the overall presentation the top down perspective that showed every graphical detail of the overworld and dungeons spot on controls that had you control link on his quest to save princess zelda memorable music tracks incredible sound effects all wrapped up in a quest that will take days to complete and even longer if you find all of the games secrets
in case you missed out on this great game shame on you then you can either pick up a used copy of your snes still works pick up a copy released for the game boy advance or download this title for the wii via their virtual console service for  points  us its well worth playing and well worth seeing why this game continues to receive high praise so dont miss outi was reading a pretty funny trolling star review of this game and i thought id share my thoughtsif youre reading this chances are youre probably full aware of what kind of amazing experience a link to the past is
its difficult to separate nostalgia from objective features that make the game so gosh darn great but remember that the nostalgia exists precisely because it is that greatgraphicsthere are games on the snes that utilize better technology such as prerendered models killer instinct donkey kong country but the old bit era was one of artistry without realism
hires graphics didnt matter as much because most games were interactive cartoons
a link to the past is precisely that and i dont think that it could be much improved in the graphic department
the gba port is exactly the same in graphical style as well it should becontrolsin contrast to the original legend of zelda a link to the past allows you to move in eight directions
zelda players who have enjoyed ocarina of time or majoras mask might wish for the ability to use more than one item at a time but youre unfortunately limited to one here
alttps collision detection is greatmusickoji kondo has produced many little melodies for nintendo over the years most notably the mario theme and of course the zelda theme
in a link to the past were treated to a number of different ballads all of which are of remarkably high quality
theres the mysterious melody that plays in the lost woods which corresponds perfectly with the visuals and ongoing storyline
when link works toward his final assault on the games antagonist were treated to a truly epic sounding march theme which is again perfect for the scenario
the melodies sound good on their own but what makes them great is that they all correspond so well to game eventsgameplaya link to the past is challenging but not hard
when facing enemies there are a number of different ways to dispose of them
but most of them from mindcontrolled hylian knights to final bosses have a vulnerability which can be exploited to make your gaming session a little easierunlike the original legend of zelda there is a prescribed order to proceed through the dungeons
however this order is at points more of a suggestion
often enough theres nothing stopping you from going ahead to later dungeons if you cant best the final boss
the first time i played through this i remember jumping ahead and beating the last dungeon to see if i could skip all those enemies that i couldnt beat
hehe you still have to clear every level even if you do thatsuffice it to say that a link to the past had the right mix of storyline development and player freedom a feat id consider unmatched by any later entry into this franchiselasting appealseeing as ive played through it far more times than id care to admit its safe to say theres some lasting appeal in this game
the fact that the enemies can be killed in so many different ways allows you to try out different strategies each time you proceed through the gamepretty much every game is touted as the best game ever made but few games have been hailed as such as consistently as a link to the past
theres a reason for that and i think its more than mere nostalgiai loved the first zelda game
link to the past is even better and longer
there is so many areas and cool bosses that you can fight
the sword is still very cool like always
and i think that the map is even more heplful then the first zelda and even the second zelda game
you will be satisfied with this incredible gamethis game was released in the early s a time in which video game makers still focused more on fun gameplay rather than graphics and sound
these days it seems more and more video game makers just want bragging rights for the best graphics and sound therefore abandoning the most important aspect of the game rushing out games that are clearly not finished and very little regard to actual gameplaywith that being said at the time zeldalink to the past had very good graphics and sound to boot
but what kept me playing this game over and over again was the fun gameplay
i originally got this game when i got a replacement snes and this game was bundled with it
it took me over a year to play it because i thought to myself there is no way it could be better than the original zelda on the nes
one day i decided to pop this game in and realized that i was wrong
this was the most fun game i had ever played on the snes even better than super metroid in many aspects
it was very easy to pick up and play and easy to learn
once i started playing i just could not stop
it took all the aspects i loved from the original zelda on the nes and multiplied themthis game was very succesful in capturing the nostagalistic feel of the original game while at the same time allowing me to enjoy a brand new one
absolutely fantasticyou still have to search for heart pieces weapons upgrades etc but this game like the original makes it fun rather than tedious and boring
i got a real sense of accomplishment when i found a new item and a even greater feeling when i finally beat the game
this game was fun from start to finish and was never once bored when i stopped playing this game after a long sitting it was because i physically couldnt continue not because i was bored or tired of playing the game
in fact if i picked this game up today i know that i will still enjoy it as much as i did back thenits too bad that these days i am finding myself rushing through a game just to finish it because other than the great graphics the gameplay is subpar and it gets boring after a while
rushing through a game causes one not to really appreciate the game and it tells me that the gameplay is lacking and the developers did not do enough to keep the player involvedhonestly if i had to choose between a game with superior gameplay and ok graphics or a game with superior graphics and ok gameplay i would choose the gameplay over the graphics everytime
while you get your occasional blockbuster on todays systems for the most part the games are just all fluff and no substancethis is by far the best adventurebased video game of all time
sure the graphics arent dimensional but the game was released for super nintendo twelve years ago
what do you expect
the plot is as follows dont worry i wont spoil everythingprincess zelda is trapped somewhere in a deep dungeon and talks to a young boy named link through his dreams
she is asking him for helpbut where is she
links uncle rushes out into the stormy night and to hyrule castle and link secretly follows but only to find his uncle lying on the ground in the castle
this is only the beginning of the adventurein this game theres action adventure and awesome revelations
collect cool equipment such as the legendary master sword meet new friends and enemies along the wayand even find a sinister parallel worldplease dont miss out on this gamethis was the second zelda game i have played with the first being ocarina of time
that being said this game is the best one on thecritically acclaimed super nintendo entertainment system or snes
this game introduced some staples in the series such as the master sworda hammer the hookshot teleportation zoras and a few others
one of the strong points of this game is that it is easy to pick up for most beginninggamers and there are plenty of environmental varieties such as an ice lake a desert forest and a steppe
aside from the controlsbeing simple to master and those important staples introduced getting around is not very difficult at all and the dungeon locationsare pinpointed for your convenience and the dungeons are balanced in difficulty though the difficulty increases quite a bit later ononce the player receives the master sword it does not stop there
one can actually upgrade the sword two times and it is stronglyrecommended that you do because the game increases in difficulty and it will be necessary to have the upgrades in hand for thegame to be bearable later on
the two upgrades are the tempered and golden swords and the golden sword is necessary to be able todefeat the final boss somewhat easilyoverall this is not only the best snes game to be released but it is the second greatest zelda game toever be released only ocarina of time besting this one
i highly recommend this game for snes and the game boy advanceas this will change your perspective on gaming forever in the most positive of waysthis game was so much fun to play when it first came out that i probably spent close to two years trying to figure everything
my brother probably spent about the same amount of time as well and figured even more stuff
the most challenging thing about this game was getting all of the container hearts
i will never forget the countless hours spent looking for those things
lots of fun
anyone who doesnt give this game  stars doesnt know a d thing about video games perioda link to the past is my first zelda game also my top favorite zelda game
a link to the past had the best graphics i ever seen and the best dungeons i ever played
the creators stay true to their fans button smashing and directional smashing like the first and second zelda games but the future games of zelda will change to a crappy stylus touch
a link to the past had many video game awards including  top  video games of all time
a link to the past is better than phantom hourglass and spirit tracks
if you prefer old school controls than stylus touch this is the one to buymy first experience with zelda began when i saw my uncle playing it in  on my grandmas television
i didnt bother playing as i was too intimidated as a  year old at the time
i tried it but there were no cracks in the walls to let you know where to bomb and finding some of the levels proved too difficult at the time
i have since beaten it plus the master quest
then i bought zelda  as a kid
some say its the black sheep but its my second favorite zelda game
i beat that game on my own after getting stuck a few times
anyone remember finding error in the woods for the letter to move onwhich brings me to this game
i borrowed it from a richer friend when it first came out and i was just getting out of elementary school
the music was ground breaking the graphics were d at its best and still holds up pretty well to me
the puzzles were tricky but i eventually did solve most of them
i couldnt put this game down till i was done
the level of difficulty was just right
take that ocarina of time a game where i constantly got stuck and thought it was really difficult to get through without help of some sort
people still praise it as the great game ever but i dunno about that onemaybe this game brings out my old school d love but i prefer this one to any d zelda game and it is a diffinite upgrade to zelda  must playthis game is excellent any way you put it
i remember playing it for the first time about  or  years ago yeah that is a very long time and i thought it was just the greatest thing ever
the graphics were supurb and even to this day they look beautiful
though they dont stand up to ps graphicsit really doesnt matter with these oldskool games
im not a graphics kind of guy and never was so it doesnt affect me but if you are really into high tech graphics and havent played this i doubt you will like it
dont get me wrong some games with more high tech graphics are good but this game along with many others on snes proove that graphics dont make any game
but then again i dont play or own a playstation  so thats just how i see it
my views on videogames are rather conservative
if you are still under  and havent played this game i doubt you will like it though as it doesnt appeal to younger payers any more due to its old school design that kids tend not to appreciate these days
but that doesnt mean kids wont like it
i just think people who have played it in the early s are mainly the ones who will enjoy it nowdays unless youre a zelda fanatic but havent played this one yet or if you like older games but havent gotten around to getting this one yet
the music on this game is also very good although the dungeon music can get very tedius and annoying its not that bad
the world music is classic though and after you play it enough it will be ringing in your ears
gameplay also doesnt get much better you get a whole arsenal of items
much more than any other zelda yet
this game is basically the game that set the standards for all other adventure games sometimes even rpgs
another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way too time consuming if you have a life to attend to you can do so while keeping up with the game as well
even though i like really long games this game is short in a good way
but the first time you play it  it will probably take more than  hours to beat at least
if you get all the heart containers it will take even more
there isnt a lot of text in this game either theres talking sequences but they usually end pretty quickall in all this game is classic and if you havent played itthats your mistake
playing this game and hearing its music after years really brings back those great childhood memories
even to this day this game looks better to me than most new games
it just has that aura
i highly recommend this to any one into adventure games or rpgs that has a taste for the classics or anyone who likes snes or nes gamesthis is just an incredible game
theres no way to put it
just brilliantyes the graphics are bit
but they hold up so well
oot looks dated and is almost nonplayable amongst the newer standards of the next gen d graphics the draw distances are terrible
but lttp was and is at the fore front of sprite based games and is a hoot not only for nostaglia but also something i will offer to future generations of gamers as a true classic
what great story and twists and fun gameplay
like a favorite moview that you cherish and want to relive i take my time to enjoy each aspect and have never raced to get through
a rarity in gaminglink to the past will go down as a classic nintendo game
if there was a video game hall of fame i think any of the zelda games would be in it but link to the past would definately be in firstlp link to the past seriously had everything going for it from good graphics and effects to twist and turn gameplay and story lines to outstanding replay
this was another game that i didnt get tired of because it was that fun to playit played similar to the original zelda with an overhead view of your surroundings and at each end of the world there was something different including an alternate world when you used the mirrorthere were levels that accommodated every gamers ideal level
enemies to fight bonus items to pick up almost eerie at times scenery and definately some of the best adventure type gameplay everi still have my original copy of this game so im safe but for those of you who dont have link to the past you have to get it
there is no excuse if youre a nintendo fan
if you claim you are a true nintendo fan and you dont have this one theres something wrong with you
get this gamegreat game i owned it once now buying back retro games for my kids to enjoy
brings back lots of fun memories
favorite zeldawhen i think of zelda i think of this game one that is more polished than the nes zelda games and more traditional than the newer onesafter the sidescrolling oddity that was zelda ii back on the nes it was nice to see zelda go back to its topdown roots
the graphics even now are very good
minimalist shapes and soft colors get the job done and create a very dark atmosphere in the world as if the sun is constantly behind cloudsdespite the presence of elves fairies and princesses in this game the soundtrack does a good job of letting the player know that these are dark times not a time of festivities and celebration
the dungeon themes in particular are very mysterious foreboding and gloomy link
step away from the edge
dont do it
after playing a great many rpgs where one usually has to grind to build levels to grow stronger a game like this that focuses on realtime action is a nice change of pace
even more so because it is done so well
unlike many rpgs i found that the items and powerups are actually rather practical things you would actually use regularly like the bombos spellthe storyline is simple and straightforward not world fantasy awardwinning material by any stretch of the imagination
this simplicity is a good thing though as it makes the game more accessible to those who just want to run around with a sword instead of reading page after page of textthe gameplay is very faithful to the original 
and at times very hard
fortunately there are a number of special items you can collect to make your quest easierif i had to pick a handful of games to represent the snes or just great games in general i would heartily recommend this onethis is the classic zelda game the one that enshrined the franchise in video game history
this game is still fun after almost  years  and its now available on wii
great music beautiful worlds fun and challenging levels
unique amongst video games at the time or even today it has a rich plot including a dramatic opening level
the switch between the light and dark worlds works great
at some points the game gets ridiculously difficult but usually it is pretty manageable
just make sure to buy enough potions to increase your healthagain another great gamesame deal with this one i can play it over and over again and never get sick of itwhat can i say
its zelda for the snes
good times
never beat it as a kid
gannon here i comethis game brings back a lot of memories for me
how i got it was actually an accident i wanted my mother to buy me a nintendo  game but i didnt have a nintendo  and she thought i meant that i wanted it for my super nintendo and ended up buying me this instead
it was one of the best accidents ever
the legend of zelda a link to the past has an engaging storyline that wraps you up instantly
its easy to learn as you get somewhat of a tutorial at the start and becomes fun to play
you basically beat monsters for more heart containers which increases your health and in order to rescue princess zelda
along the way you get neatest tools a hammer for smashing things flippers for swimming and even a mirror for traveling between two versions of the same world
cool puzzles between fights even the boss temple puzzles keep the game from being tedious and boring
youll also come across fairies that will upgrade your stuff and heal you
this game is basically amazing
if you dont already have it in your collection get itthis game is one of the best videogames i have ever played on any console and i have played games on almost evey console made to date
this is a classic game and should be played by everyone who loves games
this is one that proves you do not need fancy d graphics to have a truly great gamei dont think i can top anyone elses review here they all say it like it is this is a great game and playing it is a great way to spend your time
probably the best game ever made for super nintendo
if you are looking for a game that you will not get bored with on super nintendo this is iti didnt really get hooked on this game as much as other zelda games like ocarina of time and majoras mask
it is a fun and challanging game nonethelessbest rpg ever made for snes
if you love zelda you will love this game
if you love rpgs you will love this game
if you do not like ether you will still love this gamenice game trying to play it but my nintendo will not go on but as soon as i get it i will be playing thanksseriously if you havent played this game on snes you are missing out
i dont believe its better than ocarina of time which some of my friends think but its up there
of all the great snes titles this one is probably my favoriteseriously though you know im not lying
i recently re played this game i havent played it since it was new and it does hold up to the test of timethis game is an oldie but goodie
graphics suck compare to todays games but its very awesome to have and play
one of my favoritesthe only zelda i prefer to this one is the ocarina of timeand thats a very high video game standard
its unique to the other zelda games in the series but yet still very true to form somehowif youve got a wii download this gamemove over wind waker  ocarina ok not that good but i regret selling this for  a year ago i recently downloaded it on my wiiu and connected a snes style controller to it and im still playing it after  monthsits very intuitive and  definitely gives you bang for your buck
the quest is like in the nes version but with mode  and orchestra musicjust shows you how devoted to its fans the snes was commited tothis is one of my all time favorites
next to super metroid all grand theft auto and super ghouls and ghoststhis is the best game ever
my only complaints is that it ends to soon
every year i bust this game and and beat it
if you dont like zeldathen youre either some kind of tribal person that has no access to electricitywhich is cool
or a lame republican that despises epic themes in anything other than making mass amounts of revinuewhich is suckylike a lot of the older zelda fans i grew up playing the original zelda on the nes and loved itironically i never got around to buying and owning a super nintendo as well as this classic game a link to the past until i was  years oldit took me a while to get to where i am nowganons tower in the game but with a lot of patience a printed out walkthrough and a lot of addictive gaming i got close to beating it and am still playing it until i doi know this will be one of those games worth playing again and again no matter how many times i beat itwhat makes this the best of the d zelda games you may askit expands on the story telling and gameplay has more levelsside quests and dungeongs and most of all is just a plain fun game to play
while it took me about a month to beat the original legend of zelda game this one like ocarina of time kept me busy for several months just to reach the final boss
a lot of the gameplay mechanics level designs and boss fights set a standard that influenced other games that came after it such as ocarina for n and twilight princess for the gamecubewiithis game is long but easy enough for the average yet dedicated gamer as well being challenging and deep for  the pros such as the ones at nintendo power who love itlegend of zelda a link to the past released in  big hit for the snes  around this time  was when the super nintendo  sega genesis were neck  neck  while the sega genesis had great beat em ups arcade games shooters  fighting games
if you wanted rpgs adventure games puzzles solving platformers you went for the super nintendo
legend of zelda a link to the past is in my opinion is the best of any zelda game i know some will say oh what about ocorina of time ocorina of time is awesome i love that game i played it a lot when it came out  i still do play these games here  there
there all awesome i do think of some  zelda games as there own game others are sequels like  adventure of link was a sequel to the st zelda or majorias mask is a sequel to ocorina of time
ltp is its  own game like ocorina of time is its own game
most games for me dont need a storyline
zelda on the other hand needs a story
the story is zelda contacts link telepathically links uncle heads out to you follow him  find him wounded its all up to you
you find zelda  you take her to some preist then you go out to find  pendants to get the master sword
theres the eastern palace the desert palace  then then the palace in the mountains
you need the master sword to kill agahnim who works for the main villain gannon agahnim us taking these maidens into the dark world so gannon can unlock the triforce also in the graphic novel agahnim does more than gannons bidding he actually r  p  s them
the st  dungones you should get through with no problem the mountain dungon is a little more tricky  the boss when he knocks you over to the side  you have to go back  fight him again god is that frustrating
when you do get the master sword zelda contacts you telepathically shes been kidnapped by agahnim so you try to save her but its to late he trransports her to the dark world where you have save the  maidens the st  dungens souldnt be a problem but when you get to the rd  th where you got to use your head
playing it again some of it was by memory some was help from a walktrough  some was help via playthrough videos
the palace in the dark woods those hand things that grab you  take you back to the beginning i hate those things
i forgot that you had to open a hole in the th dungon so the light would be in the room
i feel it is a smart game a well done game
cause you have to to look for weapons magical weapons that get you from point a to point b the th dungon the ice palace is no different you will have a lot of puzzle solving  it can be frustrating but it never gets boring
when you do get to turtle rock this dungon will get on your nerves but if you keep on trying you will beat it
you better keep magic potions handy too
when you do get past turtle rock you save zelda  she tells the task is at hand
she shouldve said beat the s hi  t out of him
gannons palace isnt as hard as turtle rock but it is still tricky
you fight all  bosses from the light world again then agahnim he has these  clones of him but its easy to spot the real  after you defeat him you fight gannon  of course what else he wants to take over the world
when gannon does his little diappering act  when he knocks you over to the side oh that makes me mad
so be careful dont get knocked over the side
when you defeat him you get a big ending satisfying ending
if you dont have this in your snes collection you should get it
if you have a wii you can download it i think i dont know i dont own a wii
there was a collection of the zelda games on the gamecube  if you have a snes emulator get it
i doubt most of these kids could have the patience to playthrough zelda on the nes or zelda ltpok i am continuing my reviews for the zelda games i own cause i dont own every zelda game
this zelda game is without a doubt favorite legend of zelda a link to the past which for any of those who dont know was suppose to be called zelda iii the triforce saga
but since the nes was near the end of its life span nintendo decided to go for the snes
if any game deserves the title of zelda iii cause i think of the st  zelda games on the nes  a link to the past as a triforce saga
now after zelda ii wasnt what everybody wanted even though i didnt mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view  drop the rpg elements go back to using rupees  weapons instead of using all magic attacks
if i could give this game all the stars in the world i would if i am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy
i played this game a lot along with mario all stars  street fighter ii turbo back in the day
even now hearing about all the glitches  preforming them this game is feels fresh  this game is  years old
this game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in ocarina of time  big time in majoras mask as well for twilight princess
this game started the dark tone in a zelda games
you have this character aghnim he not only collects the money from the king for helping him he then kills the king  takes these maidens that are ancestors to the wise men he seals them into the dark world
the dark world is the land where the triforce is at people who go to the dark world dont come back  they change shape
its a twisted version of hyrule
link is framed by aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from death mountain
you have this kid who plays the flute who is dead
the next reviews i do for the zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in japan in   a few months later in the spring of  the name of this game in japan is the legend of zelda the triforce of the gods
the story is ganon tries to get his hands on the triforce he enters the golden land the king has  wise men put a seal on the enterance to the golden land which it seems that hes been sealed there forever
hundreds of years later a drought a famine  illnesses have spread through hyrule the king thought it had something to do with the golden land but the seal was intact a wizard or a satanic priest however you want to look at i prefer what aghnim was in the japanese version
aghnim shows up  ends the problems with hyrule the king was looking for decendents of the  wise men aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in the kingdom aghnims intentions came clear he murdered the king of hyrule put a mind control spell on the guards had the maidens rounded up  sent them to the dark world which this is all told in the opening  it really showed off the power of the snes plus that music by koji kondo is great which alttp is my favorite zelda score ocarina of time is nd the opening music where it shows aghnim sending the madiens to the dark world scared me as a kid
princess zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message  of the people who get it is link  this is not the same link from the st  games  this is not the zelda you save from the st game or the sleeping zelda from part ii
links uncle decides hes going to see what that aghnim guy is up to he tells link not to leave the house
well he does anyway you head for the castle  find a secret passageway where you find your uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword  shield he never finishe his sentence  there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says princess zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your sister
link might have a connection to the royal family cause in the novel his father was a knight but zelda being his sister i doubt it
so the st thing you have to do is save zelda  get her to this church so she can be hid
you have to find  pendants that will allow you to get the master sword this game introduces the master sword
youll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it the light world dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kidalso aghnim has framed you for kidnapping princess zelda when you get the master sword guards have taken zelda killed the priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you werent allowed to enter before cause the master sword can break the seal
aghnim makes you watch as he sends zelda to the dark world
when you face aghnim you cant fight him head on you have to play dead mans volley as its called
when hes beat aghnim draws you into the dark world  if you have the moon peral from the tower of hera then you wont change shape into a bunny
going back can be a hassle
this man you meet before the st light world dungeon sahasrahla contacts you telepathically  that you have to free all the maidens  zelda  that is the only way defeating aghnim  ganon
the dark world has no humans everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents whats in their mind  heart
it might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield  you can upgrade the master sword when you save this blacksmith who is trapped in the dark world
you can get a powerful golden sword near the end
the boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupees to summon a great fairy
i like how you can increase the number of arrows  bombs you can carry
the silver arrows return too mainly to defeat ganon
other items you need is like from the desert temple the power glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks
in the th dark world dungeon you get the titans mitt that lets you pick up even heavier rocks  stones
i mentioned you must get the moon peral from the tower of hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in the dark world
another must have item to even get to the nd temple is the pegasus boots that sahasrahla
that lets you move faster  you have to use them to knock the book of madora off a book shelf in kakariko village which that book is the only way you can enter the desert temple
the  medallions you get are very handy
the items you get in the dark world such as the hammer in the st dark world dungeon the hookshot in the nd dark world dungeon
the fire rod in the forest temple in the dark world
the titans mitt mentioned about already in the th dark world dungeon
then in the th dark world dungeon you get the blue mail that reduces the amount of damage you take
the th dark world dungeon contains the cane of somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in turtle rock
also in turtle rock you get the mirror shield
in ganons tower you obtain the red mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more
basically you need all the items to complete the game such as the ice rod zora flippers the magic cape cane byrna
there are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the  where you get the flute there is this old man  his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to link  anytime you approach him he disappears its cause hes dead
in the dark world you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is flute boy cause he went to the dark world  was killed
with this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place  this lost old man in the caves leading to death mountain  he gives you the mirror that can take you back to the light world
this game is  of the st times i believe that nintendo allowed death in their games
so the game started a dark tone in zelda games
i mentioned the glitches  how they made this game feels fresh i tried them out there kind of funny like you can face aghnim while you have zelda with you  aghnim is sending zelda to the dark world its like you got zelda out of her cell so who is ganon sending to the dark world
plus you know its night time when you start the game  its raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like  minutes then in the ending its night time  its still raining
my favorite glitch is where you have the mirror  the moon peral ok  you can keep going back  forth from the light world to the dark world near the broken bridge  you can explore the dark world before you even face aghnim the st time
just make sure you have the mirror the moon peral  the master sword
stuff you have to figure out like how to get the big key or the item in each dungeon is great
the bosses were all good the ball  chain trooper who is in the castle
to the armos knights which a lot of fun
the boss of the desert temple twinmola its a good pattern type boss
the tower of hera moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again
the st aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock its attacks back at him
the dark world dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as arrghus mothela the blind thief  trinexx
the st dark world dungeon boss isnt too hard helmasaur king you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face  fire arrows at the middle of its head
in the nd dark world dungeon you battle arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use the hookshot to pull the eyes away  slash away with the master sword until you have to fight the giant eye
mothula in the rd dark world dungeon while difficult all you need is the fire rod to beat it
the blind thief is hard cause it has  or  heads attacking you
in the th dark world dungeon you face kholdstare which is kind of a pain
you also have to have the bird to get to the th dark world dungeon  the boss is vitreous who is sort of like arrghus but not as hard
to get into turtle rock you have to have the quake medallion  to get through it you have to have the cane of somaria
this dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors  if  torch goes out then the door will close
the boss trinexx in its st phase where you use the fire  ice rods isnt hard when you fight in its nd phase then its more of a challenge  i recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for the dark world dungeon bosses
when you beat the  dark world dungeon youu free a maiden  finally princess zelda
which takes you to ganons tower where you fight the  light world dungeon bosses again  have the nd  final encounter with aghnim
which the nd battle with agahnim is a little bit harder
the final boss is ganon  ganon is the hardest of any zelda game cause it takes  silver arrows this time instead of   when stomps the floor the ends start to break off  if youre knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again
i think a link to the past ganon is harder than ganon in the nes original or ocarina of time
but when you beat ganon you are treated to a great ending
i know this has been a long read  i said my next reviews for the zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning
this game is amazing bottom line while love ocarina of time  enjoyed majoras mask  twilight princess this still remains my favorite zelda game
if you never played legend of zelda a ling to the past you should  play it any way you can cause you will miss out on  of the best games of the sthis a great game for you who likes to solve medium problems loves to talk with interesting creatures and beat evil lurks
this zelda was one of the first adventurerole games i played trough
it lasted a long time until i finally met ganon himself and i got the trio force back
i have many reasons to recommand this fantastic game
imagine yourself sleeping in your own house in rainy night suddenly you hear your uncles voice that wants you to come kings castle because some evil enemies are there
you wake up and dress your clothes
its time to find out what is going on
later you find your uncle who is just dying because a bad afgahnim strikes him deadly
he gives you his sword and hopes that you can beat the evil afgahnim
and this little story was only beginning
i think that zeldas storywriters have an unbelievable imagination
 music makes this game enjoyable and comfortable to play because it sounds so good
especially the melody of the castle boss has written so exciting that you really make fighting a fine situation
 game characters and creatures are made with good taste and personal way
you can meet zoras water human centauries pig soldiers witches crystal maidens talking woods and so on  problem solving is a major challenge
this is not game that last only few hours because there so many difficult problems to solve
use you brain and try to find answers without guidelines
dont get angry if you dont find to answer immediately
ask your roleplay friends to help because they will advice you
 items you collect are variable
bow hook shoot shovel bombs are very valuable to you if you want to survive all enemies castles and challenges
if you play this classic game youll know why this one of the best games in the world entertainment is guaranteedthis game is the secondbest zelda game after ocarina of time
this is the game that got me hooked
i was pretty young when i first got it and it is extremely challenging so i beat it over seven years playing on and off
the puzzles are very creative they sometimes take forever to figure out but when you do you want to kick yourself for not realizing it sooner
i still play this game every once in a blue moon just for the memories im a very reminiscent person  if you have a super nintendo and you still like it this was the best game for it so you should get itone of my favorite games as a child and still one of my favorites as a grown man
game will never get old
shipping was quick product looks good and plays wellthis is in my opinion the first zelda game that is actually a quality game by todays standards
it has a developed story uses actual dialogue and characterization has vastly improved graphics better game play and it has a much better save function
you can save anywhere in the game and not have to do anything overit is difficult at times but not in the frustrating way that the first two zelda games are
its the first zelda game i ever really played and im glad i started with it
although a link to the past is not one that i would replay many times as there are others that are more fun for me it has a style a story and a relevance that make it one of the most essential and authentic zelda games out theresothis is the tenth review of this game
please read on
this was the third zelda game
originally released in  i bought it in  since i had the first zelda game and had beaten it over ten times i was expecting very much from this
and it did not disappointwell almostthis game is more or less what i said above a charm
it does not have that same adventurous feel of the first zelda game because it tends to focus on the progress of the quest more
it does a great job of this and youll find that the instruction booklet is not needed
everything is explained clearly and concisely in the game
the game of course is traditional zelda fare
a threequarter overhead perspective and a vast land to explore
find new items to get into areas which are otherwise out of reach etc
you get a plethora of items including a bunch of new toys like the hookshot the three medallions and the two canesthis is a firstgeneration snes game so you wont find any fancy d graphics here
what you will find is quotgood oldquot d visuals which by  standards were fairly good
the characters look straight out of a fairytale even the main character link
thats both good and bad because while this helps create the unique enchanting mood of the game it does not posses that haunting quotlonelyquot feeling you get when you played zelda  its a more quotdelightfulquot game
also some areas in the quotdark worldquot tend to be dull
but the overall impression is definitely positivesounds and musicwise its very good
it has the quotzelda overworld themequot supercharged
i also like the dark world quotdeath mountainquot and quotskull woodsquot theme
the sound effects are both impressive and amusing
the sword sounds different each time you improve its level
everything is quite fitting
controls are very fluid toothere are a few minigames and sidequests too
trying to find all the heart containers is a challenging and fun task
there are a couple of weopons which are not essential to finish the quest which is good
you can find them for the fun of it
plus you have two almost identical worlds to exploreso the bottom line is if you still have a snes and dont have this game wake up and go and buy it
if you dont have a snes there would be little point in buying one just because of this game
its not that the game is anything less than great its because the snes is quotdeadquot now and youve missed out all these years and you should learn to let go of a good thingi spent a lot of time playing this game because it is so great
its probably my favorite rpg the only problem is that it can get very diffucult to beat but other then that it is very funthis is one of several games i was introduced to by a friend back in the early to mid s
since it was oneplayer i always watched adam play it and eventually went out to buy it
until ocarina of time was released this was my favorite zelda game to date
i downloaded it on the wii and am still working on finding all of the hearts i have one more to leftfor  and  this game was good as far as graphics go
they were crisp and not jagged like they were for the nes zeldas though link was rather small and indistinguishable
because of the exiting game play and nostalgic value this is one of my alltime favoritesi am getting this game in good condition
so in the beginning link is awakened by a telepathic message from princess zelda who says she is a prisoner in the dungeon of hyrule castle and that agahnim has done something to the other six girls and now zelda herself remains
link wakes up to find his uncle ready for battle and tells link to wait for him to return by morning and not to leave the house
i just disregard what links uncle says and head to the castle only to find him gravely wounded and no longer able to go on
he offers his nephew advice and urges him to rescue princess zelda after which he passes outthe first video game i have ever played and its stuck with me for years for a reason
a link to the past is a freaking classic and is without a doubt worthy of a top  spot on all lists about the greatest video games of all timethis is one of the bests of zelda
the graphics are stunning
for its day the gameplay is awesome
you go through  dugeons total
amazing
it took me  years to get about as far as ready to beat ganon
im still trying to beat him up anyway if you like rpgs run for this onehands down the legend of zelda a link to the past is the best actionrpg ever madethis game is great
i have never really been into zelda but this game changed my opinion on the seriesthis was one of the first games i played for the snes
it also brings back memories when my friends and i were excited when we had this game on the nintendo
which is very weird now that we stayed up all night playing it trying to get further
but i even thought the graphics were good back then when i played it well i was not that old either
it was in the late s when it came out
anyways it has good graphics for the snes and a good story
the story is like the older zelda games do this first beat it then you get thisyes but it never gets old
as you beat the first part which is the castle you have to find the villige elder and then he tells you to collect each of the four pendents as you go on after you collect all of them you can recieve the mighty master sword
whoooo
now lets get some hearts
soon you will be able to get to places that you havent been able to access before because each castle you beat you get a new weapon or tool to use to beat the next part
one of those wonderful tools is the magic mirror that trasports you from the light world that you are at to the dark world
which is pretty much the same as the light world but evil has taken over and it looks all destroyed and forsaken
now this is where you free the princesses and retrieve the crystals
as soon as you get all of them you can battle gannon which is the hardest part and battle of the game then you will rescue the last but not least loved zelda
that is pretty much the story line with the main parts and battles
each castle has a different boss in each world and it gets harder
remember to go back and forth between both worlds to collect and get items you couldent recieve before
very good but very hard game
i would get it considering that it is the only zelda game on the snes which makes me wonder why
all other nintendos have a sequal to each zelda becides this
it would have been a great game though
hell the gamecube even has five zelda games
so be happy with this one because it is a great classic and the last zelda that has a top view feature unstead of in third person that you will find in the newer ones
very hard but very good gameman i cant say enough about this game
over a decade old and i find myself every now and then playing it againsad really
but thats how fun it is
though the graphics look like a cartoon i could care less
the gameplay was so fun the graphics were easily overlooked and back in  you couldnt ask for the best graphics
 stars
still funits the legend of zelda on snes
this game is so dope you dont even need to know the damn tagline
were taking about the same amount of fun you had on your nes with your lil gold cartridge except with better graphics better sound and most importantly a bigger world and better gameplay
what else could be better
good question  the answer is nothingi can hear the cries of fan boys now b bu bu but what about twilight princess they will say
yeah
well what about the twilight princess is so damn important
oh you mean that title on the wii that no one will remember in  years
oh yeah  that one was fun if you like weird motion controls that humiliate you and arthritis by the age of no thanksgive me my old dogbone shaped snes controller and a  pack of rolling rock
that sounds much better than waving a stick of butter around like a dying insect for hours on endwow
a zelda on a  bit system
thats what i said at first when i found out that a new game in the series was coming to the snes and what a surprise it was
those of us who have been with link since the old school days of quotthe legend of zeldaquot really appreciated this one when it came out
the graphics were intense the plot was deep and there were so many new things to find
a person could immerse themselves in this game for hours and even days on end without stopping to eat sleep or use the bathroom yes that was me well almost
i remeber the countless hours i spent finding heart containers weapons and other things in this game along with all of the good memories that it brought as well
the dungeons seemed immense and endless with the multiple floors that were introduced in this game and continued throughout the series
i highly recommend this game and as with everyone else that fell in love with the zelda series this game is one of my most prized games and i will hold in my collection as long as i livei cannot think of anything the makers of this game could have done to make it any better
playing this was exciting from the beginning to the end
there is a huge world to explore with fun side quests and many people to talk with
i loved all the different unique areas to explore and to find out where i could go to next with my new abilities
the game surprised me many times with its fresh new look and being able to do so much and the puzzles were not so frustrating to loose the fun out of it
this game will always be near and dear to me i loved playing this game and it will always be one of my favorite gamesi am not a zelda nut but i have played a lot of them since the original
in my mind nothing stacks up to this one
it stayed true to the original formula and turned it up to   i never felt the d zeldas were as pure in spirit as this although they have their merits
if you are a zelda fan who started with ocarina or later i highly reccomend you try this one
it has a fantastic sense of exploration as wellzelda ltp is one of the best games ever made
the plot is superb in every way
the level desighn is off the chart
this game truly deserves some credit
i was so addictive to this game when i first got it which was round   the game was simply a masterpiece
the controls for the snes was good i really had fun with it acctuallyif youre looking for a classic to find and buy go and buy thistrust me this is a classicthe game doesnt cotst much eitheroverallgameplay story graphics mmm well it is a pretty old game i still give it a laterthis was the second snes title i owned and it came just in time for my th birthday in  about a few months before the xmas holidays
this game was like the legend of zelda on crack mainly due to the  bit graphics and added features and secrets
it was also known to be the first zelda prequal in the zelda series despite of the added features and variety of weapons and swordshield upgrades compared to the nes series
who knew that a glovemitt can make link stronger a pair of magic boots that can make link run faster and break into doors and boulders two different elemental wands that vary of weakness of the enemies a hookshot to connect to out of reach areasgrab itemsinflict more damage than a regular sword three different elemental medallions that can damage enemies on the screens and a magic sheild that can relect beams and block fireballs
returning weapons and power ups from the previous games are the boomerangs retaining the upgrade choices latern formally candle magic hammer armor upgrades formally rings and a magic orcarina for express traveling replacing the fluterecorder
adding on the the special features is a dark worldlight world transition of which required you to obtain the magic mirror to go back to the light world and a magic pearl to keep your identity and power ups in the dark world
now no other adventure game has ever done thatdespite of all the new features and complexed storyline the game is fairly easier than the previous zelda titles and alot more fun
your main goal as link is to obtain the three triforces this game combines the three triforces from the nes titles which are the triforces of wisdom power and courage
before you go anywhere near the triforces you must obtain three different pendants from three different dungeons guarded by the evil gannons guardiansto get the master sword
you must use the master sword to get through the hyrule castle to find princess zelda and fight agahnim the evil gannons disguise
then he transports you to the dark world taking the princess with him as you rush through several altered creatures that would either help you or stand in your way but you must make your choices wisely
then you find out that agahnim has trapped princess zelda and six of the other kings madiens daughters in seven different dark world dugeons so its up to you to free the maidens from the dungeons by finding the seven different power crystals
freeing the madiens is far from your last stop because now you must use the power crystals and the power of the seven madiens to unlock agahnims dark world tower and fight him once again
after defeating him he turns into gannon and now you must chase him into the pyramid for the final showdown but not before you obtain the silver arrow yes the silver arrow that will put him to rest for good
unlike the original zelda game fighting gannon is far from a picnic so use better judgement with your strategies and make sure you have plenty of fairies bottled up in case you die in the line of duty
after his defeat you are awarded with the three triforces of which eliminates the dark world and restores order within hyrule
not sure how this will lead into the original zelda but who cares cause this game rocks
i still have the game working order but i had to order another super nes because my  year old system has recently crashed
this game proves to be the best of all the zelda titles ive played and one of the best selections from the super nes library only because of the cool graphics enhanced features and gameplay and also due to the fact that i can finish it in one day even if it takes hoursthis is one of the best in the zelda series
great music level design and game play
if you liked any of the gb zelda games youll like this and if you are just getting into zelda this is a must playmy favorite thing about the zelda games is they take so darn long to finish
in this way playing a good video game is like reading a good book
it takes a long time but its worth it
this game tells a great story and it really immerses you into another universe
youre placed in a different world with different limits and its like you live a whole other life in a few months or days if youre a hardcore gamer
you follow link through trials and tribulations on the quest of a lifetime and fighting them ugly video game monsters is a nice way to have a bit of fun after a long daythe best game of all time ive had this game for over  years and i still play it all the time you will not get sick of this game it is well worth the moneythis game was released to major hype back in the day
after the initial zelda game rocked the gaming industry and zelda ii which i think was better than the original came out fans were dying for this gamei remember this was also the first zelda game i played
my sis was getting an snes and i told her to get the mario world bundle but she came back with this
ugh i was angry
but eventually i played this game and fell in love with it and in love with the zelda franchisewhen this game came out it was the game of all games
one of the best games of its era and easily the best zelda game for years
only when ocarina of time came out on n was a new zelda game crowned king
but this game was the top dog for a long time and is still widely considered the best game of the  bit erain essence it plays alot like the first zelda only with infinitely better graphics
the dungeons are huge and challenging and fun the bosses fun to beat the weapons and magical items are cool the side quests are fun
this game really doesnt go wrong anywhere at allthere are so many fun things to dolike when you buy the zora flippers and you can swim all over the place collecting heart pieces upgrading bombs and arrows quite expensive
the colors are vibrant and the music is excellenti only have a couple of complaints about the game but they are very minor gripes
like the blue tunic and the red tunic are gotten way late in the game which isnt a bad thing but you nearly get them consecutively
the blue tunic should have been available a little earlierconceding that probably my biggest complaint about the game is the mirror shield
its huge
it covers the entire link sprite and looks terrible
in essence you cant really see link at all once you get the mirror shield which is kind of a bummer
ill also never understand why a golden cartridge edition was never released
at first i would have believed that colored cartridges would not be available for the super nintendo but later on the snes would see a few colored cartridges such as the first edition of maximum carnage red and killer instinct black
it is a bit puzzling but i suppose it just was either not considered important or did not want to be done
however other than that i have no real complaints about the game
im still in love with itwhen you play it you see why it was the best one for so long
only when ocarina of time one of the greatest games ever made bar none came out did it unseat a link to the past as best zelda game but it really is an unfair comparisonthis game may appear slightly dated over the years but it is still a fun game to play today
let us also not forget that this game was widely considered to be one of the top if not the top super nintendo game to ever be released
oh and yes in the end you get the tiforcethis game is amazing
it was just as good as when i played it  yrs ago
buy it and love itthis changed everything the look the feel and how we lived in hyrule
the puzzles were tricky and the choice between keeping the shovel or digging up the ocarina which spawned its own game was a nail biter
can you find all the jars without help
was there a point in being able to cut all the curtains in the castle no but you can so there is the point
im not much for the small screen link games gbds but the large screen ones are the bees knees
the point is if you want to know how ocarina of time and majoras mask came about then here is the start of that while the nes had great zelda games they did not put hyrule on the map as this one did
i can not say it is worth  but then again i still have mine from the year it came out if i did not i really do not want to think about itwhat can i say about a link to the past that hasnt already been said
you get to explore that world as you choose opening up more areas to explore as you clear dungeons and find upgrades
once you have beaten all dungeons in the first world the golden land opens a shadowy counter part to the normal world
once you gain the ability to flip between the two worlds as you choose you gain access to even more secret locations and areas to explore
this game features more dungeons than any other zelda game and a large repertoire of weapons and gadgets give you plenty of options for combat and terrain traversalwhen i first asked for this game i thought it was going to be another average mario game
to my surprise it was the best one ive played in a long time
this game has many levels with lots of secrets and stuff
the levels may be hard but once you get to bowser in my oponion he is easier than the levels
anyway its a good game and it is worth your money
buy it
i have been playing this game ever since i got it and i beat bowser with the help of my friend mike brennan
very addicting and worth your timewhen i bought my super nintendo almost four years ago this was one of the first games i owned for it
now i have a stunning  games for the snes alone meaning it has the biggest selection of games of any of my other systems
no one should dislike this game in any way if you do you must really dislike classics in general
it is one of the wildest and insane games ever made and that is a clear signature of the originality of nintendo
the game is basically about mario and luigi battling their way through the island while defeating the forces of bowser yet again and rescuing the damsel in distress yet again
as you beat the different sections of the island you move to larger and much more challenging sections of the island which get crazier as you move from stage to stage
the boss battles can be challenging and funny because of how the bosses are designed
no retro gamer should miss out on this hilarious and original game that is still a lot of fun to play despite its release almost  years ago in a few more years its going to hit 
one problem is the fact this game can be quite challenging and confusing in some areas
and the game boy advance version of this game lets you play either mario or luigi it doesnt make you stay exclusive to one during segments of the game
still if you dont have a snes you can easily find this game on game boy advance and it looks and plays the same as the original classicthis was one of my favorite games when i was little i loved the fact that you could use yoshi
he is so cutethis game is very easy monsters dont suprise attack you as they do in games like donkey kong country and mario bros  where you have to know they are coming before you can avoid them
most of the monsters in this game are visible before you get close to them making it easy to avoid themthe bosses arent that difficult the only bosses that ever given me problem are bowser of course and the  
dinosaurs that stands on some wooden thingiesmost areas are easy to complete especially the first ones
some areas are quite difficult especially a minicastle high on a mountain thankfully you can avoid it because i hate going to that place
as a matter of fact if you find a secret star area you can cheat yourself to bowsers palace early in the game
and getting throgh his castle if you use the correct doors is a piece of cake
bowser does annoy you a bit but i beat him the second timeinstead of mario becoming looser mario minimario as soon as you get struck by a monster you degrade from flowercapemario to big mario then loosermario
also if you are riding yoshi and he gets struck by a monster you dont degrade but yoshi runs away crying until you hop back on
this is easy when he gets stuck in a small area where he runs back and forth but a bit annoying when he decides to run off a cliff
poor yoshiso you can basically take advantage of this in a hard area just get yoshi and you wont degrade to loosermario because you accidently get itthere are plenty of secrets in this game and in some places you can open  ways to go by using a key
theres a secret star area where you can teleport from stars quickly and theres also a secret upgrading area so you can easily upgrade to capemario and get a yoshi
or collect hundreds of extra lifeone thing that annoys me on the snes version that is solved by the virtual console since the game freeze until you come back is that if you restart the game even if you are capemario have a yoshi and  extra life when you save  you start with  lives no yoshi and you are loosermario
you can also only save when youve completed a castle or a ghosthouse
yes the hardest areas in the game
this is also solved by the virtual consolei highly recommend this game it has never bored me and ive played it for yearssuper mario world is without a doubt one of the best video games of all time
super nintendo has dished out some of the most iconic game titles and this is no exception
the game still is so fun after all these years and still looks good in the graphics department a fine example of what bit graphics were capable of along with the donkey kong country series
bottom line if you have a snes or snes emulator console buy it
you will not regret itthis game is a lot of fun even though many levels are a bit easy
yoshi rules and finding all of the secrets give it a new twist from smgreat memories and a great game
you must have this game if you have a snes
gameplay still holds today graphics are funnyim jumping into the wayback machine and setting the time for fall  hold on tight because its going to be bumpyfall  it was a great time to be a video gamer
for the past  years the nes was on top of the world and home to so many memorable games
while the sega master system was its rival it enjoyed more of a cult following as the majority of video games were released for the nes
but like all good things they come to an end as sega ushered in a brand new console
the sega genesis released in  featured new technology and more horsepower to display flashier games and brought a new video games icon to rival mario and nintendo
nintendo responded by releasing the super nintendo entertainment system and a brand new mario game super mario world
this was the game packed in with the console and was responsible for maintaining the large fan base the original nes had built up for yearsto say this made an impact to gamers would be an understatementhot off the heels of the excellent super mario bros  super mario world was the sequel that showcased the sness graphical prowess and ability to display new effects
 new worlds to explore plus the hidden star portals and  levels lie in wait for gamers to explore
it introduced new enemy characters as well as the lovable dinosaur yoshi
and above all it was extremely fun to play
from the graphics to the music and the easy to get into controls this game continued the proud tradition of the revered mario games and set standards for all future platform games to comewhile there are many ways to track down this title the original snes cartridge the game boy advance title and through nintendos virtual console service for those who have a wii that is online any true gamer has played this many many times and can tell you that it was one of the finest games to ever come out from nintendo
highly recommendedif you are going back to collect super nintendo games or even play them for a little nostalgia pick this up immediatelyits good that the original games are still out there
as much as i love some of the newer games its good to play the old ones still
if you like the old ones and dont have a machine you should check out the retro duo on amazon
it plays both the original nes and sneswords cannot expressthis is a mustplay game pure and simple
great for all ages toothis game is a classic
the story is tha same as the original mario bros games though there are new enemies and levels
it is definetly a must getthis is the fourth or fifth instalment of the super mario bros games
and it is such a sweet game
yoshi is so cool
what would mario do with out him
this is a must have gameif you liked this game then check out all of the mario gamesthis is my first mario game i  ever played and i still love it
a lot of people dont like it as much as the most overrated game of all time super mario bros  im tired of people going it  doesnt have teh sootz imo suitsyoshigameplay your standard mario platformer
only filled to the brim with secrets something smb didnt have and yoshi
i like the new cape which allows you to fly anywhere
caperaccoongraphics  looks great for the first snes game
very colorfulsoundsmusic  standardstory  bowser kidnaps peach yet again
doesnt matter since no one plays this game for the storyvery underrated
here are the reasons its better than smb secrets
 secret worlds and many many secret levels
better bosses
in smb you had to jump on the koopa kidss heads while avoiding their shots
in smw bosses are creative
peach kisses mario  
i like the cool ways mario blows up castles in this one
castlesships
many paths to take while in bowsers castle
can revisit levels  worlds unlike smb
switch palaces
ghost houses
renzorboomboom
tells enimies names at the credits
save feature
yoshi
i could keep going on how this game is better than smb but ill stop right hereps to the kid who said this game is too hard i have a few things to say  this game isnt that hard  you said the graphics are the only thing good about this heap of rubish rubbish huh
british alertthere was a time when the snes was king of the consoles and this was its excaliburdefinitely one of the greatest games ever madeit came with the snes console back when i was  this mario is arguably the best ever designed
great gameplay replay value and one of the best soundtracks you will ever hear in a  bitthis is positively the best super mario game of all time
the gameplay is similar to the gameplay in super mario   and  with one great addition
yoshi
in your travels as mario you will discover green blue red and yellow yoshis each with their own unique abilities
if you are a fan of the mario franchise buy this gamegreat games for the ages
i am getting my kids into retro games
they enjoy playing mario on the retro systemwhen you mention an super nintendo this should instantly come to mind
everyone that owned a super nintendo system had this game
it is a classic
this game and the donkey kong series are the best games for super nintendo
if you have only one game for your snes this is the one to havethe game is great
a classic
i could play it over and over again and never get sick to itwhen i bought the snes over  years ago super mario world was the first ever game i bought
it was also the first video game i ever played for any system
you couldnt possibly ask for more from a game from  the graphics are amazing for a bit game and systemsuper mario world is very similar to the first ever mario game mario bros for the nes
like in mario bros you kill enemies by jumping on top of them and collect coins to earn more points and extra lives
your goal is to save the princess from the evil bowser
but first you have to beat each level in every world by evading enemies and collecting as many coins as you can without losing a live
after you beat every level in the world you will face a boss which is much harder than any other place in the world
there are  levels in the entire game including several bonus levels that you need to find and beat before you will face bowser the main boss in the entire game
defeating bowser is very hard and takes some time but its fun trying to save the princessthis is the game that made video games become really popular
if you stop by funcoland or any store with snes games pick up this game today along with super mario allstars another great snes game with  mario games on itcompletely classic and just as fun as when i first played
plus with internet now its crazy to see all the hidden levelsthis was one of the first video games i ever got and now even though i have ps and gamecube i still go back and play it over and over again
i mean nintendo couldnt have made it better
there are tons of powerups secret levels and different colored yosiis each with their own special powers
in my mind the super nes version is much better than the gba because you have to earn the right to save and it isnt a piece of cake to get a special colored yosii
this has got to be one of the best mario classics of all timeeach mario game nintendo puts out is a solid  or above rated game
i bought this game back when the snes came out and couldnt put it down
i have lots of good memories playing this game and now its out for the wiis virtual console
even bettersuper mario world is a game that runs synonymous with any discussion about the super nintendo entertainment system
being the initial release title usually bundled with the snes until the release of the second model theres virtually no one who owns a snes who doesnt have a copy of this game
even still there are those out there who have never played this game and the only thing i have to ask in response to that is just why
super mario world encompasses all that is great about not only the mario franchise displaying the rightful place for mario in games but shows us what is right about video games and the snes in generalwhen you talk about mario the first things that come to mind are gokarts and sidescrolling platform action
super mario world grabs the platform genre puts it on growth enhancer and takes it to whole new levels of fun while building on the legend that was created after super mario bros and super mario bros  on the nesthe plot of the game is essentially no different from that of the other mario games prior to this with the exception of super mario bros  bowser has kidnapped princess toadstool yes that was her name before she had a name change to princess peach and its up to mario and luigi to rescue her
bowser has a lot of help this time from his koopa family much like he did in super mario bros  and theyre not going to give her up too easily this time around
being mario hell just hop his way around town to find her and thatll be the end of it right thereyou really have to say something about the graphics for this game
even to this day its still probably one of the best looking snes games in the library
the colors in the sprites and background graphics are very vibrant and really stick out at you
everything is detailed as much as possible for a bit game and there are virtually no graphical flaws anywhere
whats more is that you hardly come across any situations in the game where there are too many sprites on the screen at a time and the game starts to lag and sprites start to shiver as i call it where half of marios head would be somewhat transparent and try to come out fully drawnthe controls in this game are very responsive and feel as natural as can be for a snes game
you never really feel like you have to force or struggle to perform any available action
mario never stops dead in his tracks and doesnt just start moving at a constant speed
he builds up to a walking speed and comes slowly to a stop
as was introduced in super mario bros  mario can run and if he has a cape equipped he can fly in the air after reaching a maximum running speed
a totally new addition to the series for mario was the spin jump
by pressing the a button mario was able to jump into the air while spinning around like a tornado
doing this allowed the player to usually defeat enemies requiring multiple hits in one shot and you could also break certain yellow blocks by performing this jump onto themanother new addition to the mario series was the lovable green dinosaur named yoshi
this faithful lizard would put his unusually long tongue to work for you which allowed you to swallow certain fruits on trees ive always thought they looked like some really odd strain of tomato certain enemies and whats more swallowing certain turtle shells endowed yoshi with some additional abilities
for instance red turtle shells when spit back out produced three fireballs that ripped through pretty much any enemy
my personal favorite the blue turtle shells would allow yoshi to fly simply by holding the jump button
some levels cant be fully completed without yoshi as well
additionally yoshi doesnt just come in the green variety either
finding hidden places in the normal levels or gaining access to the hidden levels like star road and the hidden levels after that allowed you to find the different colored yoshis who when swallowed any shell would have the power of the turtle shell that matched their color
for instance if you found a red yoshi any shell would make him spit fireballs back outthe world map for the game is huge for its time
starting off on yoshis island working your way to the donut plains then to the vanilla dome next into the forest of illusion then the dangerous but tasty direct quote   chocolate island and finally right into the domain of bowser himself youre guaranteed hours of playtime
but thats not all
aside from the levels required to progress through the game youre able to travel to the star road for an additional challenge
again thats not the end of it
after finding a hidden passage in the star road you can travel to an even more hidden area hosting some of the most challenging levels in the gamei strongly recommend this game to anyone who plays video games
its the perfect game for casual gamers enthusiasts or children hopefully their parents are kind enough to introduce this gem to them before a xbox 
itll provide you with hours of fun and is still one of the absolute best games for the snessuper mario world was one of the first games released for snes
and throughout the long life of the snes this game was never outdone
super mario world was an awesome game when i was  years old and to this day its still cool to sit down and play this once and awhile
im even gettin my kids into this gotta bring it into the next generationneed i say morebut they make me say more with people selling off their old things for extra cash now is the perfect time to re buy those old games that you let go over the yearsi still play this game to this day
i played it as a kid never beat it but i played it so much with my friends and alone and i pull it out to play every once in a while still
mario has always been one of my favorite game series of all time
opening up with arguably the most influencial game of all time the original mario brothers then an average game by mario standards of  lost levels only released in japan which is a great one by the way and one of the most popular games of all time super mario brothers  world had a huge reputation to live up to and it did even exceeding expectations for a lot of people including megameplay the levels in this game are brilliantly done by nintendo
fun platforming cool enemies and just above all else amazing level design
those of you that have played a mario game know what im talking about
its the heart and soul of every mario game the reason every mario game is praised so highly
every level is done very nicely
as usual with nintendo brilliant stuff hereback when the super nintendo was king videogames were marketed more towards people ages  and under so with this the challenge of the game isnt hard
for the most part you can just fly through these levels but theres the occasional tricky one
one thing nintendo should do is add a difficulty setting to their games
it pains me to play such great games but be challenged so little with them allat the time of this games release games were anywhere from  hours in length with the rpgs going  hours
you can get through this one in easily under  hours and possible in  hours on your first time
with each time you play throug it it becomes quickeri would complain about the length but for the time it came out it was your average length
plus the replay value is good
the levels as i said are brilliant so you want to play through them more than once and mariofun so you will want to play through this game atleast a couple times
all in all the length disappoints for the time it is now but its still good and was normal for its timei took off the  because the difficulty setting is too easy for a lot of people
these are nintendo games so people dont complain because theyre amazing but you have to admit a more challenging mario game would be a lot of funreplay value i touched on this already
nintendo games are amazing so youll want to play through this one atleast twice
cant complain in this department but extras would have helpedmusic nice stuff here
easily one of nintendos best soundtracks
cheery tunes in the normal levels darker tunes for the castles and ghost levels
very nice intro for the game as well
just great stuff through out the whole game not a bad song anywheregraphics wow
this is the super nintendo at its best
mario looks great and the levels are bursting with color
the castles with lava look especially great
vibrant beautiful colors
still very pleasing on the eyes to this dayoverallnot an average considered by many the best mario game of all time and rightfully so
from brilliant levels to great music and graphics
nintendo went all out on this onemario with friends travel to dinosaur land for a vacation where its home to a friendly species of dinosaur called yoshis however bowser and his kooplings are still alive and yet kidnap the princess once again including kidnapping some of the friendly dinosaurs in eggs for his collection
mario and luigi team up with some yoshis to get through  levels in  different worlds to save dinosaur landa brilliant start for the snes as in  in japan as they released the superfamicom japanese nintendo system nintendo wowed players back then in that country and it became the highest acclaimed game in the series back then since smb  it spawned hype here in the us earlier in nintendo power and many other game magazines even about the shiny new super nintendo entertainment system and its launch title super mario world
on august th  the snes premiered with the game that went with out and fans were originally worried if it will live up to be a masterpiece like super mario brothers  and if it was a masterpiece they got its a masterpiece they finally gotits the best looking game in the series at the time with its highly advanced graphics and sounds as it was an evolutionary stepforward to the saga
while not offering many new elements as the previous game this one does offer a feather that can make mario a caped superhero where he can fly like his raccoon counterpart in part  to performing a bellydive and spin around he can ride his allies known as yoshi where it can devour enemies and this is the first game where mario uses his spin jump
like smb  this one brings back the map system and mario could backtrack and reenter levels
the game has brilliant d colorful visuals that still holds up as it has a work of charm to it including amazing special effects that impressed the hell out of gamers including myself when i got this game with the system for christmas back in  when i was  it was nothing like gamers here in the us has ever seen before from rotating boss battles to all the way to the climax of the banzai that bowser rodeits easily as awesome as smb  and another timetested classic that is always a treat to replay as its one of my fave games everfirst of all let me say the game looks much better when you play it on a tv than a dinky little game boy advance
the definitive version is this one
the music is amazing the controls incredible the challenges hard but never too frustrating
i think of it as super mario bros  part  because the games are so similar they are like connected somehowif you missed out on super nintendothe best video game system of all time when you were a kidi advise you get your credit card and order an snes plus this game prontoyou wont regret ita great game
i have been looking for a working copy of this game for ages after i lost my own ages ago
even better and way more difficult wow than i remember
a classic game and the delivery was timely for non expedited shippingthe only snes game thats better than this is donkey kong country  the only other snes game that stands a chance against this is mario kart and zelda
this is the second best mario game the first being super mario bros  anyway the graphics and music on this game are amazing
and the gameplay is out of this world
the worlds goyoshis islandthis is a great starter worlddonut plainsthis is a massive place with tons of secretsvanila domegood world but it could have been inprovedmountain topsa good well hidden levelwoods of mysteryloads of neat secretschocolate landa massive level but a bit hardbowsers placeit starts with a mario  level
its coolstar roadthere are five doors to this around mario worldspecial snes logo landthis is very hard
hard to find tooverdictthe only game better than this is super mario  this is fantasticmy son bought this and works a little too good
i have to keep telling him i cant help him with the next level
i grew up with an atari
no nothing about these new gamesi have to be honestthis game is so fun i like it better then all the other marios that are out today
iv played just about every mario
its so easy but so hard lol
its funi will own a copy til the day i die
buy it and love it classics never die
get a fx twin if youre looking for a systemthis is the ebst mario game ever each world has its own character and there are tons of secrets to find which will keep you playing for hourswhen it comes to d video games few games come close to the greatness of super mario world
the only  games that come close are kirby  the amazing mirror kirby super star ultra and new super mario bros the graphics and sound are great for this games time
there are plenty of powerups yoshi makes his debut gameplay is unbelievably fun but the best part is the level design
a set of diverse levels some of which actually make one powerup seem more useful than another
this games level design is unsurpassed
the first  super mario bros games combined couldnt come close to matching this games quality
many think that super mario bros  is the best but i think it is absolutely nothing compared to mario world the nearperfect game
this is the one and only undisputed  d game of all time in my eyes
i rate this game this game is awsome its the first time we get yoshi and other different yoshis
mario and luigi doing there thing for two player
u get new power upslike the feather which u can fly and make a huge bang
music is awsome graphics are good for  bit when playing this game u get to use the spin jump to break objects when your not small
over all this game is a classic adventure gamethis game also has lots of fun for super nintendothis has been and will always be my favorite mario game
its flawless and anyone from the s will agree
its when they introduced yoshi my favorite character from mario 
if you havent played it youve been missing outthe game works great my whole family is having fun playing this game all day and night
definitely happy with the buyi will always remember when i first learned that we got a snes
it was the summer of   growing up in rural oklahoma my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated
i was in that tank all the time
my father and my brother had gone to oklahoma city about an hour away from where we lived and they had gotten an snes with super mario world prepackaged
i immediately dried off ran upstairs and my brother and i were immersed in mario blissbeing the nintendo fans that we were we were subscribers to nintendo power
i poured over all the precover of their latest nintendo console as well as any information we could glean of super mario world
i had even known some people who won the snes in one of those giveaways they used to do back in the s and s on cereal boxes
i was so jealousplaying super mario world was a pure revelation that first time and a perfect exhibition of the power of the snes
the graphics were gorgeous the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical and the bullet bills were enormousthere has always been a debate on which is better  super mario bros  or super mario world  for myself id give the edge to super mario world
to be fair to super mario bros  super mario world simply took the foundation laid by smb and perfected it just like the legend of zelda a link to the past did with the original legend of zeldaessentially take everything great from super mario bros and super mario bros  expand the graphics and audio from bit to bit overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named yoshi include a lot of secrets and wala super mario worldeverything super mario bros  is so adored for super mario world takes and does several steps better with only one exception  suits
super mario bros  famously introduced us to racoon mario hammer mario frog mario and tanooki mario though oddly no boomerang mario which we wouldnt see until super mario d land
super mario world only features fire mario and cape mario
however cape mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time unlike racoon mario which is captive to a pmeter and can only fly for short burststhe story always the same in the core mario series is simply that while mario luigi and the princess are on vacation to dinasaur land after the events of smb bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct princess peach
it is up to mario to free the princess and rescue the dinasaurs
dont worry though the storys not important
mario is never about the story its always about the gameplay
and what gameplay it is
super mario world is famous for introducing the world to yoshi the ridable dragon
miyamoto wanted mario to ride a dinosaur in the original  super mario bros but was not able to implement this new character until this game
it is strange yoshi doesnt appear in super mario bros  after all ridable steeds appeared in adventure island ii and also the later game little nemo dream master
regardless you are given four types of yoshis  the basic green one the blue one who when swallowing any type of turtle shellregardless you are given four types of yoshi each with a special power according to their colour green red blue and yellow
the green is the most common
upon injesting a turtle shell the red blows fire the blue flies and the yellow creates a dust storm attack
the green is able to do all of these if he swallows the same color turtle shell red  fire blue  flying yellow  dust
the special color yoshis are only available in secrect star levels where they appear as babies which mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grownyoshi is also famous for eating
strangely enough mario must punch yoshi in the back of the head before yoshi sticks out his tongue looking for goodiesone of my favorite additions is just how miyamota and company added to the lenght
one legitimate weakness of smb is simply how short so many of the levels are  many times you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done
even miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of super mario bros  asking his developers if the games original levels were really that short
once a level is beaten you cannot go back
no so with super mario world
indeed due to the secret exits and alternate paths nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in smbtaking the overworld map first introduced in smb for the first and until the  new super mario bros u only time on a home console mario game the map is connected and completely visible unlike its predecessor
previously the worlds were divided into individual maps but not super mario world
from the get go you could view the entire game map
dinasaur land comprises seven different areas played in this order yoshis island guarded by iggy koopa donut plains guarded by morton koopa jr vanilla dome guarded by lemmy koopa twin bridges guarded by luwig von koopa the forest of illusion guarded by roy koopa chocolate island guarded by wendy o koopa and the valley of bowser home to not only bowser but larry koopa as wellyou cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay
for the first time on a significant level you could choose your own path
the map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chockfull of secrets alternate paths and hidden areas
the secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either  if a regular level had a secret exit the level would be a red dot if no secret exit existed then the level is represented as a yellow doteach world is thematically diverse
the first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay teaching you the rules and dynamics of marios new adventure
the second world is set in the plains the third world is set in caverns and the fourth world is set on dual bridges along with some mountain levelsby the fifth world the forest of illusion the challenge has been ramped up and to proceed you must find those deviously hidden secret exits
we then have the tasty but dangerous
chocolate island which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be
then we have the challenging ghost ship which according to the instruction manual is a wrecked ship from super mario bros  and the only boss level that yoshi will enter
after that naturally is the valley of bowserone of the best features are the two secret worlds  the star world and the secret world
unlike other mario games there are no warp zones present in super mario world
however there are levels called the star road which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the star world and completing the levels
to connect the star road you must find the secret exits
once you find the fifth and final level on the star road you are then taken to the secret world a world of eight gruelling ultrachallenging levels that will truly test your mario metal
super mario bros  super mario world the official japanese title is the best d mario out there though perhaps new super mario bros u will usurp this game from its lofty throneinterestingly enough miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with super mario world as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards
however just like mega man  a game also apparently rushed super mario world is as good as it gets
i wonder what further changes miyamoto would have made
unfortunately well never knowthose who love masterpieces of excellent d platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their snes  and better yet super mario world is also available on the wii and wii us virtual console
pick this one up
you wont regret itthis was written separate from the review back in may  about the mario games development history
notably miyamoto said that super mario world began development with a team of sixteen people and took about three years to make
as super mario world came out in november  that means nintendo began production on this game sometime in   the same year they were working on super mario bros 
on a game forum someone asked why nintendo did not release super mario bros  on the snes instead of the nes and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system
this was my answerlets look at some mario history shall we
smb came out in japan in october  that means it was completed finished and ready to be published by that point in timeif you look at the japanese publication dates smb came out in  lost levels came out in  doki doki panic came out in  and smb came out in late  given the fact the game was finished and released by  i would hardly call that late in the nes hardware cycle
actually the nes had only been out three years when smb hit japan although the famicom came out in late  however all the heavy hitters for the famicom came out in  and beyondessentially all nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart the code was written and completed
if have a sequel to the biggest game for your console and the sequel smb is also a massive hit  why wouldnt they release smb which was already completed and published in japan
they had a massive financial interest in getting this game outthere are very few differences between the japanese smb and the western smb namely if mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little mario rather than super mario ala mario with a mushroom
theres nothing like the major differences between the japanese and the western versions of zelda ii the adventure of linkall four bit nes titles were completed in a three year period  and were published in japan as well though smb there called smb usa came out in ive read smb took about two to three years to program meaning nintendo began work on it possibly by late  though that does sound entirely too early but definitely by early  and possibly even late  given it was released in october  and both doki doki and lost levels would have been finished in the case of doki doki it would have been closed to being completed if not already completedin comparison today that would be like saying nintendo should not have released new super mario bros wii back in  three years into the wii lifecycle because obviously the wii u is coming up and they should save it for a new system
the timeframe is the same
and according to your logic for this generation we definitely should not have gotten skyward sword for the wii despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after twilight princess came outi do find it strange that they had problems with yoshi which for the record miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original  smb
after all hudsons adventure island series the same company responsible for the abomination that is super mario bros special the first ever sequel to the mario franchise were able to get ridable dinasaurs and the  capcom title little nemo dream master had ridable creatures toothen again adventure island ii came out in april  two and a half years after smbbasically i said all that to say you should research your mario history more
when nintendo began development on smb late early  the super nes was nowhere on the horizon at least not publically
even in late  when the game was published we were still over two years away from the super famicom which came out in japan in november of so thats why they didnt develop it for the super famicomi remember growing up with the port of this to the gba and when i finally got a snes i knew that this was going to be one of the first games i got
didnt disappointthis is the first game i got for the snes and is still one of my favorites
the graphics r about the same as the nes graphics but they added a little more color and smothed out the blockeyness
the sound is great for the snes
after u get the hang of it it gets eaiser to play and the controls get more simple
this is the eaisest mario game to beat for me but not for other people
i love the multiplayer mode it makes it eaiser to get farther in the game
it seems after this game on the snes marios games were not as good untill the gc came out
like i said this is the best snes game madereasons why you should buy this
it is the best d super mario game
it is challenging
it has major replay value
this is the only game with the cape power up
you need to play this game before you dye
it makes you disrespect the new super mario bros series
great two player mode
takes  week to beat and a month to 
yoshi makes his first appearance in a super mario game
just buy it trust me its a fun challenging mario gamesuper mario world is an instant classic from the opening demo
quite possibly the deepest snes game to date
its lenthy its great for those who have alot of free time writing reviews
heres the bottom line for super mario worldconcepttake the video game icon and put him in his deepest and most challenging game yetgraphics very good for the first snes game madesound youll be humming those tunes till you dieplayability easy to pick upand as soon as you do youll be a proreplay highalex i love this game because you get to ride on yoshi and fly like superman
fast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
ain the months leading up to its release i dont think i got more than  hours of sleep
the idea of a sequel to the heralded super mario bros  kept my  year old self wide awake at night
images of mario flying around in brand new stages filled my head each night as i closed my eyes before sleep
i remember having vivid dreams the mario bros and i going on adventures to rid the mushroom kingdom of the koopa family
each morning i would wake to find that my dreams had not come true and i would just go on playing my old copy of super mario bros  like it was the newest game
as you can see i was a delirious and desperate childdad went on a business trip to kyoto japan and almost bought a japanese version of the snes
at first he thought this would be a great idea considering all of my friends would probably end up getting the american versions
his son the boy who would eventually become a man to carry on the family name would have a unique video game system that he phoned my mom excitedly but then realized only japanese games would work for this particular console
and since his son me was not fluent in japanese decided to reconsider and purchase an american snesneedless to say i was very disappointed when he came home empty handed
he usually got me a souvenir after returning home from travelling
not this time
 months later i was surprised with an early birthday present
snes console with super mario world
as i frantically raced to hook up the snes to the tv all i could think about was playing the newest super mario bros gamei felt like i was royalty
no not just any old royalty  i felt like i was king
friends who didnt have this console were considered in a class below the awesome might that was known as the snes
those four letter meant you were the coolest kid on the block
adventure island 
no thanks
id rather be rocking out to the superior graphics of super mario worldhow do i begin to explain the awesomeness that is super mario world
this game proved the super mario franchise lived on when it came out as a pack in game with the super nintendo
just as we all thought nintendo couldnt top super mario bros  this proved us all wrong
this innovative mario title introduced yoshi
it presented a whole new smoother gameplay with updated use of the controller
graphics were better and the game was jam packed with secrets galore which inspired many playthroughs
i combed this game inside and out nonstop until i got  completion back in the day
its the nd virtual console game i downloaded for good reason
its a great game everyone should ownthis game is one of my favorite mario games it has one huge world you can go through
the levels are fun and some areas are wacky
i would definitely recommend this gamethis game was the perfect introduction to the super nintendo system
very colorful full of excitement and easy to play but hard to figure out sometimes
sounds simple but most games dont have it
i would say this is the second best snes game ever right behind legend of zeldalink to the past
thanks for readingsuper mario world is a classicif you have snes get this incredible gameits very underrateedby far one of the best snes games besides super metroidif you have an snes then get games likedonkey kong countrysuper mario world  yoshis islandi think thats the name of the titlei dont rememeber since its bin a while since ive played that gamecold shadowsuper metroidchester cheetos adventureyeah okthats not a classic but its still funwell yeah thats itgo get super mario worl if you have a snesits a great gamelatersuper mario world is the best mario game of all time and with great reason although people prefer mario  over world smw fixed what we had to complain about in  the game continued on to become the bestselling bit gamesuper mario  is great but mario world improved some faults and added better things that made this game more superioryoshicape powerupsavingloadingless autoscrolling levelsetcthe game lasts really long and it is always fun even after it is beateni thank you god for most this amazing gameim trying to remember the almost mystical sensation i got as a child first playing this a lightyearleaping paradigmshifting moment of complete perfection the first of the snes batch
i can almost remember the contours of the feeling but i cant live it again its hallowed
thats finethe child knew it at leastmy brothers and i still find ourselves playing this game through start to finish
it loses nothing remains that perfect tradeoff between challenge and ease that we have dubbed fun
we know the music by heart the levels by intuition which buttons deploy a cape or snake out yoshis tonguethe archetypal sidescrolling mario adventure
wonderful and lets leave it at thatpurchased for my daughter for her gaming system
she loves it and is very happy with it and glad she has itthis is the best mario game in the world
i love it so much
we got it back when it first came out back in the s
but i was only like  or  years old
so buy itcame in great condition and worked as suppose to
wanted to get this game cause i loved super mario when i was younger and now i can play it wheneverthis game will bring back memories for anyone that ever played it on snes
i remember playing in sears
it was so funlove playing this game again its fun watching my kids play it and i enjoy playing it again too reminds me of my childhoodwith the myriad of titles now available for the nextgeneration systems youd think super marioworld would be one no one would buy
if you own an old snes and dont have this title youre missing out on one of the greatest titles ever produced in the systems heyday
playability graphics sound its all here and even if youre not a mario fan give this game a spin and you wont be disappointed
give this classic a try and youll find yourself humming the mario theme well after the game is donei loved this game fifteen years ago and i love it today
super mario world is one of my alltime favorite games
i recently bought this game to play after i became bored with some of the newer games i own
my girlfriend is a big mario fan and she and i spend time playing mario world and unlocking all of its secretssuper mario world is great fun for anyone of any agei beat this game many times as a kid and will attempt to do this again as an adult
i think ill succeed but it may take a while
this game and other mario games are always fun to play no matter how old you aresuper mario world took what made mario  so fun and packed it with epic bit action
while i thought it was rather simple i soon corrected myself once i took a closer at the internal workings
first of all the graphics are quite nice for the super nes
yeah it is rather pixelated but the cartoon style and wonderful effects make up for it
the also game is quite complicated for its time
the layer engine runs around  different tilesets each with diffrent scenery and enemies and the complicated isometric map screen runs even more
to top that off enemy generators and scrolling varations are almost always used
the heavy use of flags and scripts on the map screen make the game even more amazingly complex
however even to people who arent interested in marios internal engine design mario world is still every bit enjoyable
the levels come in all shapes and styles with creative enemies to match
mario world introduced yoshi the dinosaur pal mario can ride on and make eat enemies
yoshi is vital to the game if you want to win it
mario world also introduced many other memorable elements that make mario the most awesome platformer around ghost houses switch palaces secret exits star world bowsers koopa clown car renzor etc
your not a real gamer until youve felt the magic of the world and suffered the burn of the challenges
if you think nintendo is going to be soft and hold your hand like in new super mario bros  your in for a big surprise
nintendo was a completely different company back when the super nes was launched and mario world is proof of thatwhat a debut for the super nintendo
this is one of the best games ever
tons of levels tons of secrets tons of everything
its no cakewalk but its incredibly fun to play
you can play this game for years and years
its simply spectacularthis game is a classic and is one i will probably be coming back to for the rest of my life
dont buy this on the wii  get the original experience by playing this on the sneshad to have it i am a bit of a game collector even though i hardly ever play them anymore and all the mario games are classicsthe super mario world i know and love
a must have for anyone with a super nintendo
i strongly recommendstill amazing came with my super so many years ago i think i was like  or something and now im  and i still play it its amazingsuper mario world is one of the best sidescrolling games of all time and if you have one game for the snes this is it
it is just a fun game that gamers of all ages can enjoy
i should know because super mario world was the first video game i ever played and let me tell you it was some experience
looking back on the game all these years later and my stance still hasnt changed a single bit
super mario world for the super nintendo is a keepergameplay  graphics  the animation of this game is some of the best youll see for the snes and is certainly worth noting when reviewing this game
for a game of its age the game is very crisp in its presentation and the gameplay is simple enough for anyone of ages  and above to easily grasp yet dont let that fool you for the levels of this game are complex enough to entertain seasoned gamers or parents who wish to look back at the classic days of gaming
it is a vast improvement over the original sidescrolling mario adventure on the nes and offers hours of entertainment due to its high number of levelsentertainment value  super mario world is just plain harmless fun that is fun for gamers of all ages and it should not be forgotten
i first played this game at an age of five and i know it is the cause of my interest in video gaming so i owe it much thanks
playing it now i still recognize it as a fine achievement in the history of video gaming and that it deserves attentionso my stance remained firm that super mario world for the snes is perhaps the best game for the snes and certainly one of the best family games of all timesuperb d classicmuch enjoyment to be had starsmarios off on his biggest adventure yetand this time hes brought along a friendyoshi the dinosaur teams up with mario to battle the ugly bowserwho has kidnapped princess toadstoolagainguide mario and yoshi through nine perilfilled worlds and meet new guys you hate youmarios backand this time hes better than eversuper mario world another sidescrolling game straight from nintendo
back then this game was a real big hit and so was its remake
back in the s nintendo starting making some arcade games namely donkey kong and jumpman
later they moved jumpman or mario as you know him today to their new system the nes
they made several games for it such as super mario bros they kept going until the nes was becoming old
the snes was then released
games such as super mario allstars and super mario rpg were released
also released was the super mario world series super mario world this reviews subject and then super mario world  yoshis island
later though even the snes became obsolete as all consoles eventually do
nintendo therefore released the nintendo  super mario  super smash bros and mario party are some of the games released for this console
later the gamecube was released
super smash bros melee and super mario sunshine among others were released for this console
the nintendo wii was the next home console to be released
super paper mario mario party  super smash bros brawl and super mario galaxy are some of the more wellknown games for this
however as you know nintendo worked on handhelds tootheir first handhelds were the game boy and game boy color
i dont remember if any mario games were released for these
however there are some mario games for the next consoles the game boy advance the game boy advance sp and game boy micro all of which play game boy advance games
some nes and snes games were remade and put onto these more accessible systems
super mario world got its remake as super mario world super mario advance  yoshis island got its remake as super mario advance  super mario world  yoshis island
super mario bros  and super mario bros  also were remade
other originals include super mario rpgs sequel mario  luigi superstar saga and mario kart
nintendo also released the nintendo ds
the original was released in  the nintendo ds lite in  the nintendo dsi in  the dsi xl in a point in  new super mario bros the original super mario bross remake was released in  super mario  ds was released in  mario party ds was also released
others include mario  luigi partners in time yoshis island ds and mario  luigi bowsers inside story
anyways yeah a lot of handheld mario have been released especially recentlyanyways lets get this over with shall wethe gameplay is pretty simple
this game like most early mario games is a simple sidescroller
what that means is that the screen shows a d area and you moves left to right right to left bottom to top or top to bottom all while the screen moves around to keep you in the center
games like this have a goal at the end in most early marios a flagpole
in this game you get two goalposts with a tape moving up and down allowing you to obtain bonus stars which can lead to a bonus minigame in which you may gain up to eight lives
the scoring system allows you to go up to almost ten million points  to be exact
you go through eight worlds fighting a boss at each ones end
seemingly all the worlds are equal but not so
some have four levels other have almost a dozen
there are also secret exits which give you another level to play which you normally cannot play
for full completion you must play all of the levels
the dragon coin sidequest also makes you unlock stuffthe story is simple enough
mario luigi and peach have apparently gone on vacation
mario and luigi unpack some stuff then just fly off
they return and peach is gone
yep it is bowser again
they have no clue where he is so they search the island level by level until they find her
along the way you will meet yoshi a dinosaur that is tied much more closely to mario and luigis lives than you would think
play yoshis island to find out
they meet bowser eventually and another clash begins
wait
that is just his kid one of seven
now even bowsers kids are helping
they extend their search beyond the small yoshis island to the donut plains then the vanilla mountain and so on and so forth until they finally reach bowsers castle after beating all of his kids
mario and luigi go in but will they come out
will peach still be alive
your choice as you are mario or luigithe graphics are decent
unlike the other nes or snes mario games these graphics arent blocky in the slightest
there is virtually no lag at all
the colors are vibrant and colorful they blend together beautifully
there are also many new enemies to encounter
as you may know the usual enemies are goombas redgreen koopas and hammer bros correct
well there are some new ones here
there are yellow and blue koopas and football players among others
there are new items the feather and p balloon
there are many different environments
one level may be aquatic the next may be in a cavern the next on a bridge
you also have new actions to see such as yoshi eating koopas and breathing fire or laying an egg that may hatch into a up
so greatthe sound is soso
yes the music is new
however it can get rather repetitive
annoying repetitive in fact
nevertheless each environment has its own music and that music may change upon entering a different situation
it might take something like a boss or an item to do that though
the sound comes through pretty clearly though
there are also some new ones such as the flying sound the yoshi squeal or the sound of one of those football players running
eventually youll find yourself trying to get that radio nearby though
anywho that may take some time to actually happen youre fine once you winit can take a while to win
however there are shortcuts
using said shortcuts i can win in mere hours
playing regularly may take you several days to a week
to finish all levels it may take the rest of the month
to entirely finish dragon coins and all it can take several months to half a year at most
it can take a while
after completing it it is okay to replay it over to give yourself some more challenges
on the other hand you can try to get  points
your choiceyep super mario world is great on either the nes or game boy advance
with decent graphics and some side quests why not
sure it may not be too good for those more accustomed to d gaming but even they can get the hang of this and enjoy it easily
you may as well buy it mario fans
trust me you will like it over and over again just as much as the first time you played itwhat a powerful game to introduce the world to the super nintendo
super mario world features a world map that is an upgraded version of the one introduced in super mario bros  there are a ton of hidden levels and short cuts hidden around the world and multiple ways to beat many of the stages
a completion percentage tells you how much of the game you have cleared for each save file
mario can still fly and shoot fireballs but now he also gets an assortment of colored dinosaurs called yoshis to ride around onno joking around this game is straight up perfection
there are better games more fun games but no game i have played was so flawlessly executed as mega man x  from the very first level to the very end you are presented with crisp and detailed graphics absolutely flawless controls and music that to this day i have much of on my ipodthe opening stage is level design at its best to hear it put more eloquently look up sequelitis on youtubethe bosses are varied and well designed with similarly varied attack patterns you have to master to surviveoh yeah and the controls as i have previously mentioned are perfection
it is entirely possible though difficult to beat the game this game without taking any damage
with practice this game is more masterable than any game i have playedplay this gamemega man x the first in the series combines the best of the original mega man series while fusing it with its own futuristic style
this is one of the first super nes games i ever played and will forever be one of the best
the music graphics and storyline all of it is superb the quotryu cheatquot in this was a nice touch
while future x games were good up until x none of them ever quite had the charm that this one possesses maybe it was intended to quotpass the bannerquot from the original series onto its next generation so to speak
a musthavenow this is an action gameat the time of mega man xs release back in  i didnt think the game was as great as i do now
at the time i was so concerned with what the future of video gaming had in store that i didnt give much notice to quality and instead focused on what video game companies were doing to make games look more realistic
so even though i thought the graphics in the original mega man x were quite good at the time the release of donkey kong county was just around the corner and the graphics in that game had me so amazed and stunned that suddenly the graphics in any other game looked inferiortoday looking back to more than  years ago i can now safely say mega man x looks pretty good
it still looks a little dated too unfortunately especially compared to mega man x
but graphics arent important here this is an action game darn it
when i play an action game i want to go around shooting a lot of things
and im happy to report that all the levels in mega man x have a ton of enemies to shootthe armored armadillo stage alone has more enemies mostly bats than any stage in any other mega man game
the spark mandrill and chill penguin stages have tons of enemies too
even the introduction stage which was weak and emptylooking in x and x will have you excitedly jumping around shooting everything that walks or flies into your path
all the stages have a substantial amount of enemies
the stages in mega man x and x look empty and dull compared to the ones in the original x  this is the number one reason the original mmx is my favorite of all the x games on the super nes
capcom threw in as many enemies in each level as they possibly could including the sigma stages and thats what i like to seemega man x also has the best music of all the x games
you can easily remember and hum all the music in the game
some of the themes are slightly weaker than others but nothing ever reaches over to the boring side
every piece of music is at the very least pleasant of course getting into the whole robotic mega man atmosphere helps to really appreciate it hehe
my personal favorite themes are the password screen theme touching and sad the lonely highway theme when you beat the game and mega man is walking to the left and the jazzydance theme that plays immediately after that the screen where a computer or tv is shown in the backgroundthe bosses are really fun to fight too
chill penguin has a lot of different attacks including shooting ice and jumping at you spark mandrill will shoot sparks and swing around from the ceiling flame mammoth shoots fireballs and jumps around sting chameleon drops thorns on top of you and attacks with his tongue etc
and get this every time you turn on the game the bosses attack you differently
for example if one time you play the game and the first thing spark mandrill does is jump at you the next time you play the game the first thing he might do is throw electric at you
you never know what will happen and that helps make the game less predictable and more enjoyableexpect to see the coolest mega man x weapons
there are two extremely powerful weapons called storm tornado and fire wave which make dashing through the levels a breeze
these two weapons happen to take out most enemies in a matter of seconds
all the weapons in the game are awesome even though the electric spark and rolling shield are fairly weak they are pretty fun to mess around with
capcom was never able to create such cool weapons in a mega man game againand finally capcom got it right
whats the it you ask
instead of making an entirely new stage where you have to refight the  maverick bosses in this game the  maverick bosses are spread out through each of the three sigma stages
i figure if capcom is going to make you fight those bosses again at least make doing so as interesting as possible
and they didoverall action games dont get more exciting than this and i recommend picking up a copy of this game
so addicting youll want to play through the game hundreds of times like me
i could talk about the game endlessly
pick it up
pleaseone of the best opening games of all time a side from the difficulty being a little easy this game is flawless this game may have the best video game music ever great visuals perfcet control i highly recomend this gamethis game is so hype
the controls are super smooth the story is cool
for a snes game and the graphics are so colorful and clear
anyone with a snes should have this game along with mario and zelda
a snes gemafter  mega man games on the nes capcom was ready to move on and rather than simply continue the series they came up with an alternate take on mega man himself
in  mega man x was released and they introduced a brand new mega man series that made its debut on the snes
it was a breath of fresh air for the popular franchise and was a major hit among gamers and video game criticsa brand new series means a brand new story and it goes something like thisbefore dr light passed on he made a new kind of robot that can think and make decisions on its own
but he felt the world wasnt ready to witness this breakthrough so he sealed it away in a capsule
many years later another scientist uncovered and released the robot
after being blown away from what it can do he tried to duplicate the technology on a group of robots he made and they turned against him
the new robot mega man x must now defeat these robots and their leader sigma before they take over the worldas mega man x you explore  themed stages modeled after the boss reploids
beat each one and you collect their main weapon so you can use to defeat enemies and other reploids
as you get closer and closer to sigma you can also collect items health and weapon upgrades scattered throughout the game
just like the nes mega man games you receive a password after you defeat a reploid or if you use all your lives to write down and continue your progress laterthe pros everything
what a way to update mega man and spin off an entire new series at the same time
they kept the core basics of the nes mega man series and threw in new characters new story and new graphics sounds and music
beating the game is half the fun and so is looking for the various heart upgrades and weapon upgrades to your armor suit
and to add icing on the cake the game had a secret armor upgrade that was a nod to capcoms other popular franchise street fighter
it made such a huge impact that two more sequels were made exclusively for the snes
great great game overallthe cons with a new series comes the realization that none of the characters from the nes series make any appearance whatsoever
mega man x on a whole is a tough game to beat but only because the difficulty level spikes through the roof during the last few stages especially when fighting sigma
the battle alone made or broke gamers who reached to that point so either you celebrated with jubilation as you watched the ending or cursed out its name in pure frustrationif youre a true mega man fan then you know what im talking about as far as playing this great game
it was a refreshing new spin on the mega man franchise and gamers everywhere loved it
for those who havent tried it yet you absolutely must if you have any interest in playing classic mega man titles
you can track down a used copy for your snes search for a used copy of the mega man x anniversary collection for ps or gamecube or download this title for the wii via the virtual console service for  points 
either way it is worth it and a true classic game that belongs in anyones game collection
i highly recommend you check it outi have written a review about this game years ago in bad taste so i have come back to give this game a fairer reviewmega man is a series that has begun in  with its selftitled entry and has progressed to the snes in  this gameis amazing in many different aspects
the soundtrack is very beautiful especially the chill penguin stage i cannot fathomhow any composer can be capable of creating such a beautiful soulful soundtrack
the sound effects are amazing and the controlsare very responsive
however this game is very difficult but with enough practice you can beat it
ive beaten it after tries on the final boss but i have defeated him and its worth it for the ending
the graphics have aged very wellconsidering its release in  the sprites are very colorful and the backgrounds are extremely detailed to the core whichkeeps the player going
overall i very highly recommend this game to any mega man fan you will not be disappointedthis is a good clasic game for snes
its pretty hard actually infact i think that x may be easyer then x
but downsides are u cant duck or dash in the air witch makes some parts hard
so if your looking for a challeng get this game its fun and its a good collectible
the final boss isnt that hard but takes a few tryes
now you can only be x theres no zero and no saber
so if you like zero so much dont get this game get x instead
this is the st megaman game ive ever played so it was realy hard
but to a guy thats bin playing megaman games for a long time its not so hard
so wat more can i say besides just get this gamei didnt buy this online i bought mega man x at a local store but at any rate what is there to say that has not been said about mega man xthis game what got me into mega man in the first place
if you asked me if i heard or played a mega man game i would simply say no
blasphemy right
well i bought a retron  which i wrote a review on which you can find later i reviewed the red console
with the retron  i bought mega man x because i thought it would be a good game to get plus it was  right there
i slapped this game in and i never wanted to get away from the system
it has a simple learning curve and everything about x is awesome the pacing the music even the graphicsi love how i got my brother whos  so he never play any nes or snes games only n and beyond got into the game as well
although its super funny to see him get frustrated playing these games it brings fond memories of me playing super nintendothis game is worth having in your collection
you will do yourself the disfavor by not buying this because youre missing out one arguably the best mega man game ever
buy itin my opinion this is not only the best mega man x game but possibly the best mega man game of all time
its extremely fun and challenging an absolute masterpiece
the best part is that its also very cheap so if you have an snes then by all means buy this nowi first spotted this title at blockbuster video on sale brand new unaware that there was even such a title
needless to say i harriedly scooped it up and walked steadfastly to the counter to pay
got it home and i was pleasantly surprised with the new directionat first i thought that the x was roman numeral for  thinking that  other titles had been released sincemm without me knowing it and then i realized that x is simply the name given to this new mm model
anyway enough minutaethis title is solid
x introduces the ability to acquire different armors and varios vital upgrades such as rocket boosts for xs feet an improved mega buster and helmet
in fact some ares in specific stages cannot be accessed unless you are in possession of one of these advanced upgrades
this series also introduces the ability for x to scale walls a necessary new twist for some areasthe other major departure from the original series is that your main antagonist is no longer dr wily this time it is a sinister reploid named sigma as in the last letter of the greek alphabet
also the robot masters no longer have the man suffix ex flame mammoth chill penguin which is actually cool
the battles are also varied as opposed to the initially predictable battles of years passed most of the bosses have two different types of attacks that they use ex storm egale dives from the sky and shoots a horizontal tornadolike wind gust when he is land bound
this game also marks the first appearance of the dynamic ally zero as well as the new ride armor which allows x to pilot a headless robot with huge arms and hands allowing him the ability to break stuff and access areas that the normal x couldntanother great addition is the incorporation of heart containers
these containers serve to increase your vitality ever so much about  bars
there are  to find in all and locating them only adds to the fun factor and advanced gameplay
there is a secret power up familiar to those of you who are street fighter fans buti wont spoil it for you here
its a secretanyway just go get this game if you dont already own it
or pick up mega man x collection for the th generation systems
its a gemone of the best video games for snes
the look and gameplay is great
jump and shoot suggest buying this gamemega man x is a spectacular snes game
i used to play it all the time when super nintendo was popular so i decided to buy another copy on amazon and fire it back up
for snes the graphics are comparable with some of the best games
the music on this game is sensational some of the tunes will be stuck in your head for years
the controls are easy to use and will take repeated plays to master but work well for the game
the replay value to a mega man fan or to an snes fan is very high
ive played it through many times and still find the end challenging but very possible to beat
one thing that sucks is you have to remember saving on cartridges was still pretty highspeed at this time and was normally only used on rpgs so you will have to enter a password or look one up online to pick your game back up
still i would strongly recommend thisby all the gaming gods where the hell did this come from
extreme amounts of praise should be given to the mighty inafking for taking his beloved mega man franchise and redoing it in a darker harsher and far more serious way
since we were all raised on the classic series leaping into what mega man x has to offer wasnt nearly as bad as it couldve been but nothing prepared us for what was insideincredible graphics chaotic action amazing level designs power armor upgrades plentiful hidden items a dark and serious storyline reusable energy subtanks and some of the best boss designs and weapons any mega man game would have at that point and the whole using animals as a body scheme thing was a fantastic idea
there is really nothing thats lacking in this title in any way and as it stands this can be considered not only one of the best mega man and snes titles but clearly one of the best games ever madethis game starts off the legendary x series and man oh man is it ever fun to meet everyone for the first time
this is like classic action but capcom but it in an interesting way
for example they have powerup capsulesmm rulzalso be sure to pick up the new mega man artbooks for the x series and the regular seriesthey are limited so get them todaythis games does star wars justice
if you thought star wars for nes gameboy and gamegear was great you aint seen nuthin yet
awesome graphics awesome music complete with excellent renditions of the music from the films original score awesome sound effects and unbelievably great gameplay
its tough to decide which snes star wars game super star wars super esb super rotj is bestid say super star wars and super esb tied for  and super rotj my least fave even though its great as well
super star wars is super funi remember this from when i was growing up
this is equally fun and challenging
any s kid will definitely enjoy it
i highly recommend itthe empire stikes back is a sweet game
in this game you get to play princess liea wich is cool
and you get to face darth vader for the first time
this is a sweet game
any star wars fans should own itif you liked this game check out all of the star wars gamesthe super star wars games are amazing licensed games for the snes
the gameplay is excellent the controls are fluent and it feels really good when you hit an enemy
its awesome sidescrolling actionthe games are extremely tough however even on easy setting
i even think theyre tougher than castlevania on nes which i have beaten
ive been getting my butt kicked constantly by enemies
but the difficulty is rewarding and makes you want to keep tryingthe super star wars games are excellent additions to any game collector especially if they love star warsit reminds me of my toddler days
i like the colors
every game has some sort of different art in it
this game should be bought firstsuper star wars released in  and still one of the best  bit games for the snes
graphics control gameplay and fun factor all rate the above  stars
adjustable difficulty makes the game fit your playing ability
a must own for snes ownersthis game is unbelievably good for a game made over ten years ago and the more amzing thing is that it is still fun to play nowadays not necessarily because of graphics which are really good for  years ago almost but because of the great gameplay and wide selection of characters not all human in fact only a couple are making it a lot more fun with a variety of distinct characters
there is no game like this one
you might say mortal kombat is but thats just the gameplay not the characters and cool moves you can do with thembuy this game if you have snes
it is easily one of the top  for sneskiller instinct was a really good game
the home version was a pretty good translation of the arcade smash and the game didnt get old as quickly as other fighting gamesthis game took the bar up to  after ki almost every other fighting game came up with some sort of combo system
some not as impressive as ki but still the combo system was adopted and to this day very used by most games because lets face it the combos add another dimension to the game
instead of a whalloping onehit move that hurt like hell you could unleash vicious combos that if done properly could wipe your opponent across the screeni think one of the only problems with ki on the home system was the same problem with the arcade version
it was to complicated for a lot of gamers
a lot of people could not get the combo system down and i will admit certain characters had some difficult ones
you really had to know the combo system to win at kibut once you got decent you didnt have to be stand up good all the time trust me i got lazy in a lot of matches it was one of the most fun games you had played
i believe this was on of the first games that you could play on the short lived snes modem hook up
with the modem hook up you could play with your friends on the other side of the country
but now we have the internet so its not that big of a dealki is a keeper
id get it while you can
if its still not for you than maybe the street fighter ot mk series is for youfirst of all i mean no other fighting game matches this one in replay value due to insane combos of which there are many different variations great quotno mercyquot finishing moves and a great cast of characters
i was a fan from the moment i played it for the first time and  years later it is still without a doubt my favorite game of alltime
do not be mistaken though i am not saying all of the other fighters out there are badstreet fighter mortal kombat are also  star fighters but when killer instinct hit the arcades there was nothing like it at least in my opinion
the graphics were beautiful the combos were amazing and it seemed like an all around original gameother reviewers might have you believe this game rips off the others but nothing could be further from the truth
sure they all share similarities but killer instinct was the first to develop this complex combo system consisting of linkers autodoubles and enders not to mention the ultra combo
to me the ultra is the greatest concept of alltime as far as fighting games are concerned
it is a move performed at the end of a combo that adds many more hits to give a greatlooking combo to finish off your opponent
there are also combo breakers to stop your opponent from performing a combo on you
so by now you should be able to understand that this game takes a lot of practice to get good at
learning the combo theory mastering each characters moves and getting comfortable with each characters style is hard work but with enough practice will be rewarding once you know your stuff
there are  great characters to choose from each with their own background level and depending on the location you can knock your opponent off of buildings
it has pretty decent music to boot giving a great game experiencein my opinion one of the best games you could own for the super nes
so if you are a fan of fighting games or own a super nes try this one out
you can find it for very cheap these days so it is definately worth picking up if you see it around
you will either hate this game and never want to play it again or you will be hooked instantly and develop an addiction to the style this game presentskiller instinct is a great game and one of my favorite super nes games the controls are perfect the gameplay is flawless and the graphics are some of the best i have seen on the super nes a super nes game library isnt complete without this game buy it while you still canthis awesome fighting game came free with the snes my mother bought for my brother and myself many years ago
unfortunately she would only let us play the game once a week for one hour because of the violence
we loved the game so much but for some reason probably because we were tired of only being able to play once a week we ended up selling it to our neighbor and never saw it again
however i recently ordered it from amazon so i can relive the thrilli am not disappointed
although its been many years since ive played killer instinct it holds its own even against modern fighters like mortal kombat armageddon soul calibur ii and guilty gear xx accent coreeach character has several special moves at their disposal and they have quickmediumfierce punches and kicks
the combos you can link are absolutely insane and unlike any i have ever seen
there are also no mercies which are like the fatalities of mortal kombat that can be used for a really cool finish once your opponent is on their last breath
you can also perform ultra combos that reach over  hits in a row at a minimum
also ultimate combos are executed when you do a regular combo put the opponent to zero hp at which time you can still continue the combo if you so choose and then perform the no mercy at the end
the smooth motions are fun to watch as you string a variety of moves together to perform insane assaults on your opponentthe graphics are awesome for the snes
the characters look really cool and the enviornments are beautiful
killer instinct has some great music too
if you get the cd with the game killer cuts youll be able to hear betterfleshed out version of the songs
it doesnt get any betterthe game supports an arcade mode in which you fight all of the characters in succession and ultimately fight the boss of the game eyedol
a training mode is available as well as  player mode and a tournament mode for multiple players
there are  difficulty levels but none of them are particularly easy
this game is definitely for skilled gamers or those who are willing to put in the effort to learn the game
from the first opponent in the arcade mode you have to put up a serious fight to attain victoryi love how complex the combo system is and the challenge level although sometimes frustrating really motivates me to get better and better
if you want a deep fighting game with great mechanics cool characters and is a true classic then this game is for you
this was a gem that no fan of fighting games should pass upthis game had more combos then mortal kombat it should have been remember now
i wish they were still making games of this on ps
you can make the fighters fight faster by holding down all the buttons when you pick your fighter and when they have on the screen your fighter vs the computer to tell that it worked it will make a punching sound
the computer always tell you how many combos you made in other words how many hits
the most hit is the altra which has  hits thats the finishing one
my favorite fighters are spinal fulgore b orchid jago combo thunder saberwolf raptor cinder
this game makes the street fighter games on super nes look like a pre school gamerare had a pretty good firsttime streak with their games
they mastered platforming in both d and d with donkey kong country and banjo kazooie stperson shooting with goldeneye kartracing with diddy kong racing and of course d fighting with killer instinctki plays foremost like street fighter with a dash of the extreme violence of mortal kombat
what makes it stand out is the combo system which delivers ridiculous amounts of damage in flashy style
the whole package is delivered in donkey kong countrystyle rendered graphics and a cdquality soundtrack based in eurobeats a music cd came packed in with original versionsthe graphics arent quite as good as the original arcade but are commendable
there is also quite a bit of substance beneath the flash you can get lucky and pull off coollooking combos through button mashing but skilled players have a definite advantage over the rookies
if you like d fighters this is a nice alternative to street fighter and mortal kombat
also try the n sequelthis game was awesome for its time
it was visually amazing the sounds were sharp and realistic and everyone was unique
if you used the cheat you could unlock the two headed boss eyedol
that made the game experience even more fun
the cd it came with has awesome tracks to play as well if you manage to find one with iti can understand if youre a mortal kombat fan that may be a bit upsetting but its still mk a good fighting game and a great portthis is what is said when you are victorious
tthis game rocks this game started it all
i think if mortal kombat wasnt envented there would be no good fighting games out there
this game rocksif you liked the game then check out all of the other mk games movies books or cds out theremortal kombat is a fighting game from  created by ed boon and john tobias
it is one of the first popular fighting games
the game has fun battles that are fast paced
this snes version of the game is less violent than the arcade version
it censors the blood and replaces the fatalities with less violent finishing moves
i am totally fine with these changes though
the game is pretty fun and is much easier than other fighting games at the time
though it still has some hard parts
the game was so popular that they did a film adaptation in if you wanna play a classic fighting game then try out mortal kombatgreat game the one that started one of the best fighting series on super nintendo
if you like fighting games that are cheap to buy with a lot of combos and gore this is for youthis game provided me with my first fatality and ive been playing it ever since
easy enough to manage without the fatalities and easy enough to play without tying your fingers in knots mk was the beginning of a franchise and as you can see the series gets better and better
this one has not lost its appealto rival street fighter ii and its success this game comes out and starts up a huge controversial topic about violence in video games
when it was ported to consoles several versions didnt have the gore
the super nintendo game was one of them
what
you dare criticize an awesome fighting game just because there wasnt blood
what greedthe gameplay is pure oneonone fighting
you can choose from a number of fighters i choose subzero and then you battle onward from fighter to fighter
eventually youll get to the endurance rounds which let you face against the defeated fighters but you must face  under one go
that is what makes the game stand outthe graphics are as great and faithful to the original arcade versionsi can say the same for the sound and music qualityoverall its a really good fighting game that shouldnt be ignored
even without the bloodthis is a rad game
i enjoy the combos you can make
everything is alright in this game
dont play it too longdoom is without a doubt one of the best games ever made and created the fps genre
the character designs are excellent for the time along with the graphics despite the fact it was released in  the gameplay still shines even on its console debut
the gore is still nicely done along with its creative weapons
no other moment in my time as a gamer has been more special than when i discovered the chainsaw on the game and killed many enemies with it
some of the challenges are still difficult to this day along with the bosses like an enemy that takes  shots to kill
and its still kinda creepy
if you never played the game that helped create your favorite fps games do yourself a favor and find a copy of this amazing gameoh man this game is just great
the best sound out of any other doom and considering it is for the snesthe graphics arent bad either but if you just got done playing playstation  you will be suffering from a collosal eyesore
this game brings back the joy of releasing anger onto monsters with a shotgun hey its a guilty pleasure
just get itnow if i had the choice yes the pc version of doom is superior to this
however
when this came out back in the s a lot of us didnt have pcs
and if we did they werent gaming pcs
its not like today where every pc has software installed upon purchase that can play most games
back in the day you had to install extra graphics cards  misc software to get games to run correctly
it was just a lot easier for the rest of us to pick up the port
and that we did
while the graphics are pretty ugly by todays standards this is still a very playable game
and for those who can appreciate it a ton of fun
also for those of us with a larger snes collection that bright red cartridge is pretty badass p  you never have to look far for doomthis game is crazy weird
the game play is different but it is something you need in your collection
the red game makes it look cool  toofantastic
obviously after  years the game is going to look a little dated but still plays excellent
one of the most influential games of all time and on my favorite console of of all time
count me in
i actually prefer this version above pc because i play with game controllers very rarely with a mouse and keyboard
if you own a snes and dont have doom yet i would recommend it
not too many fps on the snes but this one is a good buythis was purchased as a gift for my daughter
she will really enjoy having this in her game bank
thank youbrings back memories
loved this game for computer and it was great on snes also
gled to have this back in the collectionthis should be a collectors item because not only did they recreate sim city for super nintendo but they added some nice features to make it nintendos own game like statues of mario and bowser as godzilla
you are the newly elected mayor of a plot of dirt which you must turn into a massive city with  quotsimsquot people
as the mayor you must face issues like riots traffic polution crime and natural disasters like tornados fires floods and even bowser coming to destroy your city
this is a pretty basic game you make roads make zones which grow to buildings and connect them all with power lines and a power plantthis was my first exposure to the sim city franchise as i didnt have a computer until college
loved it
learned about problem solving how do you keep crime low taxes low unemployment low and your approval rating high
lots of experimenting with zones and city gifts
spent many hours playing this over one summer in middle school and learned a lot
and when i got tired of buildinghad a lot of fun blowing up my city with earthquakes plane crashes and tornadoesamazing i had this game many years and i liked it so much that i still play it a lot
it is a great valueespecially for the price and it is cool to design your own city and how it works
i also recommend buying simcity that game is even better than this oneforget about contra  super mario rpg and super metroid  if you want to play a great simulator game look no further than simcity for the snes
this was when simcity was simple and great not clunky and annoying  looking at you simcity this game also marked the first appearance of the greenhaired madman mr wright  the unofficial mascot of simcity
this game is usually pretty inexpensive so do not hesitate to pick this gem upi love this game
it was my favorite  years ago and when i purchased this again i found it just as absorbing as when i was a kid
it was so worth getting
its much simpler than the modern day sim city games but i find that the simple stuff is sometimes the best stuff
they dont mention the kiss method for nothing
when i compare the old pc version of simcity to the snes version there is no comparison
the snes version rocks the house on this one
even the manual is fun to read and has little storylike lines to it with dr wright leading the way with his iq of  apparently
the alltime best simcity hands down
dont have a super nintendo to play this on
get oneright after ko
ing the first boxer i knew super punch out was a great gamefirst of all the first boxer in career mode is very easy but after that every boxer has a different skill that you will have to figure out how to counter for example raging bulllikes to do his bull charge on you and if you dont counter it he will knock you out in one punchthis game is great for a  bit system i have had this game for  years and i still play it because it is one of the best boxing games to ever hit super neswhen i first got it i assumed it would be a boxing game that would be fun but get old fast but alas i was wrong instead of being fun for five minutes it has been fun for five good yearsthis game is rare and old so if you whant it you better get yourself a copy before you will never find it anywhere again and than you will be crying because you had a chance a few months ago to buy it but now it is nowhere to be seenawesome game totally beats the nes classic
this was truly an amazing game and fun to play even now
even now i can still beat everyone is  seconds or less gotta love itthis is a total classic as it brings the original nintendo game into better light with far more competition challenge and cartoon violence
you are the boxer quotlittle mackquot or quotlittle joequot one of the two and you must work your way up through the boxing circuit by ofcourse fighting in bouts finally getting to one of the titles
i recommend renting it first before playing it because i am sure its not for everyonesuper punch out comes from a long line of nintendo games thats easy to learn how to play but challenging enough to keep you entertained for hours
the first fight teaches you the basics  punching blocking dodging and the variations on the super punch
soon youll get so good you almost feel sorry for gabby jaythen the challenge kicks in with the next person
as with the original punch out this game requires the gamer to learn the patterns of their opponent
but unlike the original punch out you can be aggressive and beat the holy heck out of them without needing to only counterpunch after dodging
this makes super punch out a step above the original by farthe graphics were good for its time
dont expect realistic graphics when playing this game
just as the cover it resembles some sort of cartoon with every character existing larger than life
but this is normal for nintendo at that time
the games just goofy fun so the graphics reflect thatmy only minor complaint on the game is the lack of rounds
the gamer only has one round to destroy hisher oppponent
fortunately this is more than enough time
but still i enjoyed the three rounds from the original punch outthe game will not take very long to beat and it has some good replay value
if you have the chance purchase itthe sprites are colorful and detailed
gameplay is fantastic
each fighter has their own unique move set
it takes time to figure out each fighters attack pattern and how to counter attack
the soundtrack is great but could be more varied
going for the fastest finishing time for each fighter keeps replay value high
this is one of the best games for the snesthis game is quite a bit easier to complete than the nes version
its not quite as classic or memorable as the original but its still a great game
its really fun to figure out how to beat each of the characters
after some practice you can get good enough to score some very quick knockouts
its darn fun trying to get a new fastest knockout time for each characterthe rapidpunching option is certainly a marked improvement over the nes version and i rarely shy away from using it
i love using the rapidpunches i love beating the goofy characters and therefore i love this gamewhile this probably is not the best game for the snes it is very simple and basic good for a kid trying to get the feel of wrestling games on the snes for the first timewith this game you will want to pin him as soon as you can fast pace awesome graphics replayable over all a really good gamethats what i said as i was playing this game  wow
everything about this game screams quality
heres the story you are a crusader of light that falls in love with a nun and then the next night you are  quotembracedquot and are thrusted into the world of vampire the  masqueradethe graphics are the best ive seen in a long time  especially on the characterstheir features and faces are so smooth that  you could hardly tell they were made of polygonsthe sound with the  proper eax or ad supported card match the environmentsand the plot
it plays like a drama that shakespeare himself wouldve wrote
the love  scenes between the main character and the nun are especially moving  because they are both bound by their religious beliefs and cannot be  lovers
as you can imagine after the character is turned into a vampire  then it really gets tragic
your characters life spans from  ad to  the present
now im not going to give any more plots away
ive read  the rpg books that this game is based on and ive always wanted to try out  vampire the masquerade but i could never get into it because of the steep  learning curve and quotpoliticsquot of the game
well vtmr does a  great job of introducing this world to beginners like me and with a  quotstorytellerquot mode even i can make my own stories and  campaignsoverall this game is a must buy for veterans of the pencil  amp paper vampire and for pc gamers looking for a solid rpg
heres  hoping that the upcoming werewolf the apocolypse heart of gaia is as good  as thisdo you like vampiresdid you ever wish to become onehow many games do you know where you can feel what it is like to be a vampireredemption brings us to the xii century i believe where our first and main character  knight christoff is falling in love with a nun anezka who saved his life after he was terribly injured during the warbut the things arent that simple  at the time while christoff is killing some vampireswho terrorized prague he becomes an object for a few different vampire clansyes vampires arent just some savage creatures they live like people in different groups clans and laws for the further introduction to that i suggest you to read some info on the tabletop game vampire the masqueradeso one of the vampire clans a good one decides to make christoff an immortal vampire a part of them before he gets killed by the evil othersthat causes our hero even more troubles since it is totally impossible for a vampire and a nun to be together foreverand he wanders off into the dark nightbut anezka doesnt give up leaves the monastery and goes on the search for christoffand of course ends up captive in the opposite vampire groupso our goal is to find herbut thats not going to be easyduring the game cristoff meets other vampires who willingly join him but you never know who to trust the vampire world is full of traitors and intrigues as wellthe gaming process consists of two partsthe first one is located in prague and vienne still old timesand the second part is londonny just before the coming new year pros great plot  different endings depending on the characters humanity levelbeautiful music and voiceover with different accentscons  other characters in the party tend to act pretty stupid sometimes walking in the wallsor not really helping much in the battlesthe original masquerade idea is a bit wrong since the characters from different clans dont have their special magicthe saving system is upsetting the game saves automatically everytime you enter a new levelbut the enemiesthings dont reappear when you reenter the levelthe gameplay is point and click no not a questbut you have to click for everythingin total it is a good vampire action rpg for people who love vamps and good stories with a twistvampire redemption is an excellent rpg set in white wolfs world of darkness
get the patch
available at a lot of sites including activisions
without the patch id have to give it around a  mainly because out of the box the game has a number of gameplay problems the biggest is not being able to save in the game anywhere other than your haven
this is annoying and hurts the game because you constantly have to replay dungeons
with the patch you can quicksave at anytime when monsters arent nearbyethe games graphics are beautiful with excellent lighting effects and player models
your characters are large and really show off the time and effort spent on them with every detail rendered
the size of many of enemies is enormousthe story follows a crusauder named christof as he deals with becoming a vampire and searching for his lost love anestka
with a few twist thrown in including one extreme one
the story is solid but half way through i was wishing for a more complicated plot than just finding anesca
i was impressed with how the designers incorporated the history and clan relationships from the vamp masquerade rpg
although it does seem unlikely that in a city the size of say praque their would be around a hundred vampiresthe music is well done and changes as you move through history
starting out as medeival and moving into techno
the combats handled much like diablo so you its mostly point and click repeatedly
overall the combats fast paced and entertaining but it has its problems
your other party members have issues with blood use
they burn their disciplines quickly and often usually on that rat that you can kill with one hit
also later in the game theres not really any reason to take your other party members with you through a dungeon since your such a powerhouse
the game is real time so using disciplines in the heat of battle can be difficult hot keys are a mustspoiler
more time should been spent balancing the disciplines magesty is grossly overpowered at lv
the discription says that the enemies look at you in awe and thats just what they do at lv is stand their in look at you while your hasted and attacking with the blood drinking sword
i hope this wasnt intended since most other disciplines are so weakoverall vampire redemption is a must buy rpg and definately worth your time also the price has dropped a lot so its easy on your walletthe graphics are immence the best ive ever seen the levels look amazingly real and the explosions and weapons fire is first rate
the ambiant sound is very realistic to and the voice acting is great sevens voice isnt jeri ryans but you can get a patch
the game is as close as you will ever come to being on  voyager its not like most games where the missions come one after the other you actualy get to walk around voyager and talk to people
the guns are great each one hase two firing modes so attacks are never boring and some of them are actualy on star trek
the gameplay is great to very high quality the controls are very easy to use you can even use the mouse for exact targeting
you cant order around your teamates but they take queues from your actions
the multiplayer part of the game is very good to tons of maps to play in and three game modes freeforall team play and capture the flag
this is one of the best games i have ever played and for sure the best firstpersonshooter i highly recomend itthe people at raven did an excellent job with this game
it utilizes the quake iii engine thus the graphics are superb
it offers both a single player story line gaming experience which quake iii is lacking and a deathmatchtournament team deathmatch and capture the flag game play like quake iii
it is like having two games in one and as a matter of fact the game puts two icons on your desktop to separate the two types of games
as modmapmodel makers get geared up on this title there should be some very interesting things you can add to the basic version
in fact there are a handfull of new maps already available
moreover there are many internet servers running this game so you can indulge in internet play
the weapons are pretty cool each has a secondary fire mode but too many are difficult to use well in the heat of the fire fight and require you to be on target
not enough of the weapons cause collateral damage
i actually like this title better than quake iiithe history of star trek games has been a long convoluted and remarkably inconsistent one
some games have been horrible most have been remarkably average but a few have been exceptionally well madethis game is the best first person trek experience ever made and klingon academy is the best starship combat simulation ever made
both are utterly immersive tremendous fun and draw you into a storytelling experienceto be fair i was never a fan of voyager its my leastfavorite trek series
but this game doesnt suffer in any way for that as far as im concernedthe game is set late in voyagers run seemingly in the last two seasons though im not certain exactly when
voyagers command staff decides that they need a specialized team to deal with extreme situations instead of sending the command crew in to get kidnapped every time
this is an extra duty for these crewmembers and some of the new hazard team are characters previously seen on the show while others are entirely new
the only character from the show you really interact with on a regular basis is tuvok since the hazard team reports to him
youll occasionally deal with other characters as well but for the most part youre on missions with the rest of the hazard team and will be on your ownthe setup is pretty basic the voyager is trapped in an region of space that saps power from all ships for harvesting of both technology and biology
there are other survivors of this trap in there including a scavenger base consisting of several known species plus two major new alien races  and then you get to start facing down the real force behind this trap
and yes there are borg involved as well you get to face them on more than one occasionthe hazard team has special uniforms suits with energy fields and selfhealing systems and a powergeneration backpack special weapons from your basic onscreen weapons to captured alien weapons to the infinity modulator which the borg are unable to defend against to some analogs to conventional weapons shotgun grenade launcher etcthis is not a runandgun all firefight game
yes there is no shortage of combat but you need to think to pause and to observe in order to succeedthis game has a sequel where the hazard team gets assigned to the newest enterprise e under captain picard
the sequel looks a bit better overall and is plenty of fun but this version remains the besttrust me ive just started replaying this recently  its a blastfyi in addition to the game itself there are also tons of thirdparty addons available online
if you like the original star trek series do a google for elite force space station k and youll find some great classic trek addons for this game for exampleimagine if you will the perfect star trek game
beautiful cut scenes seamlessly integrated between pulse racing action scenes faithful ship recreation crafty puzzles and interactive environments
the list goes on
this is the trek game everyones been waiting forthis game is a  dream
in single player mode it really is like playing the tv show
whereas only a couple of star trek games in the past have come up to this  standard eg
armada most like klingon honour guard have falled slightly  short of the mark
the gameplay is identical to half life  quake  etc
the use of the quake  engine fully recreates the starship voyagers decks  in stunning detail
the sound effects are also lifted straight from the  show and most of the actors it seems have contributed their voices to their  d counterparts
the icing on the cake is the cut scenes linking your  character of ensign monroe into the story line and the command  chainquake  style weaponry
you bet
from the simple phaser to the  anti borg gun these pack a real punch
raven have done a great jobif  you like quake half life and star trek voyager you have no reason not to  order this nowst off raven is making games that will blow you away this is cloo i like the show and this makes evry one from the show look as good it just like playing in an episode of star trek voyager the ty show this is a game you got to get the first d shooter game ive ever played was doom
since then i was an addict of these types of games hexen heretic quake duke nukem blood jedi knightyou name it until i kind of quotgrew outquot of it
i guess i just got sick of them in a way because there are just so many out there
so i never set my eye on these kinds of games again
but being a hardcore star trek fan elite force really caught my attention
i just thought quotwhat the heckquot pulled two twenties out of my pocket and took it home
i was really shocked
this game was fun
i just could not stop playing
not only did it have good graphics speed etc but it actually felt like i was part of an episode of star trek voyager
thats what made it so fun to play for me along with the heartpumping action unlike most d shooters the monsters arent those slow zombietype moaninggrowling typemonsters in this game actually scream bum rush you and tear you up
i am almost absolutely certain that any star trek fan would love this game
even if you finish the game once youd still wanna play it again
if you get bored of that then youll end up downloading all the maps provided on elite force fan sitesevery day its something new in those sites
id definitely recommend this game to trekkers out there regardless of whether or not you like d shooters or not
the demo is not enough trust mei have had elite force for years and i have to say that it is just as fun as it was when i first played the game
you really do feel like you are part of the voyager crew as the entire cast minus kes returns to reprise their roles we all know and love from the series
the story is sharp and the acting is even sharper
fighting the borg face to face is really amazing talking to the crew is even cooler
fans of star trek should love this game fans of voyager will loves this game
a must have for all my fellow trekkiestrekkersand fans who dont like the label
buy this game
a musthavegiven the history of previous games based on the star trek license i didnt have high hopes for this game
thats why i was really blown away when i finally played itwhile its not quite the ultimate fps that ut or q are it takes the best elements of these games and combines them with the best element of halflife the storythe elite force story while not entirely original is quite rich as welltold
like in halflife your character plays a pivitol role in the story and actually experiences a true character arc unlike gordon freeman imotwo criticisms first i found the physics to be a little jerky
not quite as smooth as q which is strange considering this game uses that engine
second the game play was just a little too easy the creatures werent all that challenging
even the bosses
oh and one more thing the ai of your teammates was pretty sad
they kept running in front of my line of fire and then yelling at me when i shot themthis game is the first one since halflife that like a good book i could not pull myself away from
and like a really good book its worth playing a second time throughwell i downloaded the demo played it for  minutes then came here and ordered this game
its got pretty good sound in my opinion and the best game play any first person shooter has had and tis got an awsome story line i recomend this to any fan of the fps genrewow
what an incredible game this is
the best fpc ever released in my opinion
even halflife has its job cut out against this one
superior graphics the best ai
to date and totally realistic startrek weaponry not to mention an excellent and engrossing storyline
the game is actually a difficult one to beat there are some puzzles that are very challenging
anyone who says this game is way too easy is definitely using cheats andor a walkthrough
get this game today
it is more than worth the moneyyes this is the game that has it all graphics sound multiplayer length innovation fun and its trek
yes this is a star trek game and unlike many trek games you wont be dissapointed with this amazing game
after you finish the  levels of single player multiplayer will leave plenty more
wait what am i doing
i gotta go play itnowcannot say enough good things about this
dont know why i am writing a review when so many great reviews have been written
it really is like being in an episode of the series
there are unexpected twists and turns also
they even managed to maintain the political correctness of star trek whilst allowing you to blow the hudaka out of enemiesthe weapons are great i dont know what the editorial was talking about saying the weapons were boring the weapons are great  variety utilitythe online game experience is very good
possibly better than unreal tournament and that is saying a lot
very tactical great items and teamplay and using your brain for a changeyou can download heaps of extra maps and thigns too for freenote you can play in the holodeck by yourself as well to practiceif you are a fan of star trek get itif you hate star trek absolutely hate star trek but like st person shooters get it anyway  you will like it is very very goodjust get it it is winning awards all over the place because it is truly classythis is the future of entertainment where you are actually inside the moviei have had this game for awhile
i still go back and play it once in awhile the single player version
however there is a multiplayer battle game also available
if you like the star trek voyager serious then i would suggest getting this game
however if you like first person shooter games you may still like this as well
i just recently installed this game on windows  professional bit version it runs just fine on it
even though it on the back its for windows nt sp wink
i did not set the compatibility for it either
however others might have to do just that dependingnow this game is what i call star treki love everything about it the music realistic sounds mods ai graphics this game is powered by the incredible up to date quake  arena engine
isnt great
besides the point i have had this game since december  and havent gotten time to wirte a review about itjust get this game star trek fans
it is worth iti wont spoil the story line or anything else

its addictive
you get to use strategy to complete missions
plus you get to play as the borg klingons romulans and of course the federation
has the actors from the tv shows doing voices as well
put this on your birthday or christmas list
cant wait for the next one star trek the final frontier these words are of the great history of the star trek universe
the whole concept of this world is amazing and very likableover the years many games have come out that are about star  trek and have the facts but they werent really what people were looking  for
now after so long a star trek game is now released that truly shows  how great this world is
star trek  armada is this game
it is a real  time strategy d game of the star trek universe
it expresses it very  well
you are able to pick up to  races the federation the klingon  the romulans and the borg
each race has about  special abilities and  their own units
the story line of this game is very good and it clearly  shows an expansion coming up
this is definitly a game to put on your  mustbuy listif you are a star craft or command amp conqueror fan  this the next game for youyes this is the best rts i have ever played
the controls are quite simple the concept is intreaging the graphics are blazing and sound is blasting and the game play is like none other
i was suprised at all the bland average ratings and reviews armada was getting among the game sites but when it came down to the peoples choice armada glittered
this game is simply amazing with  different races other star trek people such as cardassians jemhadar and feringi that are standing by for gaming support and multiplayer options
woa overdrive
okay look i didnt even know what genre armada was before i bought it
i was just in the store and it was 
canadian
i had  beans in my pocket so i shelled em out since i am a huge trekie i trusted that the game would be good
noticing that it was rts i was suprised and almost dissapointed but when i played the game it was far richer than any sim or action
if you have  lyin around get armada
it will take you to the far reaches of your moniter erm spacearmada is totally awesome
graphics are very well made
unlike most games  that has overhead view of the playing field you go on the level of the  playing field as space is
it is a very good star trek game and well  worth the game
for me it has tendcy to crash and lock up in game in  multiplayer mode
single player mode it never crashed or locked up
there  is also dozens of mods to add ships and plays to downloadd maps
i am  awaiting a update to fixed the bugs in it myselfwhen i got my first commodore protocomputer back in the early eighties this is exactly the sort of game that i hoped would one day be developed for home computers
if you are like me you daydreamed alot about the various starship designs and the possibility of allout fleet action between the federation and the klingon and romulan empires
well you dont have to do it in your mind anymore
not only that you also get the most overwhelming of all opponents the borg  and the chance to team up against them
plus you get ships from minor races showing up like the ferengi jem hadar cardassians etci couldnt imagine a better interface for controlling a fleet battle
it is very intuitive and smooth
and you arent forced to run around constantly micromanaging individual ships
plus you get that little cinematic screen in screen that lets you see individual shiptoship action like it was on a movie screen
a tiny little movie screen but a movie screensome reviewers have complained of technical problems and crashes ive played this game through to the end at least three times now on an outofthebox standard gateway and i havent had any problemsgood another star trek game but only now i have been taken where no man has gone before
star trek armada boasts in my opinion to be the most dominant strategy game in the trek series
i bought star trek armada last year and i am very impressed
the fmv at the beginning was something i was really impressed withi love the firing of phasers in inter galactic combat
once i adapted to the games operations i soon ranked this game as one of the better games i had and not one of those games i play a few times then tuck it away in the drawergraphics in the game with aid of a decent graphics card voodoo  pci in my case made this game really enjoyable
i first played this with a mb graphics card which was really slow but my enthusiasm for the game was so great i set all the graphical details to its bear minimum for it to operate at a good frame ratebut now i enjoy it even more
ships are rendered brilliantly as are all the little features in the galaxy maps
strange space anomalys and particals which float in space can be to your advantage or disadvantagethis game has it allmy final verdict despite this review being short is that this game is one of my must buys
and with a optional multiplayer gaming option you can battle your wits against other people around the world making the game the ultimate challenge
youll be at it for some timeno bsclock tower is a great survival horror game for the playstation
its different than resident evil very different
you do not shoot stab or blow anything up
you run and hidethis series actually predates resident evilbut followed alone in the dark and sweet home
japan only game from capcom
i love this game because it can be intense running from scissor man
the controls are click and point and take a little getting used to but overall this game is up there with resident evil  resident evil  and silent hill as one of the best in the survival horror genrethis game will keep you on your toes very happy with how well this game was taken care oflong ago in england there tells the story of a deformed monster born in the barrows castle and grew up to be a mass murdering cretin named scissorman who uses a giant pair of scissors for weapons
years later in  norway a family in a mansion was brutally murdered by the scissorman and a few witnesses like  year old jennifer and edward who were traumatized by the murders a year before
jennifer with a few other people like nolan campbell who is a reporter and assistant inspector stan gotts are running from their lives from the insidious slowwitted maniac
from norway to england they all join together to find out the mystery and how to destroy scissormanan excellent smart and truly terrifying horror thriller adventure that was released in september of  and earned a small cult following since following in the wake of resident evils success its survival horror at its finest
its a point and click game that is one of a kind for a ps game as you dont have to have a ps mouse for it
in this game you play a series of different characters in different scenarios so far as you have to survive trying to fight a maniac and even find clues which can help you on your way to live
the graphics arent impressive but the story is quite good the game is in fact influenced by halloween to dario argentos cult fave phenomena to even s slasher fave the burning this gory and terrifying game is one of my fave games since i first played it at age  when it came out
in fact its so scary i even had a nightmare about scissorsman once when i was  that it felt real and him chasing me in that nightmarethe soundtrack is definitely creepy including the atmosphere and you can get multiple alternate endings depending on how you play this game the killer himself is very much in the style of michael myers and cropsy from the burning combined
it spawned  sequels which neither can withstand the first installment so far
a movie is in the works and maybe they should do a reboot game on this which can be goodif you loved to be scared find this game and have pleasant dreams ha ha ha ha hagood puzzles and right level for kids or adults who predate the halo generation
if one of the players dies off they can restart quicklygoof troop for the snes is a prime example of coop gameplay done right
the game is a charming topdown puzzle adventure game with brilliantly simple controls and the characteristic capcom super nintendo music seen in games like super goules n ghosts and mega man 
the two playable characters goofy and max have slight differences that force you to play the game differently depending on who you play as
the gameplay is reminiscent of s the legend of zelda four sword adventures clever puzzles that let you think outside the box to solve
there is a nice difficulty curve that gently eases you in with simple puzzles and later in the game makes you stop and think how to solve the challenge presented
on the down side the music while charming can become distracting while youre thinking through a hard puzzle and a couple of times puzzles will require you to react fast before an enemy messes everything up forcing you start that particular puzzle over
on the whole the game is certainly worth the price and is a great game to play with a good friendthis game is definately a a good xmen game b a good snes game c a shining example of a good classic capcom game
you choose your mutant and each one has their own levels in which they complete the gameplay music sound and graphics are amazing for a snes game i would higly recommend this to those who love the music style of the megaman games it is present here and it rocks
and those who are fan of xmen of course
all in all a fun game me and my friends would play this all day long
each one of us would get one person and do just their stage
still never beat it thothis game is an exceptional beatemup
at times it can be very challenging but the opening stages are fair albeit difficultremember how awesome spiderman maximum carnage was
well this was kind of a clone of that game which in the end worked out wonderfully
this game is the bane of my childhood existence
i have vivid memories of begging my mom to take me to the local rental store so i could rent this gameyou see children at one time there were these stores that rented movies and video games
but like the dinosaur they slowly died off and became extinct
i remember working at one of these stores
it suckedin short get this game
its a super fun one player gamethis was purchased as a gift for my daughter and since she was home for the holiday weekend she had an opportunity to check t out
all was perfect
thank yousome like girls who are xmen fans may complain that jean grey rouge and storm were not playable characters and call these xmen games very sexest but you got psylocke  what more do you want
it would be nice to have them but jean rouge and storm would be unfair because they can fly and are too powerful
if they were included in the game developers would have to dramtically limit their powers to make them well balance with other xmen and that would piss off gamersanyways i got this game in christmas  and boy was i excited
i am a hardcore xmen fan and since many other console marvel comics games had huge flaws in the past such as silver surfer for nes and arcades revenge for snes and genesis just to name a few capcom did a wonderful job with this one here
its a side scroller beatem up game with each of the five xmen cyclops wolverine beast psylocke and gambit with unique combos powers and abilities that allows you to choose which xmen is beneficial for a certain level
it starts off when you have to go through genosia for the first several stages by fighting different clones of genosian goons alien broods brood queen tusk and finally facing apocalypse giving gamers the impression that hes the last boss until magneto taps into cerebo computer in story mode
very innovative that the first and last stages were unique for each xmen
only flaws about this game is that gameplay is a bit slow some xmens special attacks and powers eg
cyclops optic blasts and psylockes flying knee kick are slow responsive and that the game was too short and easy
a  year old can beat this game without relying on a password password will not give you the special ending of which your playable xmen reunites with other xmeni like this game alot and if youre a xmen fan who doesnt have it get it
thats all i have to say
please ignore the sequel sort of marvel war of the gems due to its simular but slow and crappy gameplayfinal fight with the xmenwhat more can you say
does more need to be said
pick it up and you wont be disappointedi got the game in perfect condition no case or anything but cant complain when the game is the real reason why you want it in the first place
dont hesistant to get this because it is a really good gamei bought this game earlier this yeari use to rent this game back when this system was popularthis game is different from a lot of fighters like mortal kombatit has strategy that involves timing moves at the right timefor examplekenryu have slowmediumand fast fireball when pressed with lightmediumand heavy punch buttonsthe problem with game is that you must have a six button controller or you will have to press start to change the kicks from the punchesplus its way more fun with the six button controllerthe graphics are  pretty close to the arcade counterpartand still look really great compared to some of the other genesis gamesi own street fighter alpha  on dreamcastso i have experience about street fighters gamesi still think even after all these years sf is one of the greatest fighters to come outor maybe its just me thinking about childhood memories of playing this game early in the morning before anyone got upthe pros close to arcade experiencecreative fighterslightmediumheavy buttons add more strategy to gameplaybeautiful backgroundsadded extra hyper mode to add to really fast experience for people with addbosses are pickable nowbefore it was just the eight fighters onlythe cons some animations are cut outmust have six button controller or it wont be funcharge moves make some fighters uneven like blanka and ehondathisi played this game a lot when it was released on sega even bought the joystick controller to more simulate the arcadei have a little story about this kinda bad but im gonna share it anywaysi was in tokyo japan a few years back and i found the sega building its like  or  floors of arcadesi stepped inside and was blown away games aging back to the s till now so you really got see a lot of the advancement madeas the games are played side by sideone one floor its all about this robots game where you are robot and you fight other robots and it looked greatso i jumped on a stack and started trying to learn my way through all the moves this little kid rolls over and drops his token in and smashes meand he has this evil mischievous face on
i smile at him the best i can so i move over one he knows what hes doing im a noob so im trying to learnso i kinda wanta get the moves down before challenging players not gonna happen he had way to much fun last round i guess and did it againok now the fer is following me so i walk over to the very dated street fight  and start playing he comes and watches for a second then kerplunkin goes the token
you think i would be mad but it was very satisfying pulling multiple perfects in a row off on this kid
i smiled big and looked down and gave him thecustomary what now bitch look he looked sad and walked awaythank you street fighter
flexthis game can keep you entertained for hours
sure i never got around to defeating m bison but thats why theres two player
in two player mode you can do handicap fun a team match also fun or just one on one still fun
lets not forget the amazing roster of fighters
my favorites have to be ryu ken chun li and dhalsim
if you have a genesis i highly recommend itcmon its better than the nintendo version
sure its not as good as street fighter  but its still a fun bargain
as soon as i get the cables for my genesis i dont know what happened to my other cables im going to start playing it againi played all the street fighters in my time but thinking back on this one it seemed to have great speed features when you go and actually tweak the settings
however i remember playing this on the genesis nomad and i got a black screen with hex code saying i performed an illegal operation
not sure what happened but i have found this to happen on the x as well and with the mortal kombat this did not happen on the genesis console which is good
killed a lot of time on this when i was younger but wish the sound was better
overall a great game
for the nomad i called sega back in the day and found ms pacman and decapattack to be the only two games known to be incompatible the list should have been a lot biggerloses only  star for the operation issue and bad sound performance  actually the sega unit itself is responsible for that all in all i believe that the sega system made this game fall short but still a near perfect gamewhen i was a kid i would play this game nonstop
it seriously brings back memories
it might not be the best of the street fighter ii console ports but its still my favoritethis game is so intense and at times kind of scary
if you play this game with the volume all the way up and the lights off you will find out why
i know many people complain about the horrible camera angles in the game but that is what makes the game so suspensful
every minute every time you come across a hallway you have no idea what will be hiding on the other side or around the corner
the controls on a keyboard at first might be tough to get used to but you will figure it out
you can play the regular game as clair or leaon in normal or diffuclt game settings
my personal favorite with the pc version is the extreme battle mode
you play from the end of the game and work your way towards the begining and you have to destroy the g virus for good
during the extreme battle you can use chris redfield and its pretty much just a point and shoot or run and gun style game as oppose to the regular style of re suspense and puzzle solving
anyways this game is a true classic and if you have a pc that is up  date then grab this game but beware this game is not for the weak at heart
its that good loldid you ever watch say friday the th and wish that somebody had packed a mac in with their camping equipment
or that laurie strode had a mossberg  gauge handy when michael myers knocked on her door in halloween
did you ever think to yourself what you could do to leatherface with a rocket launcher
isnt that just like a cannibal brings a chansaw to a bazooka fight did you ever wonder how you would behave if your survival was on the line and say oh flesheating zombies or irradiated mutant beasts were looking to chow down on you
well thanks to the sheer genius of resident evil  you no longer have to wish and wonder what it would be like to live out a horror movie
youre stuck right in the middle of oneall resident evils basically proceed from the same premise the evil umbrella corporation has developed a virus which mutates animals into horrid killing machines
because umbrella is so darn curious about its new toy the virus keeps accidentally getting loose turning ordinary pets into monsters and people into ravening zombies
in the first entry the virus was released in a small environs of a labmansion on the outskirts of racoon city this time however the germs have escaped into the city itself turning it into a apocalyptic wasteland populated by lab projects gone wrong andyoure  has a fascinating twodisc set up
in the first disc you play officer leon kennedy one of the few survivors of the rcpd who has a really bad first day on the job
leons adventure takes him from the streets of the burning city to the police station and from there through the spiderinfested sewers to umbrellas massive underground labs
along the way leon must solve numerous puzzles obtain various keys and weapons and blast or outrun a wide variety of drooling baddies that want to eat him
he also encounters sultry ada wong a playable character with a hidden agenda
in the second disc you are at the wheel of spunky civvie claire redfield who like her brother chris survivor of the first game has a talent for blasting zombie brains all over the place
although claire stomps much of the same ground as leon and not occasionally bumps into him her tasks are different and her options effected to some degree by the choices leon has made in the first half of the story
as if claire doesnt have enough problems she must also look after a kid named sherry who turns out to be the games other playable character  one too small to carry a gun
id like to let the zombies have her butin addition to the regular storyline there are some alternative options including extreme battle mode which removes the plot elements and just lets you kill away and a few bennies which can only be obtained by meeting certain standards and which allow you to add new weapons and change your characters getupsit would be easy to dismiss re as just another shootemup but it has a number of features which made it unique for its day
firstly the game is presented in the third rather than first person so that you feel as if you are watching a movie this makes the game more difficult for newcomers to play but also more like a horror flick
second the atmospherics of the game its creepy music and haunting sound effects wind dripping water creaking doors etc
truly create that horrormovie feel
third because the events of the two disks are dependent on each other the game never plays exactly the same way twice this is particularly true if you reverse the order and play claires mission first
fourth the various puzzles which present themselves make the game a challenge for the noggin as well as the trigger fingerwhat really grabs me about the re series however is not the wide variety of monsters or the action per se but the storyline
the game begins with and is occasionally interrupted with movie sequences which explain some of the backstory which heightens the feel of having been thrown facefirst into a cerebral splatter film
it is an interactive experience in the truest sense
all thats missing is zombie brains on your shoesi realize re  is now very much dated but i couldnt care less
a game either plays well or it doesnt and if it does it plays well in all seasons
in the re series capcom didnt just create a monster they handed you a chaingun and said kill itgreat game with different endings
be sure to save a lot
you can die
took a lot of memory
but it is worth it
this is second time playing it
music is melencholysplots of ways to go
many choices
do not see that very oftenan oldy but a great one for me
first time i played i thought the dame was a mutton head and in my way
i did not know i was supposed to love her
so keep that in mindthis game is so intriguing and so realistic i found myself rushing to my computer after work to play it
in this game youre free to tour the famous ship the gymnasium wireless room smoking room cabins turkish bath even the engine turbine and boiler rooms and the top of the last smoke stack
you get to meet all sorts of characters from social debutantes to a serbian revolutionist
listen to what they say
each character gives you clues that will help you solve the game
in solving the game you will perform tasks like sending a wireless developing negatives and decoding messages
it is a game that requires strategy observation and thought
try out your ideasthey may work
my advice is to save this game often as youre playing and several times at various stages so you can return to a spot when you think youve figured something out
this game is not difficult but does take time and thought
dont give up its worth it in the end
as a former history major i appreciate the period items you find on the ship including a waxcylinder gramophone which was a bit out of date even for the titanic and the lessons you get in the events that led to the first world war
you wont be able to save the titanic but you might be able to change history by altering the past
my only qualm is that the game freezes up a lot which is very frustrating when you are getting into the storyline
again i cant stress enough the need to save where youre at in the game often
i also recommend the book titanic adventure out of time hints and solutions not just to solve the game you may be able to solve it without it but as an interesting supplement to the historical and scientific themes of the game
the music and graphics are excellent
you can really lose yourself in this game
even after solving it i find myself wanting to play it again and againif youre looking for a great adventure game theres no need to look further then titanic adventure out of time
all the elements that make a wonderful adventure game are here an intriguing story great environment interesting characters to interact with and it can even make your heart pound
i have played it a numberless amount of times
this is a game that is timelessthe storythe game begins in a shabby apartment during world war ii where you an exsecret agent are still brooding over the mission you failed on the titanic decades ago
however you get another chance when the germans bomb the city and you go back in time to that fateful night onboard the titanic
your mission begins when your contact onboard instructs you to find the stolen copy of the rubaiyat of omar khayyam
and the adventure officially begins murder blackmail hobnobbing with the first class passengersyou name it
besides the main plot there are secondary plots you can get involved in which make the game all the more interesting
you can die in the game and you can also loose however if you win its a feelgood endingexcept that you cant save the titanic from sinking
at least i havent found a way toenvironmentexcept for the very first and last part the game takes place onboard the rms
titanic
this was a great environment for me since i am especially interested in the inside of the titanic
however either way it made an excellent place to set a spymystery adventure game from the luxurious grand staircase to the long silent corridors of scotland road
the interiors of the ship are surprisingly accurate despite a few errors and titanic buffs especially will enjoy visiting such places as the first class smoking room cafeacute parisien reception room and even the ships inner workings
there are a number of places at are nonaccessible or locked such as the palm court the first class dining salon and much of the second and third class areas
however there is still a large amount of space to navigate in fact you might even want to consider taking the tour so you can familiarize yourself with the ship before you play the gamethe charactersthere are live actors in this game instead of computeranimated characters
the acting is some of the best i have ever seen in a computer game and the characters are welldeveloped and believable
there are all types of people on this ship ranging from the young american couple on their honeymoon to the evil german colonelother aspects this is a firstperson adventure game you move around using the arrowkeys on the keyboard
once you get the hang of them you can move very quickly
the game also has a map of the ship and certain areas are highlighted so that you can instantly jump to them without having to run there yourself
when the ship is sinking this jumping feature is disabled the graphics in this game are good the biggest problem with them is that when you move they blur for a split second
however if there are newer versions this might be cleared up
titanic is moved forward mostly by dialogue and certain actions such as retrieving a painting unlike many adventure games today which seem to be more mysterypuzzle games
you go from one puzzle to another to another or have to spend half the playing time moving the mouse over every inch of the interface in attempt to find some infinitesimal objectas i said earlier titanic is a great adventure game and at least for me setting standards that no other adventure game has matched
hopefully the creators of the new adventure games try to follow titanics example and in the future make actual adventures instead of endless puzzlesthis is one of my favorite games of all time
i wanted it on when it first came out and my husband thought i wouldnt like it
i finally convinced him i would and got it for the computer
even now years later i still play it
it is that good
very rarely do you find a game that provides you the hours of gameplay that makes paying your hard earned money money well spent
this game does thatthe creativity involved in coming out with the zany ailments and the types of drs nurses and janitors that youll employ just brings so much to the game
micromanaging the hospital is quite enjoyable
if you can find this on the computer its even better but if you have to play it on the playstation in order to get it then do it
its well worth itdont pay the crazy high prices your seeing here online for this game
the game is no longer in production so the prices youre seeing are rd party sellers with an insane mark up on it
one way to get this game for a realistic price is if you happen to own a play station  yes even though this is a play station  game
if you own a ps just go turn it on then log into the play station store on it
in the games for sale category there is a section that says play station  classics this game is available for sale and download for just a few dollars right in there
it will download and save right to the hard drive no need for any disks
its the exact game we all played on the original play station or on old windows dos computers right down to the nurse telling everyone what to do over the pa systeman awesome classic that just never gets old no matter how many times youve played it
its one of those games you can complete put it away for  months then play it all over again and its just as fun as the first timeive had this game for years im reckoning ever since we first got a computer
i love this game
i tend to go through phases of playing it and then not playing it for months
and then i suddenly think i havent played it for ages ill have another go
im just coming out of those phases now mainly because i cant go through a level so i thought id review it
i have the pc game but what the hell i normally get as far as the levels where theres epidemics every two seconds no matter how many handymen you have wandering doing sweet f all  believe ive had up to  and i still get epidemics
ive somehow managed to get up to the level with radiation patients but once ive had one epidemic thats me the level slowly goes downhill until i get to the doctor digging gravescaught in the toilets with a naughty nurse magazinegoing past the bank etcthis game is terrific and the patients are so funny
i dont know what my favourite patient is but you see patients going around with big headsdressed like the kingno hairtransparentcompletely invisible and bright green are some of the more memorable ones
most of the patients have regular computer game symptoms so they look ordinary peoplei dont know why but theres two types of doctors and i prefer having just one of them
theres one who has afrostyle hair and one who has slightly less hair but looks pure evil so i tend not to have himthis game can get very addictive
ive seen me sitting there playing the game listening to music and reading when a level is running by itself and i dont need to do anything
it can get quite funny if someone walks in on me quotmultitaskingquotwhen you get a sickness epidemic in the hospital its so funny
especially if youve got the sound turned up people come running thinking youve been sickthe announcements are brilliant to listen to although my version seems to stop and start
sometimes theres complete silence and then the announcements will come thick and fast  normally after the emergencies have been and goneid love to complete this game but i cant
ive had it for years
but it shows how addictive it islet me start by stating that i am an atari  girl who does not normally like the games of quottodayquot because i find them too complicated and too timeconsuming to figure out
that is until i found this game
for some reason i was attracted to the title
it sounded like a fun game
when i started playing it i found it to be not only fun but very easy to learn and quite addictive
all you use is a mouse and you can build your hospital the way you want including restrooms staff room complete with pool table and arcade game soda machines etc
 hire staff purchase property for more rooms etc
the higher the level you get the more neat stuff you can build scanners xray room operating theatre even a hair restoration clinic and the more obstacles you face earthquakes emergencies epidemics etc
there are so many things to control in this game from making sure each staff member is in the proper place to shooting rats that roam your hospital
sometimes a stomach virus will spread in the hospital and you have to hurry maintenance men to clean up the vomit the sound effects are also a hoot
the game even keeps stats like how many times a bench or soda machine is used so you can rearrange your hospital more efficiently
i find myself playing this game for hours
theme hospital is definitely worth the money but you can also buy this game as part of the quottop ten bluequot pack for lessyears ago i picked up this game for pc
at the time it had to be one of the most fun games i had ever played
the company that produced it bullfrog has a great sense of humor and doesnt take themselves too seriously
a few months ago i discovered it offered as a download for the ps as a classic play station game and i found the play station version is exactly like the original pc game from years agoyou begin the game with a small empty hospital in need of staff rooms and patients
you are given a lump sum of money and you begin building from the ground up
as patients come in you start by diagnosing what they have then working on curing them
as the game progresses the variety of illnesses grows larger and the tasks to be completed get more difficultearthquakes medical emergencys and widespread illness outbreaks are just some of the random tasks your hospital will have to work through
the better you do the better your chances are to advance to the next level
each level gets a little harder but also offered something new and funi have played through this game many times
its the kind of game that even after you have finished it you will find yourself pulling it out to play again  months later
its simple to learn yet challenging to play
theme hospital is fun to play for any agewhen i first got this game i couldnt stop playing
theme hosptial is dangerously addictive
its a obsession to build a hospital and take care of the patientsi had a giggle at the funny diseases and the cool machines they invented for the game to cure things
youll have a laugh playing this its pure entertainment
you have to think while youre playing it like where to put that doctors office or those toilets or that cocacola machineyoure up against  other hospitals and if you cure the right amount of patients you get to go onto the next levelive had this game for years and have never gotten farther then level 
my doctors always go crazy and i lose the levelbut overall a very funny game with a great soundtrack and funny things to doone of the best games of all times
it combines deep storey nice graphics smooth adventure and great action in a way that will make an adict 
its a classic i love this game
yes there are many great games with action adventure great guns great effects and excellent graphics
but not all games have great matrixtype slow motion effects and lots of other graphic action moves
this is a great game for everyone who likes  and syphon filter type games
it is exciting and has fantastic moves and levels
this game is definitely one of the best modern games everi have had this game for a while but declined to play it because it did not have any online gaming available and with the release of games such as rtcw mohaa and ccrenegade i had played those first and done the online thing
so i finally loaded this one up and wow
the beginning cutscene was amazing
alot of the game storytelling is done in comic book format and you have the ability to either watch it again or fast forward through itthe graphics are amazing they recommend  meg of ram and a m video card which i had which means you may not get the full effect with anything less the sound eefects and music were awesome and the controls were just like any other fps game i shouldnt call this an fps since it is played in rd person but hey
also there are harder levels of play available after you beat onei read one review that said the game looked cool and all but there was know strategy
strategy
you mean there is another strategy besides shooting everything in site
this game definitley had strategy to it
one example was if you just went into a room with guns blazing against  or  guys you either suffered significant damage or died which is what happens most of the time
you have to decide what weapon to use how you want to go in the room and which guy to take out first becasue some of the bad guys had weapons that do serious damage
usually when entering a room where i knew bad guys were i used the dodge and shoot alot
with the click of button when you are moving everything slows down and give you the advantage while you are airborn
very cool to use abd saves you alot of damage
then there is the bullet time method which lasts about  to  seconds as long as your meter is full
as soon as you press the button you move in slow motion and it give you the advantage of targeting them and avoiding their fired shots
its very cool seeing buckshot fly past you in slow notion
a definte advantage you need on certain levels otherwise you spend alot of time reloading because you will be dead
another cool feature is if you shoot someone in the head or in a certain area say near a ledge and you see the guy go flying in slow motion
very cool
also some of the levels you had to figure out how to get to the next area and it takes a little thinking but the way is always in front of you
there was also a level where you had to get max through his dream and that was pretty coolthe outside scenery this takes place during the worst storm ny has ever seen is awesome
the snow falling all around sirens in the background wind whipping all around when you step outside very nicely done
there were only  things i didnt like they cut to a story board a little too often   the game was a little short
other than that this was clearly one of the most awesome games i have ever played
it had me hooked from the moment i started playing it
too bad it didnt have online play available but heres too hoping that they make a max payne  with that capabilitymax payne is nearly the ultimate game but hey no game is perfect
if you want a challenge then this is the game for because this game is hardi didnt expect alot from max payne as the hype around it dulled my senses
i bought the game on a whim and wow i was blow away
technically the game has no equal for graphics the camera work makes you feel like your in a movie
the gameplay is very well done although the ai is moderate it can still provide a challenge
the key to the game is the storyline
your heart goes out to this character i more than once felt as though i would well up a tear for what this fellow goes through
the soundtrack and vocals are excellent adding so much more depth to the story
my only beef with this game is that it is extremely mature oriented
the graphic violence blood and various inuendos throughout the game should really be dealt with by adults
i havent tried the parental quotlockquot version however i cant help but wonder if they could take out all the stuff i would be concerned with my kids seeing
max payne is going to go on my shelf as one of the best games ive ever playedmax payne is one of those rare games that comes along every once in a while that breathes new life into a genre that seems to be all boring clones
i have played many shooters and yet max payne was a totally new experience
it is unlike any other shooter out there
i have played very few games with such a deep involving story
from the first episode in the game you are deeply involved in the character and the story
max payne is a complex character who is very realistic
the gameplay in this game is truly superb as well
the action is intense and smoothmoving
it is difficult but very fair
the feature that you surely have heard about the most is bullettime
this is truly a unique feature that adds a lot to the game
you will surely end up using it a lot
it provides for a lot of very cool sequences
the game is a bit short but the included mods hardboiled new york minute and dead on arrival should provide some additional longevity
i would not recommend this game for younger players though
my brother is  and he found a couple parts a bit disturbing though that could just be him
i personally am  and found nothing to be disturbing
there is mild swearing but nothing you dont hear everyday
max payne is truly an enjoyable game and a very worthwhile purchase
even without multiplayer it is a rewarding experience to play through
it like nothing youve ever played even if you think youve seen everything a shooter can doimagine a john woo hong kong gansta movie with chow yung fat diving into a room in slow motion with his twin berettas firing and you will understand this game perfectly
you are chow yung fat in this game
anytime in the game a press of a button will throw the action into bullet time a la the matrix where bullets glide by you in super slow motion and you can react to enemies faster than humanly possible
not only does this look darn cool but finally you can enter a room full of  bad guys with your guns blazing instead of taking glazing shots from the corners and playing hide and seek
shootem ups are finally funthe settings are all classic action movie settings like the rundown hotel new york streets and boat dock slick office buildings and even a chase through a parking garage
the firefights are amazing with or without bullet time and the weapons are all unique and fun to usethe plot  so important for a game like this  is only marginal
all the twists are told through graphic novelstyle comic book panels
while they look perfect and capture a wonderful mood the story itself is cliched and the plot often jumps all over the place
the voice acting is great but lonely college kids pose as models in the panels and look ridiculous
oh wellthe game is rather short  hours but the developers thoughtfully included all kinds of modification tools with the game and already you can download all kinds of tweaks to the game like kungfu payne and terminator paynebuy this game nowgiven that this game was under development for so long by the time it shipped i really wasnt interested in it
then i watched one of my coworkers playing it and i immediately went out and bought it
for the following couple of weeks i did little elsethis is one of the most interesting games ive ever played
the storyline wasnt terribly original but it was presented in a very effective manner
i especially enjoyed the graphic novel scenes that separated each chapter
also innovative were the levels where you took part in paynes nightmaresof course the big thing that everyone is talking about is the slow motion sequences
some of these are activated by the player and besides looking cool they allow you to overcome some situations that would be almost impossible otherwise
the other time slomo comes into play is when you kill the last enemy in a particular area when you see them flying through the air with a grimace on their face  a very nice touchthe game is very violent which wont be a problem for many gamers but its something you should be aware of
also as has been mentioned the game is fairly short which may disappoint some people although finishing the game the first time unlocks new play modes
overall though if you want something different from the standard shooter fare you wont be disappointed with max paynealthough the name of this game might be a turn off at first max payne
how original
 you should never judge a book by its cover
at a glance it may seem like just another clone shootemup game but in reality the game is quite innovative and just about the most fun youll ever have with a shooting gameyou play the game as max payne an undercover dea agent whos having a streak of a bad luck to put it lightly
i dont want to ruin the story but bottom line is that youll end up having to shoot your way out of every situation
the gameplay is superb
with a short and painless tutorial easy to navigate controls and  minute learning curve the game is quite easy to jump into and play
the story plays out like a bad action flick but its fitting and actually adds to the gameplaythe graphics are excellent and the level of detail is amazing as well
within the game youll see bullet holes from every shot youve taken and looking down at the floor youll even be able to count the shells from your gun
there is no item decay which helps add to the realism if you gun down some punk you can run around for  minutes and when you return his body will still be there and so will the shells from your gun
the story settings are excellent as well
running around seedy parts of the bronx while gunning down mobsters and drug addicts is quite a change of pace from the your normal shooter where youre on a space station killing stupid looking aliens
also the quotbullet timequot effect is something completely new to the genre that really makes the game shine
basically what quotbullet timequot does is put the game in slowmotion allowing you to get a better edge in gun battles and perform beautiful actionmovielike stunts
although quotbullet timequot sounds like a cheat its really what makes the game great
you wont be able to just do it whenver you want for as long as you want
you have an hourglass that determines how much btime you have left and even when its full its only a couple of seconds in total
earning more btime requires you to kill thugs without using the btime so it is best saved for tight situationsnow although i do rate the game with  stars it does have its annoyances
for one the game is quite short
if you have a whole day to yourself you can blow through the game within a good  hours
another annoying thing is the ai reflexes
its almost impossible to sneak up on these thugs
the second you enter the room they are all aware of your presence sometimes even before you enter
its frustrating because these are supposed to be lowlevel hoodlums and yet they have the reflexes of a navy seal
another thing that will annoy the hell out of you is how long it can take to kill the people sometimes
youd think a pointblank blast to the stomach from a pumpaction shotgun would be enough to finish off any human being but be prepared to fire again
itll also annoy you when you put  rounds from your beretta into a gangsters chest to have him keep charging at you as if unaffected
basically the badguys show no sign of pain or injury other than death
you can shoot him in the legs all you like it wont do much other than kill him eventually
but even with these problems i still rate the game a five because once youre playing you wont even be thinking about these things
the game is short but so much funoverall max payne delivers a very entertaining and very fresh gameplay experience
with many realistic weapons to choose from the bullet time feature the realistic enviroments and the action packed gameplay max payne will have you begging for a sequel once youve completed the game
bottom line the game is funthis game blows you away and on top of that there are cool mods for it doing move so cool as this its more of a interactive movie in short you have to play this but dont get the xbox or play station version just trust me on this max payne plays out as a modern raymond chandler dashiell hammet detective novel complete with the classic moment about midway through where the hero fights off hallucinations while trying to overcome a drug overdose
in the game this happens to our hero twice but it works quite well as a change of pace from what is otherwise a bloodbath
the dialogue and storyline in max payne is a bit overdone even by pulp fiction standards
perhaps the development team spent a little too much time watching professional wrestling when they werent working on the game
nonetheless with some effort it is still possible to suspend disbelief and get caught up in the max payne story
the games greatest feature is bullet time
click the right mouse button and you are neo in the matrix
time comes to a roaring halt and yes you can dodge bullets
you can even watch them as they fly by
bullet time is very fun and its the first genuinely new innovation in the first person shooter genre in awhile
frankly i hope other games copy it
the graphics in max payne are well done although somewhat blocky due to the limitations of the game engine
audio and music are professional and most importantly not annoying
control is solid and customizable
the only real weakness is the lack of multiplayer
if you are in the mood for a good single player adventure max payne is for youps
 if you really want to have fun with the game in windowsxp variations will work on any os from the cgt command prompt type cprogram filesmax paynemaxpayneexe developer
once you have started a new game or loaded a saved one hit the f key and type any of the following cheats god getallweapons getinfiniteammo gethealth and best of all getbullettime   hit f again twice to return to the gametoo many people are whining about the cheesy
hammy acting in this game
well guess what
when i was a kid we didnt have this much acting in video games
all we could settle for was a couple of minutes of grainy dialogue and maybe some jerky fmv cut scenes
max payne is one step closer to bridging the gap between games and cinema
kudos to the valiant finns who created this bad boy
finland is slowly but surely taking over the media worldthis is an amazing game really
ill tell you the full story and options you have in this gamethree years ago his wife and baby girl died because of some men that broke into the house
max payne has killed them though he wants revenge for this happening
finally three years later he gets a lead on the case
he follows this lead with bosses and a lot of guys to shoot ahead using bullet time that is like matrixstyle slowmotion that is easier to use then the fastpaced real life that happens all round him
he firsts gets a case in the subway he finds out that his partner is died and the big guy blamed it on him and so here on out cops are on his tail
well though here to the lasts missions he is just trying to get though the bosses that lie ahead each boss defeated getting him one step farther
there are over  levels each long and painful to max payne but thats what happens when youre trying to beat the case of v i should tell you that there is two wacky levels that is kind of confusing there called prologues which the first time max payne gets shot up and gets a nightmare
you actually have to beat the nightmare
the second time the bad guys od him on a drug known as v its a lot more confusing and hard in the second one bad after the second one its good and clear though here on out
well im not going to spoil it for you but he learns out everything and gets the real bad woman that is with all of this
scale timegraphics great awesome with smiles
d fun there is some slow parts here but most is fun
gameplay it took me  hours with cheats sound awesome it makes sound for even the panels
overall well not perfect but max payne  will probably be twice as goodeven though this game is not out yet there are many things to say about it
this game simply put is going to cross boundaries never crossed when it comes to technology and gameplay
the graphics are absolutely stunning and the attention to detail is just jawdropping
the storyline is strong and is carried out well through the use of ingame cutscenes and comics
this game will be a classic everyone should experience itif youve never played max payne before and you love firstperson shooters then you owe it to yourself to buy this game
its cheap now so theres no reason not to own it before its out of printmax payne is a gritty story about a cop just doing his job
his wife an baby are murdered and it throws his world into turmil
as you can imagine he wants revenge and he gets revenge many times overwhat makes max payne unique is that it uses john woo style moves and action
this was the first game to feature bullet time which allows the player to slow down the action and perform fancy dive and jump moves while blasting their weapon at a target in slomo
couple this with a good story and vengeance and you have a winning game
you get sucked into the world of max payne and you cant help but love itmax payne is a huge game
by the end youll have killed hundreds of people in your quest for the truth
its plenty of action
even though by todays standards the graphics look a little dated it was top of the line for its time with reflective floor surfaces and flying wall debrisanother cool thing about this game is you can use cheat codes and slow the action down to a stop then move it forward one frame at a time
you see with max payne the bullets are actually flying out of the gun at the target so when you do super slowmo you get to see the bullets in midair heading for their target
using the time cheat you can watch bullets hit targets and debris flying all over the place in realistic fashionlong story short its a mustown game for fps fans
theres no multiplayer but who needs it when you have all the action you could wantalso check out max payne  the fall of max payne
it continues the story has updated graphics and the characters mouths move when they talk
it takes max payne up another level
however the game is somewhat shorter than the first installment
get both of them todayso if you havet gotten this game yet get it now
it does have certain drawbacks the game is realativly short and the acting just badany and all short commings are made up by the great gameplay and a new concept bullet time probably the coolest thing to come out in the last five years with the exception of max payne overallthe moral of this story is dont try to kill this guy you will just piss him offim going to start with the positivesthis game is simply the most advanced game ive played to date
not only are the graphics something out of the future the story is what keeps you playing the game
its like your walking through a movie and your the main character
if your sick of games with all shooting and no storyline this game is for you
this one will get you interested enough to keep playing it right to the endthe weapons arent the biggest attraction to the game but the quotmatrixquot style slow motion is like nothing youve seen before in a pc gamethe negativestheres only one negative i can think of
that is that you better be running a damn good system if you expect to see and play this game up to its potential
im running a p  with a geforce  ti series accelerator and that has something to do with why the graphics are so good and there is no screen slow downbottom lineif your system can take it go for itif you even think of buying something else forget it
max payne is the best game of  a plot that will keep you drawn in close from start to finish
a game that you will sit down and play and lose track of time
a fantastic game which captures the slomotion of the quotmatrixquot in a bullettime mode
if you like games like halflife hitman codename  or rainbow six you will love this
the best action game ever inventedwow
amazing game
simply amazing
highly recommendedone of the best actionpacked singleplayer gamesfirst of all if you are turned off from buying this game because you dont have an experimental superprocessor and a mountain of ram dont fret
i run the game on a  mhz piii and  mb ram and its smooth as silk at the lowest but still gorgeous graphics level
if you have the bare minimum hardware its very worth it to give it a tryatmosphere it is a very mature game  not for the little tikes
the game deals with violence sex and drugs most of the time not to mention heartstringpulling drama
if youre ok with that prepare to be immersed in a tense crime actiondrama that feels like a movie and mature comic book at the same time
i find myself almost biting my lip at times playing this game
the suspense will have you sweating bullets
the voice acting especially maxs is also great
max has that great quotseen more hatred and darkness than any man shouldquot kind of sound in his voice but has a comforting quottough guyquot sound as well
the only thing i can really compare this game to in terms of immersiveness is metal gear solid for the playstation only with a richer settinggraphics and sound the graphics vary between great and jawdropping depending on the power of your processor and d card
in the slowmotion quotbullet timequot you can actually see the bullets coming toward and away from max
the sound is also very welldone
if max is a room away from two thugs talking they sound like they are a room away
overall it makes you feel like youre theregameplay and features one of the coolest features of the game is the slow motion officially called quotbullet timequot
bullet time can be used at any point since there is no break between action sequences and looking around
however bullet time is limited
it slowly drains while it is activated but you get a little more to refill it a bit whenever max downs an enemy thug
the slowmo really adds an extra quotwowquot factor to the action sequences
this isnt just tomb raider with thugs drugs and baretta slugs  this is a game of matrixlike action tied together with a usual suspectslike story
the controls are very simple and do not detract from the game whatsoevermy advice buy this game if you have at least the bare minimum hardware
wait until it is dark and quiet to begin playing it
prepare to have all of your emotions thoroughly smackedaround and sent through a rollercoaster ride of action and dramaa few years back when i bought this game i was blown by everythingyou name itthe graphics the plot the gameplay the chilling but never the less suspenseful music
seriously when you install and play this game its like something you have never experienced beforethe bullettime feature is such a great feature when you want to outsmart your enemies with slowmotion attempt to kill
this game is like the movies
some very awesome things happen in this game like really loud tires screeching echoing in the midst of a parking tunnel or a large steel bridge collapsing
the best though is when you kill your enemy and watch him get knocked out in slow motionthe plot is so unbelieveably great that whoever wrote the plot has to be very very skilled at writing
like i said its like a movie mixed in with a novelthe weaponry could not be better
each weapon is so powerful and actionpacked that you can feel your hand shake each time you fireyou seriously do not want to miss out on this one
the game is adapted to a variety of computers
the game has a powerful plot movielike gameplayand i mean movielike graphics are exceptionally spectacular for such minimumlevel requirementsi tell you right now this game is worth your  and i tell you right now you will never ever forget this gameone word quotwowquot
this game is uinique in so many aspects i dont even think i can list them all
first off the game overall is one of the best shooters i have ever played
the reason for this is because the story and action are so perfectly intertwined with one another that the game comes off as almost flawless
remedy decided to take the shooter genre to new hights by adding inovating gameplay including the awesome matrix style slow mo
the graphics and sound of max payne are amazing
its really cool how they take peoples faces and litterally put them onto the characters
with so much action style and  an interesting story max payne is definetly a game that no shooter fan should missgreat game great story and a lot of fun to play
its a bit high on the system requirement side im running a p ghz mb ram and a nvidia ti graphic card and it still slows down in heavy action
aside from that this game is definitely one of the best games ever created
if you like first person shooters then this game is definitely for youhey fellowgamers i have nothing but praise for this game it was a little awkward getting used to the controls but only because i wasnt used to slow motion shooting
the game itself is a riot to play
i for one am delighted with it
im very impatient so i like action games where i can jump right in and start shooting
max payne is a great game for fps and im starting all over again playing the game
i highly recommend it to gamers who love shooting things up have a blast
youll feel your money was well worth itwow
simply put max payne is one of those games that makes you sit back and thank the heavens for your pc
from the brilliant opening sequence to the dingy corridors of hells kitchen apartments and subway systems payne promises a feast of graphic delight convincing audio and a wealth of gameplay goodness
the games depiction of maxs wife being murdered is harrowing and from there the story just gets better
told in snippets of pulp fiction graphic novel paynes bentonrevenge theme works to perfection
the locale of nyc is genuine down to the ambulance sirens mailboxes and subway location signs
but where the game really stands out is its gameplay
although max is a conventional shooter it is anything but
using the brilliant quotshootdodgequot and quotbullettimequot techniques max can essentially slow down the clock and dispatch enemies despite overwhelming odds
how you ask
by slowing the enemys actions including their bullets max remains in real time essentially letting you squeeze off a few rounds before the bad guys even knew what hit them
when its all over youll see foes somersaulting backwards bullets and blood their last hurrah
the games use of maxs heartbeat to slow down the action is unforgettable and having to use it only in times of trouble is amazing
it never gets overdone
the action sequences are too good to be true
in fact to believe it youll simply have to see it
action camera angles are done seamlessly and maxs comments during the game keep the story flowing
cut scenes are meticulously crafted in grainy comic book action and the style works thanks to the storys key elementswith so many cool features and amazing gameplay the only disappointment with quotmaxquot is its length
because after  to  hours of complete immersion its over
still with the included editor game geeks from all over the world will be creating mods to further maxs bloodlust
oh and one other note payne works better on fast machines with updated graphics cards so be sure youve got a  mhz or better unit running with some heavy ram  or above  is clutch and a geforce or aboveso if youre thinking about buying one game this summer make it max payne
its an instant classic that is sure to go down in pc history as one of the greatest
its that goodmax payne is a masterpiece of ingenuity with a bit of excellent illiteration throwing in for good measure
on top of all that its one bloody massicre after another
the story itself makes the game worth buying add in an awesome main character then exciting combat and a good arsinal of weapons and you have a winner
i totally love this game
then you also have the dozens of mods being produced every day including a first person mod and the decision to buy this game gets even easier
the best game ive played in a long time
dont hesitate
if your computer can handle it get it
unless you frown upon violence then donthell yeah
if youre looking for a gritty no holds barred third person shooter this is the game for youwow
this is definitely the best game of the year
with a new feature that allows you to go into matrixstyle slowmotion it is the only game to employ such a feature
pc gamer calls this feature quotslomo gives you an inventive advantage over the opposition and it also happens to be the most fricken cool device ever employed in an action gamequot the graphics are truly stunning the story is excellently written and it has one of the best plots in an action game
the mature label is correctly applied since there is a lot of animated blood violence and suggestive themes such as a the player killing a devilworshipping maniac
this third person shooter will replace halflife as the definitive action gamemax payne has got to be one of my all time favorites
for those people who love john woo action shoot them up with two pistols the matrix type action with oozies or sincityfrank miller comic books  this game is just that
with a brilliant frank miller type storyline and action that makes many action movies look bad this game is a must own for any die hard action fan
this is a third person view type game though but it does makes sense in that it would be the only way to see all the action in a cinematic movie viewpoint
this is the first game to introduce the new concept of bullet time
bullet time is the idea where when the action gets so involved and gritty that the motion of the battles goes into slow motion mode example neo in matrix when he dodges bullets in slow motion you actually see the bullets fly passed you as you jump back with two pistols blazing and scraping the enemy just as his bullets carves away paint on the walls
the graphics for this game surpasses any other game  even surpasses games such as halflife and alice
there were several instances during gameplay that i forgot that everything wasnt real and that it was d sculpted
perhaps most of the graphics are created in d studio max  which gives the game its realistic hollywood movie look
gameplay is excellent and there are many weapons to choose from single and twin barettas single and twin ingram oozies pump action shotgun sawedoff shotgun sniper rifle grenade launcher molotov bottles grenades machine gun rifles baseball bat etc the game even features mods that you can make yourself and levels that can be designed by you
i believe there was a mod at website address that has a faceoff level with speeding boats and face off shootouts in churches and another mod with the matrix lobby shootout with neo and trinity blasting away guards
this mod has even twice more the weapons than the game ordinarily has  including a kungfu feature where you can do backflip kicks kungfu roundhouses and kicks and jump kicks all while holding your weapon
for people who are thinking  but this is a third person view type game like resident evil think again  there is a mod that can be downloaded that enables you to play in first person viewshooter much like that of quake and unreal you can even have picture in picture of both views at once this game is definitely for people who cannot get enough of cool john woo and matrix type action movies
if you even thought about taking on the entire mafia mob all by yourself  max payne does just that
buy it
gameplay  graphics  sound  value  max payne is gritty new york crime game that has been able to do something few others can do and that is to add a well scripted graphic novel to support gameplay
max payne is a wonderful shooter
there are some puzzles that have to be solved yet most are rather simple such as shooting a tirechalk to make a trailer crash creating an opening for youthe graphics are wonderful and they really give the gamer the new york subway feel which kinda creeped me out
the most distinct and amazing feature in max payne is maxs special power
bulletime allows max to alter time much as in the movie matrix
although maxs enemies bullets slow to a snails pace his fire normally giving him an edge
bullettime is limited however and this is not a bad thing because too much of a good thing is bad and would make this fantastic game too easy to completethis game is definitely not for young children as the rating would suggest
there is graphic violence blood slow death sequences etc
and strong language which may be deemed unsuitable for younger gamersallinall this is a great game that i would recommend to anyone interested in something new in the gaming world
max payne is first class all the way and those interested may want to check out the soon to be released max payne comicenjoy as i havemax payne is a lot of fun and has a great story to bootthe game is great but is pretty short maybe  hours of gameplay
the game is also very addiciting i havent but people i know have beaten this game in a day
bullettime is a great feature which puts everything in slomo to let you aim at enemys and focus on a headshot while dodgeing bullets at the same time very innovativethe game is storydriven and let me tell you that the story is fantastic
its probably the reason that most people spend all day playing it to see what happens next in the storytheres one downside to max payne lack of multiplayer
if you want to have fun with some friends sorry look somewhere else becuase max payne wont let you play on the netlastly i dont know the min
system requirements so here are the specs for my system ghz amd athlon mb ram mb geeforce  video card hercules gamesurround furtismo ii sound card the video settings are at their highest and the sound settings are at their highest as well
the game runs perfect without any skipping in either sound or videoi have noticed that some of you here have been stating the playstationxbox  versions are better
if you really think so why dont the lot of you who said that go out and buy yourself a playstationx box and stop letting the world know it sucks on pc
it does not suck on pc
on the pc version if you need a patch you can download it directly off the internet
on the playstation versionsx box your sol
this game rocks
nothing comes closetwo words that simply make this game worth playing bullettimei really enjoyed max payne
i like games where i have to think by preference but this was just too much fun even though the bodycount ends up like something from a terminator movie
basically youre just waltzing in playing it bogart and pumping the baddies full of bullets some of which are full metal jacketed
its nice that they took such things into account and the effects of your gunblazing are seen with more detail to your environment than the baddiesthe developers were extremely detailed with environment in this beautiful game
its really eyecandy and i honestly enjoyed the script its funny in parts and wonderfully descriptive in its brevity
the writers did a great job setting the mood
comic and noir lovers will be especially pleased as it is above all artfulalso knowing a thing or two about guns and ammo this game does a fair job keeping with the traits of the various weapons that youll use in regards to rate of fire kick and penetration
stopping power is sometimes a foriegn concept though because as the game progresses some of the baddies youll face are just inhumanely robust
that was mildly annoying but keeps it challenging when max can use bullettime to knock them off with ease
the odds at some points are so incredibly against max that when you do manage to kill all the baddies in a room the cinematic effect of watching the badguy fall is a nice bonus
its a tough game in some partsit is a little on the short side but i was ready for the end when i got to it because its mostly mindless gunfighting in close quarters
still its fun and there are  different skill levels to play so it does have replayability
there is a big difference in difficulty from the fugative level to the hard boiled
i havent played dead on arrival yet or the new york minute but i plan to when i just want to have some fun and get freaky with the shotdodginghighly recommended
the first thing i said out loud when i played this and flew through the air in slow mo was ohmygod this is so wicked cool
nuff saidi havent been such an avid gamer lately truth be told
ive been annoyed by most of the titles of the past  years same thing over and over again right
well heres max payne
beautiful graphics and strikingly realistic
the plot is very well layed out and entertaining
my greatest complaint is also a magnificent complement too short sigh
more more more more
all in all this is an incredible game
i found myself completely involed in this experience the payne and allthose who complain about the difficultyi laugh at you without remorse
go stare at a stack of peanuts or somethingmystatsvery very good music
great sound ambience and effects
also amazing voice actinggreat graphics
very nicely detailed texturesrealistic
convincing environments and experience
asside the fact that some baddies require  blasts with your biggest gun to the head
hey maybe theyll make a realism patchgreat story intelligently told in styleand most importantly alot of funmax payne is really a wonderful source of gameplay
best of all for the pc version there are tons of modification sets that can be downloaded for free
i highly recommend this game for that reason
they really enhance gameplay in a way that cannot be done by the regular consoles
though at times it is repetative and you will sometimes forget why youre shooting the next  people its rather funexcellent graphics and good story plot its the ultimate shoot em up
this game make other st person shooting games amatuerish by comparisonthe weaponry is realistic and i have to say that even the subway graphics and the look of the nyc storefronts is totally authentic
i thought i was back in flushing queens
the joe pesci criminal types are perfect
i havent finished the game yet and im trying to savor the fun
definitely worth the moneyenjoyive grown tired of firstperson shooters
you run around kill things get a bigger gun and kill things some more
max payne doesnt let you get away with that
yes you run and around and kill things but this game runs deeperthe story is quite intriguing and gives the player some narrative reason to keep playing
the story is narrated and presented in the form of stills from a graphic novelvery nicethe voice acting is superb and the sounds are accurate and subtle
having a good  or better speaker system is a mustthe graphics are gorgeous and graphic
the faces of the characters are very realistic and expressivebullet time this may be the games crowning feature
think the matrix where neo dodges a few bullets
you can do this on a regular basis in max payneif you want a game with stellar graphics an intelligent and nicely developed story great sound and you want to kill things max payne is for youmax payne is a game that can only reshape the genre very much as half life did
besides the obvious use of eye popping graphics and visceral and highly stylizied hong kong movie style gunplay a la aptly named bullet time this is a very engrossing game
the story moves along at a very crisp pace giving you the feeling that the net is closing in on you as both the cops and the villains want you dead
the game also employs a nice touch that it borrowed from grim fandango where your head turns to look at items of interest
i cannot put this game down
it will surprise you
i recommend that you try the demo at least
you will need a hefty pc and d card to run this game wellreleased in december  for the pc and later for the ps max payne captivated gamers with its jawdropping bullettime feature dark and engrossing story and over the top action
even now i still have a blast playing it
the graphicnovel sequences were suprisingly good and well made and to boot the voice acting was not all that bad either
the game has great sound amazing graphics immersive plot and awesome weapons colt commando rox if you have not had the sheer pleasure of sitting down in front of your computer for several hours playing this tight game i highly recommend you purchase max payne as soon as possible max payne  should come out some time in summer classic gameran on windows xp  bit spworked for half the game then crashed every time at loading screengo to drealms site download the  patch
solves everythingafter applying the  patch played through the entire game flawlesslet me say this is some of the greatest gameplay ever created
you can interact with almost every object around you useless or not
graphics are smooth and wondefully detailed you can even see the enemies squint there eyes and bite there teeth together when they shoot at you
great voice acting and an unbelievably good storythe gameplay is purely genuiss and bullet time aspect of slow motion is awsome
really there are no bad points i can think of just dont let the kids play this onethis is one of the best games i ever played
this game is for anyone who enjoyed the movie the matrix
you can slow down time by pushing your mouse button and the story line is gripping
if you are looking for a great game this is it
i ran the game fine in full detail on my p  with  ram and a   meg tntmaxpayne is the most original character ever madehis grin is what ruined it for me
this is one of rockstars bestgames out to date
i still like  more but still were talking about a ground breaking classic that every pc owner should have
the pc versian looks way better than the ps and x box put together but over all max payne is an action adventure for any die hard fans
but if you want a true classic action adventure gameget metal gear solidthats true gaming for yathe story max payne is thatmax payne the new york police detective has had a bad time of it recently and its time for payback
three years ago junkies high on a mysterious new narcotic called valkyr slaughtered his wife and child
the tragedy drives him on a prolonged path of vengeance
it turns him from a detective looking for easy work to a deep undercover vice cop infiltrating the mob to a hardened vigilante
max payne is a filmnoirinspired game about revenge that is unflinching in every way possible
its dark and moody extremely twisted and turns pc action gaming on its ear by featuring stateoftheart graphics audio and cinematic actionso get out now and get the gamefinnish developers remedy have been at work on max payne for several years now and its finally hit store shelves
it is a truly breathtaking achievement not only in terms of the astounding visuals but also in terms of story and actionthe player takes on the role of new york detective max payne
in the emotional opening chapter a prologue to the action we see through maxs eyes the murder of his wife and infant child
max finds hints that the murders were the work of a particular drug gang and moves on to work with a drug enforcement agency for three years to find the leader
it plays out like a scene from a bigbudget action movie
this sets the up the rest of the first quotactquot of the game with max in search of the leader of the ganggraphically max payne features some truly amazing textures very much photorealistic
controlling max will be simple for anyone who has played a fps style game with one great twist quotbullettimequot gameplay
this is a feature where the player can slow down the game time ala quotthe matrixquot with a simple mouse button click
this gives the player a small tactical advantge but it certainly does not distract from the already difficult gameplaythe hardware requirements are fairly steep to enjoy the eyecandy at its fullest
although the minimum requirements call for a  mhz p or amd processor  mbs of ram and a  mb video card a more realistic requirement is a processor near to or above  ghz a higherend video card with  mbs of memory and above this is the game that the geforce  was made for
and  mbs of rammax payne has definitely been worth the waiti bought max payne not too long ago and beat it
i have to say that this is the best packed action shoot em up game
in max payne your an undercover cop and becomes a new york fugitive
i cant tell you why because it would spoil the whole game
i gave this game  stars because of its unique creation
its full with action and it has just the right amount of difficulty
theres also an option that lets you do a matrix slow motion style shooter for about  seconds
this is a very brilliant option in the game because if you see a group of enemies just use this option and shoot them
secondly the graphics are amazing
it just spices everything up to a new level
the enivironments are also interactive for example you can buy a soda from the soda machine or turn on the sink or shower or even flush a toilet
so thats also a pretty cool thing they put into this game
also the games ai scripts are easy at the beginning and increase with each level
the ai is never impossible to beat and i think that is pretty creative
max payne also has a dazzling storyline
the only bad part about this game is the voice talent
max payne always seems dull and just says things in a voice thats kinda lame but funny
like if someone dies hes just likewell if you buy the game youll see what i mean
i gave this game  stars because i thought it was very unique and amazing and everything
i also want to thank the creators and everyone else for spending their time to create a game with so much action and brilliance
well if you like action packed games with unique features i say buy this game at all coststhis has to be the best action game i have ever played maybe even the best game i have ever played and i play a lot of games
i love this game and i play it all the time
it is so cool
it has the best graphics around if you have a good enough system to run it lots of weapons great gameplay a great involving story and the coolest feature ever bullettime
there are also tons of game mods that are already out too
this game is worth every penny if your an action game fan you cant go wrong with max payneputting holes in junkies while you fly through the air in slow motionneed i say more
a great game
very funmax payne is a must have for any serious gamer
the graphics and realism are all that anyone could ask for however you must be sure that you have a system that can handle the kind of power needed to be able to enjoy this game to the fullest
if you dont all youll be able to see is choppy slide by slide movie looking gameplay which takes away from the game and makes it so that its virtually unplayable
the bullettime mode is what really makes the game though
it slows down time so that you can kill multiple enemies in one room while taking minor if any injuries to yourself
once again a must have for any serious gamerthis game is great
every move is action packedthere are no puzzles which makes the game totally and i mean totally cool
the language is a bit explicit and so are some scenesbut once youre in the groove of the gamethere is no way outthey should have included it in the doom multi packnot compleat without this doomlegendary game resurrected by programs like skulltag and zdoom
if you love doom get this and play it using zdoom or skulltag
hours of fun and highly addictivea very good shooterfightingcrazyexplosionsandstuff with funny characters and very good graphics ive beaten the game  and i am very impresseda really good game the only problem is noone really knows about itthis is the first attempt at balanced multirace mutliplayer gaming
one has a big knife one has a big gun one iswell just big
hes  feet tall and sneak a snack means youd best watch your back at all times unless you like short baths in ketchup and soda
the  press release says eat burn drown kidnap or bury victims
now i dont actually requiring the digging a hole and shoving someone in but being taken by surprise by a reaper or thrown into the air like popcorn or just dropping to the ground due to a sudden loss of blood pressure for no reason except that gaping would in your left side may expand on the idea
obviously esrb rated m  mature
however the graphics are light when compared to doom half life or alice by ea

planet moon studios got this one right

creative and amd are all built into it tooif you didnt actually make it through all that this is a really cool game
i bought it used on amazoncom for less than the shipping
yeah for amazoncomthis is the most visually stunning game ive ever played period
the backgrounds are so engaging theyre almost a distraction
the colors and textures are rich and beautiful
the lights and special effects are amazingly realistic
the characters are smooth and engagingi recently purchased one of the mnay geoforce cards on the market this game plays like a dream
upgrading from an older tnt made a tremendous difference
giants seems custom made for the features of the geoforce cardsgiants has raised the bar in graphics and gameplay which may strike some the wrong way
those of you who with computers barely ahead of the obsolescence curve might feel a bit left behind
those of you who are still running on older video cards like i was  might have some problems
unfortunately its the nature of the beastaside from graphics giants presents and engaging and hilarious story with excellent gameplay
just when i felt id conquered one aspect the game switches gears races or genres and suddenly becomes a new game
giants hints at being a first person shooter a racing game a strategy game and an adventure game
unlike many games that have tried to combine different elements and failed giants makes each transition smoothly and succesfullyso the bottom line if you have a newer computer with a decent video card you will probably love this game
if youve been thinking of getting a new computer because your current one is lagging behind you might want to reconsider purchasing giants
giants could still prove to be fun but without the incredible graphics you might feel that youre missing somethingif you combined salvador dalis mind with that of general powells youd probably come up with something like quotgiants citizen kabutoquot odd strange and wierd all describe it
but likewise so does fun entertaining and laughoutloud funny at timesthere are  different factions to play as the mercs the sea reapers and the giant kabuto himself
with the mercs there are  guys though you basically play as one of them with the other four tagging along and mimicking you  there strength is in weapons and technology
the sea reaper is delphi a sort of mermaid like women with very strong magical powers
and kabuto who is raw strength and sizeif youve ever played warcraft starcraft or command amp conquer rtss and doom or halflife first person shooters youll get a feeling for this game as it combines base building with first person shooter
but the big difference is that with each of the  factions in this game the strategies and tactics required are totally unique
none are like the other two and yet they are very well balanced and a blast to playgraphically its stunningly beautiful as are the sounds and music
and you will laugh out loud at some of the cutscene dialogues and youll be wondering if the creators were part drunk when the put this all together
but it works very much in its favor
its one of the top  games ive ever played but its definitely the most uniquei cant contain the experience alone
every one must know they must you seeim typically the type the more gore head kracking and the darker and more evil a game the better
well heres giants possibly the funnest gaming experience ive ever had and its light hearted but its the funniest game ever
its so masterly put together with all the perfect elements of twisted humor beautiful graphics and environments different styles of gameplay within the game staring at delphis nude bodyjust delete or move the arpfix file in the bin folder to experience the sea reapers as they were meant to be
quite possibly my favourite game ever
a winner in the industrymystatsbeutiful graphics amazing modeling work sharp texturesthe story
oh god i love it
the plot is so perfect
funny and i mean really funny heroic great combination of elements

the sound effects and ambience is rivetinggameplay
fun
very fun
pure energetic funone of the few titles i give  on a  scalein the spirit of mario brothers and donkey kong spinoffs interplay has released a very entertaining title that gives you a cartoonlike feel
even with that feeling you cant set this game down
its one of those games with an amazingly simple concept that still gives you weeks of fun
and dont expect amateur graphics when i describe the cartoon atmosphere the colors are brighter which is different than most games today but still stand on their own meritmy best comparison would be the pc games black amp white and rainbow six meet each other
the scenarios amp cartoonish artwork provided are precursors to the ones you experience in black amp white
i am not a fan of quotshoot em upquot games but i loved the firstperson shooter aspect of this game
the controls are rather easy to learn and the combination of weapons and extra accessories make the game very fun to play
the multiplayer addition is also entertaining but perhaps not as fun as some games
this is one of the few quotshoot em upquot games that might be more fun in the standalone version vs the pc than the multiplayer mode
the multiplayer configuration is still entertaining enough to keep you hookeda quick note on some of the earlier reviews
the overall rating of this game has been lowered because it made the mistake of being released too early in order to capture the holiday shoppers
three patches have since been released and cleared up most of the technical issues involved
i havent had any crashing problems as of late
this is a game i delved into not expecting to enjoy but was utterly surprised
a keeper for anyone that would like to spend their free time with an entertaining pc gameto start off with this game has some of the most amazing graphics i have ever seen
it takes full advantage of nvidia and atis latest tampl engines with gorgeous results
that being said you are going to need a serious machine to play this game
if you dont have a geforcegeforce or radeon as well as a speedy processor and lots of memory then you are going to miss out on this games outstanding graphics
fortunatley this game is able to stand on its own without the graphics
the storyline is humorous to the point where i burst out laughing at many of the cutscenes
the gameplay is solid the designers obviously spent a lot of time with this games engine
i have yet to truly play around with the multiplayer capabilities of this game but from what ive seen in single player there is real potential for a great lan game
that being said this game does have a single fault
i have found a few annoying bugs
i am sure these will be fixed in a patch in the near future theyre not that bad anyway so that shouldnt hold you back from getting this game
if you have the system to support it dont just sit there get itthis is a bioware classic
you play through three different characters through the game
kurt is the sniper that take out targets out at long range
max is the sixarmed dog that can have a weapon in each arm
the final character is the doctor that has some puzzle challenges
this game is very challenging but satisfying and very rewarding
i would not recommend this game to casual gamers due to the difficulty
if you are a hardcore gamer and looking for a challenge this would be a good investmentsoul calibur is fantastic
jet grind radio is innovative
metropolis street racer is addictive
however looking back now that the dc is fading away mdk is the systems best gamewhy didnt more people buy itthe visuals are unmatched in console gaming
even the ps version of mdk is graphically inferior
the sequence where kurt must glide from platform to platform is absolutely jawdroppingand thats on the first level
the alien city of swizzle firma looks like it was taken straight out of the fifth element  vehicles buzz everywhere with no looping or random placement
everything from the glowing tip of maxs cigar to shwang shwings snaillike spacecraft is rendered with meticulous attention to detail and loving careforget gunbird  and bangaio
good games in their own right yes but they cant compare to mdks challenge
this is the ultimate hardcore game
climbing the tower with maxs jetpack on level  or diffusing the bombs as doc hawkins on level  will take any gamer a loooong time to complete
but the game always rewards your efforts by taking you to another fantastic environment and presenting a task that is guaranteed to raise your blood pressure
the feeling of victory and accomplishment when successfully navigating these challenges is what gaming is all aboutas games become more mainstream they are becoming easier in order to recruit more fans
a major tip of the hat to bioware for crafting the first visually stunning d game that retains the challenge of d games of the past
the ps version of mdk contains helpful hints like big red arrows saying shoot here that make the game less than what its intended to be  really a shamethe only negative comment i have about mdk is that the levels with kurt are slightly more creative and fun than the max and doc levels
i think that if mdk had been  levels of kurt it would have easily been my favorite game of all time
still the top three isnt badcontrol visuals audio even the ludicrous story are all some of the best in the industrymdk is a gorgeous genius mix of reflexdriven action and brainnumbing puzzles that no gamer should pass upmdk  is one of the best games of all time
i really love what was done with this gamethe graphics the scenery the humor the challenge are all top notch
this is definitely one to own and one to keep
get mdk  without a second thoughtyou wont regret itthis is a super game
i first rented this game from blockbuster several years ago
i loved it so much that i just had to have it
this is a very fun game
if you like a game with tons of shooting bones exploding all of the place fast action and blood then this is the game for youthis game is a whole lot of fun
it hearkens back to the good old days at the arcade when it was all about reflexes
the game does not boast the greatest graphics but it does look like those arcade shooting games
if you have a justifier light gun then you must add this to your collection
this game is addicting and will eat up some hours of your timei really enjoyed this game
its like being at the arcade
too bad they didnt make too many of this type of games back then
but the few that are available like this one are worth getting a playstation for
if you have a playstation and have never played this game then you are missing outi played this game many many moons ago and enjoyed it immensely
i am now in the market for a game comparable in fun that compares to it
i played final fantasy tactics and didnt enjoy it nearly as much  the entire system seemed much more complicated and difficult than vandal hearts
i also played kartia and it too was inferior with its paperscissorsrock combat systemi wonder if the game hoshigami is any good
that is the one i am eyeing in hopes of being as fun as vandal heartsthough not one of the longer strategy rpgs out there that honor would have to go to disgaea or the epitome of all strategy rpgs final fantasy tactics vandal hearts is one of the most overlooked games on the sony playstation
starting out the game you are put in the role of ash who along with his friends diego and clint fight off a group of bandits who are attacking them
this sets the games gameplay in place with blood flying and a soundtrack that only the fine folks at konami could produce one that still echoes in my head to this day
although the graphics are quite dated by todays standards the gameplay elements of this game are where it truly shines
after leveling up at level  or level  you are given the option to upgrade your character thus allowing you access to new moves and enhanced abilities
for example archers can continue along the bowman path or can get rid of their bows in exchange for the ability to fly which becomes irreplaceable later on in the game
someone elses review said that this game had little replay value but i would have to disagree having beaten this game on at least  different occasions
clocking in at somewhere around  hours it is not a long game but there are somewhere around  or  seven secret levels which are really tough and require precise skills but if accomplished correctly open up not only a slightly secret ending but also the class of vandalier for ash opening up every skill in the game for the main character and making him basically a god among the other soldiers
the realtionship between ash and elena develops throughout the game very well and the ties of friendship are established between other members of your party just like any great rpg
konami was on one hell of a roll back in the day releasing this game suikoden metal gear solid and castlevania sotn within a year or two of each other signifying them as one of the premiere publishers during the original playstations golden age and producing all of these a class titles
definitely do not miss out on the chance to own this game especially if you grew up with games like shining force
not to be passed upvandal hearts  was and still is a truly remarkable game
the graphics dont do a game this beautiful any justice but this ones soooooo good i wouldnt care if i was controlling stick figuresok lets run through the thing
the first rpg ive ever seen that doesnt require exploring
all you do is follow the dialogue very intriguing story and fight fight fight
the battles reek of awesomeness and require a huge amount of strategy which rounds out to a game that will not be enjoyed by everyone
some might not appreciate the smarts that go into this thing and the game is very user friendly should you lose a battle you learn from your mistakes and eventually will move on
it builds thinking skills
hows that parents
you are ash a soldier who can kick some serious booty
your initial friends diego an archer and clint another soldier
as the story progresses you meet other characters rounding your final party to twelve whom you can use in the same fight at the same time and enhance your abilities archers can become either hawknight or bowmen and then advance from there to higher levels and so on and so forth for each character
youll like the ending i assure ya
graphics  out of could be better
sound  oooo you can hear the blood gush
neat
control  i like it
hey mikey
funocity  the nesish graphics cant pull this one down
a keeper for surei love turnedbased strategy games
choosing where to move your characters and it will make you wonder if you made a right choice or a deadly mistake
my favorite one is final fantasy tactics
unfortunately squaresoft has decided to discontinue it and it has become very rare
i was lucky and found a copy
for those of you who werent so lucky to get a copy of final fantasy tactics dont worry because konamis vandal hearts is another great gamethe game plays like any turnedbased strategy you usually have about  guys and fight a bunch of enemies
you fight on big open levels and you choose where to have them move and attack
the objectives range from defeat all your enemies rescue a certain person or get to a certain place
also every time you defeat one of your enemies they explode into gallons of blood
swift justicein between battles you can go to different places to get your skills upgraded
such as shopping in town learning new skills at the dojo getting new information at your headquarters or just to have a drink at the tavernin all vandal hearts is a great game that should be played by everyone who likes turnedbased strategy
even though its not as good as final fantasy tactics its still tons of fun to play
highly recommendedis that a joke
this game is fantastic and still fun todaybasically it is like shining force  where you get people and can upgrade them
you get a choice for most of your characters and each game you can try different jobs to see what you like
this game has alot of memorable characters and pretty nice graphics
the story is also impressive and stays interesting
ive played it numerous times and still love it
do i reccomend this game
of course i do
will you get your moneys worth when you buy it
yea you will starsthis game is one of many that i am taking the liberty to review that i have owned now for atleast five years
vandal hearts vh is a one of a kind game
even though there is a second vh out there is no link whatesoever in the two stories
if you get sucked into this story dont expect anything after the end because thats all your getting
that is really the only bad thing about this game because everything else is great
i am now going to give you a low down on the gameyou are playing the character of a man named ash
he is the head of a security force for a local governement
the game starts with you pretending to be merchants taking goods across to another town when your suddenly ambushed by cutthroat thieves
little do they know is that they were the ones ambushed
when you suddenly reveal yourselves and attack them first
from this point on in this game the strorie becomes very interesting
eventually your sent across the sea to discover the wherabouts of a missing person and then to ancient tombs and just about anywhere else you can imagine
along the way you pick up allies that help you along the waythe intersting thing about vh is the battling system and the way you upgrade your units
first you start with a basic class
like archer knight sorcerer priestetc
then you can upgrade their classes once they hit a certain level
in this case levels  and   the only person with a special job class is your hero ash
also he is the only person with the opportunity to upgrade three times instead of two
the problem with this is that you have to unlock six differnet keys
one for each chapter and then you have to hope that you can defeat all the enemies behind each of these locked doors
if you can do that be can upgrade to the ultimate class the vandaler
this class is godlike
you basically become damn near impossible to killthis game is wonderful and very intense
i suggest you order this from amazon as soon as you can
this game is awesome and will make you very happy to have bought it
one of the main reasons for that is the replay value
it is very high
higher than most games created by konami
enjoythis is one of my favorite games ever
the charcters are great the job system is wonderful and the story music and graphics everything is great
everyone who is a fan of any strategy game especially final fantsy tatics would love this game
also it is very easy to learn the battle system and the job system
i dont think it should have gotten the mature rating the only reason for this is because when you kill somebody on the battle field all these red squares burst out
buy this game you wont regret itplayed the second one first and had to have just so hard to find it shipped fast and was complete and in great shape
recommend playing if never played and you like older system gamesvandal hearts is definitely one of the sleeper hits of the year
no one expected it to be a great game as it wasnt hyped up before its release
but konami put something into the game that usually helps fun and addictive gameplay
vandal hearts claims to be an rpg but it really isnt
actually its a strategy game with rpg elements and a story intertwined
unlike command and conquer where you can have hundreds of units at a time in vandal hearts you usually have around  but rather than having units with identical abilities each of your characters have different skills spells and strengths that set them apart
they advance in levels again making vandal hearts look like an rpg but all it really does is add more spells and raise endurancefor every ten levels you advance you can choose a path of study for your character
for example when your archer reaches level  you can either have him become a bowman a more skilled archer or a hawknight a flying spearwielding character
since your characters can be different every time you play vandal hearts has some unprecedented replay valueduring the actual strategic part of the game you navigate bitmapped characters throughout a polygon map
the maps range anywhere from really small to quite big  it can take up to  minutes to get from one side to another
the landscapes are varied with mountains and valleys
the textures that are slathered on the polygons look great and the bitmapped characters and enemies fit in like a charm
the spells dont look quite as good as final fantasy  but they are still really cool
vandal hearts did receive a rating of mature and there is really only one reason for it
when you kill an enemy even if you just poke it with your finger an arterybusting spray of blood is released
although it may be a little gratuitous it sure does look neat
the game is turnbased and you navigate each character individually
because of the vastly different maps and buildings that would block your view of the action you can rotate the camera around  degrees as well as switch from a blimp view to a side view and everything inbetween
the camera is really intuitive not hindering the game at all
before you decide to start moving your characters and spewing some blood you might want to observe the landscape and plan out your attack
because you can see the whole map from the beginning having an actual plan can be extremely helpful
i can attest that blindly running around attempting to kill things doesnt work as well as youd think
the music is an orchestral score that will definitely get you pumped up into killing the baddies
the sound is equally as good squishy blood sounds and the clashes of metal upon metal are all superbly done
the sounds that accompany the spells also follow suit and you wont be disappointed by leaving the sound turned up loudthis game is so ridiculously addictive youll soon find yourself taking time off from work to play it
its combination of a good story great control and strategic play set it apart from all the other games on the market todayt the arcade game is a great arcade rail shooter ported to the snes system
it is a sidescroller arcade shooter the terminators and you move sideways while shooting in a pov manner
the upgrades are great
the beauty of this game is how it is not a complicated game but very enjoyable
the straighforwardness of the game does not make it boring or take away from the experience
it is a casual game and based upon its merits a very good one for its time and still todayi remember back about  or  years ago when arcades where more around this game had me hooked one of the best shooter games for its time its easy to play but pretty difficult to beat on one player still fun though thanksif you dont think a game where you fly star wars star fighters is awesome then youre worse than six bags of hitlersconcerning xwingi remember getting this game for my birthday way the heck back in   the missions were so fun and challenging now this is a word that most people in the computer game industry seem to have forgotten
the appeal of this game for me was that because it took so much time to completei think i managed it in  years the victories were all the swetter when you wonnowadays you can just type in a cheat code and skip to the end well keep in mind that such a thing did not exist on the old dos machinesxwing was the first but later on lucasarts improved the engine by adding tie fighter thats right a game where you play on the side of the imperials this also provides some very challenging missions but can be beaten with much more ease that anyone could ever beat xwing
still fun just as enjoyablenow xwing vs tie fighter brings us relatively up to date combing elements of both games what you have is a game that is more useful for multiplayer than single player missions
this is finally where the age of this type of game in this type of format began to show
most of the missions in this game were just repeats of the same missions in xwing and tie fighter
although the graphics are better and there are one or two missions that provide a great level of enjoymentif any of you old dogs out there are still using  or  pick up a piece of gaming history and get a copy of this packagei own all the titles within here collector editions of xwing and tie fighter and have xwing vs tie fighter but i heard in this package the two previous games carried xwing vs tie fighter engine viewage but im not so sureother than that
the games are all good
using dosbox and a joystick you can indeed play xwing tie fighter and xwing vs tie fighter on your windows machine vista to windows  you could probably find a few mods around that ease visualsof that i can confirm the working part
i dont got a joystick to test the control part i got the game last night and from the secondi began the installation process i knew this was going to be awinnerthe cutscenes are fantastic lucasarts knows how much gamerslike these little rewards for their work and effort and the opening sequence is nothing short of spectacularthe gameplay is superior
it would be nice if there were an option to slow it down or even pause it but hey this is quotrealtimequot strategyno such wussy options here
the quotholographic interfacequot the gameplay screen through which you control your troops is actually pretty easy to get used to and is incredibly flexible at the same time
you can get dirtside with your troops and watch a stormtrooper run past you as he fires his blaster at the rebels while a atst comes traipsing up from behindsound and music are equally spectacular
endwhat can i say i love star wars so this was a game to play with cheat codes of course although a few of them doesnt work but it is still a good game i completed it in  days loli have been eagerly awaiting this game for more than a yearnow and now that its finally out im not dissapointed
awesome story video graphics sound and smooth gameplay combine to make this an amazing game
the levels are a reasonable difficulty level and it intertwines with the written star wars stories without blatantly contradicting or ignoring them
although it doesnt run great on my system because i have only  megs of ram it is still reasonable and on my friends new computer its amazing
all rts or star wars gamers must have this gamethe downside as mentioned in the previous view is what makes this rts different from the rest
this game uses a system of quotcommand pointsquot instead of the usual resource gathering of every other rts game out therethe command point cp system works like prestige points
destroy enemy units gain cps
occupy enemy structures gain cps
achieve mission goals gain cps
this was done in order to force the  player to use combined arms instead of the cliched quottank rushquot  tactic used in alot of rtss like command amp conquer and clonesthe  units in force commander work like a quotrock paper scissorsquot way
you would not want to storm your opponent with  atats because they suck  against infantry namely the rebel infiltrators which can takeover an  enemy vehicle just like chewbacca took over the atst in quotjediquot
so of course to counter rebel infantry you want to use fast moving  atptsyou lose cps for not using what youve got so basically its  like if you just sit around and not do anything you would lose prestige  points with your superiors
achieve your goals and thus gain cpsgame  mechanics screen resolutions up to  x  x  d accelerated d  floating camerazoom out to a birdseyeview or get right down on the  ground with your troops
classic john williams soundtrack remixed with  modern music ie heavy rockto start off this review id like to say that this game will mostly only appeal to fans of myththe fallen lords and myth iisoulblighter
but anyways this rts realtime strategygame isnt like starcraft
you dont  pump out soldiers from a compound you dont take huge groups of soldiers  and attack the front of the base carelessly and you certainly dont  quotjust attackquot
you start with a group of soldiers choose who  fights in your epic battles and then you strategicly place your units  across the battlefield
you then attack at the right time and pray to god  that your enemy hasnt noticed any movements in any sides of your  ambushyou get a wide variety of units
most of them come straight out of  the movies but considering there are  something units youll get some  that are plain new
the story is pretty diverse and is a very good one so  i wont spoil that for ya
this game features stateoftheart graphics in  beautiful full d worlds
everything comes to life around you in the  battles
sound iswellif youve seen the movies you know what the  sounda are quotreallyquot supposed to be like therefor the game does  the sound well but if your new to star wars then youll have a hard time  trying to find out why things sound like they do
gameplay is what this  game is all about
its downright fun
you command huge at walkers and you  can just watch them trample the enemy while they retreat helplessly
you  can see infantry just storming outposts annihalating everything in their  way
also the camera is fluid not fixed
this is a game great fan for true  rts fanseverywhere you look people are enjoying taking out little green men with a pistol
oh well
xcom has been proven to provide great entertainment for this who enjoy being a mib
control bsaes and protect them from attack
monitor the world and keep major cities safe from the scum of the universe
control up to  soldiers in a turnbased combat mission where every move your people make my be their last
research new and startling technologies in your biology and physics labs and put them to use in your manufacturing plants
be careful that you dont spend too much time researching and not enough time in combat
the countries of the world are footing the bill for your little operation and should they fall under alien control kiss your much needed funding goodbye
vast array of weapons terrain maps enemy aliens vechiles and ufos will keep you busy for a good  hours or more
if you liked this game then get the sequels for them made for your ibm pcbuy this game
you wont regret itim not a fan of strategy games
ive never been into populous civilization command  conquer or anything resembling
however i cant stop playing this game
every year i pick it up and start playing it againyou are at the helm of a multinationally funded ufo defense team
your goal is simple protect earth from the oncoming insurgency and ultimately seek and destroy the source of the invasion
aside from the strategic turnbased combat sequences you will control all aspects of the administrative efforts
sink your fingers into the purchasing of supplies design of bases hiring and firing of personel the armament of your aircraft for shooting down ufos and most importantly which alien technologies to research and incorporate into your arsenalcombat sequences boast a fully destructible environment a rarity in classic gaming
need to get down to a lower floor
blast a hole and drop down
if theres a tree blocking your view turn it into kindling with a well placed shot then take aim at your newly exposed enemies
you can even level a hill if you have the firepower
the designers should be proud they thought of everythingif you try this game you will discover a new lovea few years ago pcgamer made a list of the greatest pc games of all time and suprise suprise guess what game topped the list
xcom ufo defense and it well deserved itthe game even when played today still shows its greatness
ive logged probably more then  hours of gametime playing xcom and its many sequels over the years since it first released and the gameplay still amazes meif you love strategy games and for some reason havent tried xcom   find a copy of it
the pc version is way easier to get a hold of then the ps version and is a better port of the game anyway if you loved games like final fantasy tactics campc warcraft or less recognizable classics such as dune  and the more recent disgaea hour of darkness then you owe it to yourself to see what youve been missingas with the details the other reviews do a great job so ill just leave you with this  ive played just nearly every tactical combatrpg ever made and xcom is by far the bestx com is the best strategy game ever made if you have a ps and the cash get this game its well worth the priceive been playing this game for months now
i was surprised at how much fun this game is
if you have a playstation one you have to get this game
if youre a collector you have to get it or your collection will be incomplete
it is addictive and will suck up hours out of your liferts games did not exist when xcom was released or least i have never heard of one from that era and good stratagey games were even harder to find i could be corrected by a moor fan
when it was released xcom became the reason i invested so much in video gamming
the computer ai was nothing special but the other little touches like surprise fire from windows and quotfog of warquot to name only a few overcame the ais weakness and forced you think about who to put with who and where on every mission
fire teams fire teams fire teams
if you want to live through a mission deploy in fire teams of no less than two with mixed weapons and always have someone under good cover ready replace fallen members
if you just cant get out of the s and s when it comes to video games and you long for those old great strategey games then this one for youfirst off this is an extremely great game for those who liked metroid and wanted to continue the story of the game
the game is a really great game and is what you have come to expect from the metroid series a really fun game
the concept of the game revolves around the idea that samus goes to the a planet to investigate some kind of investation
this turns out to be metroids a class of aliens she encountered in the original game and you must go through and wipe them out from the planet before they have the ability to spread
the graphics of the game are relatively good for the time the game premiered coming out in the early s but the game is still a fun game despite the matter of graphics
playability is pretty simple as it is a simple control scheme that anyone can quickly get used to and the entertainment factor keeps you playing for a while when you are in the car on a road trip
as far as replay value it is pretty cut and dry
the game progresses through and begs you to beat it so eventually you probably will
anyway i enjoyed this game a great deal or i wouldnt have given it five stars and i recommend that you try to pick it up so you could have a little slice of metroid joyi seriously believe metroid ii return of samus is an underrated classic
we all know about the weak abilities of the game boy and the horribly dated black and white graphics but when you consider everything else about the game succeeds who cares about graphics at allyes this game succeeds in numerous aspects
lets take a look at themthe sound
alright sometimes the music you hear is nothing more than scrambling awkward bleeps and whatnot but you know what
those bleeps work
metroid is a space shooter adventure game
those sounds are entirely appropriate in this particular case
you think about those kind of sounds when you visualize aliens spaceships and distant planetsoh and while some sounds in the game are not very organized other sounds actually form somewhat of a quality melodythe gameplay
arguably an improvement over the first metroid because here youre introduced to items such as the boost ball the spazer beam the plasma beam and the spider ball in addition to all the regular items from the previous game
at least here you dont have to search for the long beam haha
that always feels weird to me when i play the original
searching for a long beam is one of those things game developers realized wasnt necessary anymore thank goodness
so they stopped putting them in metroid gamesanyway yes the wave beam ice beam space jump screw attack bombs its all here folks
i honestly cant believe such an old game was able to include all these items
amazingthe exploration aspect of a metroid game is always a very important thing
maybe even the most important thing
without the ability to explore a huge planet theres not much left in the way of adventurousnessluckily despite being a game thats nearly  years old the focus on exploration was included hard and heavy
however the way the game is designed without spoiling anything its more like youre exploring certain areas of the planet before moving on to other areas
thats how the game plays
still a strong emphasis on exploration was in fact implementedi love battling the  or so metroid creatures
each one of them basically serves as a boss fight at least thats how i treat them because of their relatively high challenge required to take them downtheres four varities of metroids in addition to the normal ones you encounter at the end of the game and honestly they are pretty difficult creatures to take down successfully
if you mess up just a little bit and dont aim for their bodies properly you will pay for it by taking considerable damage
even the ones you discover early in the game are surprisingly tough
i love it
thats how it should bei also love their high level of detail and their animations
hey they look intimidating to me
thats how i know they look cooli love how each of the metroid varities you come across become tougher and tougher as you make more progress and go deeper and deeper inside the planet
the ones that spit fireballs and dart around the screen at a pretty good speed are what nightmares are made of hahatheres a great deal of suspense in the atmosphere too
people underestimate this aspect of the game
the suspense comes in accidentally stumbling across a metroid and having to quickly prepare yourself for a fight
sometimes while exploring and stumbling across a metroid you wont have enough health or ammo to take it down which adds to the suspense a lot more
i cant tell you how many times i just barely had enough missiles to defeat a metroid
the games not very generous with health either
you will find yourself barely surviving plenty of times i betthe enemy designs are pretty cool considering this is a game boy game
theres snakes that come out of the ground theres plenty of other creatures that remind me of rippers from the original metroid hermit crablike creatures that wander back and forth and theres even a laserspitting robot in a few sections
those are just some small examples
many of the enemies from the original return as well
the bats are probably weak though
just look how tiny they areto give the graphics some credit they really do perhaps unintentionally add to the atmosphere and the loneliness of being on some faraway planet by yourself
this is a pretty underrated aspect of the game i believeso yeah metroid ii return of samus has many cool features that honestly takes quite a few hours to complete
if theres a weak point in the game somewhere i honestly cant find it
just buy this great game used
do not pay over  bucks for it though because its not insanely good or anythingwheater you play this on a gameboy snes superboy gba or gamecube player this is a must play for nintendo fan metroud fan or fans of solid platforming metroidvania yes there is a reason metroid got its own terminology hybrid name son absolutely loves this game he can keep playing especially when hes bored and nothing to do
interesting as i like it tooi bought metroid ii the day it came out back in  and since that day it has been my favorite gameboy game and one of my favorite games on any system
the graphics were far superior to its nes predecessor which made me love this game from the start
the game play is extremely easy to pick up and very responsive to what you want it to do
and the levels are vast and fun to explore for a few hours
lets face it it doesnt get much better than playing as samus and shooting up the metroidthis game picks up where the original metroid left off
you are samus aran and you work for the galactic federation to fight evil
lately the evil has been a species called the metroid
in the first game samus defeated the metroid on another planet including the mother brain
in this game samus travels to the metroids home planet to take em all out
this game really stands out compared any other black and white gameboy game and it even rivals new gameboy color and advance stuff
the metroid series is one of the best nintendo has to offer and i recommend anyone buy a game that boasts samus aran as a charactereven tho i got the beat up lookin game pak it still works good as new never froze on me and i liked it it was pretty fun too bad i sold it lol i didnt have the urge to play old school games but i bet later on in a few years i will go back to the old times hahawhen the game boy first debuted in late  i was immediately addicted to tetris and super mario land  until metroid  came alongafter a long  year wait the nintendo designers released a sequel to the nes metroid and put in on game boy
i still remember the commercial that came out back thenif you thought that the metroids were all but extinct think again
after samus defeated the evil mother brain she now has to set out on planet sr
as you progress through the game samus will eventually come across some mutated versions of the metroid family
in fact theres  forms  alpha gamma zeta omega and the mother metroid
each form is increasingly harder to defeat and yes you will need missiles to defeat them
samus will also come across new weaponry that wasnt in the first installment including the space jump and spider balli love the opening theme song followed by the excellent euphoric soundtrack when you first start the game
unfortunately you dont get to hear the latter song enough in the game in most of the areas that you have to explore there is no music but rather  just silly sound effects
and a surprise treat  before you reach the final metroid the mother metroid herself you will have to contend with  original metroids
be sure to use the ice beam followed by  missiles in order to effectively kill them the ice beam does not apply to the mutated metroid forms
once youve finally defeated the mother metroid you will get a surprisecliffhanger ending that will eventually be crossed over to super metroid for the super nes
so i hope that by the time youve read this you are already downloading this awesome installment onto your nintendo dsnow this is a fun game
i tell you what
this is a fun game
i got mine off ebay sorry amazon but the prices anywho the game is really cool
i think theres like  metroids you have to kill but the deal is yoru go though the disturbed planet fothe metroid sr and have to kill them all
and after you kill a certain amount theres this rumble and the lava in a big shaft room goes down to the next floor and this goes on for like  times
when you then get close to the lordess metroid so fine you have to fight i think  new metroids
which is a add on the prevoious  so technically theres   if you include the queen anyways then you anilate the lordess and for some reason on my game theres this weird red line on the wall but whatever it goes donw after teh battle and for some ohter reason theres a little excape hole under the lordess
so i guess you can wimp out and excape kinda ruins the point of a boss if you can jsut escape
but oh well after you defeat it
then a baby metroid hatches jimminy crickets where do all these things come from
fun never ends with metroid   but then you escape the terrifing planet and go to your ship
the end review darn good gamevery enjoyable game
if your into the metroid series this is a must have for your collectionmy son highly recommends itnow this was one of gameboy classics best game 
the graphics were actualy really detailed for the gameboy
the the play was really smooth
it was not too hard or too easy it was just right to make it loads of fun
i still find my self playing the game on my gba once in a while
only prob with this game 
is i beat it in  hour and  minutes after  trys
the game is way too short
but well worth the moneyi played this originally as a kid but had to get it again
it brought back memories of how challenging portable gaming was before touch screens and color
its a must get if you want to relive the glory that is the d metroid seriesgreat love it very pleased for this order hope to make more orders in near future thank you for muchnote i downloaded the ds virtual console version of the game recently but this review is largely based on the hundreds of hours i spent playing it on gameboy
 someone will surely disagree with that title
and there are plenty of good reasons to
after all gameboy tetris doesnt have any of the features that were added to later versions of the game like tspins that count for points or back to back tetris combos
it doesnt even have the win at round  mode
you just keep going in game awhy would i say that then
nostalgia i guess
to me its what tetris is supposed to look like
this is the first title available for the gameboy but could the graphics have really been any better
the blocks are very detailed and have a great style to them
the entire game looks great on the original gameboys green screen
its a style that you wont find available in any game today and looking at it with modern eyes the game comes across as very uniquethe chiptune music is a lot of what makes the game stand apart
you can download newer versions of tetris on your computer or maybe for your ds and most will have remixed versions of melodies that were present in this game
but its not the same
theres a certain beauty in the simplicity of tetris three melodies
also the flow of each song is different enough to provide enough variety your blockdropping which is really niceconfession back in the day i never played the player mode in tetris and to this day i still havent
who had gameboy link cables prior to to the existence of pokemon
im sure its fun but i cannot speak to its qualityfun game
plays perfectly on a gameboy gameboy color or a gameboy advance sp
no problems with the game at alli play this on my gameboy color and its super addicting and challenging
a must have for any one with a gbgbcthis is tetris
i always loved this game i played it on my gameboy since i was four
i grew up playing this game and i never got tired of it
my only complaint is if you want it dont order it on amazon buy it at a flea market or somethingtetris is one the best blockdropping puzzle games out there
heck it revolutionized that
along with arriving on nes it also plopped onto the portable game boy
it has all the same content as nintendos nes version but with an addition of a player versus mode and portability on that classic green and black pocket buddyin this platformer you navigate wario marios evil counterpart through fun platforming goodness
with interesting powerups  such as the bull helmet and dragon helmet to deal with enemies
you can also simply toss them tackle them and jump on them
the jet helmet helps you traverse the level swiftly
garlic replaces the supermushrooms in sm also
this game is as good as i rememberbottom line  its a fun game and i highly recommend itthis was by far the best super mario land game
warioland had brand new gameplay all new levels and great fun to play threw
finding the treasures was a blast the bosses were great and wario is awesome
i have nothing bad to say about this game
nintendo makes the most fun games and wario shake it on the wii is a wonderful addition to this series
awesome job nintendowario first appeared as an antagonist for super mario land  and he proved to be worthy enough to be the subject of the third sml which is kind of a misnomer since mario only  makes a cameo at the ending
i wont spoil what happens but its pretty funny
instead wario begins his own series which is to say is quite fungraphics its an original gameboy game so it has as much color as the first clerks movie
still the sprites are not bad looking though wario kind of looks weird especially without his classic hatmusic catchy bit tunes mostly
i always liked wls musicstory it doesnt explain whats up in the game and i dont really remember much about the plot so ill try my best to sum it up
in sml wario takes over marios castle
and of course mario kicks him out at the end
so a distraught wario looks for treasure at this island which has areas named after food and such
the antagonist is captain syrup a woman who is the leader of piratesgameplay it has the elements of a mario game plus more
wario can charge into enemies pick them up and collect hats that act as powerups
one hat allows you to do a butt stomp one allows you to breathe fire and the last allows you to soar in the air
when wario gets hit he turns small just like mario
you can also use your coins you collect as weapons and you need to use them to beat levels and get to checkpoints
at the end of the level you can play one of two games where you can either gamble to double your money up to three times or play a throwing game for lives
your remaining money in the level  adds up to a total and at the end of the game the treasures you can acquire adds up also
the castle you get in the end depends on how much money you get
there are also hidden exits in some of the  levels in the game and theres even a secret worldbuy this ones a keeper
though short its quite good for its time
you should also check out the other wario games because they are unique on their own ways toointro wario was in his canoe when suddenly a duck on a large ship appeared wario was shocked and started to chase this duck around and around several times until wario tricked the duck and smashed in to the front of his ship and then the title appeared and wario gave everyone his cool looksstoryline wario must save the great princess syrup from an evil genie of which is the big boss of this game wario has to go through many challenging and fun worlds in order to reach the last world it is very challenging and there are lasers shooting at you
wario has to avoid many dangerous creatures such as ducks devils with swords duck heads that bounce up and down as well as many other helpless creaturesgraphics for it being an original game boy game the graphics are great
the only things better they could have done for the graphics and creatures is i see a few creatures on the cover that i dont think where actually in the game itself and the graphics for the last boss the genie the graphics are terrible being the last boss and they shouldnt make each boss opening be waves and several other weird intros that have nothing to do with what the action in the game is aboutglitches every game has glitches but this game just has too many glitches such as start b and then you get a bull hat frog hat or jet wario
just way too many to think of off handmusic the music for an original game boy game is great but i dont like when you die the creatures still move around in the background and the music is still going for quite a while after your death
for the most part the music is pretty decent i especially like the train ride music as that matches the train levels perfectlylevel design the level designs are pretty decent however there is just not enough to say due to the fact that there are so many glitches practically a glitch per level the only ones without glitches are the train levels and those are my favorite levels so they are sound sometimes the sound is poor not much to say as sometimes it gets jumblyplease get this gamejrthis game been around longer than my younger sister
i started playing it then i realized this started all wario adventures
for anyone who never play this before be warned this functions like mario than later wario games
you can collect treasure and coins to raise your money
you will find out in the end if you maxed out
you can see the beginning of warios style and gameplay
i recommand this nice pick if you are either a wario fan a mario fan or bothi have wl an  but i beat all of them
i played this a long time ago first wl game i played at friends house an i wanted a copy but gamestore didnt have copy of game at the time but they had wario land  so i got it wario land  and the gba didnt come out yet then when gba an wl came out i got that but my friend didnt manage to get a gba but got wl luckily an i played an beat it an thats how i beat all wl games
i played super mario land but not the nd one but i didnt really like it its just me thats all
an a few days ago i got this game at gamestore
u should get it too cuz it leaves off after marioland  i know the plot from end of smlwl ill explain the  storyend of sml mario defeated wario an got his castle back and warios attempt to take over marioland failedwlsml wario realy wanted a castle but didnt know how to get one until he remembered a rumor about a gang of thieves forgot name stole a giant peachtoadstool statue that mario  yes mario was forever  lookin for an wario thot if he found it first he could sell it for  to the royal family so he headed off for his goldand castle of coarsethis is where u come in to help wario on his journeyyou can get this game at some gamestop stores here from a seller ebayetc
its not that hard to find really an  is a good deal for this game
wl is the easiest to get then wl then wl in my area but wl is quite difficult to findhave fun with this gamethis game you must have in your collection instead mario you be wario  trying to save the princess from an evil geniethe wario land games have been a pretty longlasting series of bashing enemy throwing pouncing fun but would you ever believe that the series started out as a conclusion to the super mario land trilogy
the gameplay has changed so much from super mario land  although you can probably still tell it was made from that games engine that it may as well go into a series of its own in the first placeremember how extremely bizarre the worlds were in the previous games
well wario land is no different when it comes to that but what it actually brings you could make you think what the heck
 and not in a bad way either
these new landscapes are very interesting and fun to explorealong with warios regular bash attack wario can collect powerups to replace it such as a dragon hat that blows fire a viking helmet that upgrades warios bash attack and gives him a ground pound move and a heart more on that belowthere is a heart counter in which when you reach  hearts you earn an extra life
you get these from killing enemies or collecting them from powerup boxes as  heartsas you earn more coins and treasures you could change the games ending scene depending on how much you have
wario could buy several different representations of his moneywise condition from poor birdhouse to extremely mouthwatering rich mansionall of those new gameplay quirks make the traditional gameplay pretty unique making it stand out from the other entries in the mario land or wario land seriesthe game starts off as the classic donkey kong arcade game with  levels then after you send dk falling down the collapsed building instead of winning you then have a whole new game to play
several levels and worlds that make you think and plan out how to move taking the area enemies and variables into account
i played this as a kid and just got it on my ds eshop and i love it just as much
i only have one single complaint
you cannot pause during the final battle
thats the only complaint i have from what i remember
great game awesome characters a fair difficulty and i feel this game demonstrates the classic rivalry of mario and donkey kong better than the original arcade did having many more levels and showing how creative donkey kong can be years agoi bought a game boy pocket and bought my first game of all time donkey kong years laterim become kick ass great gamer and i find donkey kong while looking for zelda four swords and i still have fun playing it
the classic first four levels the puzzling quest for keys and the final battle at the top of kong tower or whatever the hell they call that tower
anyway buy if you want to it
its a good gamei never played much of the mario vs donkey kong series and saw this on the nintendo eshop on my ds and thought eh looks like a port to the original arcarde game only in black and white which is lame
like many others i was so wrong
i read more into it and figured id shell out four bucks for the download
best four bucks i have ever spent
you start out with the original four levels arcade the last one included which was left out in the nes version
other than the improved appearances of the characters and backgrounds of the original game only in black and white or if youre using the super gameboy peripheral for the snes color with the arcade cabinet and slightly improved sounds
at the end of the fourth level you defeat donkey kong and save your girlfriend pauline
you can choose to turn off your gameboy or exit the game on your ds or you can let it play out as donkey kong rises back up smashing the ground making you mario aka jumpman and pauline fall
poor pauline falls into the arms of that donkey of an ape and chases off with your girlfriend marios secret girlfriend dont tell peach
you have to chase after him in  more worlds resulting in  more puzzleplatformingi have yet to beat this game but im having a blast while doing so
if you have to go with one version of donkey kong get this one
it has elements from the original donkey kong donkey kong jr who also makes an appearance and of all things super mario bros  there are other notable improvements such as the ability to do backflips performing a handwalk to deflect barrels and even jumping further down from one platform to another just not too far
this game pretty much laid out the groundwork for the mario vs donkey kong series and is the prequel to them
yes this is the first of this series so if you loved those games you will love this
 levels on a mario platformer for less than  bucks is quite a bargain
snatch this up when you can whether it be for your gameboy system super gameboy for snes gameboy player for gamecube or even on your ds
i found the cartridge of this game along with a super gameboy peripheral for around  bucks altogether so i could see how good the super gameboy improvements were
its about as good as it gets but even though its only in black and white on the ds i would recommend that one because you dont have to worry about the battery save dying and it has restore points you can bounce back on
i recommend either cartridge or download
pick up this gem if you love mariodonkey kong games
its a great addition to add to your collectionthis game is one of the best donkey kong games ever
if you like the mario vs donkey kong series then youll definitely love thisthe premise is simple go through various obstacles with jump man more famously known as mario and dodge the baddies find the right path and unlock doors to get closer to resquing the princess from donkey kong
its stiff fun and it seems it will always be relevant in pop culture
its awesome with the super gameboy adapter for the snes which has its own themed arcade cabinet border and it gives it color
 great game highly recommendeddonkey kong was originally an arcade game in the early s that nintendo put out to gain exposure
it turned out to be a hit with gamers and it was soon ported to and was one of the launch titles for the nes in  nearly ten years later nintendo released the sequel to the hit s arcade game for the game boy
simply titled donkey kong it was a runaway smash for nintendo as it was a puzzle platform game with the original  levels from the arcade game plus  brand new levels exclusively made for it
it sold millions of copies and is a fun game that will take you hours and hours to completedonkey kong sticks to the same story as in the arcade game you control mario who must navigate a maze avoiding traps and enemies in order to reach pauline and rescue her from donkey kong
after you clear the original  levels donkey kong kidnaps pauline again and you chase after him through multiple worlds each with its own theme and levels
now the main goal is to find a key in each level and use it to unlock the exit
to update the game and keep things fresh mario can use new moves weapons and items to take out the enemies
he can even use ladders and flip switches to gain access to other areas of the levels
once you finish a level or use all your lives you are prompted to save your progress so you dont have to start over once you turn the game offthe pros this was a proper way to make a sequel to an arcade game that helped put nintendos name out there
everything in the game worked and every aspect of it complimented each other
playing through  different levels was impressive and it never felt repetitive
the new features that were never in the arcade game helped kept the game fresh even though the goal was always the same
on top of that donkey kong was one of the first game to take advantage of the super game boy peripheral that nintendo released for the snes it played all original game boy games
it did that by coming with additional colors and an exclusive border screen when you used the super game boy to play the game and it looked fantasticthe cons nonenintendo would continue to release similar games on their other portable systems as it proved to be successful with critics and gamers alike
if you like puzzle games andor are a fan of the original arcade game you had to pick this up
if you havent played it it is worth searching for a copy so do it as soon as possiblethis game is one of the only games i have that i can beat
you can save on this game unlike other game boy games like terminator  judgement dayyes that is all everyones favorite gorilla can say after playing this its amazing this is a combo of mario vs dk  donkey kong  mario bros  super mario   one shocked gorilla how did they fit all this into a gameboy game plus three save files
well dont ask me buy the game
well what are you doing still reading this review
buy it now or ill get some barells kidnap pauline againits a classic game that should be owned by all gameboy lovers
its the best version of the game toothis is one game everyone should try
inspired by the original  arcade gamedonkey kong expands on the original game by adding more moves better graphics more enemies levels and overall fun
this game alone helped inspire the creation of the mario vs donkey kong series
it is great for mario fans and gamers alike
i would recommend this game to anyone with a gameboy or gameboy game compatible handheldthis is a classic but now with more new levels and stages new moves but the same gorilla and the main character marioremember back in the arcades when donkey kong was an incredible hit
and then every game system back then got their own version of the game
well it has been  years after the arcade games release and nintendo was developing a new version of the game for game boy
at first glance youd probably think donkey kongs already been released on several classic consoles already
so whats the point this one
but if you look at the game itself youd go buy it alreadydonkey kong has  save files
when you start the game you get to play through the  levels of the arcade game
but after beating donkey kong in the level with the disappearing yellow platforms you saved pauline right
wrong
when i saw dk get back up capture pauline and run i was amazed and my mouth dropped
mario was running after the big age
and now the real game startsthe main gameplay has mario go fetch a key and then use the key to open up a locked door to move on
the levels are clever fun to play and just downright cool
in fact mario can use acrobatic skills to help him through the levels
he can somersault flip and perform handstand jumpslater donkey kong jr comes into the scene and helps out his daddythe graphics are great especially when played on the super game boy
with the super game boy theres a border around the game that makes it look like its on a donkey kong arcade machine
the graphics also shine during the final boss giant dk
he looks very cartoonish but that is how the game is supposed to be cartoony and fun
exercising somersaulting mario vs a huge king kongsized dk on top of a big buildingthe music and sounds are also very good
the tunes are memorable and who doesnt love the sound of collecting upsoverall this game is truly amazing and its also one of the game boys besti bought this on my ds using club nintendo points and i dont know how i missed it before
the game was very large difficult and creative
i always hated the original arcade donkey kong
mario died if you fell off a ledge yet he could withstand falling off of planets in mario galaxy his hammer was useless because he could not climb up a ladder and it only had  levels  in the nes port
this game fixed everything
mario could fall to the next platform but not all of the way to the ground he could throw his hammer up and then climb a ladder before it fell and the game included  levels
every level seemed to put marios moves at full power he did a hand stand climbed a vine grabbed enemies etc
after about  levels mario faces donkey kong  which gets really interesting
one boss level was the first level donkey kong jr another ironically had jr flipping switches for his dad and in one mario had to climb up a massive bunch of ledges carrying a barrel to throw at dk
every time donkey kong would grab pauline and run away
the soundtrack is ultra catchy even though the bit tunes can be weak at times
if you dont play this you are missing out on the worlds greatest puzzles and challengesmario is the king of platforming but donkey kong is probably the prince
the story is funny cranky kong saw the success of donkey kong country and said it was because of the graphics and said they would never make it on a  bit system but they did and the graphics push the gameboy to its limit
it is a great platformer with great graphics for its timelove itin a world where there were cds companies like sega and do had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a cd giving the games enhanced graphics and sound
there is one company however named nintendo and it created donkey kong country
donkey kong country was a game that proved that you dont need cdbased technology to make games with flashy graphics
you just need to put in effort to fit it to your console
how will that work on bit systems thoughfans often overlook this as a remake of donkey kong country
unfortunately for them they are missing out as this is actually a sequel
the gameplay and graphics are the same as the snes game but the levels and worlds are different
is the story the same
no
in fact the story is about according the manual dkcs success
cranky kong claims that the game only sold well because of the games fancy graphics and that kids would buy anything these days
a funny story to a satisfying gameactually the graphics are eyepopping on the oldschool game boy
even if the characters blend in the backgrounds a little playing the game on a game boy color or advance helps them stand out betterthe sounds and music were memorable
you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of kongo jungle
now that its composed in bit it would appeal to nes fans as wellthe game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels
once you go to a level youre gonna be expecting barrelblasting kremlingsmashing animalromping fun
as a platformer it doesnt disappoint with its gameplay
you can even ride atop an animal buddy like a rhino or an ostrich
rhinos can knock everybody out of its way while the ostrich guides you safely across the level though it also kills enemies
it can also float in the air like racoon mario in super mario bros one thing i gotta point out is that there is no candys save point in this game
instead youd be able to save your progress by collecting the kong letters in a levelthe whole game is just a lot of fun and id continue playing it ever after beating itoverall this is a really great game boy game
you should get it for any game boy system you havei can still remember reading all the articles about kirbys dream land  in nintendo power back in the mids
i had never played the first kirbys dream land because it was very hard to find where i lived and i sure didnt want to miss out on this installment which had  animal friends to help kirby
everything about the game looked great it had some of the best graphics on the gameboy kirby had a ton of powers the animal friends all had their own versions of powers and the game had a secret ending that could only be seen if you collected all the rainbow drops
yeah i couldnt wait to play this game and i ended up getting it with some of my birthday money the year it came out
no other game had my attention until i beat dream land  this really was the best platformer thatd come out in years and im happy to say that it still holds up  years lateran evil forced named dark matter has stolen the rainbow bridges that connect the rainbow islands and possessed king dedede in order to take over dream land
its up to kirby and his  animal friends to defeat dark matter
however in order to truly get rid of the evil doer you need to collect a rainbow drop from each island
if you dont get them youll still defeat the possessed king dedede at the end but in the credits dark matters silhouette appears with question marks where his name should be
dont you want to get rid of the real bad guy
of course you dogameplay in kirbys dream land  is easy to get the hang of
a is jump b is inhalespit and pressing up while jumping lets kirby float around
he can also shoot out puffs of air while flying to defeat weaker enemies
throughout the levels there are different kinds of enemies and a lot of them have unique powers that kirby can absorb
press b to suck in the enemy then press down on the dpad and hell take their power if they have one
kirby can gain abilities like having an umbrella to help him float and defend from air attacks a fireball that lets him dash through enemies and objects needles that let him essentially turn into a porcupine a boomerang and several others
but the star of the game is the ability to get an animal friend to help you out
rick the hamster coo the owl and kine the fish are all here to help kirby with each one having their own obvious benefits
rick is great on land and cant slip on ice coo flies and is so good that the game is super easy if you keep him around at all times and kine makes swimming easier but is very slow on land
and as i mentioned earlier they all have their own takes on kirbys powers
where kirby would just have one boomerang that goes in front of him coo shoots three feathers in a spread shot that is very useful for taking out multiple enemies and obstacles
kines version of lightning lets him charge a lightbulb in his mouth then shoot it forward when b is released and you can detonate it by pressing b again making a kind of explosive shield
its a blast seeing all the powers for the animals and i still get a kick out of seeing ricks rock power where he turns into a boulder and kirby rolls it with his feetthe game never gets very difficult but its never so easy to the point where you get boredunless you want to be cheap and keep coo around
i love that owl and all but since you keep the animal friends until their health is reduced to zero or you get rid of them yourself a lot of people will want to keep them since they act as extra health too
the stages are varied and get longer as the game goes on with some leaving a little room for exploration instead of being linear
and figuring out which power to have in order to get out the rainbow drops from their storage rooms can be a little bit of a challenge
but hey these days you can just look up an faq or walk through video and figure it out but back in the mids this was tricky
people who love the old mario games especially super mario world will love kirbys dream land the graphics and music are both fantastic with this being one of the first games that i really wanted a soundtrack cd of the first being donkey kong country of course
but theres one nitpick i have with it and its that if you have one of the animals with you the normal stage music is replaced by their theme
all three of the animals have cool themes but hearing the same music for every stage gets old and there were times when id turn the volume off because of it
still theres not a bad track on here and coos theme is still one of my favorites to this day
man that bird really has it all doesnt hewhat else can i say
the only bad things about this game are little nitpicks that i had
it can be cleared in a relatively short time has a great variety of stages and powers to get and is a perfect game to play on the go
no gameboy collection is complete without kirbys dream land  i know the chances are slim but if they could rerelease the game and fix the animal theme takeover problem i had color it up to look like the snes kirby games and maybe add a few more levels id have no problem buying it all over againwith the success of kirbys dream land nintendo went to crank out a sequel to the million selling title
in  kirbys dream land  was released and it too was a smash success
essentially a bigger and better game kirbys sequel pleased all game boy owners who bought the game
its still just as cute and fun and was a must own back thenyou once again take control of kirby and this time a form of dark matter has taken over dream land
kirby and his new animal friends take off to stop the dark matter in its track by exploring new levels filled with old and new enemies
just like the first kirby game his main power is to inhale everything and then spit it back out at enemies
this time he can now absorb the powers of certain enemies to make it his own and he can team up with his animal friends rick kine  coo
and just like the first game kirby can pick up health items to restore his energy and ups to earn extra lives
but to make it to the villain of the entire game youll have to collect rainbow drops from all  levels
after you complete each level the game will automatically save your progress and you have unlimited continues should you use up all your lives before you complete the game
as an added treat when you pop in the game on the super game boy peripheral it has its own colors and border screen to use during your play timethe pros nintendo took the first game and expanded it into a brand new game while keeping the same concept and controls
it paid off big time as kirbys dream land  is even more fun to play
the graphics looked great and the new music is as cheerful as ever while the controls work just as good as before
adding abilities to kirby like absorbing enemy powers and teaming up with animals adds new twists to the gameplay
there are more levels and they are longer now so its not as short as the first game
the battery backed save and exclusive colors when you play the game on the super game boy round out an overall excellent gamethe cons its a little bit more challenging than the first game but not by much
its still a fun game that you wanted to play again and againso if you got a working game boygame boy advance track down a copy of this game
youll have fun playing this game and if you got kids they will enjoy it too
it is well worth your timei like this game is that kirby has some help to back him up in the game and it funive had this game for a long time
it has  worlds
every world you go the harder the game gets
in the last world in the last stage you have to get these special people and eat them to get a special ability
it will be tricky because there are two doors in each place so if i was you i would write it somewhere
then after the last football you face king deedee
after you beat him and if you had gotten the last football an evil spirt comes out of king deedee
first he is a knight then he becomes a eye
you will get a sword with all the footballs combined so you could beat him
i did not know that until a few years ago
but this game rockslove any donkey kong gamesdiddy kong and new member diddys girlfrienddixie kong are off on a long dangerous adventure to save the leader of the dk crew
diddy kong and dixie kong must go through  dangerous and challenging levels to get to the lost world where king k rool is located this is also the place where you save donkey kong
when king k rool is running jump over him if you hit his crown then you will be at a major risk of killing yourselfget this donkey kong land game it is the most challenging and most interesting of the three
i have all  and i played them a lot the first one is very dull and has loads of glitches and horrible graphics the pixels on the screen of this game are all choppy because of the limited colors these games offerdonkey kong land nintendo game boythe game is donkey kong country but for the original game boy
the graphics are pretty bad considering it was one of the later games in this library and the game tends to be slow and messed up at times
the game itself isnt that bad however it is just that the graphics ruin the gamedonkey kong land  nintendo game boybest of the series
more challenging levels play as diddy kong or dixie kongdixie can fly when she is in the air her hair can do a helicoptor
this game is very fun the levels where you have to go in the ocean are more fun in this game if you are a person who likes action packed games this is the one for youdonkey kong land  nintendo game boythere are many levels in this game where the levels are boring but the music and graphics are great in this one
if you like something fun challenging classic and you get your full value this is the game for you
many new creatures kiddy kong and dixie kong are the playable charactersbuy donkey kong land  because it is fun and flawlessthanksjr
plattthis is a very cool game
i think it is better than donkey kong land  in dk there is  levels and collect  dc coins
you get to be diddy and his girlfriend dixie kong
the cool part is that dixie kong can fly with her hair spinning
this is a very cool game and it is just like the one in the nintando systemas any capcom guy would know megaman is the hardest game series the company had ever created
ever since the original nes version it was hard
but it was still a great game
the game boy version released after the nes sequel was no exceptionthe game boys smaller screen caused some slight changes to the formula
for example megaman seems to have slightly less hp than in the nes games
however theres less in the games layout too
so it kinda evens outthe sounds and music are also sounding different
well the music is carried over from megaman on the nes but different bit instruments are used
some sound effects are totally different such as the mega buster soundsthe game has  robot masters compared to the nes games  even though the game is easier than the nes games its still pretty hard for people that arent hardcore megaman fans
if you are one of those people itll take a while to get past all the robot masters and reach dr wily
the precise controls the tricky pathways and difficult situations are all present
fortunately once you reach a robot master its possible you may beat him right away or you lose a life or two and then beat himthe downside to the bosses is the weaknesses
they are off
for example when i tried fighting iceman i used firemans power reasonable right
 but it didnt do a whole lot of damage
then i tried elecmans power and it took him out in  or  hits
edit never mind
this isnt actually an error
in dr wilys stage things are just plain unforgiving the first time you play through it thank god for passwords
there will be spikes in places you least expect traps that seal you to your doom etc
also before you fight dr wily you must battle  more robots from megaman  nes game
be sure to get your powers ready because youre in for a short marathonbut after this you go through one last level
then you reach dr wily at last who is actually pretty easy once you get this pattern down use quickmans power to shoot off the his robots mouth and then use the energy buster to reflect wilys lasers while avoiding a roboclaw that reaches for youall of these events are packed into  levels of run n gun fun
yeah its possible you can beat this game in  minutes but at least you will have fun doing itoverall this is a really great game for the classic game boy
if you have a game boy a game boy color or even a game boy advance itching for some classic megaman action this is the game for you
if you are new to megaman this should be a good place to start other than the game boy sequel megaman iithere are only  playable characters but it is still alote more better then mortal kombat a must buy gamecould someone please tell me what year killer instinct takes place in 
is it  
is it somewhere in between    ad 
is it  
fanboy i want to freaking know already 
it better be the year  had this when i was young
me and my brother would play this all the time
just so many good memoriesyou cant have a snes without this game
this is a must buy
this destroys any of those stupid mortal kombatski has always been one of my person favorite fighting gamesright behind mortal kombat iithe charactersstorylinegraphicsgameplay and soundtrack was just so great that this game quickly became a classicif you own an snesand if you love fighting gamesthen you need this game for your collection
you will love itduring the bit age the original era of video games were platformers side scrollers beatem ups shoot em ups and the occasional great puzzle game
then mortal kombat and street fighter  were met with extraordinary success and the next thing you know fighting games are all the rage
of that we saw good and bad
some of the good games included are the mortal kombat games the street fighter  games and a game like primal rage
some of the bad games were titles like the legendary terrible shaq fu ballz d and double dragon  one game came out that was very different and actually probably the best fighting game not named mortal kombat or street fighter  that game is killer instinctsome would even go so far to argue that killer instinct is actually the best fighting game of this era
while this claim is merely an opinion its definitely worth noting that it is at least as great as the best mortal kombat game
the backgrounds were very nicely animated and the music was vastly superior
all the character sprites look good and the characters were pretty unique and cool
however i would be remiss if i did not mention the major selling point of this game which is its unique and fantastic combofighting systemin a game like street fighter  or mortal kombat you would rely heavily on your ability to combine special attacks with toptier mastery of the fighting moves
to achieve a respectable level of skill at killer instinct requires you to master the fighting combinations
there are auto combos juggle combos and some very cool methods of stringing them together to make a more damaging and longer combo
no matter how good you get at combos though if you are going head to head against another toptier player who is capable of executing a combobreaker at will the tables can turn very quicklythe characters were a very refreshing addition to a genre quickly becoming stale
spinal was a skeletal warrior with sword and shield fulgore was a vicious and violent futuristic robot combo was a punishing boxer and riptor was a violent raptor just to name a few
on top of the really neat combo attacks each character also had a complimentary set of special moves and even a finishing move
but the one thing everyone remembers and loves most about this game is the ultra combothe ultra combo was a lengthy auto combo that you could execute after landing at least a threehit combo
if you could pull this move off when your opponents lifebar was nearly depleted it would result in you totally owning your opponent in a torrential downpour of pain landing brutal hit after brutal hit after brutal hit
in video games there were few feelings as satisfying as pulling off this move and watching your opponent get thoroughly beaten
after that the game voice would even scream ultra
just to cement the momentthis was a game where players could get legitimately competitive
constantly trying to oneup a friend by executing a tough  or  hit combo could become very intense and nothing spelled out ownage quite like executing an ultra combo on a friendlastly i thought that one of the more interesting things about this game was the black snes cartridge
you really didnt see that many colored cartridges during the super nintendos lifespan but the fact that killer instinct was released as a black cartridge was appropriate and so cool lookingeverything about this game is above average
the characters the levels the really awesome music and the most excellent gameplay make this one of the better snes titles to own and easily the best fighting game of this era to owni hadnt played this game in over decade as i made the dumb choice of trading it in for a zoids model kit from japan and a huge box of dbz tcg booster packs
anyways the game is your basic entertaining mortal kombat clone with fun yet overly entertaining wtf humor to it
i would not suggest this to children but for teens and adultsi practically play this every day and i still havent gotten tired yet
nothing can beat this game this is the best game ive reviewedthis game is so fun and addictinggraphics  pure eye candy
beautiful sprites and backgrounds
very colorful
really good for a  gamesound effects  great sounds slurp wah
ohoh  although marios crying gets annoying sometimesmusic catchy especially boss the final boss music
gameplay  kinda like smwonly you play as yoshi with baby  mario on his back
you can shoot eggs eat baddies shoot seeds fight bosses and dont lose mario
also find items in levels to unlock secrets and bonuses
its very addictingdiffulcity medium
this game can get tough at times coughcoughverylongcavecoughcoughreplay value  ive owned this game for many many years and i still pop this game in from time to timebuyrent
 well you cant rent snes games anymore so buy it if possible
if you dont have  an snes or you cant find it you can now buy super mario advance  for gba
it contains yiconclusionthis is a great game
a little underratedps
why is amazon editing my review
stop editing it
anything in   means amazon edited itmany of you are familiar with the first ever mario game on nintendo and super mario world on super nintendo
for those of you who have never played super mario world  yoshis island you definitely should
nintendo changed this game a lot form the previous version but didnt ruin the amount of fun it providesin yoshis island you are yoshi and you go through the levels with baby mario sitting on your back
if you get hit by an enemy then you lose baby mario and he starts to cry but you have  seconds to get him back
if the timer runs down to zero he is kidnapped and you lose a life
as yoshi you can eat the enemies and they become eggs which you can shoot at other enemies and at bonus clouds that hold coins stars or flowers
every red coin that you get that is hidden throughout each stage it worth one point to your score
each star you collect adds one second to your timer
and each flower gives you  points
if you collect all  flowers in a stage you get an extra life similar to collecting the yoshi coins in the first super mario world
you can earn up to  points for each level  for all the flowers  for all the red coins and  for all the stars
if you get  points for each level in the game you can unlock secret levels that are really awesomethere are many stages in this game
in all there are  levels in the whole game only half as many as the original super mario world game
after you beat each stage you jump into a hoop and a light starts going around the hoop
if it lands on a flower you get to play a bonus game if not you just advance to the next stage
it takes a while to get used to this game if you are a veteran super mario world player because this game is so much different than it
if you own a super nintendo and dont own this game yet go to your nearest used video game store and buy it you wont regret itthis is very original when compared to previous mario titles
the gameplay is much different than super mario world or any of the nes marios
dont expect anything groundbreaking here just expect an enjoyable time with nintendos boss dinosaur yoshi
no bs just a straight up good game
for the young ones and even the old timers
peacemany have said that this is one of the best games on the snes
this is very true but i must say that quotyoshis islandquot is one of the best games in history
even though i will admit i didnt like the game when i first saw it
my cousin used to play it and baby marios cry really got on my nerves
since then i played the game for myself and it was all good
after mastering the controls which doesnt take long i realized that you dont hear baby mario crying as much
simply because if you know how to play you wont lose him losing him makes him cry
you have up to  sec
to get him back or your game is over
now i must say the graphics are sweet
i love when yoshi eats the white puff ball things and the graphics start looking all trippy
at any rate this game is one of those keepers that all true gamers cherishi gotta go im about to fight that giant turtleyoshis island ruled
when this game first came out i went and baught it
god it braught back some awesome memoryyou play as yoshi and have baby mario on your backi wont tell you the rest of it since you can just read other reviewersthis game is friken awesome and fun as hell
the game is not a tad bit boring and the game is quiet long well i cant remember since i played the game about what  years ago and im trying to find a snes system for like now since my snes broke down er just broke awhile ago but i happend to borrow a friends snes and this game friken rocks the house manthe game play is extreamly fun and the characters are greatespeccially baby mario
he rulesover all i would give this snes masterpiece or  in amazons reviewgo out and buy this incredible gamebesides super metroidif you can find itlaterthis is perfect for anyone wanting to play bit or bit nintendo products ie
nintendosuper nintendoworth it to me just for punchout and tecmo bowlfzero is probably one of the best racing games ever made aside from the classic mario kart
racing against the other opponents is fun racing by yourself is just as fun the level designs are awesome and the music is still great and goes well with its environments
the tracks are challenging and the experience is very rewarding and fun
simply if you own a snes go pick up a copy of this gamethe best racing game ever
why
the controls
this game is very easy to control
which is a huge thing that is missing from every other racing game i have ever playedyeah its an old game for super nintendo but its the greatest racing game ever made in my opinion
i think the graphics are very impressive for its time and it is blazing fast for a snes racer
the music is also fantastic techno the best music ive heard in a racing game and better than most games in general
the vehicles are pretty cool each having advantages and disadvantages
there are many difficulty settings and many courses depending on the difficulty setting you chose
beating the game on the hardest difficulty can be extremely difficult especially at the later courses
the only rip i have on this game is that it should have been two players and after you beat it so many times beat it on the hardest settings it gets old i played it non stop before i mastered it now it isnt nearly as entertaining
but for when it came out it is definitely a classic and to this day i think it is the best racing game everfirst off everyone needs to keep in mind that this game came out a very long time ago and in no way should be compared to todays racers
with that out of the way on with the review
fzero is set in the future where racing is done with hovering vehicles that reach speeds which are insane
this is an extremly fast paced game which can be a lot of fun
heres the breakdowngraphics for a  bit quotlaunchquot game this is pretty good
the colors are nice and bright the vehicles and tracks look great and the backgrounds can sometimes be distracting in a good waygameplay the first thing you will notice is the freedom you have with your vehicle
its like trying to skate on ice for the first time   once you get used to the frictionless feel you can start experiencing some serious speed
the controller setup is perfect and the controls are crisp
you will be hitting break neck speeds but still be in control of your vehicle which feels great
the game offers  different vehicles and around  tracks which include insane obstacles like mine fields jumps and magnetic fieldssound i personally really enjoy the music in the game
each track has its own beat and it really goes well with each theme
the sounds of the vehicle engines explosions and the whizzing of passing another vehicle all sound terrificstory does it really matter
i dont want to rag on anyone but honestly for the person who reviewed this game below and bashed the game for having no story wake up
did you honestly play fzero or any other racing game expecting a story
gran turismo is the most realistic and best selling racing game on the market does that have a storyline
if you want a storyline play an adventure or rpg gamechallenge getting used to the feel of the vehicles and the speed is one challenge but the game has multiple modes with increasing difficulty
there are knight queen and king circuits which are composed of  races each
obviously king is harder than knight
there are  difficulty settings with a th unlockable master setting
learning the car physics is one thing but try fire field or silence on master and youll know first hand how difficult and challenging fzero can beoverall bottom line this game is fast and fun to play
with fzero for the gamecube right around the corner the original makes for some great classic gaminglove those classic gamesf zero is one of the reasons why you should own an snes
it is beautifulit is very fast for  bit and the levels are all classici dont understand how people can say things like this game isnt very fast or the vehicles run as slow as a turtle because i think this game is so fast that sometimes its very hard to control your vehicle in some courses like death wind and fire fieldthese people may not know that you get an extra boost of power that you can use after the st lapthe music too is classic super nes at its bestfor as old as this game is it still looks and sounds great and for me the gameplay remains as fun and as fresh as it was in this game is different than the other f zero games that came after it in that when you get ahead of the other racers or get first place you get a  up which makes it funthe challenge is when to know to boost and get ahead of the other racersoverall i say if you liked the other f zero games you should check this one out since it was the one that started it alllove this game
be careful when ordering though
be sure to order the snes version
not the famicom version
unless you own a famicomfzero is known for showing off the super nintendos extremely graphically impressive mode  technology which was beating off the genesiss socalled blast processingyou select from  cups or in this case leagues each with five futuristic coursesyou start with  lives
if your car explodes you will lose oneeach of the tracks sort of have their own gimmicks most notably death wind mines and rampsonce you cross the finish line you can use an extra boost that you earn every time thereif you are losing health be sure to steer towards a healing areaall of the gameplay would most likely resemble super mario karts gameplay but this game came out right before itone of the first game ever for the super nintendo
if you was born after than the you missed out on the nintendosuper nintendo era
believe me after playing ataris pole position and then nintendos rad racerfzero is a whole new way of racing
the colors the music the fun factor is great being in the early skids cut school to play fzero
classic gamecollectors itemi love f zeroto me its one of the best racing game series everget f zero for the gamecube play it on your nintendo wii silly
and get f zero for the nintendo  also available on the wii virtual consoleget them today
best racing funas a child i played many hours of fzero on the super nintendo back when it was at the height of graphic gaming
though always a bit disappointed that no twoplayer option existed i still had a lot of fun mastering the controls and trying to perfect the different coursesfastforward about  years when it comes to racing games fzero still holds up for a number of reasonsthe graphics though obviously not state of the art anymore still look really cool and unique
the whole hoverracing concept was truly oneofakindthe music is perhaps the best soundtrack ever created for a video game
i can play tracks over and over again just to listen to the musicthe tight controls
i dont think ive played a racing game to this day where the controls are so tight
this creates a fairly high level of difficulty as there is little margin for error but it makes for an experience that stands the test of time
at one point in my life i was playing this game on expert level
after not playing for roughly  years i can still slip back into the general feelbut have to start back at beginner again
basically the controls are just difficult enough to never truly be able to master while just simple enough to be able to get the hang of them fairly quicklyoverall fzero is one of the best games ever produced for the snes
its cool concept great music and endearing controls make it a game that will last much longer still
its many sequels have been hitormiss but none have ever quite lived up to this incredible originali can understand in some ways why some people seem to think i despise good clean fun because of my bad reviews for a lot of kids games
nintendo classics like this are reasons why i got into games in the first place and why people who have this perception of me are not right
this game has a lot of fun tracks that are noticeably absent from its successor some characters not featured as racers in mario kart  like koopa troopa and donkey kong jr multiplayer is lots of fun just like its followup and it has endless replay value
though it may not quite be as good as its successor it still is way to much fun for even the most mrated infatuated gamer to resistbuy this game if you have snesit has  characters for you to pick from
many items to hurl throughout the racing course
but perhaps the best thing is the wide variety of game types such as battles and racing in different tournaments
there isnt much to this game but what do you expect from snes
besides you dont want anything added to this game
this is the perfect mario racing game for super nintendoi always liked this game i used to play it all the time when i was a kidhowever completing this game   good luckive only done it once in my life and its so frustrating that i never want to do it againthe computer players also cheat when you are in first place they magically always catch up to youthis game is much more fun to play with a friendthis is a very fun game great especially when playing with two players
but still as fun with one
there are the classic powerups and levels that many gamers have fallen in love with
it is still as fun as it was back in the day
highly recommended to any racing game fans and mario fans alike
if you want to see where mario kart all began for those of you who have played the gamecube and wii version then bask in the goodness that is super mario kartplay this all the timebrought it out at a party and it was a hitoriginal mario are the bestwhat i love about this game is that you can decide on if you want to test drive the courses alone and just go for a joy ride or you can race and set the difficulty level
i love this game
you can choose between mario luigi princess toadstool yoshi fave bowser donkey kong jr toad and koopa troopa
going with one of the smaller characters always works in your favor as they seem to move fastergreat game i owned it once now buying back retro games for my kids to enjoy
brings back lots of fun memoriesever since super mario kart came out it has been a favorite snes game of mine
super mario kart is the best racing game ever made for the super nintendothere are  different modes you can play in this game mario gp grand prix time trial and battle mode
in mario gp you can choose form eight different characters form nintendo games mario luigi princess yoshi toad koopa donkey kong jr and bowser
then you can choose to race in the mushroom cup the easiest flower cup or star cup the hardest in cc cc or cc mode
cc mode is the easiest to race in but in cc and cc the computer gets a lot faster and more challenging
after you win a cup you will earn a trophy
if you beat every cup you will unlock a secret cup which is very difficult
in gp you can play one or two playersin time trial mode you race in any course from the mushroom flower star or special cup and try to set records for the fastest lap andor racein battle mode you and a friend choose a character to battle against each other
you drive around a course trying to pop each others  balloons
you pop their balloons by shooting green or red shells at them or throwing banana peels at them
this mode is very fun especially if you get tired of gp modeif you are looking for a great classic racing  game for the  super nintendo super mario kart is the game to geti bought this game as a kid friendly game for my children
as it turns out our whole family myself included plays the game
it has become a staple for family fun night
i would recommend this game for anyone of any age
i am very pleased with this purchasethis is the best nonserious racing game for snes
pick from eight racers mario luigi toad bowser koopa donkey kong yoshi and the princess
then pick your difficulty and one of three circuits that you want to race on
each circuit has five racetracks each is severely detailed from start to finish
the ghost houses have ghosts everywhere bowsers castle has thromps to come down and crush you
you can pick up items along the way like mushrooms that give you a huge boost of speed stars which make you invisible and shells that you fire at the other racers
throughout the game you can even add to the fun by earning extra difficulties and an extra circuits with five new and cool racetracks like star road
the only downfall is that the game is quite dated because it is for snes and there are versions for gamecube n and gameboy advanceits just as you remember no different lol
but still fun for groups who are retro an into snes
i play it with my gfthis game is so much fun the tracks all have there own unique features and each character adds something to the game
the weapons are the best
if you have a snes still and dont have this game then you need to buy it todayracing games have been a staple of the video game world for years
this game combines just the right mix of silliness with racing to be fun for everyoneyou can choose to be one of  nintendo characters from mario and luigi to the princess donkey kong jr or yoshi
the object is the same as any other racing game be the first to complete the race in this case five laps
along the way you can pick up objects to help you and hinder others like turtle shells banana peels or the invincibility star
keep winning and you move upthere are three sets of tracks and two speeds for each so there is plenty of variety to keep you entertained for a while
plus you can race the computer or one other human opponent
the head to head races are the most fun because your friend will offer some surprises that a computer wont
finally you can always battle it out and try to be the first person to knock your opponent off the battle fieldthe controls are easy to get used to
i may not be as good at it as my friends but ive spent many happy hours driving around these tracksi first played this game in about  a couple years after it first came out at a friends house
at this time mario kart was one of the most popular games for the snes
my friends and i would have tournaments though usually on battle mode
we liked yoshi and peach because their turning ability was better than the others but we used toad and koopa troopa during races because of their superior control at driftingone thing i liked about this game the most is you needed skill more than luck to win
you didnt have blue shells or clouds hampering your progress
i have to sayeven now at  it is still one of my all time favoritesits here 
i t got here so very quickly
its in really great condition
thank you so much and i hope to be doing buisness agian in the futuremario kart is an exclusive snes game which features many of the familiar characters that make nintendo the best developer in the world
race on tracks against an opponent or the computer or battle it out in battle mode using heat seeking shells or banana peels among many other projectiles
this game is great fun for any age and it is one of the best games made for the snes
this fact is obvious due to the demand for each new version that has come after this one
battle mode is one of the most exciting and fun features of this game and i still play it often today
if you run into this at a gameshop pick it up you wont be sorrymost fun game ever i played this game nonstop for about  years its great in  player this was the game that literally made me and my friends go from being innocent quiet nerd boys into blood thirsty savages
if you fire a red shell at me i will punch you in the mouthi love this game
my only lament is that they wont bring out a second and third one just like it with different races and boards
i havent yet played the wii version when they bring out new versions for new systems they always try to change and improve and in doing so they usually make it worse
ths game was great
not too childish difficult enough to be fun easy to control
if heaven exists god is up there playing like  sequels to this that are all equally good but differentthis game was ans still is the best
the racing game is pure fun
all there features that were available at the time in  because back then when i was  that was all the techonlogy we had at the time 
on here you can choose from i think  racers
mario luigi toad
koopa troopa
who i  also love his finsihing musickoopa troopa and donkey kong jr bowser king koopa and more
the best tracks tome are vanilla lake choco island
mario cirucit and donut plains and ghost valley and last but certainly not least is rainbow road i mean this had to be good this is the mario kart game that started it all
so go out and buy this game nowdid you ya buy it yet
lolonce you get past the semiweird steering youll begin to realize that the first of a terrific series of kartracing games has a lot to offer
you get to race in around  tracks as your favorite of the eight playable characters and use items against cpus or your friendim pretty sure everybodys favorite item would be the star
i mean seriously who doesnt like itthe player battle mode is where you and your friend pit against each other and throw random kinds of stuff at each other until one of you loseoverall do you wanna see what was first kartracer has to offer
go ahead and buy ita very fun game that i remember playing with my cousins back a couple decades ago
play it with a friend it brought back lots of fond memoriesthis version of super mario kart lacks the cleverness of the newer versions for the more modern consoles but in my opinion the pvp action in this one is easier to assimilate and easier to navigate which means the business of bursting each others balloons is the primary objective not constantly trying to find each otherthis boils down to the chances of prolonged nailbiting chases and wellearned escapes or wellearned kills is higher where on the newer versions the sudden ambush is the chief encounter typei cant speak for you but i much prefer to be in chases or duels in close contact with the enemy as soon and for as long as possible so that tactical driving skill is paramountpossibly the best use of a super nesthis is a classic game
it doesnt any better than this except for maybe mario kart 
this took me back to when i was younger and played games on my snes
its just the same as it was back then pixels catchy music and allreally good times with this game do much fun
one of the best game for the super nintendo
a must have for any true hardcore nintendo fanlike many of the super nes games it has super in the title and uses the standard color scheme of green red blue and yellow
that being said it was an innovative game where you could use banana peels and turtle shells against your opponents
successful updates came in the form of mario kart  and mario kart wii instead of rehashes these future games expanded on the concept and had original tracks
but to see where it all began you need to play this
if you do not own a super nintendo download it on the wii
well worth iti had so much fun with this game and it was great now a days getting drunk and us trying to play it we had a blastexcellentthis game is the perfect game for nesi love driving all the courses and i love the cupsand the people you can drive
you can drive marioluigidonkey kong jryoshitoadbowserkoopa troopaand princess toadstoolpeach
you can play a normal game or battle with friendsthis game is really fun its a totally mustbuy for your sneswhy
well its a racing game with nintendo characters ok its not super smash bros melee but there are many fine characters in super mario kart
there are many options of racing thoughout the game but the characters are eight mario luigi peach bowser toad yoshi koopa troopa and donkey kong jr i like to race with mario most of the time
there are three kind of championships in the game the star cup flower cup and the mushroom cup
there are indeed many choices of racing in this game
with or without other cars one or two players its all up to yougraphically the game is not one of the best but its not bad
the soundtrack is great
it goes from happy melodies  of the game until sourt of scary ones like in ghost valley one of the racing circuits
its useless to say every possibility this game has and its great replay value
no need to read this review either i hope it was helpful but just go ahaed and buy this title
i know its a little old but its much better than many nowadays gameswithout a doubt this is one of the greatest games of all time and one of the greatest snes games period
the hype is much deserved and this game is addicting and fun
it was one of the first video games to take on a nonlinear style and use heavy exploration to gain powerups
the result is a game which will be both tedious and amazingly fun
i cannot recommend this game highly enough to you fellow review reader
the bosses are amazing and the graphics are superior
it shows just how gourgeous bit can be
the replay value is amazing and you will always have the joy of beating it faster the more you play it
this game made the speed run what it is today
buy it noweveryone remembers metroid for the nes and its sequel for the game boy metroid ii return of samus
well third times the charm for this series as samus aran must hunt down and capture the metroid larva that had been taken from a security lab
once again she battles through zebes
read on to see why this is the best metroid game in the series and why i think its the best game on the systemthe goodthe capabilities of the snes allowed super metroid to far surpass its predecessors with cooler and smoother graphics eerie music and more areas to explore
samus simply looks awesome in this game
the map is huge and you will spend hours finding hidden stuff and more enemies to blast
there is also a wall jump technique here thats introduced
i was also enthralled by the extremely large bosses in this game
these are probably the biggest bosses in any game
the story is also very engrossing and has good use of flashbacks to previous metroid games
wow
i cant emphasize this game enough wowthe badwhat bad
thats right noneoverallreading other reviews on amazon and metroid fusion in particular i cannot believe all the reviews metroid prime is getting
dont get me wrong its certainly a good game but it is nowhere near the quality of this game
by far this is the best the super nintendo ever produced and it is therefore the best in the series
sure the graphics may have aged note to you gamers just because donkey kong country followed less than a year later does not mean it couldve been better with those types of graphics but who cares
this game is a masterpiece
dont be washed by away by graphics buy this game
its a keeperfor some reason i never played this game back when it came out when i was a teenager
i recently got back into video games and have been playing through all the highest rated games
i wanted a break from all the d games
i wanted to play d character that could go extremely fast and i definitely got what i wanted in super metroid
i liked the size of the game in terms of how long it takes to beat and all the interesting items you acquire
there were a couple parts in the game where i got stuck and had to look up what to do next
and there was an ability i dont want to spoil it that was very aggravating to try to use
but the small problems i had with the game werent enough to stop me from giving it  starssuper metroid aka metroid  was the only metroid game released for the snes in  and continues from the previous game released on the original game boy portable systemthe game starts off showing cut scenes of samus dropping off a baby metroid at a laboratory only to rush back and find ripley a long time villain of samus breaking in and stealing the baby metroid
you briefly control samus fighting him off and then escaping the space station before it explodes
you fly to a mysterious planet and here is where the game officially beginssuper metroid expanded on everything that made the series so revered by introducing brand new elements that appeared in future metroid games save portals map system new weapons and missiles
this game is huge so it will keep you busy for hours
the graphics and sounds are excellent and showed what the snes was capable of
the controls took advantage of the snes controller since it used every button but after a few minutes you can control samus without any problems
til this day i still kick myself for not buying it when i had the chance to
the only thing i was able to do was to download this great game to my wii from the virtual console service
all nintendo fans especially metroid fans should check it out
the snes had a great great library of games and this one ranks up near the topif you didnt play this game before you should do what i did and it will only cost you 
thats a bargain considering you will pay plenty more for the original cartridge
it is worth it either way so experience what other metroid fans have already and see why this title was and is still remembered as an excellent snes game
highly recommendedsuper metroid is without a doubt one of the greatest games i have ever played
the soundtrack fits perfectly with its eerie atmosphere and the controls are fluid
there are a plethora of upgrades you can obtain throughout the course of the game from energy containers to new suits to be used with their perspective environments
the story is also entertaining enough especially coming from a nintendo game
the difficulty can be rather brash at times but fortunately whenever your character does get killed she respawns in the last save point you have usedoverall i highly recommend this to anyone that has a snes wii or a wii u as you can also purchase this title on nintendos virtual console as i had for the wiigrandson happy with it so i assume everything was okyoure samus aran on your third and best video game adventure as you return to the ruins of planet zebes
a sidescroller second only to castlevania symphony of the night super metroid can blast with the best ofem with  massive areas  different weapons a grappling beam xray vision no you cannot peak through her armor
 a swirlyswirl attack that enables samus to soar through the air a jumping ballcurl tons of welldetailed underling anemies and several excellentlydetailed boss enemies
are you still with me
you go all the way from the surface of zebes through an abandoned space station and dark tunnels and lots of water to the extremely hot pits of the planets core where you fight the infamous mother brain
im not giving anything else away though
you have to play this plastic little gem yourselfnow for the bad stuff like all her known previous adventures samus goes this one alone and unlike the the nintendo power comic does not interact with any other characters
this in my opinion can make the game feel kind of lonely especially when there is also no sunshine to brighten the areabut like the ratings i gave it this is a star game and should be fun throughout the ages
besides it stars the arguably best and best female video game character to date
go for itwords cannot describe how blown away i was by this game when i played it for the first time at the tender age of about  years old
being a huge fan of the original metroid for nes possibly the greatest game ever made or equal to this one i was frantic when i saw the commercial for this game on tv yep i still vividly remember the commercial even after all these years
when i finally was able to purchase this game i could barely handle the excitement
sitting down and playing it i was not the least disappointed
the graphics were amazing the music atmospherically beautiful and to be honest i was completely captivated by the awesomeness of samuss suit
i have played most of the great nes and snes games but none of them stand out in my memory as strongly as this one
i still remember getting stuck in brinstar for a long time because i didnt know pressing b made the character run
 this was the first game i ever played that had a run option i believe
i vividly remember looking in the instruction booklet and anxiously awaiting finding the powerbombs
anyway this game is just great so ill break it down for yougraphics wowthe graphics in this game were the best a console system had ever seen at the time
i believe this came out before mario rpg donkey kong and chrono trigger
it was the first game to go beyond  bits and make it to  bits amazing feat back then
the backrounds are great and while in the norfair stages the backround is wavey symbolizing the effects of the lava and extreme heat
the bosses are absolutely breathtaking especially kraid
instead of the little ittybitty kraid that was in metroid one this one has been totally redone and is bigger and badder than ever
samuss suit looks great and the weapons look awesome as wellmusic the music is absolutely beautiful and extraordinary
hearing brinstars green theme for the first time was just amazing and it is still stuck in my head
the more recent metroid game metroid fusion had a pretty low grade technoesque soundtrack but this game is totally different
the music is often times somber and sad sounding and often dark or mysterious
every single levels song perfectly fits that area
the music for the norfair area is quiet and dark sounding fitting the darkness of the area and the maridia music is very eerie and brilliant fitting for a water area
definitely the greatest soundtrack ever for a video game and even better than a lot of other musiccontrols  controlling samus is a breeze anyone can do it
she stops moving when you take your hand off the buttons and runs smoothly
you can also wall jump among other things in this game
like i said this is one of if not the first game to create the ability to run which as small as it sounds is a great thingfun factor yep you read that right
there are plenty of powerups to collect among many other things such as missle containers and energy tanks
ive beaten this game probably  times and it never gets old
in fact my snes malfunctioned recently  deleating my super metroid file i had recently started
i was near the end of the game when it got deleted but i still found myself playing it again without being bored or sick of it
in fact im glad it got deleted because now i can play through it again
seriously though if you do not have this game you are missing out on the greatest video game ever created and it isnt just for kids either im  and i still love this game after  years
i would also recommend getting prime and the first metroid
zero mission is also pretty good but be aware it is extremely short but still much better than fusion which was a total letdownthis game rocked
it was great
samus is back on the snes with new weapons new monsters a totally new world losts of strategy and hours ipon hours of fun with this one
honestly i could never find pars of this game that i didnt like because this is an all out great gameeasily one of the best revamped nes games super metroid is a must have for the snes system
really check out this game and while youre at it check out the other revamps for the snes like mega man x zelda  link to the past mario allstars and super contrahere i compare super metroid and metroid fusionif youre familiar with either title youll see how i feel it equates to the other
the short one line summary of how i feel
fusion is a great new title and far above what we see most of the time these days in the d world but it still isnt quite up to par with super metroid
just a few days ago i thought perhaps fusion was better than super metroidbut that would be incorrect
if you have a choice to get one or the other get super metroid
not only will you automatically get bragging rights to ownership of a game thats older than a great fraction of the worlds population and going on  years old but youll get the game thats easier on the eyes and a blast to playsuper metroids graphical appeal has sustained a frontal assaultmetroid fusion saw to thisand when we look at whats left it would be easy to predict that it doesnt hold up well
after all in a few significant ways this may be called the graphical update of the original famicom disk system game from  back before samus had blonde hair and back before the word metroid was seen by english speakers the next year metroid would appear on the nes she was fighting the same bosses after all using the same powerups and going through some levels that would look strangely familiar in that said put those fears to rest
super metroid is still the best sidescrolling metroid game and heres why
enemy designs and graphicsyes the games old and yes there doesnt seem to be as much happening onscreen as in fusion though in truth there is and at higher resolution too
however fusion has a few problems with character sprites looking clunky and genericnever the case here in super metroid
super metroid is unique in setting different tones throughout the gamesomething like horror on the space station wonder and adventure throughout the game and an admittedly touching ending
this is in no small part due to the ecellently created graphics
there are remixes of the original metroid enemies here but theyre drawn in a simple way
the backgrounds are still better than fusion the large cavern formations and falling petals from brinstar are greatfusion initially will seem like the superior game but bear in mind that the system has less pixels to push around
instead of quibbling about that think of this fusion is more prone to confusion than super metroid
this makes a direct impact on the next category
replayability and game designsuper metroid forced you to go here and there without making it feel too much like you were actually forced to do something
sure there were a couple spots where you could repeatedly hit that morph bomb button to blast up to places you shouldnt be able to reach without other equipment but overall it make you feel like you didnt have to go anywhere
the newer title unfortunately feels highly artificial
maybe they needed less planning and when youre locked into a nav room in fusion theres no doubt that youll be doing things in the correct order
the extra work put into super metroid certainly has paid off
the easily followed layout of fusion works on a handheld but on the super nes or the identical super famicom version so much more is possiblesuper metroid arguably has the better methodology for presenting a story during the gameafter the intro and story segments right up to the very end its all rendered using the ingame engine as were prone to say today
the art of giving the same old ingame sprites a character all their own and making us empathize with something so small is certainly an achievement and its rarely been done elsewhere
fusion as you might expect with gba cartridge sizes rapidly approaching the size of a good size neo geo cart in terms of storage space often adds cutscenessome frames good some in need of more colors
overall though that approach seems overly preachy with the nagging computer stealing far too much of your precious battery power
we understand nintendoits a common sin these days
musicsuper metroids music still stands the test of time
after listening to the gameboy originalesque soundtrack and effects of metroid fusion its certainly a relief to pop brinstar in your spc player or to turn on yer super fami for some bg music
either worksalthough you might worry about screen burn with the latter
this music counts as one of my top  game soundtracks of all time for its eerily beautiful accompaniment to one of the greatest titles ever createdyou quitly step out of your spaceship onto the sandy damp ground of an unexplored planet
suddenly a giant flash of lightning appears as it starts to rain heavily
you nervously look behind you
nothing there
in a hurry to get away from the rain you run under a near cave
after going through an old broken door another lighting flashes and an intemidating roar of thunder follows
you slowly continue to walk through the abondoned lifeless cave
a slight glisting of metal appears as you approach a peice of torn machinary
traveling depper you find the entrence to an old advanced shelter of somekind
after exploring somemore you return to this enterence spot
a flash of lighting lights up the place again and you find a giant insect mantis like creature staring right at you
in a hurry you fire your beam at it and destroy it
an earwrentching cry echoes the halls as you see there are tons more of them crawling on the walls jumping down from the ceilings surrounding you
in a hurry you attack them one by one and run to the cave enterence of the place
suddenly it lights up with life
giant crab like insects start crawling down the walls trilobites flee as the abondoned bunker becomes housed again lights flicker on and off and motion is constantly seen throught this once desolate and quiet place
only not one human or freindly creature is moving
thats basically the opening sequence of super metroid
constantly through this game will be intense and sometimes freighting moments of suspence
there is also always very satisfying action to follow
you play as samus aran who has really cool sumersaulting jumping techniques
also she can shoot something right at a pin of a target while sumersaulting through the air ten yards away
shes a really cool character with a really cool suit and a really cool arsenal of firepower to go with it all
plus a really cool game
most of the game will be taken up exploring places finding new abilitysweapons in those places and using those abilitys to gain acces to and explore other places
most of these enviroments are dark suspensefull and gloomy like the one described above
the game also features some inovative enemys that can be destroyed challengly and satisfyingly no matter how you fight them
it has some really great graphics too
but the one con and its a big one to is that after watching the opening cutscenes theres almost no story left
youll alot of times be wondering if youre supposed to be in an area or not supposed to be there with no real knowlege of where to go or what to do next
just little hints like youve accomplished a big task in an area and feel that the next big task is in another big area
other than that this game is a really great classic and should be played by all at least once
it really almost plays identically to metroid fusion so a learning curve would be very small since alot of people have probably played fusion by nowi have fond memories of beating super metroid on super nintendo
the graphics were amazing for its time and still hold up on mediumsized tvs
the amount of detail and complexity of the planet zebes still boggles my mind
if youve beaten metroid prime and want more i definitely recommend downloading this game from wiis virtual games menu and trying it outonly costs  plus tax to download via wii virtual console
note youll need a gamecubestyle controller compatible with the wii
wikipedia says nintendo released this game for just  cents in the middle of this year
still  isnt a bad price to pay for one of the best video games of all time
its certainly cheaper  and probably wiser  than purchasing an ancient snes cartridge that may or may not still workhere is some data and some static and other information about this game from the mid s area during the last years that supernintendo was in business before it was replace with the nintendo  for in between  and  discontinue around  maybe earlier
its popularity was also short lived
you can beat this game with only  shoit is if you find and use the plasma a lot on the bosses the special weapon given to you by the metroid that was captured which ironcially scarfices its self to heal you restore your health if you make it to the final boss fight against mother brain
unfortunately ike at ridely the first time when he cant be defeated mother brained iniaties a self desctruct seqeunce upon here defeat you have about  minutes to get out of all the chamber  on to your ship and off the planet or your toast
the original metriod  in the mid s was a big hit creating several sequels and prequels including metroid prim i and metroid prim ii
the first game is actuallu metroid prime for gamecube
also  samus depisite the characters brod shoulders look is actually a girl
if you die in the game super metrioid her armor dissapeares and she appears naked for a few second then you must reloaded the game from the last save point used which this player on you tube that posted this run neglected to use thank good he always healed inbetween bose fights picked up enough spare energy packets to beat all the bosses except for the two sub bosses in about and hour the world speed recorded for this game
also if you want to know ridly and kraid where destroyed before  super metriod in metriod ii return of samus for either gameboy or game gear ridly and krad were also boss in that game also but were somehow were clone or recreated
in between this game and the prequel metriod ii return of samus
got to i hope this information was helpful and interestingsuper metroid is one of my favorite snes games of all time
you first start off in a space station to rescue the baby metroid that was from metroid  but youre not able to because ridley escapes with the baby metroid to planet zebes
once again you have to go to planet zebes and beat the space pirates again but the terrain of zebes has changed quite a bit from the original game
mother brain kraid and ridley are back as well as some new main bosses arrive
before reaching the newly revived mother brain in the newly built torrian to the left of the original escape tunnel of the old torrianyou have to beat kraid ridley and the other two main bosses
in the room where you enter the new torrian there are big stone statues in the shape of the main bosses you have to fight that sit atop the entrance to the new torrian
after beating each boss the spirit of the boss you have beaten comes out of the statues eyes and flys awaythere are cool weapons and gadgets in this game
the beams you can get for your energy gun are the charge beam you automatically start off with the long beam on your energy gun throughout the whole entire game meaning it is no longer a separate beam to acquire the ice beam is back as well as the plasma beam and wave beam
one new beam that is added to the series is the spazer beam which is a threeway more powerful version of your regular gun youre better off using the plasma beam along with the wave beam and charge beam
other items added in are power bombs the grappling hook xray visors to look for hidden items or passage ways too bad the spider ball is not in this gameand super missiles and regular missiles
there are also different suits in this game too
you have your regular yelloworange suit you start off with the varia suit makes a come back and a new purplepinkish suit has been added called the gravity suit which allows you to move underwater with ease as well as more protection from enemies hits than the varia suit
oh i almost forgot you can also duck in this game before rolling into a ball
you can get the bombs that make you go into the air while in a ball
the bomb jump is easier to perform than in the original game where it is almost impossible to do
another added powerup you can get is the speed dash ability
you can use it to break away through certain walls and obstacles
you can also use the speed dash in the air to get to certain places you would normally not be able to
unlike in the future games where you can get also use the speed dash it takes away your health if you do it in the air in this game
when you get health in this game it gives it to you at the right time when you actually need it and not just randomly
if you own a super nintendo an emulator or a wii i recommend getting this game along with super mario all stars and super mario world or the regular super mario all stars mega man x  x super street fighter  turbo the donkey kong country series zombies ate my neighbor super mario kart kirby super star mario rpg etc
whatever you are interested ini was completely ecstatic when super metroid came out for the super nes back in   the nintendo designers built on all of the greatness that players already saw from the first  installments
the prologue from this particular title continues off from the cliffhanger ending that you may have seen from metroid  for game boy
samus will eventually return to the old stomping grounds of planet zebes with  new ideas to explore  crateria and the wrecked ship
every single thing about this game is just awesome times tenall new graphics and familiar locales should get players interested
but the euphoric soundtrack will really get you hooked especially when exploring brinstar and tourian
samus will also encounter her old rivals kraid and ridley
but dont think its an easy cake walk this time around  both minibosses are extremely difficult yet satisfying to defeat
and the boss battle music will get your attention no
the brand new weaponry that samus will acquire are super missiles morph ball jump super bomb and even the death defying grappling hook
you will need all of it to advance to  you guessed it  the return of the nefarious mother brain
as in other metroid titles going to tourian is usually my favorite part of the game
so once again you will need to freeze those pesky metroids and fire either  missiles or  super missile to destroy them
and after you reach mother brains lair its time to fire even more missiles at her cagebut wait  just when you think youve destroyed her for good the second time around  she arises again and transforms into a completely new body
time to take her out once more
by firing at her head however without revealing too much spoiler ie for anyone who hasnt picked up a metroid game a very sad ending will ensue after samus has given mother brain a run for her money
its still one of the saddest endings to the game to this very day
but dont let that deter you fellow players  download this game posthaste and you will be really pleased that you didone of my favorite games growing up
that first boss literally scared me due to his overwhelming size
crazy to see how far games have come when compared to current gamesnot as good as the original on the nes but metroid is still awesome just the same
love the older gamesso i had a real hard time deciding between this and grand theft auto vice city
this wins due to epic theme and the fantastic alien graphics
the game play is astounding
this game is moderately challenging and entertaining to the end
i cried the first time i beat this game because i didnt want to samuess adventure to end
this game is it
it doesnt get better
im gonna go cry nowthis is the rd installment to the metroid series
and probally one of the best
it was the first of the metroid games to have a map of the areas and a section that told what you have collected so far
it takes place after samus aran finishes off the metroids on the planet sr which is roughly about oh maybe  months year after the origional metroid
ridley a massive teridacle like creature also from the origional metroid goes to the space coloney a massive research station used by the intergalactic federation police to take the baby metroid which latches itself to samus in metroid  after samus lays some damage on ridley it takes off with the metroid and selfdestructs the coloney
samus then escapes and follows the flying feind to the space pirates own basethe origional home of samus aran
i found that out reading some metroid manga japanese comics the game is outstanding
if you have a super nintendo you have to get this game
but if you dont have patience and cant exept a defeat here and there you will probally smash this game in a mad rage
but this game is the best with some seeings of some old enimes such as ridley kraid and the mother brain
and some new ones such as draygon crocomire and phantoon
this game is amazing the name is super metroid the platform is super nintendo and the fun level is infinityof all the greatssuper metroid super mario world mario kart chrono trigger nba jamyup i would name this one first
buy it play it love itsuper metroid is a masterpiece of sci fi gaming
originally released in  on the snes super metroid has withstood the test of time and inspired countless other games and media productions
every bit of the game has been carefully constructed and finetuned to weave the world of planet zebes and its underworld web of labyrinths
the ambient electronic soundtrack is absolutely haunting and beautiful one of my favorite soundtracks of all time
i love the second brinstar theme which reminds me allot of a more ambient depeche mode and both the maridia themesa timeless masterpiecethis is another one of my favorite snes games
it is great and everything but it gets very hard and confusing after you get far enough
the graphics are just the same as all of the other snes games and the sound is a little better than most snes games but is still not the best
it took me forever to figure out what to do so i stoped playing it
when i finally got unstuck i started playing it and beat it in seven hours
yes that is kinda a long time but it was the very first metroid game i played and i got almost every item
this game has a very creative storyline and awesome music like all metroids but the last battle against motherbrain i will never forget
especially after i beat the game because i dont know if its just me not smart enough to figure out but everytime i want to play it again i have to re beat motherbrain and the last part which i have done many times and each time gets eaiser
but the game doesnt save and you cant really do anything but start a new game on a new slot
many people say this is the best metroid game out there and at least  of people who own an snes and this game say its the best game for it
i loved this game and it has a great storyline if you have played any metroid before or just a decent gamer you can rent it after school or work and beat it before midnight without stoppingd is good and so is d people should not display ignorance in themselves by saying simply because humans mastered one artform prior to another the prior is inferior
d is not inferior because that is the same as saying blue is more primitive than red
it makes no sense
they are both rendered differently and express game content differently
besides it is not as if d is really d anyways since you use a flat d tv screen to view the fake d environment
if you could pass your hand through the tv into the environment it would be dso in conclusion d is valid and quotdquot is valid as plausible tv game options
dont make yourself look immature by disputing irrelevant informationfast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
a this is one of the top selling games for snes of all time and probably the most played game in the metroid series
this game is really long with a lot of secrets
good luck getting it  basicaly has the same storyline as the orginal metroid
but wicked kickin graphics
the controls are sharp as a nail
the gameplay is awesomei always keep going back to this game on my snesi was checking up on old snes games to buy off amazon and came across this game
it was going for  at the time and i was thinking there is no way im going to pay that much for this game
luckily someone on my bus was selling his old snes games
i offered him  and i got itwhat he got was  to buy some more weedcause he must have been smoking something to sell me this game for 
i got one of the best nintendo games of all time
it has an excellent story excellent graphics and character modelsby snes standards and the music is outstanding
its by far the best soundtrack for any gamebesides donkey kong country
the game never gets old and it never ceases to amaze me how entertaining it is
i guess snes games are like fine wine they get better with ageits been almost years since ive last played this game for the snes just before the system itself stopped working
but after watching various youtube videos of other people playing it for a  item collectionspeed run it practically brought back memories of the last time i played this actionpacked thrillride
so when my new fc twin nessnes system arrives in the mail along with the actual game its about time id take a bit of a stroll down memory lane by exploring or in this case reexploring the planet zebessuper metroid is commonly hailed as the greatest super nintendo game ever
sure its graphics cant hold a candle up to metroid prime and its story isnt quite as good as metroid fusion but if youre gonna make a metroid game you might as well do it right dont you think
what i mean is we want exploration while theres a good storyline in tact
something that the two new metroid games didnt put together
while metroid prime has great exploration its story kind of sucks
while metroid fusion has a great storyline probably the best in all the metroid games thus far you cant explore worth crap
but put them both together and youve got a metroid classic
that my friends is super metroidi remember playing the first metroid game and it was an inspiration to me
it wasnt some linear path you had to explore
sure theres a lot of backtracking but if there wasnt then it wouldnt be called exploration now would itthe storyline of super metroid is that the metroid hatchling samus found at the end of her previous adventure she left in the care of scientist
but that station came under attack and samus finds that she must help
when she gets there she has a confrontation with ridley who ends up flying away with the metroid hatchling and samus tracks him down to planet zebes
this is a great storylinesome landscapes look a lot like those of the original metroid game but enhanced
some abilities are even in the same spots
still that exploration is there and for that i was happy
instead of having a linear path to follow you can play the game at your own pace and find the powerups how you want to find them
exploration in my opinion is what metroid games are all aboutas far as difficulty goes this metroid game is really easy compared to the original nes one and the newer metroid prime
its about the same as metroid fusion meaning that if you know how to take on something youll undoubtably come out of nearly every confrontation without a scratchi have only one gripe with this game
that is the default control settings
thank goodness nintendo has allowed us to change them
the default control scheme is terrible using the x button to shoot
and its better that you can customize the controlsnow as far as games go i think super metroid is one of the greatest games every made
it would be on my top ten list of the greatest games ever and im happy to have gotten the oppertunity to play thisif you want an example of how a metroid game let alone actionadventure then this is a great example
super metroid is without a doubt one of the greatest games ever made and i have to second the opinion on making it the greatest snes game of all timethis is my fav metriod game
i dont have the super nintendo copy yet but i have it for the wii vc and so funi recieved this game three days after christmas three days later i beat the game spending around  hours to win
my palms drenched in sweat and my heart racing tremendously i destroyed the final bosshowever despite my efforts i had barely scratched the surface of this truely time consumming game
there was still areas to explore and items to findthis game is awsome to say the least
it is the true image of what the super nes was capable of
topping super nes greats such as final fantasy  legend of zelda and more this title proves that d games are better in many ways than d
the huge world is only second to the tremendouse areas found in castlevania sotn
the bosses are difficult but not that difficult they each have a specific pattern except for ridley and as such you must find their weakness
i honestly have no complaints about this gamethere are not many games that i can say are perfect but this is one of them
this game is mainly an exploration game that has alot of d platforming
there are many things in this game that will make you want to play it more than once for example finding things you werent supposed to with wall jump or finding all upgrades or minimal run
super metroid will have you addicted as soon as you start the game
the main goal in the game is to find the baby metroid that you captured earlier in the series
this game is not too long with some assistance it took me  and a half hours
the graphics may not be stunning like todays games but it is still good on a small enough screen
super metroid is a must haveso for any gamer that somehow missed this game you should play it now
a very clever sidescroller that allows you to explore in whatever direction you wish  provided you have the right equipment to get through the area
it is very zelda like in that respect hey theres a couple of doors that i cant open now but ill try to remember to come back when i get more upgrades this game has been a huge influence on many games from later generations and most fans will tell you that super metroid is the best title in the seriesfourteen years ago i began playing video games on a daily basis ranging anywhere from the mindless firstperson shooters to the more complex and enticing rpgs the world had to offer
i grew up with the classics and now that i look back on those days im proud i did
but there was one game among them all that triggered the gamers flare within my heart
it was the first game i ever played by myself and finished at a young age and it ranks as  on my top  best games of all time list
ladies and gentlemen i present to you the game that started it all for me illusion of gaiastory when i first played this game i was far too young to truly understand everything that was going on but when i turn on the game and play it nowadays the story always manages to just nearly bring me to tears of joy
you take the role of a boy named will who lives in the town of south cape with his grandma and grandpa
he intends to travel the world in search of his father a famous explorer named olman who disappeared mysteriously after their expedition to the tower of babel
through a series of misguided and unfortunate events you end up thrown in jail and you have a spiritual conversation with your father who tells you that the comet a star representing total destruction is heading straight for the planet and only with the power of the mystic statues can you hope to save the world from its untimely doom
if that wasnt enough to already have you hooked you will be completely and thoroughly engaged into every single line of dialogue from every single character that you come across on your journey
everybody has something of interest to say and only a few times could i ever count the dialogue as forgettable
there are plot twists moments of romance and a seemingly endless supply of magic and wonder all wrapped up into this games story and its an adventure i will gladly take up any time of any day over and over againgameplay this beautiful game retains everything good about its predecessor soul blazer but makes everything more complex and even more challenging
instead of the traditional levelup system found in almost every single rpg to date you will become stronger after defeating every single enemy in any area you are currently in
when you defeat every monster a jewel appears from the last monster destroyed that permanently increases one of your stats by  point
you have three statshp strength and defensethat can all be boosted and the max hp you can have is  combat is fast fluid and always intense just as it should be
not only that later on in the game you will be given the freedom to change into two separate forms that will grant you an entirely different set of abilities and powers freedan a dark knight and shadow the ultimate warrior born from the light of the comet
each character will learn unique skills that allow them to access new and expansive areas and sometimes it is absolutely vital in order to move on with the game
also there are these secret items in the game called red jewels and there are  of them scattered all across the world
collecting them and bringing them to the jeweler gem a master of disguise in every area you visit will grant you items power ups and even access to a secret dungeon
no matter where you turn theres never a dull momentpresentation everything about this game is outstanding
beautiful even
from the development of each character to the unique and exciting areas you will travel to this game will have you loving every single second of every minute you spend playing it
youll travel the world going to reallife locations like the great wall of china the ankor wat and even the great pyramids in search of the mystic statues and any trace of your father
its as if every single pixel used for the graphics of this game were given an untold amount of detail and it shows tremendously well
the game isnt ridiculously difficult in any way but it gradually gets more difficult as you get closer towards the end just like any good game should do
it also retains the world map system that soul blazer did being that all destinations can be selected by simply choosing them on the world map itself
everywhere you go theres always something new to discover or something left to do even if it feels like nothing at all
the adventure itself just seems endless in every kind of good way imaginablemusic what can i say about this games soundtrack that i havent already said about any other game ive reviewed
well to put it simply anything
i cant even put words into describing how amazing this games music is
every track whether big or small is moving sensational and at times emotionally enticing
of all the games ive played that had amazing soundtracks this is the one i always find myself humming or whistling to when im at work or when im out doing anything at all
its atmospheric
its intense
there are only a few tracks that are reused and even when they do you can forgive them for doing so because theyre simply beautiful
every area of every town city village or dungeon will have you instantly hooked to the music playing in the background and its an addiction i will never overcomeoverall rating there are very few games that will ever score a perfect rating with me but with illusion of gaia i can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that a perfect score is what it deserves
all this time later i still find myself popping the game in playing it from start to finish without stopping
its an outstanding game that deserves all the praise you have for it and i think that with this review i have done it justice
rated as my rd best game of all time illusion of gaia is an excellent and enticing adventure that you will not want to missgaie is one of the greatest rpg games i have ever played
you start as a young boy named will and you set out on a journey to find your father
you soon aquire  more companions a knight and a firey spirit dude
i would definently reccomend this game to any rpg and adventure game fan because this game has a deep storyline cool bosses challenging puzzles especially the last one fun side quests and the gameplay is just fun
the only downside to this game is the last boss
she is a giant amazonian chick who is very very very hard
but after a couple hundred tries i eventually beat herthe tonel underpinnings of social commentary through out history makes this much more than a mere super nintendo game
the gameplay is decent and solid
not profound but competent
i have layed awake at nights thinking about this games story
i truly find it amazing nintendo produced something with this kind of depth
they address the moral ambiguities of life social stratification slavery coping with loss genocide archeology as well as good hearted adventure
when was the last time donkey kong had a comment on social oppresion
when did mario deal with historical trauma
i would like to see more of this side of nintendo
you know what the makers were going for when they created this game because they made the map to purposely resemble our earth
not perfectly but close enough to realize the symbolism
they even referrence alot of earths archeology such as the nazca plains pyramids easter island the great wall of china and the tower of babil just to name a fewyou start out as a kid going on an adventure with your friends and a girl that turns out to be a princess to find your long lost dad who got lost at the tower of babil or something
very familiar territory i know
next you are talking to a voice in your head that leads you on wild adventures and compels you to leave your group at unusual timesthe game has two parts to it
theres the story part where you are on your adventure with your fellow goonies and then there is the part where you have your alter ego and you go dungeon crawling
none of your friends get to see you in your awsome form except for the princesss girlthe dungeon part is where the game gets down to buisiness with puzzle solving and monster fighting
you transform into a knight which is terrific because fighting bosses as a little kid with a flute is weak
later you take on the form of a liquid metal alien made of pure energy or something
the boss fights are spectacular and the level designs and puzzles are a slice of  bit triumphthe sound and graphics are in top super nintendo form
the music is solid
as for story some people remember reading books ln school like  lord of the flies tom sawyer clockwork orange or whatever
i remember playing this game
for just an unasuming snes game there was a lot of stuff going on here
if you see this used for like  bucks and you enjoy playing snes pick this up
just remember to get one with the manual
its a full players guide on how to get every red gembonus for a bonus ending try finding all the gems
i had the manual and i still missed one someplace in the gamejust got my copy of iog and it works great
iog is the second game in the soul blazer series st being soul blazer nd illusion of gaia and the rd being terranigmawhich saddly never made it to north america
in iog you play as will a young boy who wieldsa fluteyeahanyway youre accomplayed by a royal princess kara and a blue haired girled lilly and other of wills friends as they try to save the world from utter doom
along the way will will gain the use of two other spirits the sword swinging freedan and the flaming spirit shadow
if you like the soul blazer series and still have a snes id get this as quick as you canthis was definately my favorite super nintendo game
i only had about  dozen games for this system but i havent played it in several years and i havent forgoten how much i liked it
this game looks a lot richer than most games for the snes and has a crisp sound as well
playing this game for me was like reading a good book
i really didnt like the game until i had beat the first continent
you cant judge it by its cover either
i was looking for a game that was similar to this but there really arent any
the people who made this are the same people making final fantasy games today for the company square enix
the game i believe is closest to this would have to be the first final fantasy just with more elements from final fantasy adventure which has been remade as the sword of mana
if your collecting games for the snes this would make a good museume type trophyyou begin as a boy in a small town wanting to simply travel the world out of simple curiosity
you then travel the world eventually finding two other souls to join you pretty much going to the  wonders of the world and beating monsters solving puzzles and riddles with new skills you learn in your journey
its a very good game for your brain
this game also spares you travel time of having to travel from point a to point b by just having a map displaying where the heroes are going
no travel time is to make up for the fact that it is not always obvious what to do so it may take you days to figure out simple puzzles
this an incredible game for learning purposes as well as its fun gameplay much like the zelda games weapon special item run and map buttons
with that being said the buttons are configured nothing like zelda
it has a very disappointing configuration but thats why it has a mode where you can configure your own buttonsthis game plays like the secret of mana but feels very unique in its own right
the music isnt very memorable but its atmospheric and fits well to each section of the game
it also brings an adult male such as myself plenty wonder of what waits ahead a feeling i havent felt in quite sometimeoriginally called soul blazer ii in japan this game completely knocked me off my chair
its originality and replay vaule are through the roof not to mention the cool music you get once in a whileyou play as will a mysterious boy who seems to have psychic powers
his friends seem to think that this power is some sort of sixth senseplenty of traveling in this game
you learn the mystery of wills past and more as you travel through dangerous ruins climb incredible heights explore many towers castles and morethis game fits together so well youll end up replaying again and again to try and find all  jewels the ultimate sidequest in the gameso id call this game a rent and if you can find it anywhere for a good used price grab itonce you get past the beginning and figure out how to leave town  quotillusion of galaquot from then on is a five star adventure that echos quotsecret of manaquot and the nintendo masterpeice quotthe legend of zelda a link to the pastquot
the soundtrack is intense when it needs to be however it is wonderfully mellow and enjoyable most often
truly one of the great video game soundtracks from the unforgettable snes days
if you love rpgs and i know you do or you most likely wounldnt be on this page youll love this game
it has now become a classic treasure to many
remember this if your just getting started with the game the beginning is a long and drawn out intro
dont get frustrated its easy to figure out just more reading than sword swinging
the battles are just around the corner and the adventure is worth all the story that wraps around itillusion of gaia is an interesting rpg
there were many on the snes but this one is in its own column
it plays very similar to zelda when it comes to battle but with some new things thrown in that i wont spoil
however the story seems to lack a little at times but thats only in comparison to other games like final fantasy  and chronology trigger
on its own very good and worth a playthroughbuyi had so much fun playing this game
i played this game not to long after i had played secret of evermore
i was so glad to have found yet another super fun rpgi remember liking the story line finding out what happened to the lost expedition and saving the world from the comet
the game has different and distinct looks in the world from all types of towns and villages to a castle along with different terrains
i liked gathering the information to advance in the game it wasnt so hard that you would get frustrated too much like in chrono trigger i had to make lots of notes
taking a breath and thinking about something would get you past the issue
for that matter i do not remember the puzzles being too hard or leveling up being difficult
i do not remember much backtracking like in some games
if you have ever played secret of evermore final fantasy iii or secret of mana this game is along those lines
i dont think it is as large as the previously named games but it is long enough to put a smile on your face
i dont remember the exact hours i played this game but i know it was over  i am glad i found and played this gameillusion of gaia was released in  by enix although nintendo published it
it plays a lot like zelda only in a more linear fashion
most of the time you cant revisit places once you leave but this is an excellent game that is worth your time and moneythe story will keep you going and you get stronger through killing all the enemies in a room
your strength defense or life will increase
the main character will can also transform into two other characters freedan and shadow when needed
as you go along in iog you will learn new skills such as wills slide technique used for sliding under low places
if you liked the zelda games i suggest checking out this gameeasy at times hard at others this game will keep you playing until you beat it and then some
this is a side scroller that deserves some love a lot of love
these graphics are sharper than any gameboyadvance game and this game is simply done magnificantly
this is definitely my most favorite side scrolling adventure game everthis game is very difficult but its sooo much fun to playthe graphics are the best on snes there are plenty of bonus stuff to find and a procent system that gives a lot of replay valuedkc is a classic game one of the best games of all time
i was feeling nostalgic so i bought it and am enjoying it thoroughly
what are you reading my review for buy it nowplay this and remember it was made in  look at the graphics
donkey kong country shocked the world in   with its revoulutionary garphics but also shocked it with its gameplay soundjust about everything
even today the graphics are still better than some of new playstation games
if you like gorillas or just like video games youll love playing as donkey and diddy
your not a true video game fan if you donrt like donkey kong country
also play the  sequels which are both excellent
get it immediatley if you dont have itthis game is definitely hands down one of the greatest video games to ever be releaseddonkey kong country was a game that revealed the positive side of the barrelthrowing donkey kong
it also introduced donkey kongs sidekick diddy kong
and with the graphic production from rareware the stunning graphics blew any other snes games graphics awaythis game is a definite challenge for the player
the game structure is defined by challenge levels and the boss battle at the end of each world which sounds pretty formulatic but you wont even care once you start playing the gamei have also never played a video game with such an atmospheric and amazing musical score as well
it really brings out the atmosphere in this game
whether youre in the jungle deep in the caverns or swimming with the fishes theres always a suiting soundtrack to each leveli dont want to tell any more than what i have as i might spoil the plot if i do but if youre looking for a fun spectacular mindblowing at least for a game released in  and classic game donkey kong country awaits
and so does the stolen banana hordebefore this game came out in the s i remember seeing a video about it
i knew i had to have it and bought it immediately upon release
the graphics were absolutely stunning and are even pretty good by todays standards
the storyline was great and the characters instant classics
and so when i got my wii one of the first things i did was download this gameone of the best ive ever played in over  years of gamingneedless to say this excellent game has stood the test of time
it is sidescrollingpre dbut that is one of the games strengths in my opinion
there are some incredibly difficult levels the mine cars are very tough but the game is not impossible to beat and provides just enough challenge to really absorb you in it
control is fairly simple but another plusyou dont need a whole slew of button combos to master this game just some dexterity and practicei would recommend this game either on the super nes or as a virtual game for the wii
whereas some older games are good just for their nostalgia factor dk country is certainly one that can be played and enjoyed even  or so years after its original releaserare became famous overnight once they developed published and released donkey kong country for the snes in  nintendo had handed over to them a well known but dormant franchise at the time and using acm graphics this stunning game wowed anyone who played this title for the first time back then
it was considered state of the art for its time and it made owning an snes console even betterin donkey kong country you control donkey kong and his sidekick diddy and set off to get back donkeys kong most prized possession his banana hoard
king k rool the main villain and his army of animals have taken over the island and to defeat him you must travel through  worlds filled with stages and then confront king rool on his pirate ship
there are many ways to earn extra lives and some of the local friendly animals lend dk and diddy a hand from time to time
in addition to completing the stages there are many secret rooms scattered through most of the stages just waiting to be discovered
in the one player game you control both characters
in the  player game you and another player can play together cooperatively
in the  player contest you and another player take turns in playing the game
when you reach a certain character in each world you are allowed to save your progressthe pros this game blew away gamers back in the s and its one of the few retro games where it has aged well
a side scrolling platform game starring one of nintendos recognizable characters meant it was going to be a good time for all and it was
thanks to the awesome graphics sounds and music plus tongue in cheek humor each themed world is filled with stages brimming with enough variety to keep it fun
to cram it all in into a cartridge is a remarkable achievement as nothing was sacrificed
its fun by yourself and when you bring in another person and the game is hard enough to challenge you but not overwhelm you at the same time
adding hidden areas and secrets gave it more replay valuethe cons nothing
its a perfectly balanced gamethe donkey kong country trilogy began with this crowning achievement
this game sold millions and gathered praise and critical success and there was good reason for it
thanks to the success of this game rare released two sequels and they too have sold well
if you havent tried this game out yet youre not out of luck
you can either try to get this game new or used or you can download this off the virtual console service for the nintendo wii for  points 
it was well worth it then and it is still a great game to play today
get this gamewhen rumours of new bit consoles were becoming a reality many fans began to forget about the snes that was of course until the release of donkey kong country
a game so ahead of its time that at its first e showing many reporters mistook it for a n gamewith a revolutionary graphics engine and fantastic gameplay to boot dkc took the gaming world by storm and indeed acted as the final nail in the megadrives coffin
also notable is that this was the first big hit from gaming giants rare who would follow with the classics goldeneye and perfect darkanother important point is that this game is completely without flaws the rendering is perfect and the games music is one of the best soundtracks ever recorded
in technical retrospect dkc is a d sidescroller with a d graphics overhaul in english any fan of platformers should not be without this inspirational classicdonkey kong country was also the largest ever cartridge at the time carrying a massive at the time mb and til this very day the game remains a classic
if you still have a snes or your a retro gaming fan like myself you should pick this up as soon as possiblethis is such an awesome game
its fun and pretty cool
its the best since mario was made this game rocksf you liked this game check out dkc   dkc i remember playing this
i had a lot of fun with it
it saved nintendo really it didgraphics it set the snes to its limits
crystal clear d images
great rain and watersound great sound
the monkeys grunts sound pretty goodmusic  jungle music that is very catchygameplay although not as good as the other  its funplay as donkey or diddy and romp through many worlds
you can also ride on animal buddies tooi suggest you to get thisi knew sheer bliss playing this game it made d gaming look amazing and the super nintendo appeared impossibly invincibly powerful
a great classic game i just wish they made games like it for gamecubewho wouldve thought that the donkey kong series which started out as an quotape throwing barrels at peoplequot game would turn into a full scale  star actionadventure extravaganza
donkey country had it all
flawless clean and sometimes breath taking graphics and effects to complement the endless arrays of level by level challenge and outstanding game playthe many bonus levels intrigued you and challenged you to be your best
the animal companions gave you an extra incentive to play because the swordfish the rhino and the frog made it that much better and that much funthe other thing that really revolutionized actionadventure type games was donky kong countrys boards and levels because none were exactly the same
each board had its individual quirks and perks and each board gave you that needed challenge that other actionadventure type games lacked at the timeyou could not put this game down
me personally after  months after this games release i was still playing it because it was still that good that and i was determined to play a perfect game and clear all the boards including the bonus levelsthis was the first installment of the newly revived series and it was a must need and still is
i would definately recommend this series to anyone and for those of us triple crowners own the ps xbox and gamecube i would definately stop all of the other games i was doing when the next installment of the donky kong series came to the home system
but for now get this one and play the hell out of iti absolutely love the donkey kong country series
they all have a great soundtrack wonderful graphics and are somewhat difficultbut very enertaining
this dkc is great because the two characters really balance each other out one is more for stregnth the other speed and it really sets the standard for the other two
the only con about this game is that i like having to search for the dk coins like in dkc   
it makes the game more challenging and keeps you entertained longer
other than that i really enjoy this game and would recommend this to anyonea classic and great game
it is one of the best games in my opinion
could play it over and over againdonkey kong country for the super nintendo is one of the best console games of alltime
just like super mario world you kill enemies by jumping on top of them
and like mario and luigi collect coins to earn extra lives donkey kong and diddy kong collect bananas because theyre monkeysking k rool the biggest cruelest enemy in this game has stolen all of the bananas form the kongs banana hoard and your goal is to defeat him to get all of the bananas back and to beat the game but first of all you have beat each level and world just like in mario games before you get to king k roolbut luckily the donkey kong and diddy kong have many friends who help them along the way
the smartmouthed cranky kong is always there to provide a few laughs and tell some great stories
funky kong will give you a ride in his planelike barrel that brings you to other worlds and levels that you want to play again or find the bonuses in
and candy kong is always there to save your game and blow you a kiss
there are also many animal friends such as enguarde the swordfish rambi the rhino and winky the frog who help make the levels easier to beatdonkey kong country became the best selling super nintendo game of all time for a good reason
the levels and trying to find all of the bonuses is very fun and challenging
the graphics seem way better than the bit that they actually are
donkey kong country also has great sound effects when you kill an enemy or lose a life and great music during the levelsif you beat the game or just get bored of playing by yourself you can change over to two player mode where you can chose to be a team where one of you controls donkey kong and the other diddy or play against each other
all  modes are very fun and provide several hours of funthis is one of the best snes games ever and should be added to your game collection as soon as you can get it
its one of the best games of all time for a classic systemthis game is the first game in the dk series put out by snes
and as with most things i think that the original is always better
i love all the dk games but this one is my personal favorite
this game was a technical marvel in its time
there are so many levels and hidden items
even next to the games of today this game could hold its own
its a great game
you wont regret buying thiswhat else can i say about this  bit classic
it always reminds me of great christmas memories as nintendo always seemed to release the  snes dkc games near winter
and these games being my main gift was always a definite treat
i was so hyped up for dkc after the nintendo power vhs i received in the mail
i can still remember playing it and being blown sway
to this day a classic
the graphics music  gameplay still blow my mind
still hoping for that proper sequel
dkcreturns for wii is coolbut id love a real sequel to dkcdonkey kong country
that is all i have to say
there is nothing wrong with the game
iconic snes game
you do not have a collection unless you have this gamethis has to be one of my favorite super nintendo games of all time
the graphics are excellent for its time however they still stand up to todays standards in d sidescrolling platformer games
i recommend getting it for the super nintendo wii virtual console and game boy advancethis game consists of three game files you can choose to use
also make sure the game has a game battery that works or you will not be able to save your progress once you access candys save point located closer to the end of the first world kongo jungle
futhermore playing the game with a dead back up battery is no fun especially when you do not feel like playing it anymore for the day and the next day you turn the super nintendo on and the progress that you worked hard for did not save like it should
on the other hand the music is very catchy making you want to sing it while you are in the levels especially in the first levellove it
i cant believe i still remember where half of the secret passagesbonuses arethe first game with computer graphics if you grew up with it you remember
if you didnt you need to buy it purely for its educational valueone of the reasons i bought super nintendo  years ago was for donkey kong when came out ive remembered been stuck at the mine cart level for couple of days but later on ive beaten the game without losing a life
this is the best donkey kong they ever made second and third was okay but the main character which is dk was not playable on them
but anyway i still play all of then among  dozen of others super nintendo gamesdonkey kong country really pushed the limits of what the snes could do
the graphics were very ahead of their time
i dont normally rate graphics but this game gets points just because it had d textures and characters in a side scroller which was a first for games back then
also the sound design in this game is great
each sound is clear and you can easily distinct the step of one of those fat brown dudes with the green army helmets from the sound of a crocodiles mouth opening and closing
this game is loads of fun with two characters who you can switch between depending on what the situation calls for
there are tons of secrets to find and riding around on the animals is an experience a true gamer could never forget
this game serves up great challenge without getting too hard
the levels in this game are brilliantly designed and make for deeply addictive gameplay
if you like this one check the second and third one also as the series builds on its weak points as well as its strong points making for great well rounded gameplay in all of the gamesthis was the best donkey kong game ever
why
well for one thing it has undeniably the best graphics on the super nintendo
of course a game can hardly be judged by the quality of its graphics as any true gamer knows
the characters are interesting the gameplay is funeven if it is easy and it has a pretty good story
this is definitely a classic game for the snes
its fun no matter how many times you beat iti got this for my parents and they love this game
no regrets very well worth the money i paid for this game
even i like iti played this game all the time at my cousins house in canada
never had my own copy of the game till i finally bought myself one on amazon
and i am so glad that i didthis game is kind of like mario brothers with better gameplay and graphics i loved this game and its a must have for snesthank you so much for this game actually this was a birthday present for my nephew
he is enjoying this game so much that he is not sharing with his sisters nor me
thank you once againthis is a game i first played at my friends house in about late  when it first came out
i thought the graphics were good for the time and better than the graphics for the next two sequels but what bothered me the most is it was too linear
you could look for secret rooms and bananas but nothing else
however i find this to be one of my alltime favorites if just for the nostalgic factorthis game is the donkey kongs own adventure with his partner diddy kong on this awsome platforming game
music is awsome
graphics are good
there are hidden rooms
background is very cool
no time limits at all
overall this is dks first adventurei remember in  how incredible i thought this game was graphically
looking back at it now in this era of ps xbox or gc it still stands up
why
not only is it an awesome game with many different levels the graphics are still awesome
snes was one of the best systems that ever came out
this is one reason why
if youre looking for a great game check this outthis is one of the best games ever
graphics  omg
the best i have seen on snesthe resolution on the characters and the objects are highawesome graphicssound  awesome sound effects
they are crystal clearto find how good are the sound effects play the gamegameplay  awesome gameplay the levels are professionallydesignedmusic  aewsome music
the music is crystal clearoverall  buy this game now if you dont have itfast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
a classic donkey kong for snes i think i like the music just as much as i like playing
oo oo aahh aahi bought this game to replace one that didnt make the trip out of moms house so many years ago
i have a lot of fun playing this and i will enjoy this for years to come or until the cartridge stops workinga classic game for those who loved the older ones
it is recommended for those who loved dkc all together
i had to recently by a brand new system because mine got too old to play on
its well worth it though
this dkc and dkc are the best games for the snes
i also do recommend yoshis island as wellthe game is great for young kids to adults
if you love playing games and want something with a fun adventure antics great bonus levels and characters this is the series for youwho knew a game with primates would be so fun
well this is one of my favorite games of all time and thousands of others
you may ask why
blow the dust off your super nintendoif you still have it and pop it in
look at the beautiful character models and backgrounds as donkey kong is beating his chest
listen to the brillant songs of the jungle
still not convinced
play the game
youll enter a vibrant jungle world a frozen winter world and a polluted industry world just to name a few of the worlds in the game
oh and if you forgot snes is the best system ever so you know its a good game
nuff saidthe greatest game of donkey kong historygame play   simple hard but very fungraphics   when it comes to donkey kong country good graphics are an alltimehigh
nintendo wasnt lying when the box art said d graphics
music   some good stuff
and thats saying a lot because i mostly listen to punk rockoverall   greatest dk game
the most actionpacked game at least until the second oneaside from this game having great graphics its fun playing with two people and cool being able to tag the other person in while the other follows
player one is usually donkey kong player  is diddy kong and you travel through the jungle to defeat the kremlings and take back your banana hoard
you can even ride animals to get you through obstacles faster
i havent gotten too far but although it gets a little frustrating at times the game is very fun and one of the best games for the snesdonkey kong country is one of the coolest games i have ever playedi played this awhile agoback when snes just came out and i happend to buy this gamewell acctually my dad got it for me as a giftthis game was off the hookthe gameplay was original
same with characters and eveythingthe lengh of the game was greatnot too long but greatthe controls were easy to uselearn in about what minutesdkc was probably the best dk game everif you like dkc then get the second oneits got all the same of  but with some some new stuff mixed with itthis is a great gameget it if youre an snes fan such as myselfget it if you can find itlateri loved this game it had donkey kong always beating on his chest and doing loud noises everytime when you make him stop and donkey knog jr would scratch his head
in this game when one monkey gets hit in order to get your partner you have to find a barrel inside would be a monkey screeming to be let out so you grab it drow it on the ground break it then your partner comes back
i like it when you choose which person you want to use and i mean while during your playing all you do is tag team
this game has a lot of scary rides like that rollar coster or being shot out of shotting barrels while its a snow storm
and the giant bees you have to dodge them or hit thim with a barrelin a world where there were cds companies like sega and do had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a cd giving the games enhanced graphics and sound
there is one company however named nintendo and it created donkey kong country
donkey kong country was a game that proved that you dont need cdbased technology to make games with flashy graphics
you just need to put in effort to fit it to your consoledkcs graphics were incredible on the super nintendo
the game almost looked like the characters came from a cgi movie
at least at its time
even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movementsthe sounds and music were memorable
even when you defeat a kremling alligator enemy his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time
as for the music well you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of kongo jungle and the king k rool boss battlethe game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels
once you go to a level youre gonna be expecting barrelblasting kremlingsmashing animalromping fun
there is a lot to do in donkey kong country
as a platformer it doesnt disappoint with its gameplay
you can even ride atop an animal buddy like a rhino or an ostrich
rhinos can knock everybody out of its way while the ostrich guides you safely across the level
it can also float in the air like racoon mario in super mario bros  the entire game is a bunch of funthe multiplayer is pretty cool too
while you cant really play coop like in the new dkc game thats out on wii your friend can cover in for you if you die
one player plays as donkey kong and the other plays as diddy kong
once one player is participating in the action the other player cant really do anything
but if that one player dies or presses select then its time for the second player to play
you can also compete against each otherto save you must reach candys save point
personally i wish they added a save anytime kind of feature
but that is a minor complaintoverall this is a really great super nes gem
its worth the money
even if you dont have a super nintendo its also out for game boy advance and game boy color
oh and wii virtual console toonarley game man going old school with a game like this never gets old gotta love donkey kong oh hell yanow i can play my zelda games instead of them sitting in a box collecting dust or going to a yard saleobviously this game is a classic
when i received the game it worked perfectly find and it was in good conditioni love this game
i remember playing it when i was younger and recently went to play through it again with my wife who had never played it
it is still as fun now as it was then
while the graphics are far behind and its very pixelated when stretched on my  tv the content is still fun and exciting
it brought back a lot of memories for me
i have caught my wife even playing it without me
no amount of graphics makes up for the quality content found in classic games like thisdonkey kong country is amazing
i would pay anything for it even  dollars but i bought my copy for 
why is it so amazing
well when it is cut on it plays a the original arcade donkey kong theme but then donkey kong swoops in with his boom box and dances to a remixed version of that
now how many bit consoles were able to produce dancing d monkeys
then the game starts
donkey kong burst out of his house
the game itself did not have any kind of plotline but it was pretty obvious after a while
donkey kong walks into a cave with a sign that reads dks banana hoard
the music gets sad and donkey kong starts shaking his head
i got the message pretty well
somebody stole donkey kongs bananas and he wants them back
this was all shown through d animations
soon the big monkey is running through beautifully rendered levels
controlling a giant rampaging monkey seems really hard but it is not
he moves about as well as mario
the level design is beautiful
my favorite was stop and go station which had me flipping a switch to freeze an enemy
every time the enemy was frozen the lamps in the level would shine red
when the effects of the switch wore off the lights shined green
it was a very interesting puzzle
the soundtrack is as good as the graphic effects
i dont know how but i have never heard as good of a score as this and this came off of a cartridge
i have played sonic cd with some of the catchiest tunes super mario galaxy fully orchestrated and a link to the past but none of those sound as good as this
each tune went along with the theme
a dreary and quieter tune if it is raining a flute tune for a forest theme and a nice quiet tune for the nighttime tree top town level
believe me once you buy this you will want to smash your uncreative and overhauled xbox  to bitsthis game came out on the brink of the  bit era at the end of  and will always be remembered as the super nintendos last answer to being overshadowed by d consoles
the graphics were state of the art side scrolling d rendered brilliance for the time they were released and incredible for the system they were respective to and are still capable today of the same awe they were  years agothe music is also of the same incredible quality and will easily immerse you in the tropical atmospheric themes underlying the games setting on dk isle with the soft flowing aquatic ambiance or the immediate danger of mine cart carnage
but the final prize goes to the gameplay which is the most fluid and seamless ive ever seen in a platformer
you can literally span across levels at breakneck speeds performing barrel roles and jumps that just dont operate with as much functionality in other contemporaries and even games today
and lets not forget the story simple and perfectly fitting for a game of its typeif you still havent played this masterpiece almost  years later you owe it to yourself to try it at least once in one of its many versions including the wiis virtual consolepurchased this game for my granddaughter
she loves the game
and she is very good at it
she started when she was  playing the game helps with dexteritythis game rocksplay as donkey kong and diddie konghelp them battle the evil king krooltrust mebuy this now
a greatfunand good gamewith the  bit games fading out and the nintendo having the best in the way of bit graphics outback in the day dkc was and is another one of my favorite games
looks great for the time period i love the whole franchise and look forward to the new wii versionthis game offers a variety of gameplay and never gets repetitive
you will keep going to finish the game
the graphics are awesome because this was the first or one of the first games on the snes to use prerendered graphics
that means that the graphics arent generated on the spot
the graphics are still spectacular even in todays standards
the story behind this is krool took your banannas and you want them backs so you chase himyoshi has always been my favorite character of the mario universe whether he was kicking  on smash bros racing around the tracks of mario kart or going across the board in mario party or exploring the strange lands of his island he was always my favorite character
the game starts out where a stork carrying baby mario and baby luigi is attacked by a group of shy guys and baby mario is dropped on an island
then a yoshi finds him and then the game has you take control of the different yoshis as they trek through different sections of the island to find marios brother luigi while fighting many different groups of enemies
the game feels very adventurous very strange and at the same time awesome
unfortunately the main problem in the game is when you cant figure out what youre supposed to do next which will leave you lost
other than that youll will have a great time like you did in the first super mario world
if you dont own a snes the game boy advance ports of the super mario world games are exactly the same so they are just as awesomethis game is quite a lot different than the first super mario world in almost every wayyou control several different yoshis on a quest to get baby luigi back after he was separated from mario
you can eat enemies to turn them into eggs which you can then throw to kill them
the rest of the gameplay is generally a twist on classic mario gameplay though there is more a puzzle aspect to it as wellthis game really is fun even though i cant do its gameplay much justice in this reviewon the other hand the visuals and music are amazing
the sprites are beautifully unique from all of the other games comparable to a cartoon or a picture book
the new super fx chip is great as well
just watch a video of the title screen
its fantasticall of the musical compositions are new as well and theyre great
even if youve never played this game before listening to the music will make you feel nostalgic
this really adds a lot to the gameanyways if youre a selfrespecting snes owner youll get this game
its a classic
everybody loves it
just watch some gameplay and you will too
oh and for the full effect youll obviously want to have your snes hooked up to an old crt through svideo
composite video and modern hdtvs do this game no justice
its insulting
you can find crt tvs on craigslist generally very cheap too
thats because the owners who no longer want them dont realize that they need it to really get the full effect of super mario world  yoshis island
the result is beautiful crisp graphics unparalleled by anything but emulatorsladies and gentlemen this is it
the ultimate mario game
the ultimate video game periodthere is so much to do in yoshis island whether its collecting flowers stars and red coins in an attempt to aim for a perfect score or the mini games flooded through each of the six massive worlds such as roulette card match and slot machines to name a few this is without a doubt the most exciting mario game everthought super mario world was big didnt you
that game looks microscopic compared to yoshis island
as i mention above trying to get a  score in every level is a major reason the game is so much fun because you have a reason to replay yoshis island over and over
in some levels you may be left wandering around for a long time until you find all the red coins flowers and stars
if you ask me any one of the levels in yoshis island is twice as long as the ones in super mario world and probably three or four times bigger than the ones in super mario bros   nintendo really went out of their way to bring mario fans the biggest adventure yet and the funny thing about the game is how it didnt receive as much attention as youd expect when it hit stores in the levels in this game are positively packed with tons of goodies
flowers stars coins ups enemies pswitches you name it
the thing that amazes me is that  years after owning the game im still finding more of those invisible floating clouds usually containing stars inside
there must be thousands of those babiesspeaking of babies cry cry cry
yeah mario is pretty darn annoying but you have to remember hes just a baby
you were crying like that too
you have to forgive him
cuddle him and be thankful you dont have to raise this childthe only problem is that the music could have been better
its not bad i mean it sounds really good but most of the themes dont really impress me
theyre still pretty catchy you will remember them after you turn off the game but i dont know
just not the kind of music youd expect to hear in a mario game
its like nintendo wanted to progress the typical mario themes into something bigger
actually the music is like a soundtrack to a childrens bookthe challenge is excellent which means just right
one of the hardest mario games to date you will be playing this game for a long long time
trust me youll want to dig in and replay this bad boy over and over because of the amount of fun it offers
the challenge isnt in reaching the end of the level
its in trying to get a score of  in every levelyoshi was just starting out in the original super mario world and nintendo werent entirely sure what kind of things they wanted to do with him
look how much yoshi has improved in this game
you can jump on enemies stomp on enemies spit enemies at other enemies turn enemies into eggs and shoot eggs with a sliding target thing its hard to explain but it will make perfect sense once you see it
you can also aim your tongue upward reaching for things above you including baby mario when he floats away
you control yoshi throughout the game which explains all the new things he can dothis game is just incredible
please pick it up
you wont regret it
ive played yoshis island a lot and thanks to tons of practice ive become pretty good at it i still cant get  in every level though but thats a pretty difficult task
i have to say the final boss battle with bowser simply blows my mind
i simply love shooting eggs at him while having to jump around on tiny rocks
a fantastic battlealso a reviewer below named linda mccormick says you need some kind of special equipment to play yoshis island
thats not true
just a regular controller will work
she may have meant the nintendo  yoshi game or a different game entirelyin  super mario world was the pack in game when you bought the snes and it was a great game
so to everyones surprise nintendo announced it was making the sequel to it and in  it was released on the snes
not only was it one of the best games for that console it also was a sequel superior to the original and also very different
it sold very well and went on to be a solid entry in the super mario bros seriessuper mario world  yoshis island stars the lovable dinosaur named yoshi
as it turns out this is a prequel of sorts as on the night the stork went to deliver twin babies mario and luigi a sorcerer came out of nowhere and attempted to steal them
he only got baby luigi while baby mario fell straight down and onto the back of yoshi
yoshi and his fellow dino buddies decided that they would reunite baby mario with his brother and go off on a grand adventure
what lies ahead for yoshi and baby mario are  worlds each with  stages filled with enemies traps obstacles puzzles and secretseach stage has the same goal go from point a to point b yoshi can run jump duck down and do his flutter kick which lets him hover in the air for a few seconds
he can also swallow most of the enemies and turns them ito eggs
they are your ammo for shooting at other enemies or stuff floating in the air
some stages call for you to transform into objects submarine train helicopter etc
while others let you control baby mario after you touch a starman this games version of the invincibility star
after you finish each stage you are graded in points with  being the most you can earn
getting a perfect score on each stage in every world means unlocking a secret stage in that world
the game provides  separate save slots and saves your game after you complete a stagethe pros the game looked so good back and by todays standards it still passes as a nice game to watch in action
the graphics and overall presentation give it the preschool feel of lush colors catchy music and kiddie sound effects
the controls are spot on you will master them in a few seconds and start having fun quickly
there are lots of items to collect and so many enemies to defeat but you wont mind because theres so much variety as far as stages puzzles and the enemies and bosses you encounter
dont be fooled by the cutesy graphics and kiddy theme here this game is notoriously hard
its also going to take you a long while to beat with  stages from the get go plus  bonus stages open up once you get perfect scores for every stagethe cons like i said before its a hard game and will turn off some players if they are going through it the first time
some players might also be turned off by the cutesy graphics and automatically dismiss it which is a shame because it is such a great game it adds charm to the whole packagethis game was so good it was released as an enhanced port on the game boy advance in  to a new generation of gamers
so if you havent played this game yet you can either find the snes cartridge or get it for the game boy advance
it was one of the best games and sold millions around the world
find out why as soon as possible
i highly recommend ityoshis islandsuper mario world  is one of the greatest super nintendo games that was ever created
there have been many great games out there that had won my heart as well as fans from back in the day
earthbound terranigma super mario allstars super mario kart starfox super metroid chrono trigger and many many others
this is one game that you need to own in your collection even if your not a collector of the old school games
it is one of the best looking best controlled and best platforming game i believe of all time for the snes
super mario world is good but yoshis island beats it everything about this game just has it slated as perfect
great level design  the levels are bright and colorful no two stages look the same everything is different in every portion of the stageawesome boss battles  enemies  fighting enemies from the mario series piranha plants koopa troopas para troopas shyguys chain chomps taking on a frog that eats you baby bowser  kamek
perfect controls  one of the best controlled games for the super nintendos controller
dpad works great for moving yoshi and buttons are not hard to remember using for attacks or for special tricks you make yoshi use on his enemies ground pounding firing frost breath and etc
beautiful graphics  one of the best graphics games on the snes system other than terranigma and starfox
all of these games being on a  bit system
just goregous
you owe it to yourself to pick up the best game in the entire super nintendo library
if you find it in a store for cheap do not let it get awayok this game is cheeesy
the graphics arent great and it definitely isnt as good as yoshis world but it still rocks
it is challenging and fun
i am a huge mario fan and although this game pales in comparison to the original mario games there is still a lot of levels jumping on creatures and fighting bad guys to keep you entertained
i would definitely reccomend this to any marioadventure fanif you are an avid nintendo fan and you have an snes then you need to get this game
yoshis island shows a lot of evolution in nintendos oldschool games
although it is nothing like its predecessor aka
super mario world it still manages to maintain the feel of a traditional mario gameyoshis island has a unique array of boss characters
they each have different strengths and weaknesses and there are two per world which should make for an interesting challenge
although in my opinion they are quite easy
something else i like about yoshis island are all the different enemies there are dozens
each one is unique as well and adds a lot of diversity to the gamethe graphics are some of the best ive seen for the snes
while they do look a little cartoony they look like wonderfully handdrawn canvas pictures
the paralax scrolling is nice as well
the music for each level is extremely catchy like the jungle themethe story is also interesting it takes place when mario is a baby and your mission is not to save princess peachit is to save baby luigi from kamek and baby bowseroverall this is an extremely unique mario game
not much else can be said except wow
please dont miss this game youll regret it if you dont buy itmy favorite snes title availablesuper mario world had many levels and was like super mario bros upgraded into a whole new realm of dthis time around this doesnt follow the traditional mario franchise style of gameplayyou play as the little dino yoshi and his palswich are multi colored yoshis
you get to use yoshis tongue as a weapon making for some completly different levels disigns levels may not sound liek alot ecspecially since smw had over these levels are alot longer and much more colorfulthe music is fantastic and the graphics were a pastelcrayon look making it look as though a child had colored it insome items you can obtain are watermelons and use their seeds as a gun liek weaponsome melons are for flamesand others for icethe bosses are are each unique and span out from all the zones in the gamethere are  types of bosses a mini boss thats halfway through a zone and a full out boss they are in a castle of some sort at the end of each zonereally good game controls are easy enough the scoring system is awsome for perfectionista must haveone of the top sidescrolling classics i love it more than super mario world  thankfully its coming to gba soon
buy it
play itpros amazing graphics for its time visual different than graphics amazing controls amazing gameplay mechanic replay value soundtrack characters enemies storycons none this game is perfecta fun sequel to super mario world
in yoshis island you play as a group of yoshis trying to reunite baby mario with his brotherluigi
you travel through  beautiful hand drawn world using eggs watermelons and stars to keep baby mario safe from the clutches of little bowser and his servant kammy koopa
this is a fun game and a must have for anybody who likes yoshii remember playing this game growinhgup  when i was inbetween the age of  and  i rented this for about a week
i only got to the pirahnha plnat boss
i though along with super metrioid in was on of the harder super nintendo games to master
if you were a novice at mario like i was
here are  boss statics and startegies froma speed run on you tube recently posted
this was done use tool assitance like slowly the game speed down and like saving possibly more frequentylu than normal
the real game may take you longer or more than about  minutes or less to complete excluding the credits
but here are some startegties for most of the boss battles
i may have left out one battle before  baby boswer when you might have to fight the evil kopa magican that kidnapped bady lugi and  appears in ever boss stage making the enemies bigger most of the time
if you dont want this assitance than close the website and find out on your own i only have about  minutes until my class
yoshi island sattics
first boss enlarge has   damage resitance against egg shot attaacksnext boss shot with and egg until it splits up enough to the poin that the enlarge yoke is destroy this guy i think shout multiple eggs at the same times the exact damagage resitance is not clear because he does it so fastthe next boss is and enlarged boo using magic the evil minion of baby bowser enlarge it
hit him with five eggs each hit he will expand after the fifth eggs hits he will explouded and be reduce to endoplasimic goy d one in the box we be fast he be slow
a alternation of a quote from ghostbuster four forth boss it is simple all you got to due is push the  jar of the edge by applying more pressure than the shy  guys that are try to push it back from the center of the platform
this was a toll assited run some you maye have to do it more than once in the real game with out enhancements to defetas this boss but that is the general method for defeating this boss
 minutes into this video will continue after second appoint ment with jannet gets done around  because next appoint is not until  its only about  to   minute walk or run
going to play yugio dont think i can beat the arcade ninja turtles in under  minutes yet not good enough at dogging and countering yetfor the fifth boss the frog instead of making the frogg bigger the evil koopa that captured baby lugi and failed to get mario shrinky uo the frog swallows you
you must go inside while doggin the dijest juice hit the gage relexflex with six jumbo size eggs it will flash when hit the boss is defeated you are pulled down the and come out of his but
you will grow to your original size and the frog will be standing there back side up like a beached turtle
got to go sending the next boss which i think is the enlarge pirahan plant later
total damage resitance  for the frog not sure for the egg  yoke boss was done to quickly
this game is slowed down in parts and saving is done more than usually due to reduce speed and auto or save more often  emulator code
about  minutes into the video minus about  to  seconds of rewatchingthis guy super cheat at the pirhan plant boss taking it down befor it grow to  about size of a full grown naudrey ii maybe large
i think he used a push a button to drain energy cheat kind of like the drain boss health with vital which they had on the megaman collection cheats up until the cheats were created four number five or six than they did away with it
here the really way to beat the pirahan plant if i remember correctly it grows bigger tries to attack you there is like a sticker with like and x down near the bown of the plant near its root
you got to shot the egg of the wall and across the water at certain angel  you due it right it will hit and plant will flash i think about    time you have to repeat this process with out loosing baby mario
i higly recommend get the starts they increase counnt down time if you are hit so you can rescue baby mario before he is grabbed and taken away you have to repeat from last stage over again until you get through the whole stage with out baby mario getting capturing they also give you a higer point score for the stage you can use your points to by two items per area if you get a certain score i belive the max time he can stay of before being captured is about  second unless there is a cheat to increase that
i am about  the way done with i am past the pirhana plant the next ball is some kind of dust ball or something like that
to defeat the this bost ground pound it six time each time it will break up into smalller dust ball after six time it is defeated you have three stage to go before the next boss
the player is  about to enter the next boss castle
i am getting of in about  to   minutes  so i am going to fastfoward to the boss then i am going quick email my best friend
which is a giant turtle
hit it with  egg and another four hits using those ground pund attack this boss goes down
i am about  of the way done due to fast forward about four minutes  plus about  minutes to watch the boss fight maybe less
to beat the slug it it has  ressitance against  hit it ten times it will exploud
i am now  minutes into this  due to  minutes of fastfowarding because i only had about  to  minutes to class started
to defeat the enlarged raven that you fight on the moon hit with three ground pound attack these will send sock waves through the moon or bring up some short of post that will hit it it has a weak  damage resitance do this move correctly three times it goes down
 about done with this will post other statistics later
this boss has  percent resitance dfeat him the same way you defeated the first koopa kids in super marion on
break enough of  block with out you falling in the lava will do in this giant porcupine like boss
i am now  done with this speed run the static will probably be posted withing the next  hour  minuntes maybe less
i have three minutes to get to the next boss mninus ten to wait in the loby so i wont me marked trady
the final boss fight with bowser  has  damaga resitancte ground pounbd three times when  kid bowser is small it will send a shock wavd due it correctly it will hit he will flash them his wizard maske him grow bibbger than hit him  with   bigger eggs froma distanc ehwild doging the flying builders the destroy the platform hit him  times there mwill be the explosion effected  he will shrink and take off them you free baby lugio and the stork and congrulations you have just beat super mario world ii yooshis islandyears ago  babies named mario and luigi were being delivered by the stork until the wizard magikepa makoopa decides to kidnap both the stork and luigi leaving mario to fall into a village of yoshis on dinosaur
the yoshis all join together on different regions of the island to protect mario and rescue both the stork and luigi from the witch and evil baby bowser as they challenge evil monsters on the waya brilliant prequel to the mario universe and a fantastic sequel to a timeless snes classic
in this game you play yoshi as you can jump to even devour enemies not only that as you can collect  eggs to use them as weapons to shoot at enemies or objects that need to be shot
the music and graphics are totally exceptional with its d beautiful that offers impressive stuff like the enemies which is unlike what mario faced in the other games this platformer is one of the best snes games ever and if you havent played it i recommend you do find it or upload it and youll be glad you did played it for its a satisfying gamethe game came the first day it was predicted to come
i put this game into my super nintendo and it worked first time
not to mention the game is awesome
probably one of the best snes games i own
this game is great for all ages
i would recommend buying itthis game is a sequal prequel it was released after super mario world but the story takes place before the first mario bros game you play as yoshi to help baby mario to save the stork and his brother from baby bowser and is minions
game play as yoshi you can lick and swallow enemies and create eggs you use on bosses and enemies this gme is the first to introduce redcoins and itemswhile playing as yoshi you can transform to help along after each level you will get a bonus round for extra lives  items
this game is challenging aswell as funthis is a great game for yoshi lovers like myself
regular marionintendo fans enjoyed this game too though
its a lot of fun even if baby marios cries can get on your nerves
haha xbefore i go any further there is one reason why you need to play yoshis island
during one of the boss battles mario and yoshi are fighting a giant frogs uvala while trapped in the frogs stomach its a weird battle to say the least after defeating the frog the frog then literally expels yoshi and mario out through its rectum
without a doubt this is the strangest scene in the entire mario series even with the peach is bowser jrs mother scene in super mario sunshineif you go in expecting a conventional mario title you will be disappointed
yoshis island makes super mario bros  look like a straight up traditional mario title in comparison its that differentover the years ive played every mario game in the main series either at or near launch from the  super mario bros to the  new super mario bros  and all the games in between missing only two the  super mario land the most insubstantial mario game in existence and the  super mario sunshine from  for the gamecubemy personal history with yoshis island is i first played the first few levels at a lake house with my scuba instructors grandson in   in  i bought an snes cart second hand on ebay and again played it briefly
at that point in my life i had bought super mario allstars and yoshis island to play with my college friends and several of them hated the visual style of yoshis island so we really didnt play it very frequently
fast forward to  and i began playing through yoshis island in earnestbut wait you may say
what about super mario world  yoshis island
although the title may confuse things super mario world  is no more a mario game than super mario land  wario land
both use preexisting mario brands to jumpstart sales and neither one star mario
both games launched their own perspective subseries in the mario universe completely separate from the main series
and both are jawdropping titlesperhaps the most revealing evidence that yoshis island is not a mario game is its original japanese title super mario yoshis island
only when nintendo brought the game to the states did the title super mario world  become associated with this release
most revealing however is the  gameboy advance port in the super mario advance series where nintendo reverted back to its original japanese title of super mario yoshis island
likewise although called super mario world  this game is not a sequel to the original mario world in the conventional series but appears first chronologicay
nintendo released the loose sequel the  yoshis island for the n and the  yoshis island ds for the dsall that being said what does this dispute between is it a mario game or not
the game besides my own personal justification for not playing the game for so many years
what does this distinction have to do with the actual gameplay itself
well quite a lot actually
just like super mario land  wario land where you play as wario you do not control mario
instead with only very brief exceptions you control yoshi
exclusivelyanother big change
the art style
due to the game taking place while mario is a baby the art style reflects a storybook hand drawn visual appearance and also features what can only be considered crayon coloured backgrounds and sprites
by  nintendo had mastered the graphically prowess of the snes and with the advent of the super fx  chip they accomplished visual feats which you would think was far beyond the power of the snes
that same year nintendo released donkey kong country another amazing title visually
yoshis island features sprite scaling and rotation advertised as morphmation technology basic polygonal rendering for limited d effects and advanced parallax scrollingwhile daring this visual style gives yoshis island the appearance of being marketed for small children
while mario has always been whimsical and colourful yoshis island takes this tendency to even a more extreme place and as a result has the potential to turn off a lot of players my college buddies from back in the day for instance
appearances are ultimately deceiving however not only is yoshis island one of the best platformers out there with deep engrossing gameplay but to fully complete the game and  each level is quite challengingchronologically yoshis island takes place very early on in marios history
given how each zelda title keeps going further and further back one is hesitant to call yoshis island the first mario game inseries though how much further back can you go than when mario and luigi are babies
this game also famously introduces kamek a magikoopa who would later become a major character in his own right as bowsers premier councilor the consigliere to borrow a term from the godfather of the koopa clan
kamek kidnaps baby luigi and it is up to a number of different yoshis to reunite baby mario and baby yoshithe gamplay is simple
navigate through each level with yoshi to the end
there is no health or hit points  rather if yoshi gets damaged baby mario with an earscreeching cry floats off in a bubble and you have approximately ten seconds to regain mario
if you do not several magikoopas come and take mario away and the player loses a life
if you collect starmen enter middlerings which function as halfway markers for the level much like the midlevel flags in later mario titles or use point stars and point stars you can increase this timer to a maximum of thirty seconsthere are no power ups instead yoshi swallows enemies converts them into eggs rather curiously in a biological process nowhere elaborate upon by nintendo and then can shoot the eggs at various angles
also at various points yoshi can turn into different vehicles such as a helicopter or a drilling machine by touching a vehicle transforming icon
if yoshi touches a star mario jumps off his back and becomes invincible
invincible mario is the only time you actually play as mario
once his invinicibility wears off mario is transported back to the original location of where he left yoshieach level sports five flowers twenty red coins and thirty starmen
to  the levels and unlock the bonus level found at the end of each of the six worlds you must find all items
also the levels are long and have no time limitthe music is also a strongpoint in the game with miyamoto praising koji kondos work in one of the iwata asks interviews
kondo then told miyamoto that was the first time he ever praised his work
having played super mario  countless times over since  imagine my shock to find out wingvanish marios theme is lifted directly from the invincibility theme in this titleif you go in expecting a conventional mario title you will be disappointed
but for those looking for an excellent engrossing platformer starring everyones favorite mario dinosaur you will not be disappointedunfortunately super mario world  yoshis island as of november  has not been released on the wiis virtual console due to difficulties emulating the super fx  chip
the only way to play this fantastic game is a working snes or if you pick up the gameboy advance port from   heres holding out hope nintendo will rerelease this awesome game so more gamers can experience its amazing goodnesslist of bossesworld  burt the bashful fort salvo the slime castleworld  bigger boo fort roger the potted ghost castleworld  prince froggy fort naval piranha castleworld  marching milde fort hookbill the koopa castleworld  sluggy the unshaven fort raphael the raven castleworld  taptap the red nose fort taptap the golden castle door  baby bowser castle

glad to add it to my collection
if your trying to decide whether or not to buy it just do itbecause the longer you wait the more rare and expensive these classic games are going to become seemed to be a great year for a gamer
the donkey kong country series went portable with dk land rayman was a surprise full of perfection and vectorman appealed to sega genesis players with its colorful prerendered graphics that dkc had done
all of these games were great but yoshis island was the best of all
while rayman would have been my favorite game of all time it suffered from the most extreme difficulty ever
yoshis island has amazing graphics catchy soundmusic awesome gameplay and forgiving difficulty alikethis is not the average mario game but rather is it what fans would call a yoshi game since it plays a lot differently
as yoshi you romp through levels like usual but now you can throw eggs at enemies as well as eat enemies to make eggs
there is also a huge variety of obstacles like boulders loads of unique platforms collectible flowers the enemies doing all kinds of stuff etc etc
but the thing is it is all wellcrafted and carefully put together for one of the ultimate platforming experiences
dont believe me
go on some video websites and watch some gameplay footage
one look and youll agree that it looks beyond terrificthere are also some bonuses in the game to help you on your quest to defeat the evil bowser jr for example there are small houses that you may possibly find in a level it requires a key though
once you are able to enter in you must compete with an enemy in a certain challenge collect most coins pop most balloons etc
theres also bonus challenges when the goal chooses a flower you had collected in a roulettelike wayoverall its definitely one of the greatest platformers i have ever played
i may prefer super mario world as the best of all but this game certainly comes close to winning that titlethis was purchased as a gift for my daughter
since she has been home this weekend for the holiday it has been checked out and is working perfectlyi find it odd that i would give this game a higher overall rating than fun rating but i feel its appropriatethis game is beautifully made with excellent graphics levels and play control
you cant ask for anything morethe only problem with the game is its too easy to beat
this doesnt make the game any worse it just makes it less fun
fortunately even long after you beat the game you can go back through it and try to get a score of  on as levels many as you can
its an extraordinary challenge that i have yet to complete even after years and yearsi never was a big fan of collecting coins though so id rather just go through the game again and beat all of the levels once more than worry about a score
still whether you like beating levels or collecting coins this game has something for everybody
i highly recommend at least a rentalthis game claims to be the sequel to super mario world though the two are very different
both are mario platforming titles but yoshis island is played a little differently
baby luigi has been kidnapped and its up to his brother mario and his yoshi friends to save him from kamek and baby bowser
play as yoshi and defeat enemies by turning them into eggs and throwing the eggs
find and collect all  red coins  flowers and  stars to get a perfect score
transform into lots of different vehicles to get past dangerous obsticles
yoshis island is fun for all agesfor those of you who loved the first game in the donkey kong country trilogy for snes this is highly recommended
diddy and dixie are the charachters in this one and they certainly have more attitude than the titular beloved primate
the levels are more elaborate than the first one and just as fun
everything you loved about the first one is present in the sequeltwo player fun makes the game fun and excitingi love this game it is definitely a classic arguably the best in the trio for the snesdonkey kong has been kidnapped by k rool again
however diddy kong is left behind but is he alone in this quest
nope with the help from dixie kong both kongs are off to save donkey kong and beat k rool againi must say that this game is even more enjoyable than the first of the series and the st donkey kong country is already a classic
dixie kong has some special abilities she has to offer here
when she twirls her hair she can defeat the baddies and also glide in the air
a new feature for the seriesanother new feature is the kong throwing method in which you can team up both diddy and dixie and use it to grab outofreach items and platforms you must have both kongs in order to use it thoughyour animals buddies also increase with the help of a springy snake and a webmaking spider
squawks rambi and enguarde also come back better than everthe music and the graphics are excellent
again rarewares production make the bit look improved and the soundtrack is just as great as the firstoverall if you are looking for a masterpiece of an snes game put in donkey kong country  and prepare to play with the chimpsthis game has alot of worlds and is challenging to beat at some points it is a two player game as well solo u also get alot of new gaurdians then number with the runaway success of donkey kong country rare went back to the drawing board and a year later came the sequel
in  rare developed and released donkey kong country  diddy kongs quest for the super nes
it was an immediate success
the sequel to dkc was bigger and better in every way possible
better graphics better music brand new stages with even more variety and new characters helped catapult this game into millions of homesdonkey kong country  diddy kongs quest plays out like this donkey kong has been kidnapped by king k rool now called kaptain k rool and wants dks banana hoard as a ransom payment
instead diddy kong and his partner dixie kong decide to rescue him
like the first game you can play a one player game you control both characters two player game you and another player control the characters and two player contest players take turns in conquering the stages
there are brand new worlds with new stages to explore and its all under the pirate theme as old and new enemies dress and talk the part
youll be going through the stages collecting bananas letters and ups to rack up extra lives like before
this time youll also collect banana coins the games currency kremling coins special currency to gain access to a secret world and dk coins
new animals join in to help you this as well as old friends like rambi and enguarde
youll also meet new characters to help you along the way as well
save your progress when you reach a certain character and youll need to do so often because the challenge has been ramped up this timethe pros if you thought donkey kong country was an awesome game then this sequel blows it out of the water completely
everything that made dkc great is here for dkc and more stuff was added new worlds plus a secret one more stages with more depth and variety new kong characters and friendly animals along with some old favorites more stuff to collect doubling its replay value and even more codes to discover
its also a lot harder so dont be surprised to replay certain stages more than oncethe cons nonerare went all out and produced a game that is worthy of being the sequel to donkey kong country
its easy to see why this game sold out just as quickly and had people amazed that the snes was capable of playing this kind of game
it was another groundbreaking experience at the time and it still holds up as a fun game
you can get this game used or if you have a wii download this game from the virtual console service for  points 
you absolutely need to have this game in your collection asapi got this game about ten years ago for my birthday needless to say i was entranced by the stunning beauty of this game
being a fan of the original donkey kong country i loved its amazing sequalthe plot dk gets kidnapped by krool
its up to diddy and dixie to save him now
you have eight worlds to traverse to amazing environments to get through and dozens of baddies to stomp
classic dk countryhow about the graphicsprobably the best ive seen for the snes the paralax scrolling is maginificent
on pirate ship levels the water in the background is dimensional and scrolls at different paces
the graphics are very clear and vivid and really bring out the sharpness in the game
this game has adopted the theme of pirates remember all the kremlings in dkc 
now they all have pirate clothing and peglegs and stuffspeaking of kremlings lets run through the bestiary
from hopping kremlings to invincible zingers bees the enemy range is very wide each enemy has its own strengths and weaknesses
one particualr kremling dualwields two swords and is only vulnerable when he gets them stuck in the ground
there are also different colored variations of enemies the pink version of this kremling has his swirds stuck in the ground for a much shorter amount of time so its tougher to kill himlevel designthis is an amazing part there is so much diversity of stages in the game its not even funny
there are carnival stages where youre on a roller coaster trying to dodge closing gates there is a giant haunted mansion where fiftyfoot ghosts chase you down while youre driving a rusty old minecart and there are levels in which you are underwater
did you think there were only these level types
guess again pirate ships ship sails lava boiling water levels giant towers with toxic water following you up sunken sea ships forests of thorn bushes etc
i could go on and onthe music is amazing
the theme of the bramble forest levels is particularly awesome to listen to while youre playing i sometimes pause the game just to listen to that song play
or you could listen to the mysterious tune of the gloomy gulch stages which are also cooleven if you beat this game there is still plenty more to do collect all the dk coins
collect all the bonus game coins
comlete world  the lost world
this game will never have you boredas far as difficulty goes this game has got it all the first level
a baby could do it
however there is a level near the end of the game called toxic tower in which intoxicated water floods the inside of a tower while you struggle to climb up and up and up away from it
all in all the more worlds you master the tougher the levels areand now for some hintson the map screen when your character is standing on a level its name will appear
if there is an exclamation point next to the level name it means you have all the bonus coins there
if theres a dk symbol then youve found the dk coincollect banana coins
use them to save your game at wrinkly kongs house to ask for secret gameplay hints from cranky which are very handy and to warp to worlds that youve previously visited in funkys flights or to compete in swankys minigames to earn extra livesthe fun never stops
if you have an snes get this game
if you dont then buy the system and this game
youll regret itoh oh donkey kongs been captured and now diddy and his friend dixie must save him before its to late
this is a sweet game and thier is a new member in the kong family and new animal friends to help you out
this is a sweet gameif you liked this game check out dkc  dkc i love this game for the graphics the music and the cool level designdefinatly a challenge trying to find all the dk coins and rescuing donkey kong
i have completed most of the game and all of the kremling world
ya know the weird lookin place with the psychidellic volcano  i say this is definatly the best and always fun to play now only if they would come out with it on a portable systemanyway buy this game its sure to delightif it werent for that stupid kids negative review the overall score would be a perfect  looks like hes afraid of the challange
hes also scared of the music
i hate kids reviewsgraphics a beautiful feast for the eyes
the graphics look better than the firstmusic great music
from the piratey music in the first world to the spooky tune of gloomy gulchsound just gotta love diddys monkey rapgameplay this time you got diddy and dixie

you can also look for coins and get things such as hints lost levels or making cranky like you

also this game is going to be rereleased for the gba later on
buy itthis is my favorite donkey kong game out of the   all of them are extremely good gamesvery entertaining
this one is kind of hard if you want to try to get all of the dk coins from all of the levels in order to get the proper ending
you can find some really fun cheats online for this game which also makes it really funanyway this game is one of the classicsup there with super mario world and super metroid
the soundtrack is amazing like all of the donkey kong country games some of the levels get to be quite challenging especially when you want to find all of the dk coins and the graphics are really lush and beautiful
i would definitly recommend this game to everyonethis game is very good
it has great levels and its a good challengethis game is great fun

fast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
awhats not to love about dk for snes
the cartridge arrived in great condition
the game operates without issue and i enjoy playing itthe donkey kong country series was the reason i purchased a super nintendo
simply put donkey kong country  is a classic that no fan of old school platformers should be withoutthe goodthe graphics are excelllent the best on the snesthe controls are easy to learn and very smooththe variety of the levels is incredible there are roller coaster levels hot air balloon riding levels and much morethe boss battles are ingenius and amazingly fun
the best part of the gamethere is an excellent strategy guide available for it the official nintendo power onebritish humor is hillariousmany secretsthe badpretty easy gamecan become a little boring near the endcompared to modern day d platformers which are mostly inspired by this series the graphics and gameplay might seem rather outdated to some gamersstory is rather nonexistentoverall donkey kong country  is a fine addition to anybodys video game collection
a revolutionary game that is still great fun
the excellent level design and the multitude of secrets will have you playing for a long time
a classicconcept take an incredibly fun gamedonkey kong country and make it better by including better graphics better musicmy favorite soundtrack of all time a better plot new pals and more bad guysstory donkey kong gets kidnapped by king k rool and it is up to diddysidekick on donkey kong country and dixie to save him
old pals aiding you in your questare rambi the rhinobrute strength enguarde the swordfishdefeat underwater foes and squawks the parrotto fly
you also have new pals rattly the rattlesnakemad hops squitter the spiderwebs to reach higher goals clapper the sealto freee water or cool it and glimmer the angler fishto help see underwatergraphics look at this game
you can tell me the pirate theme is not cool
the environments are incredible for being a snes game
if you thought donkey kong country looked good wait till you see this onebest seen on lost world levelsmusic youll love diddys monkey rap and dixies strumming the electric guitar
thats just when you beat the level
you will find yourself humming the beat to yourself everywhere you go
the soundtrack is so amazing that i had to download it and put it on a cd so i could listen to it wherever i gobest heard on the krazy kremland levelsdifficultly the game puts up little resistance when trying to beat it but trying to master it comletion is extremely difficult
some levels may be harder than others but there are a few trials in the gamebest examples on gloomy gulch levelsgameplay you have some new moves in this one
you can team up and throw your partner to reach higher platforms of defeat enemies
you also can do a helicopter spin with dixie for reach far away platformsoverall as i stated for the title this is my favorite series of all time and all the donkey kongs for snes are masterpieces
its a shame to see that nintendo has been making spinoffs of donkey kongdonkey kong jungle beat king of swing donkey konga     mario vs donkey kong while these games may or may not be good we have yet to see a donkey kong platform game since donkey kong  whether there is a reason i dont know but i hope nintendo will make one before the revolution comes outawesome game
its fun hard and simple
great graphics too
super funthis is an amazing game for anyone at any age
i first played it when i was like  or super mario rpg legend of the seven stars is not a very well known game why is this
because it was released in the year  at the very end of the snes life cycle
so many people were grabbing nintendo s and this amazing game was completely overlooked
however it still sold about a million copies and will go down in history as one of the greatest mario titles ever
im sure you noticed i said squaresoft in my title thats because back in  squareenix was formally known as squaresoft
i consider this one of their best games ever createdgraphics  at the time of its release the snes had just about enough and it was nintendo s job to take over
although the  was revolutionary mario rpg had one of the best looking games for the snes
the very well done d and art style blended together so well
the graphics were topnotch at the time and i still think they did an amazing job with it
in my opinion this was the best looking game for the snes with sharp textures and awesome modeling this game has no problem fitting in with the games of the presentgameplay  smrpg is a turn base role playing game like older final fantasy games
you will feel a lot of similarity comparing this to ff seriesyour buttons on the snes controller serve as the attack menu interface
a  attack y  magic b  defendrun away x  items
it is a very simple combat system that youll grab the hang of it from the start
not to mention that toad gives a little help on controls if needed
they also have a time attack for basic attacks
what i mean is you select your attack a button and press a right as your hitting the enemy for a continued comboextra damageout of combat the game has some fun platform elements to it including mario elements as in secret boxes and jumping for coins
there are a bunch of minigames along the way including puzzles here and there
so not only is the combat excellent but out of combat is amazing to add
there are plenty of hidden goodies to find along the way including final weapons for everyonemusic   the music was done by yoko shimomura a female music composer for video games who has quite the amazing history of video games soundtracks including street fighter  kingdom hearts legend of mana and morethe work she did for smrpg was outstanding i still have the geno woods song stuck in my head
each melody was perfectly mastered and each piece of music was so well done you will humming these tunes for a long time
the music fits very well into the story line it really pulls you into the game
i am very amazed with the music from this gamestory  a easy way of summing this game including story mode up easily is its a final fantasy world and mario came over to visit
everything will remind you of ff games right down to the story linewhat happens is these group of enemies called the smithy gang destroyed a place called star road where everyones wishing go to become true but now that it is destroyed no ones wishes will ever come true again all hope is lost for mushroom kingdom
until mario meets a kid named mallow a small puffy cloud who thinks he is a tadpole who lives with his grandfather who really is a tadpole
mallow shortly finds out by his grandfather that he is not his grandfather and that he is not a tadpole
mallow who is very shocked about the news joins mario in search for his real parents
later they meet a star spirit who took over a body of a doll named geno
geno went to mario for help in order to repair star road and make everyones wishes come true again
so he joins marios party no pun intended to take back the missing stars from other smithy gang members
on top of that peach has been taken by a mad man named booster who kinda reminds me of wario
him and his snifits look like shy guys are taking the princess to marrymore so he can marry his bride to be peach
not if mario has anything to say about it
mario and his gang have many hurdles along the way but will they repair star road
i highly recommend this game to all rpg fans out there
it is on the wii for purchase and this is most worth itfinal rundown overall this game was perfect at the time it was also nice to see a story based mario game
i highly recommend this game for those of you that own a wii you can buy this game now on the wii shop channelprosamazing set of charactersgreat gameplaysuper mario with a well written story was a awesome change of pacemany extra hidden goodiesi love this game honestly need to remake this game with updated graphics and lengthier storyline with a lot more features on it it would be the best if they could do it againi own a snes but its sadly dying down slowly and the graphics are very snowy and worst with a flat screen but since i own a nintendo wii i downloaded this game for  wii points and i can play with a cordless classic wii controller and this game is worth every penny
it first starts off with the usual princess gets kidnapped by bowser and mario comes to the rescue and the best story happens where a giant sword takes over bowsers castle which bowser teams up with mario peach geno and mallow who take a journey to defeat the evil smithy and his gang of evil villians who are taking over the mushroom kingdom
the whole role playing game is fun and awesome with weapons and upgrades to more challenging characters and the game play is alot longer which im guessing they added extra memory to make this gamethis was one of the final most finest moment games in snes history has to offer before snes died and if you own a snes in good shape or a nintendo wii then you need this gamea must haveomg this was the highlight of my life
i remember getting this for christmas one year and i was too little to understand iti never got past the hammer brosbut as i got older i began to understand how things worked and i was blown away
the amazing story the amazing graphics all the characters and enemies all the worlds to exploresome of my favs were monstro town booster tower nimbus land etc
its just a dreami keep waiting for the day for them to make a sequel to this one
the others mario rpgs just dont compare to this one
its a masterpiece
theres also a lot of humor in this gameid have to say the funniest enemies are the axem rangers i loved the power rangers also as a kid and i busted out laughing when i saw this
another thing i loved about this game were all the secrets
i dont think i ever found them all but i did find the casino and the lazy shell among othersi think the only way to beat culex is with the lazy shell or the star egg which i never had if someone can do it without any of these things id love to see it
i never got the  jump thing which i think youd need so kid of cheat to do that bc its near impossible
i have absolutely no complaints about this game other than they need a sequel
if you love mario or rpgs
buy this game immediately though i couldnt imagine you not already knowing about this game if you love either one of those thingsi hope that i am not the last person to put in my two cents on this game even though i do realize how long its been out eight or nine years i believeits thanks to games like this that im so glad i held onto my super nes after all the flashier stuff like the playstation and xbox came out
next to the original nintendo system it is bar none the greatest system with some of the best titles to ever have hit the markets
that being said rest assured that mario rpg legend of the seven stars is one of the most underrated but fantastic games you could hope to play on a bit console
ive asked many many people whether or not they had the pleasure to play it and i get a surprising number of vacant stares and silent head shakes
how this managed to slip under the radar of so many gamers is beyond me but i assume it has something to do with the advent of the digital modules overshadowing those last few years of the bit systemsi wont go out on any limb and say that its one of the best games ever or even one of the best games for the super nintendo but i will say that it provided me with plenty of hours of entertainment and the incredibly rich charming gameplay along with the silly sense of humor dotted throughout the game keep me coming back every year or so to do it all over again
ive outgrown a lot of things in this old world but ive never outgrown this fantastic originalif youre feeling any dismay whatsoever over the sagging mario series pop this puppy into your snes i assume if youre a real gamer youve held onto yours and give it the oncethrough
its not too long but its also not so short as to be irritatingly easy
in fact the last boss can manage to give me a real run for my money even at my age  where returning to your childhood favorites can run the risk of disappointing you with their easinessi would absolutely recommend this one particularly to rpg fans who are looking for something a little different
the graphics are above average for a super nintendo game the music is upbeat and catchy and can get stuck in your head for hours in keeping with mario game music tradition
 the characters are all incredibly likable and they come loaded with some very creative battle attacks
check it out you just might be pleasantly surprised at how much you like itwhen the super nes was beginning its end games sometimes are rushed out to beat the discontinuing of games and systems
mega man  was the last nes game released in america and it was not all that worthwhile of a game although it is necessary to complete any mega man collection
however for the super nes one of the last few games ended up being a great classic super mario rpg
combining the world of mario with the designs of a classic rpg setting this game is not only a great game but a landmark game in the rpg genrethis game uses a simple rpg system to introduce newbies to rpgs but at the same time it captivates veteran gamers with a great story and interesting characters
the biggest irony is that mario doesnt speak which is intended to be classic because a lot of rpgs have main characters that never speak
this will surely please even the jaded rpg gamersince it came out near the end of the super nes at least in america anyway this game is very hard to find
nevertheless it is well worth your time
the music is very good the characters and story well developed and the oldskoolstyle battle system is very pleasing indeed
plus mario and bowser actually fight sidebysideits a shame that squaresoft and nintendo didnt do any future joint projects together because this is a gaming feat
perhaps they will now that squaresoft is releasing past games on the game boy advanced super mario rpg for advanced anyone
 but that has yet to be seen
my advice for you is to get this game
the difficulty factor is rather easy but do yourself a favor and engage yourself in a superb rpgthis game is awesome
snes couldnt make a better rpgits about some guy named smithy
he takes over bowsers keep so bowser teams with mario and the princess to get it back
there is also some others characters
mallow and this other magickoopa guy
its pretty long fun and challenging at parts
i never new mario and bowser would teamget this game even if it is on snesokay all rpgs should look into this game
squaresoft and nintendo make a unstoppable combination
unforunately squaresoft decided to take the wrong route with disneys kindom hearts which is nothing compared to mario rpg
the characters are sweet and the little secret behind culex is sweet theres a way you can fight a ff guy in this game with the original ff boss music
the storyline is actually understandable marios funny since he cant talk so explainings a whole new thing
add in a sweet battle system a sword and geno and the games the best rpg ever created to this day
no ff or ff winternet will ever beat a game like thisif you have not played it somethings wrong with you
get it off ebay or something because its worth it i promisea helpful tip for current ownersthere is a secret behind the shiny stone
take it to monstro town make sure charas are lv and check the doors for a surprise visit from culex a enemy of some sort related to fffirst and foremost i am not an rpg fan
i never jumped on the final fantasy bandwagon
i dont care for the dragon quest games
i have never played chrono trigger or any of its remakes
but i have to admit that all of the games i mentioned helped usher in a major video games category that has been around since the days of the original nes
so when word broke out that nintendo and squaresoft now known as square enix were working together on a rpg game featuring mario  using final fantasy style game play many gamers were immediately excited and waited to play this masterpiece
and so in  super mario rpg legend of the seven stars was released on the snes and was and still is one of the best rpgs
if you havent played this game yet you are missing outthe game starts out with you controlling mario running off to rescue princess toadstool from bowser
during your fight a swordlike enemy crashes through the roof of bowsers castle and everyone gets blown sky high in different directions
after watching a few scenes and reading text you find out a new enemy is out to take over the mushroom kingdom and its up to mario to find princess toadstool and defeat smithy your new rival
and thats basically how the story begins
you control mario as you make your way through different sections of the mushroom kingdom talk to different people discover side quest missions and buying and finding various weapons and items for you and your party to use
thats right you eventually befriend certain characters who join you on your mission and when you face off against enemies and bosses you can use them during the fight
you can choose mario and two other characters to fight your battles and swap out the other two characters with new characters you meet  or  characters in all who join your party
it adds to the strategy on how to beat the bad guys since each character has different strengths and weaknesses along with their own attacks and defenses that benefit a character or all  characters in playthe pros there is a very good reason on why this game was and still is cherished as one of the finest rpgs ever made for the snes
its that every element of this game works well and compliments each other
the graphics feature colorful backgrounds and scenery  fully rendered characters all under a birds eye view set in  overhead perspective
the sounds including audio tracks and sound effects fit the mood nicely
the story is told very well as if you are playing a final fantasy game mixed with the nintendo brand humor that will have you laughing at what happens
plus this game is loaded with references from past mario games and nods to final fantasy games including an appearance from a well known enemy from the final fantasy world if you know where to find him
the game play is taken entirely from past final fantasy games so anyone who has played them will feel right at home new rpg players like myself will catch on pretty quickly
thats because the controls are easy to use once you learn all the buttons and pay attention to prompts in the game on how to fight etc
this game is also long and challenging so prepare to fight fight and fight and completing all of the side quest missions extends the life of the game after you beat the main storythe cons the only thing that i could say here is that this was one of the last batch of super nintendo games that was released as the sony playstation was making huge waves and the world was waiting for the nintendo  nintendos next console to be released
its not a knock on the game itself at all but it was just the timing of its release that makes it uniqueyou cannot go wrong with getting this game
it made guys like me who dont like rpgs take a chance and play this game
if youre tempted to find it i wish you good luck because there arent many people willing to part with it and for those who are selling it are asking for a pretty high price
you can download this for your nintendo wii for  points  which is a pretty sweet deal
i have the original snes cartridge and absolutely love this game
you will too and you can find videos of this game in action so check them out first if you want to
highly recommendedkids really enjoy it even though it is older
still fun for adults too who have never played it
downloaded from wiishop channel for only  coins thru club nintendo
requires classic controller
getting it for basically free using the coins was a plus
 for an old game cartridge is insane when you can download it to your wii for under  if not freeseriously i played this game in highschool when it first came out
the secrets are legendary the graphics were state of the art cgi for its time the characters are classic so why hasnt this been rereleased for the gameboy advance as all the other good super nes games have
where is it on the virtual console
and most importantly where is the sequel for the wii or the ds
come on now square and nintendo settle your differences and produce another game that will be on par with kingdom heartsi remember when i was just about  years old i rented this
it was much different then any game i ever played after all
even today being an rpg fan this still gets a place in my heartthe game was released near the sness last breath
and square and nintendo worked together to make this gamegameplay very fun
its an rpg with style
you can even jump
their are lots of areas and tons of secrets and minigames
the battle system is neat and easy
you even get peachtoadstool and even bowser in your team
you are going to love itgraphics whoah
this is one of the best looking snes games out there
lush detailed dish graphics that surpass the sness abilitiesmusicsound very good
the forest maze music is neatstory one of the better mario storiesoverall a classic
worth getting
it really needs to be remade for the ds thoughi still remember when i first rented this game as a kid and oh man was i ever addicted
i loved it so much i racked up  weeks worth of late fees
well of course i eventually bought it
everything about this game is great and sets the standards for rpgs to come
ill cut it down for yougraphics the graphics are perhaps one of the best things about this game especially when it first came out
it uses the same technology that donkey kong used and it is at a rd person angle
graphics dont make any game but it sure contributes to this one mario has never looked bettereversound yep the sound is also amazing
perhaps even better than the graphics
i can still remember the sound at particular parts of the game even though i havent played it in over a year
the boss music will really stick with you so will the tadpole pond music
but those are just a few of the places that are memorable
i really think the sound is what did it for me with this game it just hits you in that classic way
much like how zelda link to the past is or final fantasy gameplay gameplay is also where this game shines
instead of just running around and going place to place like any typical rpg you can jump dodge enemies run into enemies with a star even attempt to swim up a waterfall
this game allows for a wide range of actions within the field among those i just listed
and the camera angle is just right for most of the jumpsfun factoryepp you read that right five million
the fun factor is the hands down best part about this game
you can race on yoshi chase a crazy guy up a hill stomp moombas on pipes battle optional bosses attempt  super jumps find hidden items set out by a trio of ghosts hell theres almost anything you can imagine
although if you have some hang up about immaturity in video games i would advise you to keep away from this game
this game utilizes every childish tidbit of humor you can possibly imagine but that is what sets it apart from other rpgs
instead of having a romantic hey that can be great toostoryline it revolves around mario and his goofy adventuresbut there is a lot more to it justt ake my word for it this is the funnest rpg of all time and probably in my top three as the greatest maybe even top twohell it may even be the beststorylineeven thought he storyline revolves around a comedic plumber the story really cannot get any better than this
you wouldnt imagine a game starring mario to have character development and backround stories for each one but it indeed does
unlike most games the storyline is also very memorable
whether its frogfucious admitting to mallow that he isnt his father or bowzer finally becoming pals with mario its all good
if you havent played this game yet you need to get it immediatly
it is very pricey though so only get it for around  bucks or lessbut if you have to pay around  it may be worth it
it will probably be a better idea to buy it instead of download it though because you need to experience the entire game on the original consoleoverall  just get this gamenow
nuff saidyears ago on the snes square and nintendo worked together to release an rpg
many people were anxiously awaiting this game and why shouldnt they have
these  companies were famous for their own hits at the time
square with chrono trigger secret of mana and the final fantasies
nintendo with legend of zelda donkey kong and of course mario
when it was released it seemed it was a game that people either loved or hated
i was one that loved the game
super mario rpg had everything that a great rpg needed with a nostalgic and original feeling to it that made it so specialat the time i thought these graphics were the greatest thing ever
the transition of mario from the nes to snes was exceptional
basically i think the graphics fit the game perfectly
just like most rpgs you move screen to screen with different surroundings at every turn
from mountains and caves to oceans and jungles its all here
the character models in this game are excellent and the pseudo d graphic feel is really cool
lastly the battle animations and lighting effects are awesome
just look at genos ultimate attack or marios fireball and tell me that is not cool
there are those that feel that the graphics are too kiddy
i for one have never understood that term
i suppose a true example of kiddy graphics would be yoshis island for the snes
do i think that the graphics are bad because of that
absolutely not the overall graphic environment provides a great setting and plenty of emotionnext we come to the sound
there are some very interesting and catchy tunes in this game
from the traditional mario theme to some very great square compositions
each area has its own unique tune and at time i found myself humming to it
as for the sound effects they all work
the attack and power sounds as well as the grunts are all well done and fit this game perfectly
there is no voice acting to speak of but what do you expect from a classic snes gamei found the gameplay to be above and beyond my expectations for this game
first let me talk about the primary world
there are over  worlds and within each world are a variety of stages that you must pass to move on
within each world are stages where you must pass through dangerous caves jungles or mountains
there are also towns as well where you can interact with characters buy items and weapons or just take a rest
every level of gameplay is unique and different
there are puzzles to solve interesting characters to meet and fun battles
this brings me to the next point the battle systemunlike most traditional rpgs the enemies are not randomly generated
for example in final fantasy you move around a area and all of a sudden you are pulled into battle
this is not the case here
while you are traveling through areas in this game you can see the enemy and engage in combat with them by walking into them
from this you can either surprise them and attack first or if they run into you they get the first strike
all in all a very interesting concept
there are so many other things i could go into but i wont give it awayoverall this classic is wonderful and one of the best rpgs i have ever played
about the challenge of the game it is actually quite easy
there are some difficult levels and bosses but the overall premise of the game is simple but i dont mean that in a bad way
a easy learning curve is just what a game needs so you can start having more fun earlier in the game
with the amount of secrets in the game and the surprising depth of the characters and story the game can offer over  hours of gameplay
also it is a great enough of a game that you will want to replay it over again as soon as you finish it
i myself have beaten this game over  times in the years i have had it
so to put it simplyif you havent gotten this game yetget it nowi have had this game for many years and to this day i still play it from start to finish
i have played final fantasy games in the past
i dont believe any one of them match up to this
im talking about the value of the entertainment
super mario rpg has no dull moments like final fantasy which are long and boring almost to the point of not knowing what to do next
super mario rpg gave me reasons to keep on playing it such as leveling up learning new abilities having  other characters on my team that have never fought on marios side to save the world
for the first time in marios long storied career teams up with his arch nemesis bowserthis game is definitely a classic but dont expect this game to be a cakewalk
this game can be downright tough in some places especially the beginning
great story as well
i cant say i wont be putting this game down anytime soonyes thats right
this game rules
you are mario and at the beginning you have to save the princess again
after that a giant sword with a face crashes into bowsers castle flinging mario bowser and the princess all in different directions and destroying the star road that connects the mushroom land to bowsers keep
so you gotta go find the  star pieces to the star road and find out what that sword is just play the game lol bowser and the princess joins your team later along with a few new friends mallow and a doll that comes to life named geno
as you play you come up with new spells weapons and sometimes you run into little games and puzzlesi am buying this game this week so i figured i should write a review for funokay if you havent played this game then where in the world are you
on my list of favorite rpgs this is nocked up at the top for  if you think its stupid that a plumber stars in one of the best rpgs then you are stupid yourself because this is nothing like other rpgsstoryline  wrong
sorry but you are not saving peach again so just get that out of your head
a beast from another dimension and his sword guardianexor they take over bowsers keep and crash the star roadgraphics  quite goodmusic  even better than the graphics
listen to it in the townsbattle style  this is the best part
ya you choose your options with no control pad
just a b x and y  oh yeah and as a hint your pretty much unbeatable if you have bowser up in front to fightthis is one of the best games nintendo ever created
certainly its well worth your money even though its an expensive game
it has excellent d graphics that really fit the game play
i know graphics do not make a game but these graphics make the game better than it would be with horrible graphics
the story is engaging and absolutely hilarious at times
the inventory system is also well thought out
the battles are fun and are never dull
the world map is also very pretty
the music is also very fitting to the game play and very catchy at that
the culex theme is also very pleasant to hear
but now on to the most important part of this review and the most important thing about the game itself the game play
the game play is absolutely spectacular
basically it makes for a superlative game
even though this game is expensive you should get it
i hope that my review convinced you to get the game
its one of the best games nintendo made
by the way i play it on the original console and i would recommend that you do the samesuper mario rpg legend of the seven stars is an rpg for the super nintendo
it is made by both nintendo and square
this is also one of the best games on the super nintendoin the game you play mario and you must go on a quest to restore the star road back to normal
you must collect seven star pieces that have been scattered all around the mushroom kingdom
as you progress through the game you join up with mallow geno bowser and princess toadstoolthis game is brilliant
it combines the rpg style of the final fantasy games with the adventure style of the mario games so well
this is a great game and it is definitely one of the best games ive ever playedthis is the best and most fun rpg ive ever played
it is well worth the moneythis game is solely responsible for getting me into rpgs
before this i never understood the idea of leveling up a character to reach maximum strength
all i knew was jump on that turtle and eat the mushrooms
p  really though if youre looking to get into rpgs this is a great place to start
familiar characters great story  gameplay music is fantastic
really just cant say enough about this classic
if it werent for this i would have never played all the other amazing rpgs on the snesthis is one of the best rpgs one of the best mario games or any video game on any system ever
it stands the test of time and has the best of both worlds wnintendo and ssgraphicssimiliar to dkc very vivid great battle effectsplay control extremely simple just walk around touch a bad guy and press some buttons
however some attacks require some button pushing which is a blastgame design the world is huge there is tons to do and dont forget about culexsatisfaction youll be stuck to your controller for weeks
words cannot expresses how awsome this game issound classic mario tunes and great final fantasyish music also
kudos to the big n and square softthe good ill be a geezer if i say everythingthe bad the game itself is flawless but you may get hooked spend full time on it and pull your hair for some sections
for long sesssions take a break within a few hours drink some coffee and listen to beatles music to clear your head
insert sitcomlike laughtrack
the funny bowser and booster kissing
lolif you are stuck onthis game then go to my website  thanksthis was the game that got me into rpgs
its a fantastic blend of mario and rpg
its a funny engaging story with great gameplay
the music is fantastic and the battles can be challenging at times especially for rpg newbies
if you want to get into rpgs or simply love any game with marios name on it you cannot go wrong with this oneseriously this game is a classic
ive beaten it at least  times and i still play it
the storyline the characters music gameplay graphicseverything about this is top notch
too bad the sequels turned out as average as paper marios amp not bad games but dont compare to this one
this is a must have classici really wasnt expecting much from this game when i bought it
my friends had sung its accolades for years but when i finally got it i was really impressed
this game has excellent characters and the combat is one of the best rpg combat systems aroundi loved this game from beginning to end and has become a new favorite of mine
if you enjoy any of the mario games or even rpgs you will enjoy this game immenselyits a lot like an early final fantasy game remixed to have a mario bros theme sans luigi being an rpg it offered much more insight into the mushroom kingdom world
also the game made great use of a d style playing field in a time when games were still mostly flat
tip this product will outlast a wii download versioni remember playing this game over and over again when i was little
i had a blast with it
i couldnt put it down
i kept on playing and playing because it was just that damn good and the replay value was off the charts
it had a great story line great characters easyfun battle system and plenty of hidden items to findthis game actually introduce me to the world of jrpg which i had never played before
i say anyone wanting some easy introduction to the jrpg genre will love this thing
from then on i would go on to more harder and more complex jrpg but i still remember my super mario rpg days
wow awesome game
they dont make them like this game more but i wish they didthis game has to be one of the greatest games of all time awesome d graphics better  graphics than in mario  buy buy this is one of the better rpg titles for snes and lets face it there were actually alot of great rpgs for the snes
i was a little skeptical about mario leaving his familiar stomping ground to the land of the seven stars but nintendo did a excellent job with this game
the story is interesting and fun the characters are memorable  and some are really funny the graphics are nice and the control is good
this is one of my top  rpgs for the snes play it if you get a chance
oh the and the music gets stuck in your head but in a good waythis was one of the last games i got for super nintendo
i questioned getting it at first since the n was to debut soon but about a fourth of the way through the game i knew it was a good investment
the graphics are gorgeous and there are all kinds of fun minigames to participate in
even the little dialogue scenes are fun
the game is as challenging as you want it to be and can be especially challenging if you try to fight a boss without having enough experience points first
it can draw you into some long battles
my favorite part of the game is buying selling and trading stuffthis game may be the greatest mario rpg that nintendo ever made
help mario save the mushroom kingdom from a powerful threat by collecting the seven star pieces with the help of his friends
use items and weapons to gain the advantage and level up
an excellent buy for snes ownersdoes not work with retro duo system
this is not a flaw with the game
just get an original system if you want full compatibilitythis is a game worthy of a fivestar review
released right around the time the video game world was going bit by way of playstation and sega saturn the bit days were all but over
yet nintendo decided to end the bit era with a bang by releasing this masterpiece which ive always viewed as nintendos way of saying thanks due to the uniqueness of this game and the almagamation of nintendo characters
let me try to explain this one outfirst off nintendo allowed squaresoft the masterminds behind the final fantasy franchise to do this game
normally this would be considered a bad move but to the credit of squaresoft they came up with a game that not only is extremely enjoyable but still manages to capture the feel of a mario game with all the zany mario quirks
bravo
on top of that this game shows mario in a more animated fashion than we have seen him in previous games
his actions and reactions when interacting with other characters which was a first at this point is amusing and symbolic of the family friendly and lovable mario we grew up withnintendo added another interesting element to cement the legacy by allowing bowser marios traditional nemesis to be a playable character
bowser is personified in a comical fashion as he is continously trying to assert his dominance but always manages to come across as slightly lighthearted as though nintendo wanted fans of the mario series to see that bowser isnt a malicious beast
his interactions with mario are pretty funnyalso cool is running into other nintendo characters such as link from the zelda series or samus from the metroid games
even yoshi makes an appearance
i get the impression that nintendo wanted to include these other major characters not primarily to be easter eggs but because this nintendo game was meant to be the end of nintendo in the  bit era and its like a farewell to an eraand yes squaresoft did include a final fantasy character in this game the tough boss culex
he is actually much more difficult than the games final boss smithy
fighting culex is a treat because of the classic final fantasy background you fight him on as well as the final fantasy battle music and if you win the final fantasy battle victory theme
very cool
on top of that the terms on which you part from culex are friendly and he even gives you a cool itemfinally it should be mentioned that luigi is not in this game he would be snubbed again in mario 
however it is interesting that when you to the area where the stars that hold peoples wishes are you can read their wishes though their names arent mentioned
you do find a star that says i hope to be a great plumber like my brother mario
this is actually i think the only time in a mario game where it is mentioned that mario is indeed a plumberso most people who have played this game have gotten the lazy shell armor and lazy shell weapon
however few have bothered to get the super suit
the super suit can be received in monstro town if you have completed  super jumps in a row
doing this takes practice patience concentration and mastery
i myself have gotten it several times
the other item you get is the attack scarf
if you outfit mario with the super suit armor the lazy shell weapon and the attack scarf no enemy will be able to kill you
its as simple as that
the lazy shell armor can then be given to princess making her virtually invincible as wellin the end this is a bittersweet note that we end the super nintendo era on
the game is great and incredibly fun but was largely ignored during its release due to the coverage of the more advanced games coming out then on the playstation and sega saturn
in hindsight this game is treasured and remembered fondly by those that did play it and much more appreciated and loved than virtually all of the games that were released around the same timeso there is a complaint
its only a minor one
how awesome would it have been if link were a playable character in the game
the game would have been very different but it would have truly been awesome to see mario and link fighting enemies together
or even if they had made a separate game zelda rpg where link and zelda were playable characterswhat could have beenin my opinion in this bundle you get the best nintendo system ever and the best nintendo game ever
this review im writing will discuss each item separately in more detailnintendo  the nintendo  made some of the best games that are now classics
for example super mario  banjokazooie donkey kong  to name a few the best colored console to me is the jungle green console because its translucent which makes it pleasant to look atthe nintendo s controllers are excellent as well
they have a firm grip and are more comfortable than the nintendo gamecubes
the only problem is that the joysticks wear out quite easily so you have to buy new ones constantly
especially if you play mario games
an annoying problem for the nintendo   were that  in the earlier days of the arrival of the nintendo  you would need to purchase controller packs to save your games  fortunately later on they made it possible to save your game without a controller pack
also the rumble pack feature was annoying to
you would have to buy a rumble pack if you want to feel vibrations during your game which added to the weight of the controller
they solved that problem when nintendo made the gamecubes rumble feature built into the controller
the graphics of the nintendo  system are quite good
nothing compared to nowadays standards of what good graphics are but i think the quality of the games is what matters most in a console
and this console lives up to those standardsalso this console is very durable
yes its a bit bulky but its worth it
i have on accidentally knocked it off the top of tables tripped over wires thats a pain and hit it when im on a tough level of a game but hey its still in one piece
you also dont have to worry about console problems like the red ring of death a technical problem on the xbox 
im pretty sure most people know about that but if you dont i can explain it
well you can give me a fancy shmancy console but it will never live up to the quality of the nintendo  if youre a gamer your life is incomplete without this wonderful consoledonkey kong  i remember when i was younger a friend would come over and sometimes bring donkey kong  with him and we would play until our parents would turn the game off
it was so much fun that it became my favorite game i ever played
so one day i decided to purchase it and i still would play it until my parents would turn the game offthis game took me over sixty hours to play my first time i played adventure mode
its long and there are some really difficult and frustrating levels and when you finish getting a tough golden banana you feel like that it took you ten years
but its so much fun that you keep playing it until you finish the gamewell now its time to talk about the story
king k rool is trying to destroy dk isles with his blastomatic machine
but king k rools ships crashes and his machine malfunctions and his ship comes facetoface with dk isles
king k rool captures all the kongs besides donkey kong and steals their hoard of golden bananas
donkey kong needs to help his fellow kongs escape and get their hoard of golden bananas back and stop king k rool from destroying their precious islandthere are old and new characters in this game
donkey kong and diddy kong are familiar characters because they were in previous games
but lanky kong tiny kong and chunky kong are all new characters
each character has his or hers own power up to use for certain tasks and amount of regular bananas and golden bananas to get
its a group effortcranky kong lets the kongs have their own potion funky gives the kongs weapons and candy gives the kongs musical instruments to use
but you have to give them coins and snide the weasel helps you get golden bananas each time you collect a blueprint of the blastomatic machinesome additional characters are the banana fairies which live on fairy island only tiny can access the inside of their cave with one of crankys potions also rambi the rhino and enguarde the swordfish are in this game to
but only donkey kong can use rambi and only lanky kong can use enguarde and a parrot named squawks who mainly gives information to the kongsthe levels of this game are amazing
each one you have to unlock by getting a boss key
ill talk about that later in my review there are eight worlds jungle japes angry aztec frantic factory gloomy galleon fungi forest crystal caves creepy castle and hideout helm
you have to get enough regular bananas and golden bananas to unlock the boss
then you defeat the boss to get a boss key to get to the next worldk lumsy is caged up by king k rool and every boss key you get and bring back to k lumsy to open up the cage opens up a new level for you to play as wellthe bosses in this game can be a real pain
there is a boss name army dillo an armadillo what else dogadon a giant dragonfly mad jack a crazy jack in the box pufftoss a puffer fish king kut out a cardboard cutout and the last boss king k roll himself
everyone will have a tough time on mad jack and pufftoss but those bosses dont even compare to the difficulty of beating king k rool
in donkey kong country you hit him with a few barrels and you win the game
in this game you have to beat king k rool in boxing with each kong which takes quite a while and a lot of trying over and over againthere are also many bonus items to get king k rool crowns banana fairy photographs a rareware coin and a n coin
for the rareware coin you play the jetpack game and for the n coin you play the original donkey kong game which will drive you crazy because you only get one livethe music in this game is fantastic as well
some tracks that especially stick out are dk isles jungle japes and fungi forest
the quality of the music makes the game play value even better
they made a donkey kong  soundtrack but unfortunately its not in the bundle
there are also mini games for multi player mode
you can play monkey smashes with up to four players and battle arenas with up to four players as well which are really fun
there are also single player mini games with rambi the rhino and enguarde the swordfishoverall this is a great game that will never ever get dull
this review did sheeshso the donkey kong rumble pack has the followingnintendo  jungle green colorednintendo  controller jungle green colorednintendo  expansion pakdonkey kong this is a great price
it comes with a system and a game donkey kong
the game is great and the system is coolexcellent was so excited to receive the n i love it thank you so much
i had no issues at allyukyguoy fktfk tk k tduj tdk tdj tr kjtdkdcuj xtrjjr tk r dkjrd kjrskj rkjtdyk td kytk t yktmy mom bought this for me for my birthday when i was turning  it comes with the only donkey kong  which is probably the biggest platform game of nintendo  it has great graphics and the music matches each world perfectly
i love how you have to use each of the  characters to beat the level instead of just picking your favorite
each character brings different strengths to the table and have different weapons moves and instruments
the boss battles are clever and creative and the final battle against king k rool is one of the best in all of video gamesnot only does the game come with donkey kong  but it also comes with the expansion pack a green controller and nd best system of all time the nintendo  and all its cables
i got mine in from best buy and it also came with the strategy guide
this was a steal then and now if you can find it it is probably an even better dealcolony wars when i first bought it years ago blew me away with its epic space opera
i hadnt seen so much work put into a game save for a very few other titles
it is still today one of my all time favorites
its got a great story in depth back story sleek graphics amazing sound and is really the perfect jumping off point for the series
not too hard not too difficult if you really go at it which youll want to
the next two games in the series are also amazing to behold but this is the first and my favorite
the last i could say is that if any of you have a dreamcast kicking around somewhere starlancer is the only game that out shines
a masterpiece as much as colony wars is
ps
where is a new cw game
sony owns the rights after all
sheesh
just do yourself a favor and pick up this game a wonder in its daythis is the best scifi game to come out since starwars in the arcade
pure scifi action that is  original and satisfyingfor while it seemed like psygnosis was unstoppable
fresh off of the success of the awesome wipeout games came this one of the great console games of all timefor starters in the presentation and production values department this game is just plain awesome
not only does it feature some of the best graphics ever to be found on playstation not only does it feature a branching story and changes based on your successes or failures and not only does it feature some of the best menus menu sounds music and ingame cinemas to be found in any game for any system ever it also features a builtin encyclopedia of all the star systems planets and ships in the game complete with voicenarrationthis game offers great challenge great gameplay flawless presentation tight controls and a great storyline
the music is so good i wish there were a soundtrackthis game is everything a great game shoud be and fans of classic games owe it to themselves to buy this one asap especially if they like spacecombat gamesthe music the challenge level the ability to linkcable with other playersthis game is formative and fantastic
i never truly tire of racing against my fastest timesthis is all around just a great game if you like the wipeout series
i am only missing two games in this series and thats the ps version of pulse and another ps version i cant recall of the bat which i heard was the worst wipeout game
this game however is my favorite
i also bought a ps just for wipeout hd i love this seriesthis game is the reason why i bought a d accelerator card for my pc
simply amazing
the best game ever made by psygnosis too bad wipeout  is only on the playstation
boohoowipeout for euwipeoutxlfor us was a drastic leap forward in terms of gameplay graphics and musical content from the previous incarnationmusic what was inhouse early s mediocre electronica in the original xl sported a healthy soundtrack that spawned an actual cd release in stores along with a x vinyl version as well
with names like photek fluke future sound of london chemical brothers and underworld it was a snapshot of what popular electronic music was like in the late s but it didnt have that extremely dated sound
the additional tracks on the cdvinyl soundtrack by leftfield orbital and source direct were the icing on the cakegraphics heavily upgraded since wipeout xls graphics were sharp well detailed and helped immerse you into the game
colors radiated from teh screen vs the drab dead colors from the previous game
the visuals by the designers republic tdr helped give the game that distinct feel that many other racing games lacked
no other game had design flavor that this did and it really did help give this game an identity that more or less shaped the way it would be presented in the future
where wo was alien and somewhat lifeless and wipeout was almost atmospheric and bright this had a dark and gritty feelinggameplay the controls were touched up so the ship didnt bounce anymore it seemed to glide effortlessly on the tracks
when you picked up speed you sat on the edge of your seat trying not to touch the wall
the ship responded exactly the way you wanted it tobonus there was a code you could put in where you could change the ships to different things
like one was a swimming shark one was a bumblebee and my personal favorite the pirhana unlockable ship after so many gold medals could be changed into a little pickle fying a space ship that had a minigun on it with unlimited ammo
i would blow up every competitor with in  laps just from that gun alonethis is still to me anyway the best game of the seriesi consider the original wipeout for sony playstation to be the finest fururitic racer ever yes i like it better than any incarnation of fzero
from the gorgeous visuals and multiple lighting scenes for every level vemom and rapter classes to the awesome awesome awesome soundtrack my favorite soundtrack of any racing ever wipeout was perfect
but many people dont agree with me
they prefer wipeouts sequel wipeout xl
its easy to see whywipeout xl takes what everyone loved about the original and upped it a notch
the graphics are higher resolution the music is more upbeat the weapons are more lethal
but perhaps the greatest reason to play it is that its realy fast
there is simply no experience on earth like playing wipeout xl on phantom class the fastest class with the hidden class of ship unforetunately it loses weapons in exchange for maxedout statswhen you play this game in this configuration it truly is sublime
weapons are fired at you but you outrun them
youre bouncing off the wall like crazy but going so fast it feels like youve got the speed burst weapon on continuous fire
its easy to see what makes this game so great
its a great concept executed flawlessly
you have great art direction great controls great gameplay and great music
at a pace so fast it should carry a warning labelif you love racing games and especially if you love wipeout youll have to buy this gametheres been a lot both good and bad said about this game
when i first popped it in this thing was slow
i said quothow is this such a good game if its slowquot
well my question was answered
win some races and the game gradually gets faster and faster and faster and well faster
with all the mayhem going on around you slowing down isnt much of an option
once you combine the speed with all the other special weapons available this is where the game starts to shine
when your palm starts to sweat
when you realize just how fast your heart can beat
think thats an excessive description
you wont think so once you get a hold of this adrenaline rushthe original sonic
i did not buy my game from amazon but the quality from the early s is good
the missions are great and challenging been a few years that i have played my game though
this is one of the games that helped sega to run strong enough
this is worth the price a collectable herea classic
segas mascot in his first game
grab rings get the chaos emeralds defeat dr robotnic and keep him from enslaving animals for use in his machines
i could see some hollywood actors in the blue guys place but it wouldnt be much fun without the speedmy family recently unearthed our sega genesis and once again we can not get enough of sonic the hedgehog
we have a pretty diverse collection of sega games but this one always seems to rise to the top
as far as the fun factor goes id easily stack it up against a fair percentage of my ps library
i dont know much about the ports except to say that sonic has been made available on the playstation the xbox and even made portable for the game boy advance
i havent played any of these but the reviews i have seen are fair at best
so proceed with cautionmaybe its true that you cant improve upon perfection
the cartoony goodness of the frenetic hedgehog brings a smile to my face without fail
the way he zips along his path snatching up rings is something straight out of a roadrunner cartoon
and on those occasions where he gets zapped by an enemy or a set of spikes he flails his limbs but gets right back into the fray againi have never completed sonic but that doesnt make the game any less addictive
theres the constant quest to collect  rings in an attempt to extend game time
theres the challenge to find all of the secret short cuts and bonuses
and the boss battles with the evil doctor robotnik is just tons of fun
maddening at times
but fun none the less
if you have this game tucked away somewhere you owe it to yourself to dust off the genesis and have another go
i promise you its just as much fun the second third and fourth time aroundthis game should go down in historyits fun cooland most likely the best original game everthe character is newfastcooland full of surpriseshes sonici especially love the music in labyrinth zone and the final zone with the ball
its the same music in the options menu in sonic advanceand the first boss in x zone
kool isnt itlaaaaalalalalaaaaalaaaalalalala o its my favoriteif u want it its no more here so buy it off ebay
and o yahsuper sonic isnt here this game works great
i bought this game for my husband it was his favorite growing up
it was packaged very well and arrived on time like promisedonce again you just sort of had to have lived back then to understand the rivalry between sega and nintendonintendo had mario but then sega launched their own mascot sonicand man did sonic deliver a different experience than mariosuper fast game playunbelievable graphicssimply but enjoyable game play that kept you coming back for more and more and like mario has kept me coming back twenty years laterone of the best games platformer or otherwiseall these years later the feuds have changednintendo won the war and is presently handing sony and microsoft their butts on a silver platterrivalries that helped sell enormous amounts of games back then and nowwhat can i say rivalries are funall that asidemy beloved sega may not be in the consol wars anymore but they have left a positive and enjoyable legacy and continue to do so if the new sonic coming out is any indicationyes folks like street fighter mario and mortal kombatsonic is also going back to dgotta love that nostalgiasonic the hedgehogincredible  bit graphicstimeless game playa must playhighly recommendedcool me and my dad play it we race and play together no flaws we love it you will tooif you have a genesis or one of those knock offs you know its sonic you gotta go fast
relive your youth on that glorious hd tvif there are video games taht have truly stood up to the tests of time its the sonic the hedgehog video game seriesback in the days when video games for the most part were just plain clean fun and not the gorefests they are now sonic the hedgehog was and still is the defining video game series of my lifetimethe controls are very goodwhile many would argue that the graphics are dated and while they may be very dated by  standards this game was many years ahead of its time and i still love every moment of this gameone of the greatest things about this classic video game that i have enjoyed was the music
wow
looking back on it now i have to say that the music was just amazing for video game music
i could very well say that i remember the music almost by heart
my favorite level music was on the quotscrap brain zonequot levels  through  and let me tell you i havent loved video game music like i did on this leveloverall the video game music was incredible
if only my sega genesis system were still working i would still be playing this but since age finally took its toll on both the cartrige and the system i feel sad at seeing a great era in my life in video games come to a close
i still find myself humming to the music on the quotscrap brain zonequot level even to this day years after last playing this gamesonic the hedgehog is in my opinion the greatest video game series of all time
mario and crash bandicoot may offer competition in this field but sonic the hedgehog came first for mei find it to be one of the greatest entertainment tragedies seeing one of my childhood favorite activies video games decline from good clean fun and degerate into nightmareinducing blood baths of gore and violencewhatever the case between mario sonic and crash bandicoot let me just say that it is the sillier games like these three game series that have truly lasted as opposed to the countless gorefests that video games that are forced down our throatsi say they should rereleased the sonic games that were on sega genesis onto an archives video game set for the computer or for the newest video game systems in the near future because im suffereing from quotsonic withdrawalquot symptomsif this game is put back in print i will be first in line to regain this game so that my children can enjoy the fun i had iwth sonic the hedgehogill admit that whenever i think of this game i do get pretty nostalgic over it since this was really the first videogame i ever got heavily engrossed in since i got this at the age of four on christmas day of  i honestly dont remember much of my life before then
however the nostalgia factor does not influence the rating i have for this game im strictly rating this game on how much quality i think it has
anyway on to the reviewstoryin this game an evil scientist named dr robotnik is turning animals into malicious robots and is searching for the six chaos emeralds which he thinks will make him rule mobius
you play sonic a blue hedgehog whos really fast and is determined to stop robotnik from getting the emeralds all while saving his furry and feathered friendsadmittedly the story and characters arent works of art but the brilliance of this game lies in its innovative style of platforming lush graphics and excellent soundinnovationwhile its been said millions of times before sonic really set itself apart from the other platformers out there for its fast speed
while this game series isnt ninja gaidenlevel difficult sonics speed really makes a gamer refine his or her motor skills and handeye coordination to make precise jumps and to jump or run all at the right times
despite the fact that this game is famed for being fast there are some spots in the game where you have to slow down to properly avoid certain obstacles which i dont really have a problem with since i think its these little breaks that add just the right amounts of variation in gameplay to keep from getting monotinousgameplaythe gamplay behind this is simple in concept as the only buttons you really use are the dpad and the jump button and the start button just in case you need a snack or bathroom break
the physics in sonics jumps are welldone since the movementarcs feel natural and theres no sudden stops when you stop moving which like the jumps feels more naturalthroughout the game you race through d levels with plenty of platforms you jump on and pits and other obstacles you have to avoid by usually jumping over
you also have malicious robots known as badniks throughout the levels where you can either avoid them or you can attack them by jumping on them to set the animals inside the machines free
some of the most annoying badniks in the game are catterkiller in the marble and scrap brain zones roller in the spring yard zone orbinaut in the labyrinth and starlight zones and ball hog in the scrap brain zonethe levels in this game are nicelyvaried
you run through six levels consisting each of three acts and at the end of the third acts except for scrap brain the last level you have a boss fight with dr robotnik
each level has its own theme
the first and iconic level green hill zone is a level full of greenery and some tropical trees while theres levels like the spring yard zone that are almost like giant colorful pinball machines without the flippers and theres even a beautiful starlit level called the starlight zone
one of the most hated levels in the series is the labyrinth zone mainly because out of all the waterbased zones in the sonic games this one is where you were most likely to drownyou have to collect rings throughout the level to stay alive
if you get hit while you have rings you lose all your rings but if you get hit without any rings you die
if you collect  rings you get an extra life
if you have at least  rings by the end of a level you can jump into a giant ring that takes you to the special stagein the special stage you go through a rotating maze where you have to reach the end of the maze in which where you find the chaos emerald and you reach the emerald by breaking through jewels encircling the emerald
you have to keep yourself distanced from the goal areas which take you out of the special stagethroughout the levels theres various tv monitors that provide various powerups for you
theres a shield monitor which gives you a protective shield thats lost once you hit a dangerous obstacle or get hit by a badnik
theres a ring monitor which gives you  rings
theres a shoes monitor which makes you run fast temporarily and has faster music when youre in this mode
theres an invincibility monitor which gives you temporary invincibility from enemies and certain obstacles though you can still drown fall from a bottomless pit and get crushed
finally theres a sonic monitor which gives you an extra lifegraphicsdespite the fact that this game is  yearsold as of writing this the graphics in sonic the hedgehog still look really good
this game along with sonics sequels in for the sega genesis would take full advantage of the genesiss processing capabilities to generate beautiful eyecatching graphics that do an excellent job of creating visual depth by adding many shades and highlights to various objects
i think the levels with the best imagery in this game are the green hill zone starlight zone and scrap brain zone
even sonic and other characters in the game which are smaller than the beautiful environments have a good deal of visual depth to them thanks to the proper use of colors within the game platforms hardware limitationssoundsoundtrackthe sound effects and music for this game are marvelous especially the latter
the sounds like the explosions jumping noises and spring noises despite having obvious limitations from the gaming hardware of its time still sound fresh todaythe soundtrack is where the games sounds really shine
the music was created by masato nakamura whos the main composer for jpop group dreams come true
i watched some videos about the development of the early sonic games and in an interview with nakamura he said that he imagined the sonic game as a movie and composed music that would fit the caliber of a film along with matching the moods evoked by the images of the levels
out of all the tracks on here the green hill music is probably the most iconic track on here and while i really like it my favorites here are the music tracks for spring yard and starlight
the former for its really bouncy joyous feeling and the latter for its relaxed beautiful nature
all in all the music in this videogame is so great i regularly listen to these tracks by themselves thanks to websites like youtube where people have uploaded the music for our listening pleasureminor complaintsmy only complaints with this game lie in with the scoring system and chaos emeralds
the scoring system for the fact that unlike the sequels to this game you didnt get any rewards for reaching certain numbers of pointsthe chaos emeralds for the fact that all you get when you collect them is a good ending which admittedly is a pretty lame ending
the sequels fixed this problem for the fact that you become super sonic when you get all the emeraldsfinal worddespite the two shortcomings i just mentioned sonic the hedgehog has earned its place as a classic in the videogame world
its been reissued countless times over the years so you can get it bundled with other sonicsega genesis games or for you pc gamers out there downloadable purchases on steam or you may dust off your genesis and sonic cartridge to play this one againive loved this game for nearly  years and ill probably still love it by the time im  yearsoldclassic
i dont think there is more to say than that
games like these will never die
wish i could say the same about current gamesill never forget the christmas of  when i was the happiest sixyearold kid on my street unwrapping my spiffy new sega genesis and holding two new games this and sonic  what fun gameplay and memories i was in foras everyone and their mother knows sonic s plot is that the evil dr robotnik is not only capturing many small innocent animals and turning them into evil robots but plans to take over mobius their planet and turn it from forests and clean air to factories and smelly air ill spare you the new jersey joke
it is now up to sonic to defeat robotnik and make everything right againalthough sonic  remains my favorite this is without a doubt a close second
i know the graphics may seem somewhat dated today but for  this was pretty damn good
bright vibrant colors and great atmosphere love the city skyline in star light zone
it goes from a bright sunny atmosphere sun light zone to a big industrial factory scrap brain
along the way there are various icons that sonic can smash open and each one has a special power that sonic can use to his benefit  rings super speed temporary invincibility a shield and the holy grail of them all the up
the game also has catchy music
okay its  now and we can hear actual bands in our games but back then we had video game music and it was good and easy to tune out if need be
also in this game you must collect  chaos emeralds in these weird spinning worlds and defeat robot enemies by jumping on themits a fun classic game that brings back lots of memories for me i remember how great it felt to finally get to the next zone
it needs to be released on cdrom
come on sega get crackingoh and dont think im insulting new jersey or anything
i was born there so there you goi first played this great game over  years ago at a friends house and fell in lovei actually like this better than the mario series
i recently found a genesis system by sheer dumb luck and along with it sonic  and  i popped it in and was reunited with a long lost friend
and the music
that is one of the reasons i got the game
the graphics are outdatedso what
the gameplay on this blows away many of todays games
we are all bombarded with lifelike games today but this classic and others like it are what set the stage for the current wave
right now a lot of people are out getting the newest games i am going against the grain and playing the classics
while i intend to get a next gen system soon i refuse to put these old games out to pasture
sonic will live foreversonic the hedgehog  for the sega genesis system is one of the greatest video games ever created
for those that dont know it is getting a th anniversary gameboy advance rerelease in november  it will feature  new features
the first feature will be a save feature and the second sonic will be able to do the spindash thing he was able to in sonic  im so excited
i hope that they rerelease sonic  with knuckles  with knuckles and sonic and knuckles on gba on their th anniversaryi will never forget the snowy xmas of  when i made the upgrade from the trusty old commodore  to the sega genesis
i got about  game per week for the genesis and tried just about everything
my first ever game tho was sonic the hedgehog
the gameplay was simple and thats the way i liked itthe graphics were cute
from bright blue sunshine and tropical landscapes to the cruel mechanical world of doctor robotnik now called the eggman
the music was great where are the soundtrack cds
and i was never happiersure it was totally easy but i always went back for more
this game had such charm is it any wonder why sonic is still so popular all these years onsonic the hedgehog is awsome
it saved sega from defeat at the hands of nintendos big gray box
the speed music graphics and gamplay are all top knoch
its easy and hard at the same time
its games like this that make you want to shiver with excitment about whats going to happen next as you playif you dont have sonic the hedgehog you dot have a genesis
simple as thatgrowing up it was either you were a sonic kid or a mario kid
i couldnt choose despite growing up in a mario household
i would go to my best friends house who was a huge sonic kid and get my fix
i just bought a custom painted and refurbished sega genesis for my girlfriend cause growing up she was a sonic kid
a nostalgic gift
i love playing this gamethis was the game that made sega win the  bit console wars
its not about how many colors the console has or the d capabilities not even the  of buttons
its appearance and how you treat your customers
and sega treated theirs welli still miss the company
and a awesome sequel with several more just make him more classic
hihgly recommend this game to anyone big or smalli remember it well it was december  and i was patiently waiting for christmasi remember all the hype about the super nintendo and sega genesis
after renting the super nintendo and super mario world i decided that i actually wanted a sega genesis because the sonic the hedgehog cartridge came with it and i already owned the original  bit nintendowhile the super nes proved to be great it seemed just like more of the same compared to the original nes just with  bit graphics
i asked for the genesis  and when christmas time came i got an original sega genesis system with a built in headphone jack and it came with this awesome newat the time game called sonic the hedgehog
it reminded me of  when the classic nes system came with super mario bros much like that title it set a new standard for platform video games with its fast paced actioncatchy yet quirky music and great controls ab and c buttons all made sonic jump the d pad moved him around and that was about itlike super mario world sonic the hedgehog was an instant classic but in terms of originality and fun sonic was even more revolutionarythe levels were all colorful and easy such as the beautiful green hills and starlight zone plus the brilliant scrap brain levels but like another reviewer said the best part of this game were the special stages
if you collected all  chaos emeralds you get a different ending with dr robotnkik stomping on the words the endwhile other sonic games like the lock on sonic  knuckles cartridge sonic cd and especially sonic adventure and sonic adventure dx took the sonic franchise steps and leaps further in terms of graphics and sound the original sonic the hedgehog will always be my favoriteflashback to  sega has released the mega drive in japan and received somewhat dissapointing results
fearing that the same would happen in the us sega hired a special team in  to design a character that would carry the genesis to the top of the gaming world
after  months they reached a solution
sonic the hedgehog
a small bluespiked hedgehog with red sneakers that could run at the speed of sound
in the us sonic the hedgehog was a runaway hit and sonic became a gaming icon overnight
a game that had this much success was obviously a great title right
exactly
this game at the time was everything a gamer could hope for
one with an undoubtedly cool character awesome graphics breakneck speed and enough replay value that would still make you play it years down the road
this was no ordinary game
this was a revolutionthe game itsself is compiled of  zones that contained  acts each
each zone obviously incresing in difficulty as the game progressed
at the end of the third act in every zone you must fight against the evil dr robotnik
if you didnt know dr robotnik is the one who captured all of sonics friends and turned them into robots
after you defeat him he flys off and you then destroy a capsule and save some of your friends from being roboticizedthe real highlight of the game though is the special stage
collect  or more rings in an act and jump through the giant gold ring at the end and you were transported into a  degree rotating maze in search for one of the  chaos emeralds
the colors in this stage would make a hippie proud and were unimgainable on the nes or master systemcombine these features with an awesome soundtrack and great sound effects and youve got a game that will turn even the most casual of gamers into a hardcore fanatic
this was an amazing game indeedflash forward to 
 years after sonic the hedgehog was released the blueblur is still kicking in his last game sonic adventure  this game however would not be possible if sega had not discovered the talents of yuji naka and the rest of the tobe sonic team back in  sonic the hedgehog is still one of the best games in the series and im sure it will stay that way for years to comegreat game im not only a mario bros fan i also like playing sonic games and this game is a awesome child hood game that i loved playingthis game is awesome sonic the hedgehog is the best game that started a series of great gamesu play as a small blue hedgehog called sonic and u battle a villian called doctor ivo robotnick who turned all the little woodlen creatures into robot minions as sonic u must defeat dr robotnick and save the woodlen creaturessonic has speed  thing that makes things go faster there are items unlike mario u collect ring when u have  rings u get an extra life there is the shield which can allow u to take an extra hit and still have rings
when u get hit with no rings u die with rings you can still play extra lives there is a box with sonics face in it that gives u extra lives
there is a box with a ring in it hit that and u get  rings at the end of a zone there is a giant ring when u have  rings there u can go to a special stage where u can get the six chaos emeralds which do nothing but make a better endingsonic the hedgehog has great music sound effects and great gameplay this game was so awesome they made a sequel to this game thats better but this one in my book is a  for the sega genesisthis was the first sonic game everit also is to this day still goodthe plot is basicevil geniusknown as drrobotnikis creating robots out of helpless animalsbut there is one animal he cant catchhe is sonic the hedgehogout of all the sonic gamesthis is the one with the best zonesmy favorite is the starlight zonethis was revolutionary at the timebecause there was much faster frame changingthe musiclike in all sonic gamesis awesomeespecially the green hill zonethis is a masterpiece that has survived the testsand changesof timeif you own a genesis buy this gameyou will love itah sonic the hedgehog
the game that established the genesis as a figure in gaming the character that became a pop culture icon at least in the gaming world but it went a little further was able to stand right beside mario and lest i forget gave nintendo the first taste of competition
i had a genesis but i sold it but after playing it on the great sega genesis collection on my psp the old days returned
this game was a classic in so many waysthis game was fast and gave out the message that fast games are fun games
sonic was a great looking game with wonderful themed areas which would beat marios plain blocky world
the game was also great because it eliminated many cheap deaths
the games during the time were great but alot of the games even mario had the annoying death thing
if you hit something you die
it gets really really annoying and its no help either that you usually have to start over again the usual way to continue would be to memorize annoying passwords
sure sonic had many start over deaths but the fact that there were shields and rings rings are much easier to get back if you lose them and since its quite easy to get them after they fall out of sonic made the game a lot less annoying
and it was easier to kill enemies
sonic may not be as revolutionary as mario or the fact that new sonic games get  scores while mario still goes strong but i could see a discussion on which game had a better design
i cant really decide either so i will just be neutral in this discussion
however you have my approval to bring up my topic in a schoolyard conversationaside from the great design sonic was just plain fun
its faster more action easier to kill enemies and there was a lot of slick puzzles and a great plot
the stages are filled with many booby traps from the raging lava river from the marble zone to bumpers that luanch you into enemies this game is just brimming with exciting obstacles that sometimes make you dont mind that you just died and have to start over again
i do reccomend learning how to do level skip so you dont have to start  over
of course you dont keep your score but getting a record score is already done so dont shed any tears if you lose your points
and the music is jammin to its not as good as the music from sonic adventure but its very goodthis is a classic game and even though its not as good as the masterpiece sequal its amazing how this game has stood the test of time
like other classics like castlevania the very first one released for nes and final fantasy  these games are just classic
expect to see them around for quite a while longerthis game is great for all ages
its a funaction packed game
its pretty challenging as well
buy itand you will not regret itone of the original sega classics from the s
a very simplistic idea put to very good use
a must have for anyone who likes to play video gameswow the game that introduced me to sega
great graphics sound and controls uphold a classic d game
gave nintendo a run for their money back thenkinda
love the genesissegas answer to mario sonic the hedgehog
the coolest fastest and bravest blue hedgehog around who thwarts the evils of eggman wherever he might strike
blast processing to let sonic blow across the screen as fast as he wants sega does what nintendont
sonic the icon of sega a true video game hero and the most important part of video games for many people everywheresonic the hedghog is easily one of the most original games to ever come out on a console system besides gtathe games plot it acctually good for a bit bit gameoh my god and gameplay
it rules
the level desighns are great and the graphics for that time are superbthe gameplay is fast pace and not boring nd slow
its easily one of the best games ive ever playedsonic the hedghog for the sega genisis is a must own for your genisis collection
i have sonic  and  for genisis in my collectionnows your turncourse that may be something stupid to say since it came out like whenso forget what i just said and order it off amazonbut if your looking for per saymmm quotthe greates sonic game everquotthen get sonic adventure one for the dreamcastif you have a genisis then you should be lucky if you own this gameits a classic i give it a  out of laterlets seei think it was the christmas of  when i first got the genesis when it came with sonic  as a bonus pack deal
let me tell youthis game brings back memories
the gorgeous level designs the many diabotical machines from dr robotnik and to think labyrinth zone was the only one where you had to keep from being crushed from the bottom as he just moved up towards the top
pretty clever
 and the music
once i found out about the level code i would spend hours in the sound test area just listening to the music
and i loved the special stages actually when it was easy to get to just by collecting rings and before it went d
even though i didnt understand what happened at the end of the game after getting the emeralds new flowers grow in green hillok
 i guess that was a way of showing peace was restored though i wish there was moresega should get into the act of what nintendo is doing now rereleasing popular games for the gba
all of the old sonic games need a revamp
id love to play sonic  on the advance
but well see
along with mario and mega man sonic proved how fun the world was when it was in dlong live the original sonic the hedgehogin  the world was introduced to what would become the pinnacle of speedy gaming sonic the hedgehog for the sega genesismega drive
it was segas attempt to make themselves the popular gaming company after nintendo released super mario bros  in  and i am happy to say they made a great successthe story starts off when were introduced to sonican anthropomorphic speedy blue hedgehog with red shoes and the ability to curl up into a ball and run super fast
the storyline however is simple sonic must save all the woodland creatures from his archnemesis dr robotnikeggmanalmost all the levels in this game take total advantage of sonics ability to perform speedy platforming
however such obstacles such as robitniks robots spikes and bottomless pits will try to stop you from reaching the end of the level
thankfully for you and your speedy hedgehog youll find powerups such as speed bootswhich let you run extremely fastinvincibilitywhich allows you to kill enemies at the touch and extra lives
one of the last things you can pick up in this game are rings
if you get hurt while you are holding at least one ring all your rings will fly out of your reach
however if you get hurt without holding any rings sonic will diethere are a total of six zones in this game
from the first to last they are green hill marble zone spring yard labyrinth starlight and scrap brain
each zone has three actstwo of which you will simply have to run through in order to beat
at the end of every third act however you will find yourself fighting against dr robotnik
after defeating him you will have to blow up a capsule containing a large amount of animals seeing them free as a resultif you manage to collect at least fifty rings at the end of either act  or  of a particular zone you will have the option to have sonic jump through a ring at the end of the stage
upon making your way into the ring you will enter a special stage where you receive the opportunity to earn a chaos emerald
the chaos emeralds dont do much in this game however they only give you a slightly happier ending when youre done with the gamenow onto gameplay the controls of sonic the hedgehog are absolutely amazing
the physics are entirely momentumbasedmeaning that you have the ability to roll down a slope in order to pick up speed
to do this all you have to do is walk up to a downward slope press the down button and watch your hedgehog go
while in this ball form sonic will kill almost any robot he touchesspeedy platforming makes this one of the fastest games for the sega genesis
the momentum based physics obstacles and enemies makes this the perfect game for people who want to challenge their reflexes
this game tests your reflexes by giving you only splitseconds to react to the obstacles you are thrown at while going at top speed
i recommend this to anybody with a sega genesisor at least for people who want to go through an enormous amount of speedy platformingthis is another great game that came out during the early nintys when sega just released their genesis platform
what can i say about this game
great graphics great music great controls
difficulty is not a problem it is adjustable to your skills
i usually play it on hard just for the heck of it
my bro and i enjoy this game so much we play it all the time
and hes yrs oldthis is a great game
it was great to relive my childhood memories with this game
its in excellent condition
thanksi love this game
i played it a zillion times during spring  with my friend andrew
i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam
there are  levels to work thru in a rundown and corrupt city led by the evil mr big
beating up all the bad guys and the endoflevel boss is much fun
level  the bridge was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the riverit also had truly fantastic music
the composer yuzo koshiro did absolue miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis
the main theme level one level  and final boss are standout tunesi wish sega would do pc version of the sor games
its not fair that only people with a genesis can still play this game
i would love to own this again
it would be in my computer permanentlygraphics asound agameplay alasting appeal athis is where it all began
one of the greatest genesis series ever was the streets of rage games
this game is very fun and challenging at the same time and with its varying levels of diffuclty you can make it either really easy or hair rippin possibly impossible lol
anyways you can start off as either of the two classic characters in this game axel stone or blaze fielding and you can also use some dude named adam who didnt make any other appearences in the series
while this might be the first in the series the moves list for the characters is still pretty impressive
all the characters have their own combos grappling tactics team attacks are possible deffensive attacks and also each character uses weapons differently
 thing that is unique in this game that is not seen in the others is that you can call for some back up
if the punks literally start kickin your a you can call this police car that looks like a civic crx which adds to the retro feel and makes it great and the dude in the ride shoots up all the enemies on screen
this game is a very good length its not to short but its also not to long
i do like the streets of rage games that came out later probably more so
though this game is a true classic that influenced many games of this genrestreets of rage is an all time beat em up classicthe graphics are great and so is the gameplaythe soundtrack is awesome toothis gamein my opinion is second bestcompared to s of r i wasnt all that big into s of r  at allthe orginal game blows the third one awaymy favorite character that i pick most of the time is adamhe is sort of slowbut hes got an awesome jump kickoverallthis game is a classic and a sega genesis owner musthavebuy this along with the second gamebut i would avoid part but thats just what i think anywaysor sets a ton of standards and holds up in i recommend you get sor on xbox live arcade
you can find all sor titles on the sonics genesis collection for xbox try that out first starsbest one in my opinion better than the st and rd one
inhanced graphics easier enemies no return of the th lvl bosses from the st one the two girls that were hard to hit but they return on the rd one
rd ones pretty hard too great lvls better character combos and know have special moves and great gameplay
highly recommended for beat em up fansremember streets of rage
if liked that one you will most certainly love this one
it follows the same theme as the first one but with some updates
first of the game play is much better
you no longer have the police car helping you with his rocket launcher but you do have some more killer moves which help a lot in tight situations
the music is very good
i cant ever seem to forget the theme song from the amusement park
graphics are way improved plus you get to see how much life your enemies have left in other words they have their own energy meters
plus you have extra characters other then adam like skate and max
sogo ahead and get this game
you wont regret itwow
this was like the best fighting game ever
i totally loved streets of rage  this was one of the true classics of the sega genesis
whenever i fondly remember my beloved bit console the fun i had playing sor always comes to mindyuzo koshiros jazzy score was mindblowing
it completely immersed you in the seedy nightlife and underworld the game took place in
even with this simple machine sor showed just how cool the music could still beme and my best pal played this nonstop on player mode
it was definitely the most fun you could have on the genesis
what a game it isyou know the story  mr x takes over the city in attempt to govern it with anarchy and destruction
but four friends team up to stop him and his syndicate even if it means fighting the mean streetsof rageas the second installment in the threepart series streets of rage  does not disappoint in the least
after playing the first one for awhile and returning to the second i realize how much better the fight system is here the intellect of the foes the scenery items points specials pickups and the introduction of three and fourpart levels  its all a serious improvementin the first streets of rage there was generally one sidescrolling scene per level and the boss was at the end of the roadshiproomwhatever
streets of rage  beefs it up by having subbosses at the end of each scene but yet amazingly they seem to keep the perfect balance of difficulty and entertainment so that youre neither bored nor frustratedthe introduction of the selfsufficient special system is nice because if you bump the a button the cops dont immediately come running to shoot a rocket while youre fighting one galsia
at the very most youll incur a little damage but sweep the floor with whoevers around youeasily out of all of the streets of rage titles  is the most satisfying and rewarding to play
in elementary i played this game through probably  or  times and still find it just as entertaining
thats replay valueif you havent yet pick this one upthe first sor was great but the second one was well put together better sprites better animation i put this one up there with the first final fight
so the story is that george xetheus mr x has escaped from prison and is back in full control of the syndicate now called the xnz syndicate they have kidnapped adam hunter this time he has more than thugs mr x is working with neo zeed and you fight punks motor cycle thugs ninjas prostitutes
 levels easier than part  easy to pick up and play great game it is a favorite on the genesis iloved it when i was a kid the game is still great
its also available on sonics ultimate genesis collection on ps  x box  fun especially with  players
o f course there was a sor  it was delayed  delayed it didnt sell to well sega made a lot of attempts to make a sor  i have som ideas for sor  but would like everyones opinion so leave a commentstreets of rage  is  of those games that showed what the genesismega drive could pull off graphically  sound wise
i had already played streets of rage  to death that i had borrowed from a family member i was unaware of the sequels but i happened to see it at k mart that was going out of business in my area back in  my grandma got this  bought it for me along with legend of zelda a link to the past on snes
when i was about  i was an idiot  sold my model  genesis with a lot of the games
i still have the snes games anyway  years ago i got a sega genesis streets of rage    was  of the reasons that i really wanted a genesis again
anyway streets of rage  came out in late  basically it got all the good critical notices  the general public liked it too
axel  blaze come back adam has been kidnapped by mr x who was broken out of prison by shiva a new character thats a right hand man for mr x  hes a fairly difficult boss no matter what difficulty youre playing on
mr x has captured adam hunter he has a younger brother named eddie who goes by skate cause hes on these roller blades
he found the house tore up axel  blaze find a photo of mr x pi  s  s in  g on adam
 of axels friends max a professional wrestler has joined in to find adam
from there its  levels of beating up bad guys
plus each level has different sections
axel  blazes fighting skills have been greatly improved the cop car special attack is gone each character has their own special move
axel has various uppercuts like theres flaming uppercut if you press a if you press forward  a you hit multiple uppercuts  if you press forward forward b you pull off a move called grand upper
the grand upper doest cause you to lose health so i use it more than the a button attacks
blaze has some pretty good moves too like projectile a back flip kick  she has a forward forward b attack that doesnt cause any health to lower too its an overhead move where she uses the same projectile
max is just brutal he will overpower just about enemy he has powerbombs german suplexs  an atomic drop
the music the redone streets of rage theme has this dark  gritty start to it  it works with the opening
round  the music is great gets ready to get through this game
you have to fight your basic punks  these new black gangsters that i call black doug funny
theres yellow jacket mowhawk thugs
bikers  these knife wielding punks with ripped jeans  leather vests
the characters  enemies on the screen all look detailed  better graphically the game looks really good  better than st
if i didnt mention it each level has different sections you can into a bar the whip chicks are back this time they look nice  sl  u  tt y instead of the sm outfits like in part  the boss barbon isnt too hard you can back him up into a corner  administer a beating using the b attack or a grand upper as well you can do a multiple uppercut attack
as blaze i can beat him by just backing him in the corner  using her overhead move
i have never played through as skate in this game or part  as max i just overpower barbon
round  your on this bridge thats under construction with a great tune
you have bikers trying to run you over  its fun knocking them off the motorcycles
you can crack some melons with a steel pipe
theres a nd section which is on a bus where youre introduced to a samuri you fight off a flock of bikers
the rd section if another part of the bridge under construction
the boss is a guy on a jet pack i just use jumping attacks  if i can use use a flaming uppercut then i will throw that in
round  is at an amusement park which is a really fun level st you start outside fight off some punks then you go into this arcade where these punks are playing bare knuckle which is what this game is called the rd section is in this back room then the th section is on this pirate ship you have the introduction of these ninjas theyre annoying cause they jump around throw you on your a     or knock you down
i use a couple of punches  a grand upper which knocks a lot of health off of them if not taking them out period
the th section is back outside the th section is this alien house which is kind of cool very good music i just cant put over the streets of rage  soundtrack enough i mean the music for round  is great the music they use on the bus in level   pirate ship in round  isnt bad
the boss in round  is the freddy kruger claw boss from the st game only hes provides a fun challenge  is a blanka knock off
you have to rely on jumping attacks  special moves sometimes i get lucky cause theres these egg looking things that explode when you hit them  that will knock some of there health off
the th level is at this baseball stadium the st section starts off outside then your in this stadium in the nd section of the level  i dont know if its me but it seems more enemies show up on screen in the later levels not that it matters it just adds to the game for me
also remember that fat guy from part  well hes back but hes easier than he was in part  then you take a lift that takes you to an underground illegal arena but you have to fight a off quite a few waves of enemies basically its the same punks  samuris
the boss is the return of the ultimate warrior  hes slightly more difficult than he was in part  he doesnt have a simple attack pattern as axel i stand near him  use the grand upper dont try to go for the punching  kick combo he overpowers you if you use the multiple uppercut attack he will overpower you
as blaze i use her special attacks as max you can overpower him cause hes more of a match
if you have him locked up go for the powerbomb as quick as you can if you have him locked up from behind go for a german suplex or atomic drop as quickly as you can
round  is on this ship  i love the music that is used in this level
you have the introduction of these kick boxers the level  boss is back
the nd section is youre on the top floor of this ship where you have a returning jet pack man  you have bikers go after you along with bikers tossing grenades along with some ninjas which all these ninjas make me think did the x syndicate join forces with the neo zeed syndicate from the shinobi franchise
the boss is this obese boxer that i usually back up in the corner  use the multiple uppercut special
in level  your on a beach where you have to fight more ninjas kickboxers samuris  red  yellow jacket mowhawk punks
you have this where bikers are trying to run you down you have this whip chick  more than likely she will hit you with her electric whips  theres a horde of bikers after you  that has a steel pipe
the boss is the blanka knock off  jet pack man
go ahead  jump attack them  spam it to your pleasure
level  is in this factory with this awesome tune  the nd section is on a lift where you have another awesome tune sounds like some headbanging music
you have to fight through the various punks with jet pack man knife wielding dude a ninja  a samuri  a the kickboxer
the boss is these  hopping annoying robots
but they shouldnt be huge problem
the soundtrack just rivals the snes sound
i love the gameplay love the soundtrack by yuzo koshiro he knew how to get excellent sound out of system like the genesis that has inferior sound compared to the snes
round  youre in some kind of hotel you go through the lobby fighting off that jumping robot  obese boxer along with a couple of the basic thugs
then in an elevator you fight the round  boss then the blanka knock off  finally the ultimate warrior
at the top floor you fight shiva who loves to jumps attack you if you have never played this game  you think you can lock him up he will lock you up  beat you up
if you try to attack him with a punching  kick combo he will block it before the kick connects
you will more than likely lose a life when fighting shiva theres a great tune playing when youre fighting shiva
you will have to try to use toward toward b attack when fighting shiva  other special attacks
mr x has the same attack pattern somewhat but he has way better animation he laughs when you die or are knocked down
i mostly use the grand upper on mr x  get him with a punching  kick combo when i can
the i usually finish him off with a flaming punch
then you get a great ending with some great music theyve taken mr x down  saved adam the ending is as strong for me as it was when i st played this around    streets of rage  is an excellent beat em up that has great gameplay thats better than the st
better looking graphics thats a plus
 players that makes it even better great sound its even better if you got a genesis arcade stick  the soundtrack is excellent
if you have never played a streets of rage game play this  i know some say this game is too easy well theres a cheat you can enter  you can play mania  playing the mania difficulty is worth playing through at least once
if you dont have a genesismegadrive then you can play it on an emulator or on the ps  x box  you can download it  theres the genesis collection released back in  on the ps  x box  that has all  games plus a lot more genesis classics
theres even a genesis collection on ps
me i love playing it on a model  sega genesis that has the headphone jack that you can hook it up to speakers to get the best sound
next will be a review more like a rant on streets of rage   then i will review the real streets of rage  bare knuckle iiithis is one of the best maybe the best sidescroller actionfighting game of the classic years of video games for the genesis and this style of games
it is by far my favorite platform game for the genesis though shinobi  and the first one come very close and also the vector man and sonic games i favor comparablyanyways lets start by saying this game was such an advanced improvement over the original
the original is another true classic thats very entertaining but this one just shattered it
there are  characters each with their own strengths and short comings but i have to say the best balanced is axle and maybe then blaze
 characters returning from the original
the levels are long and colorful the music will also keep you bumping and busting your way through hordes of enemies a lot of people say that the music in this game really influenced dance music thats being blasted in clubs todaygreat game you can make it rather easy or extremely challenging a great option to the game
highly recommended to anybody who likes side scrollers or anybody who just wants a great game with replayability
true classicthis game is action packed and so much funespecially when you have somebody playing with youthere is nothing cooler than walking down streets and other placesbeating the crap out of bad guysmy favorite character was always axeli love the way he fightsmax thunder is my second favoritehes slowbut he sure is powerfulstreets of rage  imo is the best game in the seriesthe first game was okaybut nothing like this onei couldnt stand the third onebut if you want a really good video game where you and a friend can walk around beating up baddiesthis game is for youan all time classicduring the time when side scroller games were all the rage both sega genesis and super nintendo had an unofficial flagship franchise that championed the genre
for super nintendo the final fight series was the most recognized and loved side scroller beat em up games
for sega genesis though the streets of rage series also known as bare knuckle in japan was the top franchise
strangely even though the final fight games were fun in their own right fans actually preferred the streets of rage series over final fight despite the fact that the super nintendo games were usually viewed as superior
the reason for this is due to the incredible fanlove shown for streets of rage  the game that many feel to be the best of the side scroller beat em up gameswhen i was a kid every friday night i would be permitted to go to blockbuster and pick out a game to rent
this game was always a safe bet to rent if i did not see anything else i wanted to rent because i knew i would be up on friday and saturday night beating up thugs and having the time of my life
this game just managed to be so much funstreets of rage  featured  fighters named axel blaze and adam
all  were virtually identical in fighting styles and the special move called for police backup to shower your onscreen enemies with firepower so it essentially made no difference as to which character you played as
streets of rage  decided to change this by having a unique assortment of characters to play asaxl and blaze are essentially similar
both represent the inbetween character in terms of speed and power
axl is slightly slower and has more power while blaze is slightly faster with less power
a finesse player will probably enjoy playing as blaze
skate is the embodiment of pure speed with little power and only an expertly finesse player will be able to master the challenge of being constantly on the move and attacking aggressively
finally max is a giant hulk that dominates with incredible power yet is slow as an ox
i always found it slightly odd that maxs bio lists him as being a former prowrestler since he is obviously cut from the same mold as final fights haggar who was also a playable character in the pro wrestling game saturday night slam masters
it makes me wonder if it was done deliberatelyeach character also has a set of two special moves which cost some of your lifebar to use
each character has a stationary special attack that is best used when surrounded by enemies and on the brink of taking massive damage
also each character also has a flurry special attack that should be used to aggressively reduce the lifebar of a boss
axl has a massive roundhouse punch and an incredible speed combination punch attack blaze has a scissor backflip kick and a hard forcepush move skate has a headstand sweep move and an acrobatic flying corkscrew kick and max has a spinning hammerthrow move and a punishing dashandroll attack
max and skates flurry attacks are especially effective if you have a boss pinned to the edge of the screen your attack will be slowed down tremendously but will take out the bosss entire lifebar
max also benefits from having an extra motion when swinging a sword or pipe weapon which will clobber the enemy behind you first before the downward part of the swing hits the enemy in front of you
max was always my favorite characterthe storyline of the game is pretty straightforward
adam the friend of returning characters axel and blaze has been captured by mr x skate who is adams little brother and max an old friend of axels join the fight to save adam
you start off the fight on the city streets then on a long bridge you will also fight your way through an amusement park a baseball stadium a typical elevator level on a big boat a tropical island a robot factory and ultimately mr xs headquartersone of the things that makes this game so fun besides all the thugbeating is the music
the music is kind of an uptempo experimental electronica
the sega genesis receives alot of hindsight criticism due to its inferior soundchip but the music for streets or rage  really is topnotch and very memorable
in the days before video games actually had soundtracks streets or rage  actually warranted a soundtrack because people legitimately enjoyed it so much
you have to hear it to truly appreciate it
the music is so excellent that it allows us to overlook the mediocre sound effects such as each enemy having pretty much the same death scream and the repetitive sound effect of someone taking punches and kicksthe bosses i always felt were very cool
even though the boss of the amusement park looks and fights similar to street fighters blanca and the boss from the elevator level bears an uncanny resemblence to wwfs the ultimate warrior they are still memorable fights
also the robots oxygen and nitrogen are fun to fight and my personal favorite was the boss of the boat a giant bald boxer named bear
of course no one can compare to the madman mr x the games final boss
he is a longhaired well dressed maniac with a machine gun that sprays the room in bullets and smashes you in the head with the butt of his gun
he is so sinister and crazy that he doesnt care that he is also shooting up his own henchmenthe levels are probably the other aspect of this game that make it so enjoyable
i realize i kinda vaguely summed them up but if you have played the game then you already have an idea of what i am talking about
in the first level you fight the stage boss in the rain outside of a bar
the rain fall animation is very well done
also on the boat level there is a very nice listing feel to the level as it slowly cascades slightly up and down in motion with the sea
this could have been very annoying but is actually perfectly executed
the baseball stadium level has my favorite music the song is somewhat similar to seals crazy and the way the empty stands in the foreground scroll as your character moves is very nicely done
finally the amusement parks level has an alien house with a beautiful fog effect on the ground
these might seem like simple techniques but back during the early days of bit games to see so many unique approaches to level design background and effects was very excitingstreets of rage  easily outshined the original streets of rage but it was actually much better received than its sequel streets of rage  in streets of rage  the challenge was upped a little too much and the game was much longer plus the addition of the robot character and the change to the special moves system was just too much for gamers
sadly fans that loved streets of rage  were disappointed in streets of rage  and what they really wanted was a game that captured the same magic that streets of rage  did
quite simply it was not meant to bein the end streets or rage  is looked back upon very fondly by gamers that lived the bit era
it was everything we wanted in a sidescroller beat em up game
great music great attention to detail a semisophisticated fighting system weapons tough bosses and a varied assortment of fighters and fighting styles all packaged neatly together in one game makes this the gold standard of side scroller beat em ups
they just dont make them like they used to anymoresome food for thoughtwith all the vintage game revamps we have seen lately why havent we seen one for streets of rage 
i think it could be a good ideathis is the reason i bought a sega genesis over a snes
blaze fielding is hot in that little miniskirt
yes teenage boys are stupidreally though this is the fighter for genesis
the game has four different characters max the wrestler who is slow but very powerful skate the little kid who is fast adam excop who is in the middle towards strength and blaze the aforementioned hottie excop who is middle of the road leaning towards speed
i generally played as her because she was fast enough to avoid enemies while being stronger than skatethe game has a fairly rational progression through the streets on a ship and eventually to the boss lair
if you turn up the difficulty this game can get very hard
ive had this game on gamegear as well and its much harder on that system since once you start getting swept they can often keep it up for an entire life bar
the genesis version doesnt have that problemyou can use a variety of weapons from knives to swords and even grenades in your battles
you have super attacks one directed which uses up your health no matter what and one that is indirect that only uses up health if you hit somebody
the rd game tweaks that to a probably more fair way of doing it but i still like this one far and away better than either of the other twoif you like double dragon style games or any kind of brawler ones you owe it to yourself to try streets of rage
if you can only choose one of them then go for this one by all means
youll get enough of the story to figure things out not that the story is all that elaborate but it works well enough as a stand alone game and its just pure funa run and gun game in the vein of contra or metal slug
pick your character and weapons and start shooting things
lots of different weapons through the weapon combination system to keep thing varied
controls are great
graphics are good for their time and nice and colorful
the sound is a bit dated but is fine for what it does
a bit tough played solo best played with a bro like any good run and gun game out theregunstar heroes has been my favorite genesis game it is action packed and there are tons of levels
just when you think u beat the game your adventure takes you to outerspace
the  player gameplay  really adds to the experience
this game is a must have for anyone who enjoys sega genesis
get this game
you will not be disapointedi cant believe i let a game like this go undiscovered for so long
gunstar heroes was released on the mega drivegenesis back in  but id never heard of the game until a few years ago
none of the magazines i read at the time featured any reviews or ads either so it was surprising to see so many positive reviews
i still have a mega drive but the asking price for the complete set is often far too expensive
but when i saw it for only  on the playstation network i knew it was a bargain i couldnt turn downthe game is quite frankly brilliant
it features the madcap runandgun mayhem of metal slug but with none of the punishing difficulty
the screen is filled with action and explosions from absolute beginning to absolute end
i finished it fairly quickly and it is so far the only ps game in which i have unlocked all the trophiesits a must have
if you have a mega drive or ps make sure you get gunstar heroesundoubtadly the best game to ever grace segas bit genesis gunstar heroes was and still is to this day one of the best simple minded action games ever produced
bearing resemblance to konamis contra games and other quotrun n gunquot type games the gameplay is pretty basic
you run around with automatic firing weapons blowing away the hordes and hordes of enemies that get into your way
youll find plenty of different power ups that quickly change the pace of the game but the two player mode is where the real fun of gunstar heroes is to be had
for back in its day the graphics were great and today they still hold up for a d side scroller shooter
controls are incredibly easy and you know what to do from the minute you pop in the cartridge and play
the sound and music is the games only lowpoint but most of that can be blamed on the genesis poor soundchip remember this system was known for having shabby sound
all in all though gunstar heroes is still one of the greatest action games of all time and if you still have a genesis and dont have this game you should do all you can to track it downi love this game its like contra mixed with alex kidd hours of fun fun funwhen people think of classic run and gun games the first thing that usually comes to mind is contra
but anyone who has played gunstar heroes knows that its possibly the best run and gun ever made for the home console
its intense the action never stops and it impliments some unique gameplay elements that make the game a lot of fun to play
also unlike contra the game isnt insanely hard but has a really balanced difficulty level
nintendo was gracious enough to put this on the virtual console so even if you dont have a genesis you can still download it for  wii points eight bucks and you dont need a classic controller to play itas i mentioned gunstar heroes is a brilliantly crafted game
its crisp and clean looking perhaps one of the best looking genesis games out there
you start off by choosing one of two characters and one of four weapons
you can either choose a character that lets you run while your shooting or one that stands still and shoots
they both have their advantages and disadvantages such as you constantly running off a cliff if you decide not to choose the fixed character
but if you choose the fixed character and the level scrolls oh boy
the game is also two player and youre not restricted to just playing as one or the other
you can both be the freemoving character if you wantthe weapons range from a plain ordinary shot a homing shot lightning and a flamethrower
whats more interesting is that you can carry two different weapons at a time and switch between them
even more interesting is that you can combine two weapons and see what you get
you could for example have a homing lightning shot
this element just opens up a ton of possibilitiesas you run through the levels the game is certainly not shy about throwing enemies at you
this is one of the most intense shooters around
enemies are literally coming from every corner and surprisingly theres never a drop in framerate
with how decorative these environments are and things exploding every two or three seconds as well as enemies littering the screen youd expect there to be some slow down there is none and the game itself moves pretty fast only adding to the intensity
it makes the game that much more fungunstar heroes is a treat
if you dont have gunstar heroes and you have a genesis or wii then you owe it to yourself to get this game
youll have a lot of fun with it and it has excellent replay valuenote to wii virtual console users the game supports the wii remote and it works just fine
no need to invest in a classic controller to play itwhen the last genesis rolled off the assembly line and the game companies halted production on all genesis games to start production on the new systems there was one action game in the entire library that defined the genre
gunstar heroes is the absolute best action game on the genesis without a doubt
if you find this game at your local game shop make sure you pick it up because it is also a very sought after game by collectors such as myselfi got one of these  last week and its great
for get this only  you can get a brand new genesis with a controller and ac adapter
this version of it is about the size of a portable cd player making it perfect for travel and easy to store away
the only bad thing is that it doesnt work with game genie x vrracing and sega cd
but still  for argubally the greatest system of all time is worth it jump on this offer while you still can
it will give you nostalgia from the old school days of video gamesthis is one of the best systems ever
the graphics may not look great compared to segas dreamcast but nothing really does look good next to a sega system and this is where the blue blur started out right here on the sega genesis
while this is a smaller version of the original this still plays the same golden games
but the thing is this is not made by majesco i dont even think it is distributed my majesco so i dont know where people got that
but that is off the point this power house was the bit revolution the start of bit gaming this is also where sony got a start of developing eventually stabbing sega in the back which led to the down fall of sega who started bit gaming bit gaming and bit gaming
so buy this and all other sega systems before collectors like me take them all away
also check out my review of the ps and see the evedence of how the dc is soooooooooooo much bettermy first system was a sega genesis and i loved playing the sonic series minus spinball and d but i still got em and other classicssorsorsorspidermanxmenxmen which is still my current fave and most importantly maximum carnage
these games are all good and thats what made the system good to me is its games
i liked the snes toofor rpg reasons but the one i was raised on and still play today burned songs from sonichqorg and still have fond memories of today is the genesis the only system i dont have that is sega related is the saturn and that is because i cannot find onebut i will take my word for itso dust off that game and play it and take a trip down memory lane cause i know i do
and you oldschoolers know no game will give you the replay value and enjoyment of a classic system like the feeling you had when aeris died or the  first time you beat robotnik these game have a value that no other can match so when you find the time to play these do so cause in the end these new systems may have graphics and fancy stuff but one thing they will never have is the feeling of enertainment and gratification of a job well done
most newer titles can be beaten in a day some even less than that but i dare you to play super mario world and try to say you can beat it in a day
thats classic gaming for yagolden axe was a classic title and to this day i still cant get tired of this
you are either a axe wielding dwarf or a male or female barbarian with a sword
your goal is to find the evil death adder and defeat him
along the way you use spells and even get to ride on dragons and use them to help you in your quest to bring peace to the landits your basic beat em up blast them with a bit of magic and honestly its a pretty basic game
i just dont think it ever got boring because it was challenging great to play with a friend and always a good nostalgia game if you were getting tired of other gamesthere were a few games that were required on sega genesis any of the sonics and spinball streets of rage altered beast the uncensored mortal kombat moonwalker and of course golden axe
now that you know which ones you must get start with this one and enjoythis game is the best arcade game ever made
when i go to the arcade i shovel out quarters to play it
i have never beaten it though and i dont know how many levels there are
you are a guy who is carrying around an axe or sword and you hack at baddies as they move into the screen
some enemies are more powerful than others and it takes longer to kill them
if you knock a guy off of his lizard then you can jump on it and ride it around slashing at the baddies
the graphics are also very good
you should buy this no you must buy this
it is essential in order to survive
it aint no lie buy buy buygolden axe is a game which was a arcade game brought onto sega genesis
it is a side scrolling game thats basically a beatem up rpg
two people can play together simultaneously or you can roll solo
players can pick between  characters
a warriorbarbarrian like character with a sword
a lady also wielding a sword
and also a dwarf that has a double bladed axe
each of the three characters have the ability of using a different type of magic
golden axe rocks just as much now as it did upon its release
its a simple game yet has its challenges
the genesis version even has more levels than the arcade
as you fight various bad guys including skeleton w swordsgiants w giant sledge hammersect you even get the chance to ride some mythical beasts
two different types of dragons  a weird looking one that has a tale you use to hit advisaries with
the blue dragon breathes fire towards the ground
and the red dragon breathes fireballs towards whatever direction your facing
you work your way through levels to reach  fight death adder
the gameplay is simplistic  enjoyable
the graphics were good when it came out
and pretty good for its time still in my opinion
if you push either left or right on the dpad twice holding down the second  push youll run towards an enemy
you can then hit the attack button to do a cool attack
the dwarf will do a headbutt with his viking helmet
the warriorbarbarrian does a shoulder nudge
and the lady does a flying kick
you are allowed a certain amount of continues
also your able to add some health and continues if i remember in th options menu
the music really fits the game  its levels too
i highly recommend this game to anyone that has never played it but likes old school gamesgolden axe is a hack n slash game originally released in arcades
the genesis port has two more levels than the original and some more featuresthroughout the eight stages you just beat up anybody in your way as well as some bosses
you choose from  characters a muscular warrior a viking or gnome
 and a female fighter
each character has their own kind of magic you can activate once pressing a though that will use up all the pot you have collected from the thieves
some bosses are easy others may be hard
heck the second death adder known as death bringer uses magic once he hits you and that is saying something due to the fact that no enemy uses magicwhat i find odd is that the death adder boss counted as a separate stage rather than entering the castle and the boss being in the same level like in the arcade version
and what just plain bothers me is how sega recolored the vikinggnomes axe silver in this version whereas the arcade versions axe is actually gold like how the title is supposed to describe italong with the normal mode is a beginner mode and a duel modethe beginner mode only lets you play through the first  levels
i guess thats fair for newer playersthe duel mode plays like a fighting game since you have to beat up a certain enemyies to move on
you start with so much hp but if you lose all of it you cant advance
there are no creditscontinues in this modethere are a few options that you can change for the regular game
you can have  hit points instead of  and you can of course change the control settingsoverall this is a neat hack n slash that has been a sega arcade hit for a whilereally shows a true scenario and dilemma that dr grant faced in jurassic park
lots of action albeit taking liberties at times
the game play is worth every penny everything is incredible smooth and easy to handlebetter than the first game needs more levels and good graphicsneeded a new pad for my genesis and noticed these were being sold as new for a decent price
this came as a brand new unopened mint condition box
i almost felt bad opening the box
the controller was in perfect condition and was not a cheap knock off
this is an official sega genesis controller that works perfectly with my model many of the sega genesis games especially in the later years rellied heavily on the  button control bad
if you want to play a fighting game of course youll need one of these
but either wayit aint the same with out  buttons
you get used to the controller
better just buy one just in case you need iti have one of these and it is perfect for mortal kombat on both genesis and sega cd street fighter  sce and other fighting games
and it still works with older genesis and sega cd gamesthis controller has a near perfect dpad feel and easy to press buttonsand its comfortable to gripthis is easily one of the best controls of all timesega was always ahead of its time when it comes to productsthis is the perfect example of what they use to produce back when they made nice video game systemsthe original three button control was awful and i am glad they made this one because this is the oppositeits greatthe sega genesis is almost perfectin my opinion the sega saturn and playstation control is perfect and have a great grip and nice button layoutanywaysthe genesis  button control is ideal for fightingplatformand everything else you can play withthe controls are reliable and cheapso if you have a sega genesis you must get this controlhaha as a kid i never got one of these i remember thinking you had to have them to do fatalities on mkii
anyways great controller and a real treat to take a step back  years agoi had to find one of these controllers so i could play one of my all time favorite games eternal championschallenge from the darkside for sega cd
i finally did find a couple and i must say they are great and fit nicely into your hands
trash the old  button controller and upgrade to the six button controller and you can play and enjoy more games for your sega genesis and sega cdi love all of the sonic games on the genesis and this game is a bit hard to beat but its alot of funi played this on the sonic mega collection and i must say this game is fun and challenging i actually defeated dr robotnik and his robots after i understood the rules of the game which at times left me baffleddr robotniks mean bean machine is a classic puzzler from the  bit era
originally available on the genesis back in the early s it definitely tried to take advantage of the popularity of the sonic franchise
however it really has very little to do with sonic
its a tetris style stack em up where falling slime balls of various colors need to be linked by matching the colors in  combinations
pretty simple but can be very challenging and addicting
its extremely cheap here on amazon definitely worth  bucks
but the best option is to pick up the sonic genesis collection for ps or a simple yet challenging puzzle game
i love the simple animation of it all
if you like tetris or dr mario or yoshis cookie youll like this gamebeing a sucker for puzzle games tetris klax and the like it did not take long for me to fall in love with this game
there are different difficulty settings easy is fun and hard is hard but also fun and the rules of gameplay are easy enough to understand and theres a couple of different gameplay modes you can choose including against your own friends as well as the computer the beans fall from the ceiling and you need to connect four of them any way to make them disappear while you duel with dr robotniks robots
you can arrange your beans as such to form cascade reactions to defeat your opponent the longermore complicated your cascading combinations the more gray beans gets shoved into your opponents screen i cant count how many hours i have spent enjoying this game
solid classic not to be missed
two thumbs way uplike the sonic the hedgehog version of warios woods although its really based on puyo pop which is still a fun game this game although pretty old is a blast and a classic
its good to also have a game not based on the video game storyline using one with the cartoon instead
this game is very challenging for me because im not too good with puzzle games
if you like tetris i highly recommend it but if youre not the kind of person that likes puzzles be warned
the highest level i can get up to is fivethirteen levels in all but its still fun so even if youre not a puzzle fan its a fun game
i still play over and over even though it came out in  there are a lot of enjoyable classics out there and this is one of themin this puzzle game dr eggman has captured the citizens of beanville and is tryng to turn them into robots
its up to you to set them freehere you will face some of dr eggmans earliest inventions including scratch grounder and coconuts
to defeat them you must free more beans
to set the beans free group  or more of the same color together
try setting more groups of beans free to increase your score
also if you are playing with an opponent your opponent will get more robobeans
they cannot be grouped but can escape with a neighboring group
you can be very creative on how you set up the beans
in addition the enemies get mad when you win making it more challenging for each new level
it is so much fun to play and we own both versions the d version on sonic adventure dx and the d version on radicas sega plug n play gamethis game not only gets  stars because it is such a fun and challenging puzzle game but also because many of dr eggmans earliest  inventions were originally featured in the adventures of sonic the hedgehog tv show
several years ago that show didnt seem to air anymore
why
it was such a great show and i love seeing sonic and tails misadventures with dr eggmans earliest inventions
oh well
at least we have this video gameif you loved sega back in the day youll love this gamejust like dr marioremember that one
this game still holds your attention and you can play it for hoursintelligent qube is one of those rare gems for the playstation and it is interesting to know that one can find humble and challenging games among the giants of flashy graphicsthe game is one big and bad puzzle floor where crushing cubes come falling your way and you need to avoid them by making use of explosives you place in the floor
the more cubes you destroy the more points you get and as you advance further the speed the cubes come your way increases by dangerous marginsi do not know if this game can still be found i really doubt it but if you come to find it by all means buy it
miit was a great game because it was so addicting and challenging  yet simplistic and in the realm of its own in terms of the game worldhowever please
i was looking at the prices listed for this product and if one is hunting for a good deal the ones youll find on amazon is your best bet because there are some interesting sellers on ebay that really think youll pay nearly  for a ps game
i mean really folks
a ps game
the ps system doesnt even sell as much as this game is trying to be sold for
yeah i meantrue it was a good game but then so is monopoly and battleship but you dont see people shelling out  to  for emwow
talk about gougingthis game really challenges your thinking and that is what i love about it
you ust cant help but get absorbed into the habit of quick thinkingin  intelligent qube came out and completely took the puzzle world by storm
much like tetris intelligence qube was a game that was nothing short of simplistic
because of its simplistic formula however it was a widely addictive game that really forced you to use your brain
unfortunately the game is extremely rare these days and like many rare highly sought after video games comes at ridiculous pricesa game has never been simpler to learn than intelligent qube
each level has several rows
then the cubes begin to march forward
the entire point of the game is to capture cubes
you simply press x to lay down a trap and then x again to capture it
there are a couple of complexities to the gameplay that make it quite a challenge
for one while your goal is to capture cubes there are certain cubes that you shouldnt capture
these are forbidden cubes and the penalty for capturing one is losing a row of the level youre on
there are also green cubes called advantage cubes
capturing these allows you to set a trap that will capture all the surrounding cubes
at first intelligent qube seems easy but the game is much more complex than you think
as the game progresses the cubes march forward and there are more rows of cubes to deal with
just the same the placement of the marching cubes is completely randomat times you may even have to run in between cubes to get to the ones you must capture in order to avoid forbidden cubes
should you ever get crushed by the cubes theyll automatically roll off the edge of the stage and a row will collapse
if that happens youll have to go through the same set again
if you successfully capture all cubes without capturing any forbidden cubes youll gain another rowthe game is very deep in its strategy
its a lot easier to screw up than it looks
the game is not that long but the levels can throw you for a loop
especially the advantage cube which will even capture forbidden cubes if theyre in range
theres really nothing more to the game than thatgraphically intelligent qube looks incredibly smooth
for a puzzle game like this it looks top notch
theres not a whole lot to the graphics however as aside from the cubes and your little sprite running around theres nothing too complex to the graphicshowever the best part about intelligent qube is easily the soundtrack
beautifully orchestrated
youll be tempted to pause the game just to listen to the music of the stages
this is easily one of the best sounding playstation games ever releasedin spite of its age intelligent qube is still a great game
if anyone is looking for a simple yet addictive puzzle game then youll find it with this gamethis game isnt perfect almost though
im gonna give it a 
it introduced many things that modernfighting games use today
it has good conceptsprosthe theme song within each stage is unique and reflect on each characters personalityevery characters moves is fully narratedeach character has its own story and endgame speechconsthe only realproblem that i saw in this game was the verticalformation of each jump that was made
it served no realfunction in fighting because it was so slow and predictable and extremelypunishable if carriedout improperly
other than that it was a horizontalpaced game from the startall hits either knocked down or locked the opponent into a stun state with each weakslash or weakkick or until it was finished by knocking the person downi do like how they attempted to add aeriel attacks though it made it look cool
 that was perhaps when fightinggame mechanics werent so critical unlike todays fightinggames
likewise theres no combo features in this game unlike street fighter
its more traditional that wayits hard to say what this game could improve on because this game truly was so originalthis game couldnt have had better graphics at that time due to the limits of the playstations 
im pretty sure they took the graphics as far as they could goits a veryheavy slashing game
it could have been muchbetter however given the insight that they had at the start of the playstation era and the fact that this game started many of the other d fighting games out there today its impossible to be able to make a retrospective review of ityou can tell that the authors put their heart and soul into making this gamethis is the fighting game that start the ps on a good start too bad they dont have a hd version in the makingthis game bring back memories and a good game all aroundthis fighting game was absolutely one of the greatest fighting games ive ever played
this game is very addictive
the game features powerful fighters like eiji kayin duke ringo and more
the game features excellent graphics excellent gameplay and excellent moves
this was a very good game and if you ask me this almost makes tekken look wack
once you find this buy it on sight
followed by three more toshiden gamesi have nothing but good memories of playing this game as a sophomore in high school
i saved up my burger king money and bought a psx on the day it released along with this game and ridge racer
i couldnt believe i was playing this game on my tv at home
it was amazing
sure it might not be a star game today but in  it sure was
good timesas the title implies it was because of this game that i decided to go for the psx
until then i only had the nes and was looking at the the three next gen at the time sega saturn n psx and after my dad convinced me to rent the system and this game i was soldthe story behind it is a tournament obviously each with their own story behind why like most fighting games up until that time i had tried such arcade d fighting games such as virtua fighter and tekken and to say the least i was not impressed
this title however threw in the good d elements along with street fighter style projectiles attacks
i was hookedthe graphics compared to today are very bad however for its time it could opf been considered revolutionary
there was even one point where egm put it up against the mighty soul caliber possibly the greatest d fighter of them all and best game on the dreamcast
obviously soul caliber won but to even be put in the same league as it was a great honorget this game for specific reasons
it is one of psx first games also it features easy enough controsl and fun factor that can not be beat by most d fighterswell worth the moneysince i have been retro gaming again recently and thus tactics  and  were dusted off and put in my venerable ps
i felt it necessary to perhaps review these titles for all to seefinal fantasy tactics was the first world to my knowledge where we were introduced to the world of ivalice
a world that undergoes cataclysm after cataclysm remaking itself in a vicious cycle of doomthe story i didnt know that games could have stories half as well made as this story was back when i first began playing it
let alone this well done
the story is a timeless masterpiece that can still take on the best of them and walk away with pride and victory in its bruised hands
theres almost nothing about the story that makes me say wha
in the sense of spotting a plot holethe character development ie the characters that matter is very well executed and its really hard to believe after playing this that this is a final fantasy so used to the bad plots and characters from that series i am post 
 asidethe most fun part about the gameplay of course is the tactical aspects
and if you dont like thinking tactically this game is not for you
sorry ff rabids
you need a brain for this
you just cant spam and expect to come out ontop every time for me this is what most rpgs that are turn based should be going forgraphically the game has aged very well sprites for the win which is not all that surprising given the art stylecontrols you open a menu click a button select a square and its done
nuff saidif theres one failing of this game that i like to pick on
its the scaling encounters
first off i dislike random encounters
they ruin immersion for me
second i like leveling up to actually you know
matter
the idea that out there in this world monsters magically become better as i do the same monsters is just ubsurdbravery and faith were stupid but at least the concept works sorta but again just like random encounters i hate random statsthe menus can get a bit much as well but they dont detract from the game as much as some people like to whine about these people are the ones that think characters that can do everything is a good thing so they can just spam ultima or what have you and gg the bbegthe game with those three faults is still a five star product in my eyes and seeing how long it has been since it was released in my opinion that says alot about the quality put into this gamedamn square why cant you put out products like this anymoreperfect   it had no issues the game works well everything came perfectly and i cant wait to actually start working on this gamefinal fantasy tactics is one of those games that seems like a throwback when you compare it to ff and even ff
the characters arent polygons  theyre sprites
there are no prerendered backgrounds but tiled d isometric battlefields
and there is no dungeon exploring  just strategic battles you continually have to survive to get to the next part of the game
does this sound good
keep readingimagine the closest thing to going headtohead with a friend with your party against hishers
your enemies have the same strengths and weaknesses your characters have
you can exploit their weaknesses while they will try to exploit your weaknesses
got a summoner in your party
watch those knights coming in  theyll get in their two sword blows and your summoner will be dead before he even gets to move
wouldnt you do the same if the enemy party had a summoner
this is a sample of what it may seem like when you are playing this game
it is a challenge
the game is focused on battles and character management
yeah and you can customize your characters so much in this game
you learn abilities for each character make them a certain class equip their abilities and items etc
the possibilities in the characters you can create are endless
it is so technically deepthe story is typical ffcaliber
except square ventured into an area rarely ventured into except by atlus
corruption of the church and nobility is the primary theme
it may seem like one persons intention to run amok on the country but is he being manipulated by higher forces for example
there are so many names and events in this game that the game has a quotbrave storyquot function that lists people youve met or heard about including an option to replay the different scenes you have encountered
so if you drop the game and pick it up  months later you can browse through the brave story to catch up
but the story is flat out great very original and extremely innovativethis game gets hard very quickly
a typical battle can last up to an hour  imagine that
it would take you an hour to survive and kill about  enemy party members
and as i said the game gets hard
even some of the early battles are hard
every time you play this game  no matter how well you know this game  its hard
but at the same time it is a blast to play through each and every timethanks to sony for adding this game to the greatest hits and rereleasing it
i was fortunate to grab it when it came out
thats the trend from squaresoft  get the games when they come out because after that you wont be able to find it anywhere
so get this game the instant you see it available and you can just kiss your family good bye for about a month because youll want to lock yourself in your room playing this gamewho can go wrong with a final fantasy game
this one is based more on strategy than anything but it is still fun especially for a fan
especially since this was around in my childhood it was nice to have it againgame was in perfect condition and quick and timely shipping i needed it for a birthday and got here the day beforei ordered new and it was in fact new still wrapped not scratches and the price wasnt nearly as bad as other places i lookedthats right you read that correctly  copies worn through  gave  away and wearing down number   to be honest i was quite hesitant on even renting this game when it came out thinking that square was using the success of vii ff vii to rack in the sales of this less than average game
well i was wrong not the first time either so far ive played through the game  times and it becomes more involving each time as i try to create a different team even ramza takes on different roles this time i didnt even give him the chance to finish his base class and went right into mage
the game is hard thats a no brainer and if you are a no brainer then dont pick up this game cause i dont know where copy  is comming from and id just assume not have to guess
there will be frustration there will be hardships you will get mad at it and wonder how on gods green earth did square manage to make such crap
then you can pick up the controller again and give that battle on riovanes castle roof top another try to keep rafa alive very hard  or  depends on what you want to achieve
not going to lie to you if you dont plan ahead then you will be dead before the battle has even started
i wouldnt even try to compare this to the other games in the series but rather a game of unforgiving chess
you have  or sometimes less characters and the opposing side can have as few as one and a very hard one at that or  that can be equally difficult
unlike the other games terrain makes a huge difference in this game each landscape is unique and beautifully done just because you are next to someone doesnt mean youll hit them they could be standing ft above and neither can do anything
another wonderful aspect is the story line full of reading contemplating and scratching of the head
somedays i would get a huge peice of puzzle just before bed and find myself lying for  min trying to figure out where it all fits and how this will affect the main character
some ppl may find the plot to be either too deep or too complicated i felt right at home
even our own past is just as complicated and twisted and i would expect that of a game that is trying to relflect our own world
you can keep your sephiroth and his standard destroy the world scheme  ill take the shadowy plots of corruption cloak and dagger and the dark truth of some of the most trusted ppl in the world that are just as manipulative and far more evil than that which they condemnthis game is fantastic to say the least
i would describe it as chess but much much better
your pieces have many more moves and options and the story runs deep with many interesting plot twists and turns and a bittersweet endingthe name tactics definitely fits
i had two friends who also played and beat this game multiple times it is worth a second goaround no matter how long it takes and no two players went about the same strategy
but with  character classes each character can have a primary and secondary class you have the variety to tailor the game to your unique strategypowers your thing
go with knights monks and ninjas
distancefinesse gamer
go with archers summoners and wizards
feeling eclectic
dancers bards and mimes then
each character class has a unique set of abilities that you learn on a job class system that rewards you for acting in battlethe one big warning i have is that the learning curve is rather steep
this is a game that rewards patience and strategy
go play duke nukem if you wanna blow up stuff
but if you want to play what many say is the greatest strategy epic of them all its right here
and amazon doesnt sell it here far as ive seen but tactics has been released under the very economic greatest hits series so go to the store and pick up a very inexpensive very engrossing game
two thumbs way upi got this game last month from amazon
i am a collector of ff games and this is a very good game for the collection
i wholeheartedly recommend collecting every ff game if you are a huge collectori really didnt like playing this game but i enjoy having it in my collectors cabineti loved this game when i first played it when it came out
i have yet to play any game that comes near to matching its incredible story balanced gameplay and complexityeven its sequels cant touch it
love this and will play it several more timessquares entry level final fantasy tatics is a great game
those who are deeply immersed into strategy gaming may find this game to be either elementry as far as strategy is concerned
or complex due to the extreme customizing of the small platoon used in the game
for those who are familiar with final fantasy games but may have never played a strategy based game this is basically the best of both worlds
giving gamers a taste a strategy ff stylethe graphics for this game are cartoon based very colorful and full of life
some of the terrain where battles take place can be mundane almost eye sore
i say this mainly due to the fact that your crew of fighters level up ff style so random battles in grasslands and deserts constantly can make for very boring backgounds
not all is bad though
as you progress the story areas inside castles and around civilized structures are a pleasent and much needed change of pace
the level of detail is limited due to the angle and distance the game platform is structured on but does not take away from the experiencethe heart of this game lies with the gameplay
turned based strategy sounds boring ff tatics really adds a depth of its own to make this game pretty interesting
those familiar with the final fantasy world will know the job classes almost immediatly
all charchters start off as low level squires or chemist
gaining experience and skills in those jobs open a new class of jobs knight and mages respectivly
gaining more experience opens more jobs and classes with different skills classes in all and  skillsabilities a lot of time is spent trying level up to access everything
very customizable but tedious at times
nothing new for square in that department
the trick to customizing in this game is balancing your team
a good mix of warriors and mages will allow you to beat most opponents without much problemmusic another brilliant masterpiece by square
totally fits the game ambiance from the lighthearted map tune to the more serious tones of the boss battles
not as good as vagrant storys though both games are done by the same composer tatics doesnt seem to have the same amount of time or heart put into it like vagant story doesthere are two flaws i found in the game both can be considered medium to high
the first was that i found a way to level up my units quickly early in the game
before i finshed chapter one all of my units were at level  i wont say how i did it because it does take away from the gaming experience as a whole
making the game somewhat easy
due to this being a strategy based game you can still lose battles with high level charchters but minor strategy will get you through a fight with ease
astute players will see this little cheat at the beginning
sadly this is not code cheat
its progammed into the game
secondly this being the worst after all your hard work chapter four rewards you with allies who have special sword skills so that your elite team of ninjas summoners and knight based warriors are obsolite
you work hard to get there skills up new and better jobs just to send them home near the end of the game
you wont turn down services of charchters who can take down  to  enemies at once would you
room in your army is only  units
what you do keep wont be used becuase they cant keep up with everyone else
that bothered me for a while but after fighting the final bosses your original team would get crushed anyhowoverall a good game for beginners of strategy based games and those who are familiar with final fantasy
the story is your usual ff banter without the role playing element
i highly recommend this game to the previously metioned groups of gamers
those looking for more serious strategy fix may wanna skip this one
one of the top  psx games of all time
also i recommend buying the strategy guide there is an ingame tutorial but the book explains everything much betterdespite the game being over  years old it still rocks hardmy biggest beef is with the poorly translated script
other than that it is nearly flawlessthere are dozens of reviews which talk about specifics but here are my overall impressions circa pros music amazing
 graphics yes classic squatty sprites rule
 job system is amazing great variety of equipment cool magic and special attack animations great leveling system secret hunt rules random battles are nice learning skills from slain enemies is nice stealing strong equipment weather effects your abilities elevation effects lots of maps orlandu cloud strifecons story easy last boss though getting there is very tough only  characters in your army inability to send recruited npcs on quests and jobs quest system is a joke the jobs you accept in bars average summon animations rafa and malak suck kind of feels like cheating to raise your permanent brave and faith levelsthe whole quottactics ogrequot style of this game makes it a great play and a welcome surprise in the series
the game does take a lot more strategy so some may find it more difficult
however fans of the realtime strategy genre may enjoy this game even though they may dislike the rpg genre as a wholethis game is a little different from the other ps one final fantasy games
you have many characters and can send some on sidequests to earn money and experience while proceeding thru the game with other characters
there are jobs the characters can learn which give them abilities
the battles are different than early ff games and require more thought
the terrain in the battlefield varies and you need to be able to jump or do things like that to reach itemsa very enjoyable game if you like older rpgs
an asset to the ff seriesthis game is fantastic
the story blends perfectly with the battles and many times takes place in battles
i most of all really like the levelup system its very complex and uses the job system
this is no doubt a very intellectual game
the job system allows for hours and hours of battling and leveling up until you reach your max statistics and even then there is still work allowed to be done
the storyline is very very deep
another aspect is the music which is amazing
it adds to the atmosphericness of the game and is very well written
i recommend this to anyone with a whole lot of patienceand a brain
if you are restlessthis isnt for you
this game would probably appeal to the more mature croud of gamershence the long battles and complexintertwining storylinewhen i first got this game i thought it was just a final fantasy game where you can just have custom characters
i was wrong
this game is much more
ive played several other final fantasy games and this is better than those ive playedfirst off the storyline is amazing
the main character is a young man named ramza you can change his name who wants to follow his fathers path and become a knight of great respect
however he goes through a time of deceit treachery murder and turmoil
everything is just plain wrong in his eyes and in the end he has no idea on which side to take up so he fights on his own side which in your eyes might be the good side it was in mine
there are so many twists to this game youll keep coming back for morethe graphics in this game is amazing
the look of all the different attacks are amazing especially the magical and special character skills
the characters are as some may put it superdeformed sd but they look amazing
the levels are in d and look really nice
and each weapon has a unique look which is pretty sweetthe gameplay is just plain amazing
its a simple way of playing move perform an action and choose the direction you face
its also complex enough to require a well thought strategy thus where the word tactics comes into play
random battles are actually random they dont have a specific pattern compared to other final fantasy games
also theres a deep class system called the job system
this is a legendary component of one of the final fantasy games ffv
you can customize each member of your party to your style of play and at the beginning of each battle you are allowed to place up to  members in a specific place
you also have guest members which stay in your party until you get to a certain part of the game
most of these guests can become permenant members of your party which is actually good since theres one character that you can get thats really worth getting
theres also sidequests that allow you to get hidden characters including cloud strife from ffviithe game is difficult at points but is mostly pretty average
the most difficult part of the game is probably the battle against wiegraf for the final timesound really good dont need to go into thisif you like chess and final fantasy pick this game up asap
its definitely worth itthere are many indications of whether a game is good
final fantasy tactics has at least two of those indications
 although the playstation  is in its dark ages many lastsecond rpgs are using the final fantasy tactics battle system
 the game had to be reissued due to popular demandgraphics grade of quotaquot
yes they do look like they can be done on a super nintendo but this game isnt trying to be graphically intense
does tetris need great graphics
most certainly not because its a puzzle game
likewise fft doesnt need good graphcis because its a strategy game where too much detail would possibly get in the way and be a distractionmusic grade of quotaquot
some people will tell you that the fft soundtrack is the best videogame soundtrack ever
i dont know if id go that far but i must say the music fits perfectly with the game
there are tons of battles in this game but there is a lot of variety in the music
best of all the music actually puts you in the mood to whip out that sword and cream those foes
germinas peak sweegy woods back fire boss battle themes are among my favoritesgameplay strategy games can sometimes be synonymous with quotdifficultquot
and believe me this game is difficult
but not to learn
someone definitely had their hat on right when they made the intuitive battle system
move act or wait are your three primary commands and they become secondnature within an hour
also one can equip their characters with many pieces of equipment
this sounds tedious but there is a nice feature called a quotfitting roomquot that makes all the boredom of quotbuy exit menu equip go back to store sellquot so much simpler
but what makes the game difficult are the battles
some are ridiculously easy but others will require some leveling up in the field first
fft brings back the job system that was in ff allowing for a morethangenerous amount of customizabilitystoryline this is where the game could use a little help
for one the translation has speling errors wordssmashed together punctuation problems and sometimes i just dont understand what is going on
materialike crystals play a vital role
one thing that i found amusing was that nearly every betweenbattles sequence involves a death
to me the storyline is just a peripheral
if you understand it fine
if not fine
youre here to fight battles and listen to the music mostlyfinal id give it  stars out of  one thing that this game has though is replay value
you can beat it in  hours but you can probably play it another  times no problemthis games story is so epic that at times it seems that the story was wasted on a game designed with a focus on battles although at other times the format of the game seems to suit the story perfectly as when the characters speak during midbattle
the plot of this game has the theme of exploring history in search of truth and demonstrates through allegory the biases of the societal forces which allow for the recording of history and the tendency of historians to attribute heroic characteristics to the victors of any scenario regardless of their true alignment or intentions
at many points in the plot unexpected events occur with the attentive player having received just enough information to speculate on the motivations of the characters involved and playing through the game there were many such moments at which i speculated improbably twisted scenarios only to be shocked when future events actually confirmed my dark suspicions or clarified the scenario to be even more depraved than i had imagined
this is not an incredibly violent game nor is it atmospherically dark in the film noir sense
but it is a deeply philisophical game which doesnt underrepresent the magnitude of human suffering the tendency of humans to abuse power or the unreliability ones personal allies in societies conducive to individual scheming
the character of delita who comes across as contradictorily skeptical and idealistic is too much of a mastermoralist in the nietzschean sense to qualify as a hero but is too difficult for a player sensitive towards his motivations to villainize
even the abberant supernatural elements of this mostly human and political story work well from a literary standpoint as the relationship between ajora the lucavi and those who seek the zodiac stones is represented with style and subtlety adding faustian intrigue to the plotthe gameplay of tactics is reasonably balanced in the sense that there are not many situations in which one overly powerful and convenient approach to winning battles makes every other possible strategy obsolete
like other jobsystem games the player can create these situations himself by overcommitting to the equipment and abilities for a particular job for certain characters thereby forcing himself to use the same strategy for every battle or sacrifice the majority of his characters power but the game itself offers many different feasable play possibilities
different sections of the game will present different challenges depending on how the players party is configured such as ramzas oneonone battle with gafgarion the outnumbered battle at golgorand execution site or the rooftop save rafa battle and unless the players party is so ridiculously overpowered as to allow for massively inefficient gameplay the tactical perameters of each battle require a rethinking of the players strategy as elements such as attack strength attack range and character mobility must be alternately prioritizedthe ability to review story scenes and look up public information about the characters adds to the immersive element of the game and the players ability to appreciate the plot
this game is superb because its many innovations are effectively implemented its visual design effectively portrays compelling medievalstyle fantasy some characters are incredibly welldeveloped and even the lesser characters are given enough development to fully serve their role within the incredibly literary plotfinal fantasy tactics is one of the best video games i have ever played
its so fun and it has an incredibly deep story that will stay with you forever
you will never forget this game after youve played ityou either love or hate this game in my opinion i have met many rabid fans such as myself and by the same token many people who despise this game with every fiber of their being
it is however my all time favorite game for the playstation
it may not have the best graphics but in terms of story gameplay depth difficultyits all there
for more casual gamers it offers a fairly easy main story but for those who like a challenge there is the deep dungeon not to mention plenty of opportunities to steal rare equipment that you only get one chance for
i enjoyed this game and im sure if you are a strategy rpg fan you will tobattles are randomly generated including frequency in nonstoryline encounter areas
not to be taken lightly as the monster level match your own so overleveling compared to what equipment is available could be a good way to die horribly
be careful of saving over previous files as there are a few boss class encounters after previous battles without being able to move freelyi still play this game from time to time
the gameplay still holds up to be one of the better turned based strategy games that ive ever playedi first played this game when i was  years old
i fell in love with the game it was fun to play and actually involved strategy
i couldnt really understand the story at that age but now that ive played it again i fully understand it and appreciate how brilliant it is
the gameplay is like the early final fantasy games turn based however this game was played on a field rather than on a line like the other final fantasy games
you select your group and move across the field to get near enough to the enemy soldiers to strike
the gameplay is so fun and addicting and with so much variation to the actions you can do in battle makes every fight different and fun
now what i love most about this game is the story
the story is just very elaborate and well thought out there is character development with the protagonists and even some of the antagonists
there are lots of twists in the story and there is just more than enough good things to say about the storyoveralli know this is an old game and the graphics dont stand up to the ones of today however the strategic gameplay and brilliantly detailed story make up for the graphics
pros a lot of customization great story great gameplay
cons outdated graphics
the pros greatly
outweigh the cons
 out of some people accuse square for trying to make more and more money off ff with this title
well so thats what they wanted to do
they are running a business ya know
what i love about square is that they always manage to do it rightthe games job system is unbelievably usable and flexible
the combinations you can create with this system are almost limitless considering you have  ability slots and each one is designated for a different ability type attack movement secondary attack battle support and reaction abilities
the story  well known for its truly awful translation
dont let that fool you though
they translated the story completely and nothing is censored out
so dont even fret about that
to be honest they pretty much had some very bad grammar in some areas and had a few misspellings
and their extreme overuse of quotation marks is abominableokay back to the good stuff
this game is not designed for everybody
its very difficult and geared toward advanced gamers looking for a gameplay challenge
note the keyword gameplay
this game is not an interactive movie remember in the past ff games how tedious the random battles became
you dreaded moving along the map wondering when the next battle would use up even more of your timewell the battles are the very essence of this game
without the battles youd have a very bad movie with no action the plot is centered to require the battles and pieces of the story missing since a lot of plot scenes occur in midbattleall in all not exactly something youd get for your  year old son please dont do that  because he wont play it unless hes some kind of prodigy
for gamers who are tired of games that get old linear and tedious look no furtherwell they do if you dont take care of this disksafter all these years final fantasy tactics is still a game i enjoy returning to every once in a while
the engaging story and unique characters make it a truly enjoyable experience no matter how old you or the game get
and because of the class system it can be played differently every time
ever done a solo calculator runthe simple graphics are reminiscent of a time when story mattered more than how the game looked
and even today many games are attempting to recapture that retro look
lets face it
this is a game you can come back to again and again and enjoy it every time
there are very few games that can make the same claimi had this one when i was a young adult
one of the best rpgs ive ever owned i still remember it wellthis is one of my favorite fft games while the graphics are not extremely good it does not hurt the feel of the game as the gameplay stays solid even if have not play it for  years final fantasy tactics is an incredible accomplishment
while bearing the final fantasy name it is not part of the main numbered series
final fantasy tactics brings a new style of gameplay to the final fantasy series strategy
this is a strategy game
the goal of tactics is not so much to explore the world but rather to strategically win battles to advance the story
the only exploration comes in finding where the best place on the battlefield is to put your characters in order to attack the most effectively
this is a difficult game to get into at first but given the chance the game becomes very addictive and soon may be one of your favorite games
it is that goodthe game begins slow and is a little confusing at first
you are moved from location to location and given a lot of story the story in tactics is the deepest of any bearing the name final fantasy
you must fight by moving your characters around the field of battle and placing them so that they can do the most damage while hopefully avoiding getting too injured
terrain is important
this game features a very well done job class system so what job class your characters are affects what they can do
only a chemist can use healing items only a mage can cast magic knights are very strong and can wear armor and so on
mastering the job classes and learning what the best way to fight battles is very important and will determine how successful you will be
it seems a little daunting at first but putting the time and effort into this game is worth it
it is often overlooked but it is one of the best on the playstation
for rpg fans final fantasy fans strategy fans or just someone looking for a great game and a new experience final fantasy tactics is the game to getdefinitely one of the better strategy rpgs ive played but still difficult
not as difficult as the disgaea strategy rpg series thankfully but still pretty hard
the plot and the job system are very deep though and will definitely keep a lot of players busy
highly recommendedfinal fantasy tactics was released early on in the playstations lifespan
while some dismissed it as too hard or too quirky a lot of gamers found it challenging and a fresh change from more conventional rpgsit borrowed a lot including its basic battle system from tactics ogre many of the staff also worked on that game
its story however is radically different from to though equally interesting
ffts tale of political upheaval and ancient magic suffers from a poor translation but the craftsmanship of the plot manages to shine throughffts graphics and music are surprisingly good for its age
beautiful handdrawn sprites are layered over d battle maps and the synthesized music only occasionally sounds like itthe gameplay is incredibly deep with dozens of different job classes and hundreds of abilities to learn
you can combine abilities to create new classes  a knight who can use black magic for example or an archer who can steal
the possibilities are seemingly endlessnow that final fantasy tactics is available again as part of the greatest hits lineup its a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in the most polished strategyrpg aroundfinal fantasy is easily one of the best console games ever created
there are many reasons for this but it all culminates into one solid reason replayability
there is no other game that i can play over and over again with each game easily stretching over  hours and not get bored
it takes a lot of assets to make something this replayable
so what are these elements game design all of the stars must have aligned for the game play to come together the way it did
true character mortality makes the battles more intense
weather affinity facing luck agility are more clearly factors than they usually seem in other games
character classes and how they can be leveled and discovered is so much fun to explore like the monstrous mathmetician and how he to use him well
there are a huge number of spells spread across all of the classes and the variety of the visuals and effects are incredible
there are so many things lurking in the background of this game that make it so incredibly deep and infinitely replayable
it is different every time you play it art direction the artistic direction of this game is so focused and consistent that it becomes totally convincing and ultimately haunting
the character design colors and shadows create an amazing atmosphere that comes through on every single map
the visuals of the spells are beautiful bursting with colors and interesting particle effects
at this time squares magic spell had such a unique look to them that it was almost like recognizing a great artists style
they really stood out that much over the other games out there
even with the crude polygonal maps and limiting rotoscoped bitmaps the look of the game is impressive even today causing the replay value again to be high because it is always engrossing to enter this world sound the music for final fantasy tactics is broad in scope and style
the soundtrack takes up  cds and to listen to all of the tracks separate from the game amazes with the shear quantity and quality of every song
they range from epic to intimate and are all memorable
once again the replayability is bolstered this time by the excellent soundtrack story this is one of the few times that a convoluted japanese video game narrative actually improves the game
there is so much going on in this story that there is a dictionary to keep track of all of the characters and events
because of this boatload of information and complexity of the story it never really gets old either so there goes another one for replayability
each time you play through theres a good chance you might pick up a little thing you missed the last time around unique items the game is packed full of unique items that can be pretty hard to get a hold of
from weapons to characters there are all kinds of things to track down
if you look through a strategy guide you will be amazed to see the reems of info on stuff you can go on side quests to geti imagine there are lots of people out there with short attention spans who would get bored with final fantasy tactics so it cant have universal appeal but anybody with a stitch of patience will get sucked into this game big time
it never seems like a waste of time and is fun and amazing on so many different levels that i could never go into enough detail to give it justice
but i can say that this game has stayed at the top of my list of best games of all time through the last three generations of consoles and there have been some great games since then and thats pretty impressivetherere alot of great rpg games out there like ff zelda  chrono trigger suikoden  and  secret of mana to name a few but none can top fftacxtic for ps one
its my   rpg of all time
i really like jobsclass system   if remember correctlynija and summoner is a must  the game is quit hard if you didnt levelup get a higher jobsclass or worst decline count orlandu to join your quest half way through chapter  his holyknight skill is indeed second to none
it would been perfect if the game were a little longer but you can get up to  hours of game plays if you try to get all jobsclasses
all and all thiss one the greatest game with great stories challenging enermies and so much twists and turnsive definetely have got to agree with some reviewers here that ff tactics isnt everyones cup of cake not if you want flashy d graphics and lengthy fmvs here its d and and has brief fmvs
it is a heck of a difficult game for starters if you play without guidebooks
you may attempt hours or days on a single mission or even restarting from scratch and that is just the cool part of fft it is the most challenging square game since ffv and ff vi
the wide range of jobs and abilities is what thatll hook you till months with again ridiculously hard miniquests as bonus if youre willing to endure another couple of weeks of migraine especially the nogias dungeon
the d graphics are probably the most eyecandy ever on ps with cool d spells awesome soundtrack and great stereo sound
again this might not be everyones cup of cakeno review can do enough justice for this masterpiecei have played hundreds of games in my lifethis game ranks noin terms of offering sheer amount of strategic gameplaymusicstorychallengevariety and fantastically designed mapscombine to give you the most gratifying time of your lifethe guys in squaresoft outdid themselvesnot even the mighty ff vii can compare to this game in offering sheer amount of funtactical games like disgaeaand other nis america gamespale in comparison to this juggernautthey just don not have the storybattle animationstactical strategybalance of gameplay choicesastounding sense of progressionthat ff tactics offersthis game is in a class of itselftruly a magnificent masterworkexquisitely designed by squaresof working at the height of its powersstands the test of time as this review is posted in final fantasy tactics is a classic game for the playstation which is still great fun to play in the days of the playstation the graphics are reasonably good with three dimensional characters and environments
the church you start out near for examples looks like one you might construct out of paper and color the walls of
very flat with few surfaces but relatively reasonable for the timegameplay involes you and your group of up to  friends trying to figure out a war between two halves of the country youre in
each character has its own strengths and weaknesses of course and they gain in skill as they go through battlesbattle is turn based and involves your d characters and your enemies on a map
you have to move close to your enemies to fight with them and figure out who to move in close and who to keep further off
this is different than the final fantasy rpg series where in essence your team stands in a line the enemy stands in a line and you simply fire at each otherthere are of course chocobos your yellow friends that can carry you around
in this version they can even lay eggs
you never know what will hatch out of one and its a neat way to add new monsters to your groupi will comment that the translations are pretty awful the letters appear s  l  o  w  l  y on the screen and the plot is rather complex with names and alliances to keep track of
but thats a minor flaw given how fun the game ishighly recommended to any final fantasy fan even though its a bit old
you can usually get it inexpensively and its well worth itwowive had this game for the longest time but i still enjoy it
i know a lot of the newer games are really expensive and if you dont have a lot of cash to purchase them give this one a try
it can provide you with hours i mean hours of a unique gaming experience
its a highly customizable turn based strategy game with an engaging storyline
it is very easy to learn how to play and it will last
definately try this game or play it if you are given a chance
i highly recommend it
it is one of my personal favoriteshighly addictive i wish square would make a million games like this
really should get  or  stars because it is so superduper coolfinal fantasy tactics  circa good complex story with lots of twists and turns hundreds of different abilities and magic powers to learn hundreds of different items and weapons to find lots of playable characters to unlock as well as secrets to uncoverbad graphics may seem pretty dated to today video gamers story can be confusing to some can be too tough or slow for some video gamersif it fits your taste turn based strategy rpg no voiceovers so there is lots of reading battles can be long and pretty slow movinggame its most assocated too tactics ogre vandal hearts final fantasy tactics advanceadditional notes cloud from final fantasy vii is a secrets and playable character the director who was behind this game yasumi matsuno also worked on vagrant story and was working on final fantasy xii but got pull off the project note all final fantasy are not related to one another think of each final fantasy a its own game not connect in any realtrue way to another final fantasy the only exception is final fantasy x which is a sequel to final fantasy xthis game was probably the second strategy rpg i have ever played
the funnyand perhaps sad thing is that this may still be the king of the genre
i have been playing the game again and am still amazed at the depth and challenge of this game
the different jobs and skill each character can master is simply astounding
the challenge of the battles is tough but not impossible
yes  you will have to play some random battles to level your characters a bit  but its worth itseriously if you like strategy games and have not yet played final fantasy tactics  you are missing one great gamefinal fantasy tactics is one of the only games in the series where you control your own characters to fight with and your own destiny
while the graphics are of a down fall the games sets it self up to benefit the gamer
the ability to be a master in every job signifintly makes it easier to beat the game
some jobs are better than others
i prefer monks knights and lancers
there are five chapters  to the game and while you advance the story you will want to level up fast to hurry up and speed thrpugh the game to see its ending
even though you can not interact with the ending after the credits what happens will not surprise anybody at all
the game should take about  hours of playing time and is pretty good compared to most of the games in the seriesto close i would like to say i will definetly get ff tactics advance for the gbathis game is great
i can easily spend one hundred hours playing this game
it is very addictive to playthe title really says it all this is the best game of all time
it is in my personal opinion and most true gamers also have it as  on their listshowever this is very little like the typical ff
instead of the boring and very annoying battles in all ffs battle now takes place on a large multilayered isometric d battle fields
you must move characters around to get into a good place for an attack a strong defense or even magic
it has an extensive job system including both exp and jp job points
there are many great jobs and a few useless but customization of characters is very deepall in all its a great game with a decent story graphics that get the point across and a great battle system that brings much pleasure to just watchi played this game exclusively for almost  months on the original playstation
it is arguably my favorite game ever on the playstation
the different options for your characters was nearly endlessthis game offered so much fun i almost want to go buy it again
almostoverall  superbfinal fantasy tactics originally released in early  went on to be one of squares most critically acclaimed games of all time as well as becoming one of the mostly highly sought after playstation titles until it was released as a greatest hits title
as the years go by final fantasy tactics is one of the few games where reception of the game has increased over the years rather than decrease
despite having a reissue on the psp the original game is still a treat
however both versions have their own cons
while many have reported that the psp version has slowdown the original playstation release suffers from a mediocre translation of a fantastic storyfinal fantasy tactics concerns itself with ramza beoulve
a noble who believes in justice and honor
in the world of ivalice ramza is about to be involved in the biggest power struggle in the worlds history
it concerns a conspiracy bigger than anything ramza could imagine
the story is full of almost everything you can imagine
betrayal injustice and some of the most mature themes final fantasy has ever dared to go to
be forewarned though
despite a trating the game is actually quite dark
despite its cutesy graphics this game is anything but cute as it is easily the most violent and moving of all the final fantasy gamesthe gameplay that makes final fantasy tactics a treat
thanks to the job system customization is nearly endless
before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters
each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle
mages have devastating magic abilities while knights are strong physical attackers
they also bring their own unique abilities to the table
because there are so many job classes to choose from theres a lot of experimentation you can do
as you master abilities youll also be able to mix and match
you could have a squire casting white magic for example provided youve learned some of the white magic abilitiesas battles progress you gain experience
you pretty much gain experience after each and every turn which is nice
not only do you gain experience but you also gain job points to help you master the abilities in your job class
its pretty simple stuff and youll be surprised at just how fast you can learn abilities herehowever final fantasy tactics was notorious for being an incredibly challenging game
in order to survive some of the games toughest battles youll have to spend hours roaming around to learn abilities and raise levels
enemies dont let up and they actually are quite smart
theyll take advantage of your parties disadvantages by usually attacking the weakest character or even ganging up on certain characters
its also no help that their attacks deal a startling large amount of damage
if you want to survive in final fantasy tactics level grinding is a must and its not negotiablein terms of graphics final fantasy tactics is fairly cute looking
but the sprites are incredibly detailed especially for   unlike the psp version the game also runs smoothly and fast
there are also a few cutscenes here and there to show you some of the story
tactics also sports some of the best music the series has ever knownif there was anything to criticize about the original release it would be the same thing that everyone criticizes
the translation is absolutely horrible
the story is incredible but the script for the original playstation version may be one of the worst efforts done in localization history
its almost worth it to pick up the psp version of the game for this one reason alone
some of the translation is so bad some parts of the story are utterly confusing
the only other problem with final fantasy tactics is that if you really want to get through the game youll spend the least amount of time taking in the story
as i mentioned earlier level grinding is a must to survive throughout the adventure
the problem is youll have to do it too much
to the point where it stops the advancement of the story
sometimes for long intervals at a time
and the story hardly retreads or reiterates eventsfinal fantasy tactics is easily one of the best games in the series
it is not however for the beginner or the inexperienced tactical strategy game player
for those who dont wimp out however final fantasy tactics is rewardingon occasion i feel the need to pull out my ps and play one of my old psone games
when i do final fantasy tactics is always one of the firstwith the exception of monsters each character may change jobs between battles
some examples include the armor and weapon breaking knight the duelwielding ninja the enviroment dependant geomancer or the bare knuckled monk to name a few
a character must learn certain jobs first to unlock more down the road
in the beginning you choose either squire to have a more fightertype skill set or chemist for the wizardtype skill set
the archer which you learn later unlocks the roguetype skill set
each and every job brings its own unique skills to bare and you may cross your current job with another job you have been training with earlier
for example if you had mastered the thief class you may change classes to the lancer set your seconardy skill as steal the thiefs skill and now you may level the lancer class but use all your hard earned steal skills too
i cant say how much i appreciate this in a gamethe combat works something like an intricate game of chess
characters have a move and jump rating determined by their skills class and some equipment alters these ratings also
move and jump together show you how far and where you are capable of moving
the time mage class learns a skill learn that allows you to teleport around the map
certain monsters and classes are able to fly 
 thereby removing the need to jump
different weapons have different attack ranges
bows fire in a large ring around the character being on higher ground allows a larger range
lances reach two squares away from the character
swords daggers axes and rods have a reach one square
guns yes guns have a huge range but cannot fire over obstacles such as walls trees or other characters yes you can shoot them if they get in the way like a bow can
learning how to equip the right characters with the right weapons becomes very important as your amount of classes expands and the enemies become smarteri cant say enough about this game
my only real recommendation play it
if you dont own it burrow it from a friend
you will want to own a copy within an hour of starting a new game
for those who didnt get the title for my review final fantasy tactics for the win in my opinionfinal fantsy tactics is by far the greatest strategy game ever made
when i first started playing it i was a little dissapointed for the fact that i was expecting something more like a final fantasy rpg
but this isnt an rpg exactly it is more like a chess game
within an hour or so of fighting the different boards i was hooked
the moment i finished the game i started an entirely new game
since then i have beaten the game at least four times while having different characters and abilities of the characters in each game
i literally have over  hours of playing in one of my saved games
it is so hard to describe the coolness of this game
if you would like a game where you have a lot of independance in creating your very own characters to your own satisfaction if you like a game where you can be challenged and if you like the game of chess this is it
squaresoft how about creating a sequal to this game making it even better if that is even possible and putting it on the playstation  market
id buybesides the kiddish final fantasy tactics advancedthis is a very challenging and different game which actually involves strategy and tactics thus the title of the game
dont go in expecting a regular final fantasy game where all you have to do in battles is push the x button a couple of times and its over
the battles in this game are similar to that of chess you have to move around on a board in a turnbased battle system you have different characters with customizable abilites and you have to defeat the opposing characters by thinking a few moves ahead and developing a tactic to win
this kind of gameplay requires a lot of thinking and its fun
you also have to watch out as to not hurt your own characters like with arrows or spells
you can also accidentally aid your opponents so you really have to plan out all your movesthe customizable nature of this game is also very exciting with many different character jobs you can choose from all with a set of different abilities you have to gain experience for and learnthe storyline is also very entertaining and satisfying
you are always joining up with people and other characters betray you
the cutscenes develop the characters very well and the plot was thought out very well too
i always want to keep playing to find out what happens nextthe downside of this game not so big for me though is that you dont really travel and talk to people like in the other ff games
when you go to a town there is a menu of places you can go
so all you have to do is select a place and youre there
but the upside to that would be you dont waste time searching for buildings and other things so it really depends on the playeras an endnote i just really hope that square makes another game like this for ps and not a simplified kiddish version for the gameboy
final fantasy tactics is an amazing game and they need to make an amazing part everybody seems to note that this games plot is a typical save the world storyline
while that may be true most rpgs i have played seem to be derived from that say typical format
even ffvii as great as it may be ultimately fell for the same format
however in spite of this format wild arms delivers on plenty of plot twists and character developmentthe idea of playing each character individually before bringing them together was new to me at the time i missed out on the nintendos dragon warrior iv and never had the chance to see something like this beforehand
just discovering the elw world as well as rudys past was a twist all in itself
i remember when we first played through adlehyde and when the credits started to roll my brother and i knew it couldnt have been the end but we were still dumbfounded and trying to figure out what was going on
turns out the game was only just beginningas for battles by todays standards they might be rather simple but at the time i was very impressed
it was the reason i bought wa in the first place having seen a screen shot of a battle on the back of the playstation box
the idea of going from d field to a d battle was new to me at the time and made fighting monsters a little more entertainingand now for the overall graphics
ive been playing rpgs long before the playstation so when we first bought the playstation we purchased a rather cheap traditional space shooter with impressive graphics but not much else
wa was the second game we bought for the ps so graphically speaking we had just come off of a heavy dose of super nintendo games and were not yet exposed to the elements that ffvii would soon bring
the graphics were alright by me but graphics does not always mean a great game
take wild arms remake wa alter code f for example
updated story great movie scenes but somehow didnt live up to the originalback in  almost all gamers were talking about the debut of squaresofts final fantasy vii for the psx
i never having played an rpg before that point played a demo of the ffvii at my cousins house that was packaged with squares tobal no  little known fighting game
that christmas i asked santa for a playstation and a copy of ffvii
sanata delievered and i enjoyed and occupied myself for many hours that christmasbut this review is about wild arms
after i had completed ffvii after the holidays my classmate lent me his copy of wild arms
while wild arms didnt contain all the hype and flash that ffvii had going for it far from it in some aspects i felt the game overall was a real winnereven five years after its release i still cant praise this game enough
graphically the game is very outofdate by todays standards but one must realize the games graphics were outofdate the minute ffvii flexed its polygonal mucsles only a few months later
if your rating how good an rpg is by its graphics then you are not a true rpg fan in any way shape or formgraphics was never the series strong point even though the graphics for wild arms  were very well done outside of the battle system mind you
 and wild arms  cellshading was nice but kinda dull overallwhat really made wild arms such a strong game is the excellent character development that easily rivals any squareenix title im not afraid to make such a bold statement
when you really start to feel for the games characters espeically when tradegy strikes them you know you have a winner
even the games villians are very well developed and very very memorable i still refer to them in gaming conversations after all this time
some may say the story is your typical savetheworld fare but i still think it beats the heck out of some of the plotlines in games today where original ideas seem to be lacking overallwild arms simply put is a classic
personally i would put this above ffvii in terms of my overall favorites even though i played ffvii first ffvii still being another one of my top favorites
even if your a new to wild arms or a fan this is one rpg not to overlookhmmm i wonder what the psx remake wild arms alter code f is going to be likewild arms is one of the first ps rpg reached the american and european shelves and yet one of the betterunfortunately the game get overlooked by many that consider this game bad because the old graphics and the oldstyle settingthe puzzleoriented action rpg gameplay is the strongest pointthe positive characters prologues puzzleoriented gameplay fabulous western soundtrack any characters have a different way to learn to ability many and fun sidequests rich characters background and backstory story is crafted superbly fantastic dungeons good turnbased battle system western and fantasy merge very well too much damn funthe negative the character interaction is limited and so the character lack life snes d graphics and ugly d blocked graphics poor script the translation of the italian version is atrociousgraphics soundtrack story character development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  very good with so many sidequest easily reach the  hoursdifficulty easy to mediumreplay value  no so high but who carewild arms was the second american playstation rpg
the graphics attest to thistheyre pretty ugly
the battle system is nothing special though at the time with its guardian force system and arms was quite uniquehowever it is an extremely good time
truly the characters will become your friends
they are very well developed each with distinct personalities and drive
this development isnt without a good complementary story wild arms though cliched what isnt
presents a very pleasant storythe mysterious quality about all of the hidden goodies littered throughout the world an unreachable ledge here an edgeofthescreenseen cave there adds to the already impressive atmosphere generated by the musicthe music is incredible
youll never forget that classic dungeon theme or adlehyde town and castle or perhaps port timney
i could go on for a while
some unforgettable stuff
youd recognize it years laterthis is a very addictive game if you can get past its dated look
a solid buy id sayquotwild armsquot probably has one of the better story lines that i have seen in console rpgs
at the beginning you play the three different characters separately this basically lets you get used to the strengths and weaknesses of each character
shortly after this all three meet up and they pretty much stay together for the rest of the game
not only are the characters interesting people but the plot is very well done and executed though it is one of those save the world plots
combat in the game was pretty fun or at least i thought so though i can see where some people might not like it as there really isnt a whole lot of strategy to it
some of the puzzles in quotwild armsquot can be a little challenging but most of them are not too hard to figure out
the game has one thing that some people might consider a downside i didnt pretty much everything in the game was polygonal making the graphics a bit dated for the time
one thing i almost forgot to mention is the game introduction  when you first start up the game you are treated to an anime style production that introduces you to all the characters
this game is a lot of fun to play and well worth spending the money for iti dont know about the other idiots on here that gave this such a bad rating but this to me is truly the first great rpg of the playstation console
yeah sure the graphics suck but the storyline  character graphics on the character stats are incredible
i sure wish the entire game looked the same
im am mostly through the game  am still trying to find where the epic final showdown will take placesecrets of evermore is still one of the best games i have ever played since i beat it ten years ago
there are only  characters in the game a boy and his dog
you travel through four different worlds using magic spells created by mixing ingredients
while traveling through worlds your dog changes from a big pitbull to a greyhound to a poodle to a flying toasteri strongly reccomend to an adventure game fan because the storyline is great the bosses are badass the weapons are cool and are not too hard to upgrade and the worlds are fun
you can also trade in some locationsthis game is absolutely amazing so i give a shout to the makersthis is the type of game to play on a rainy saturday afternoon when youre in the mood to quietly sneak off into another dimension and heroically save the world there all by yourselfor at least with your superpowerful dogsecret of evermore takes you into one of these secret dimensions
i dont know if its the fact that im a musician and serious musiclover but for some reason the music in this game seemed to have an incredibly powerful effect and actually set most of the atmosphere
the low occurrence of dialogue compared to most other adventure games too as well as the fact that you only control one human character and a dog that only barks occasionally actually made this feel like a completely private very introspective game
the story was unique and interesting taking you through the best possible settings they could have provided for each time period ie a pyramid next to an archaeological camp a castle enclosed by a peasant town and a lush forest etc
 but you could also play this game just to relax
one of the great features is the ability to collect alchemy ingredients for magic spells which can be sniffed out by your canine companion and then collected with the press of a button
you wouldnt believe how oddly therapeutic it is to do this for hours on end while listening to laidback eerie deep or mysteriously distantsounding instrumental themes that match your surroundings
the battles are also particularly fun partly because they are not done on a different screen but also due to the elastic sometimes goofy animations of your characters
there is plenty of comedy and sarcasm in the dialogue too i loved for example being told by a palace guard not to play in the crater created by my defeat of one of the bosses
two of the forms taken by the dog are also amusingi wont reveal much of the plot since it isnt particularly complicated or long but all in all this game is great though you can get sucked into it if youre not careful
the quiet haunting intro theme is enough to leave you feeling as though you too like your character might possibly get sucked into an alternate dimensionunfortunately the soundtrack is no longer commercially available for purchaseonly ffix and chrono trigger are better rpgsinstead of clogging you with a bunch of characters some clearly inferior to others you get two a boy and his dog
the dog is a powerhouse and the boy can do magic
this is the best magic system ever you but your ingredients and you can keep casting the spell as long as you have the right stufflevelingup is not too terribly difficult and you have a nice stratgeic capability deciding which weapon is the right one for the jobplus crush the greatest spell eversony needs to reissue this game and ff mystic quest onto the ps format immediatelyyou can hate me or love me for saying that i think that this was the best action rpg for the snes
all of the little annoyances in secret of mana seemed to be fixed in this gamefirst you only have  levels for your weapons
its nice not to have to power up for  minutes to unleash a strong attack
second your dog actually has an ai brain and doesnt do annoying things like the sprite from mana like getting stuck behind objects every two minutes
third the script is funny and gives the hero a personality i loved the cheesy bmovie references
fourth the alchemy system is superb i enjoyed digging around for ingredients and budgeting money between weapons armor items and ingredients
fifth the game is difficult not impossible just a little harder than secret of manawhat surprises many is learning that an american team made this game
yes not the japanese companyill try not to reveal too much so ill keep this as short and sweet yet as informative as i can
rarely will a game come along that you can relate to so closely
your everyday normal guy gets blasted into a land called evermore
evermore is constantly changing and if you watch this you will get whats going on
with all the twists and turns and probably one of the most believable games you will play
evermore really feels like you are in the game
aside from that this game was made by squaresoft of america and so if you havent played this pick it upah secret of evermore
this game was only hurt by the mere fact that it was before its timei find it funny how most people think somsoe because in todays world people hate jrpgsall the western humor in this game is simply classic
its a shame that this game will probably never see a rereleasefor the record i owned secret of mana way back in its day
i was never fortunate enough to own a copy of soe but always found it to be the more enjoyable of the twothanks for this game i love it very much plys very much on the well side again i thank you very much for this gamethis game is crazy i love it
great rpg
would suggest purchasing if you are in to the rpg type gamesthis is a game i was introduced to back in  after it came out at a friends house
it is put together a lot like secret of mana graphics and all
it has the same item ring design and the characters are similar
the music like manas is one thing i remember the most about this game i find it to be haunting though i cant put it on equal footing with secret of mana
for one thing it is a singleplayer game
you cant play it with a friend and the story is not quite as deep
its actually predictable
you can assume from the beginning the boy is going to go home
all in all though it is still one of my alltime favorite games from this period in my lifeits plot is cliche the gameplay is almost like a dumbed down version of secret of mana it can be very grindy at times its music is forgettable and its only meant for  player
despite all of that i absolutely love this game
i cant tell exactly what it is about this game that made me fall in love with it so much
its by no means original and its definitely not for everyone but this is one of my favorite snes games of all time
one thing i think this game does brilliantly is its use of ambience
no other snes game has perfected that aspect like secret of evermore has
in fact the ambience is done so well in this game it even rivals some of todays games in this aspect
from the moment you boot up the game to the time it ends you really feel completely engrossed in this world like you actually are the character you play lost in a big unfamiliar world
exploration is a key factor of gameplay as it is very fun to explore every nook and cranny the game has to offer
there are few things in video games that i love more than being dropped in the middle of a foreign land and figuring out the directions on my own
because of this the soundtrack is filled mostly with ambient noise rather than actual music tracks but combined with the world you run around in this works beautifullyif you want to play this only for the story you wont be impressed
if youre wondering about the gameplay its an action rpg very similar to secret of mana and no its not a sequel to that game
this game is all about feeling lost and exploring the world at hand
if you play this game with that in mind you will have a much better experiencefast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
a reminds me a little of secret of mana but without as good of a story and the two games are totally unrelatedif you enjoy snes style rpgs then you will love secret of evermore
i loved playing the game so much that i made a guide for it
i had way more fun playing this game than secret of mana or chrono trigger
i think peoples favorites are in the timing of when they played the game having said this this game would be fun anytime
i really liked the storyline and the way it looked the music along with one of the best gaming experiences i have ever had
it is a huge world with so much to do and seeplay this game you will be happy you didthis game resembles secret of mana in so many ways 
but this isnt a bad thing
that game had one enjoyable battle system evermores is that with the twists of alchemy and currency
alchemy was a unique system that required one to gather ingredients for the casting of a certain spellthe more powerful requiring much rarer items in higher quantities
this intrigued me to no end in soes heyday and still conjures faint chills of nostalgia upon reflection
i mention currency because the fact that money types changed was for some indescribable reason very cool
it didnt mean much to the overall game experience but its very existence was so unique that i very much enjoyed it
finally there is a shop relying almost solely upon barter in the gameyou have to trade numerous items to acquire special relics that enhance you power or skill
this is a though not required helpful diversion and serves to add a little more innovative flair to an already shining game
this isnt the only source of these relics but many can be obtained there
if an action rpg sporting a solid battle system unique humor reliant on made up movies and a diverse twist on magic are your thing then this game delivers a  star experiencethis western rpg uses pretty much the same actionrpg mechanics as secret of mana except for replacing the traditional mpfueled magic system with an alchemy system that runs off of ingredients
you control a boy and his dog who must travel through a world split into distinct regions a prehistoric region an egyptlike area and a medieval setting
eventually you must travel to a futuristic environment for the final confrontations
the ai pathing and behavior works much better than in secret of manafor those of you that may have been mislead this is not a castlevania ripoff
this is a classic series that should not be ignored
also you are a wimp if you complain about the control scheme
the trilogy originally for the nes is here for super nes and with excellent resultsthe graphics are generally the same and have been improved in many areas
the sound and music also got an uplift
they also added a password system to this and it makes it a lot easierlets face it these three games are some of the best nes games ever made
sure theyre hard but you know what
these were made back in the day when nintendo games kicked your  and made you love them
ninja gaiden was no exception and it ranks as one of the best nes games ever
to have it along with its sequels onto one cartridge and improved is awesome pure and simplemy only complaint is that they let the buttons a is jump b is attack stay like the nes rather than shift it to the super nes style which wouldve made y the attack button and b the jump button
however it doesnt detract from the game and to rate this game lower because of that would be frivolous
i give this  stars simply put because all three ninja gaiden games are milestones in video gaming historyi was very excited when this game was released
it combined one of my all time favorite nes games into a trilogy of greatness
the port to the snes is almost exactly the same as the originalsninja gaiden is a classic and a hard one to beat at that
the second and third games arent quite as difficult and still deliver a great gaming experience
i loved going back through these games reliving my childhood experiences
it is just as i remembered graphics and alli must admit i was wishing that tecmo would have improved the graphics but after a few trips down memory lane i was hooked back on one of my favorite series
the action is just as intense as ever and the music is sweet
the cinemas have been redrawn as well
the effect of the new graphics will make you drool
if only tecmo worked on the rest of the game
three games on one cart is a great deal
for those of you who missed out try playing these classics
you wont regret itthis shows what the snes was capable of compact wise
being able to fit three games in one is excellent
it has a quality to it not seen in some games todaythe graphic upgrade makes the game memorable
more detail to certain levels and cinema enhances are worth the price alonethe music however was slightly altered
some i dont mind most of the stuff form ninja gaiden  but act  in ninja gaiden  was a big dissapointmentthe challenge was altered only for certain levels
thus it makes some games a little easier
also another welcome is unlimited continues added to buy this game just do soif you dont know this by now hear meninja gaiden rocksplay ng  ng sigma ng black on  downloads and all the restyou cannot find a better series
it cannot be donei remember the first time i played primal rage it came off as a clone of mortal kombat since that was the grand dadddy of all fighting games at the time and huge
you play as a group of dinosaurs that are about to get wiped off the face of the earth by a metor that is about to hit planet earth ending all life  you know
you battle it out as either blizardchaosape diablosaurontrex vertigoserpant snake vodoo lizard armadonspinosarus or talonraptor
each dinosaru has special moves and finishing moves like mortal kombat where they can perform fatalities on your opponents
its a fun game that lets you chose your animal and take out  your anger on other animalswish there were more characters but its ok i guess
the game is not hard once you know your character an learn the moves
one of the top fighting games of snesbattletoads series has always been one of the better ones the problem is all of there games are always hard
it took me many an hours to finally beat these battletoads games but a great game whether you can beat the whole thing or not
definitely worth the price of admissionif you played it  years ago you probably are getting it just like me
what a tripthis game is good in capturing the shows feel
its sick twisted and still fun
when your gwar tickets get eaten puked back up and sent through a lawnmower you got to track down each piece
in doing so you explore the town that beavis and butthead lives in and interact with many familure faces if you watch the show
fun yet hard game to beat
love it none the less worth the buy no matter if youre probeavis and butthead or notvery very fun side scrolling action great gameit has quite a challenge to it and is an addicting game once picked up you cant set it downmost games based on tv shows or movies suck but not this onegraphics very cartoony and detailed
clean and crispmusic rockin and stylishsound very good voices and soundsstory beavis and butthead have tickets to a gwar concert
mr andersons poodle takes them and runs to his yard
the dog then pukes them out and mr anderson mows the tickets with the mower
now they must find the ticket pieces to see their concert
a simple yet fun storygameplay challanging
play as beavis or butthead and go through worlds fighting enimies and solving  puzzles in order to get your gwar ticket pieces
funif you have a genesis you need to get this
also try to get a factory sealed game
it has a posterbeavis and butthead is better on sega than it is on super nintendo
this game is the best oldschool game ever
whoever buys the game on nintendo is stuped
they shouldnt have put the game on super nintendo because it is really cool on sega
beavis and butthead on sega rulesthis game maybe hard but with game genie codes it is alot easier to play and i really enjoy this game alot and my main favorite bevaise and butthead game ever made my friend and i played it together and we both had alot of fun with it and we both beat it and really enjoyed this was the first beavis and butthead game i have ever played and really still have a blast playing it to this day and i have beaton this game alot because of the game genie codes for the sega genesis is why but i really recommend this game to anybody who is a fan of beavis and butthead i like the burp and fart effects in this game which is very funny this game rocks and it is just awesome to play for being almost  years old i wish they would make a newer beavis and butthead game for the ps from the new season that cameout in  that would be very funny and awesome as wellthis game is so dumb that it is fun if you love bevis and butthead you have to get this thenthis game brings back alot of great memories to me from when i was a kid
the gameplay is intresting and the graphics are awesome
it even has the original theme song from the show
beavis and butthead the gameis funaddictingand a great trip down memory lanei dont really care for cases or boxes because i need room for shelves and cases that carry discs or cartridges
the game came completely unharmed and it played perfectly
originally i had this game but was supposed stolen but didnt matter as it was bought used before i got a replacementbeavis and butthead is a fun game you have to go around town and collect your gwar concert tickets that the next door neighbors dog chewed up take my word this game is awesomeits beavis and buttheadsure its not the greatest game but if you are a fan check it outi really enjoy this game alot for the snes i really think it is alot of fun to play very enjoyable fun game for the snes i would give this game a  out of  for the snes and the sega genesis version a  out of  for me because to me it is more fun play than the snes version but i still like this version for the snes as well i cannot believe this game will be  years old in  and so will the sega genesis version of this awesome game as well but yeah the snes version is still a very fun an enjoyable game to play for the snes i have beaton this game as well only with game genie cheats as well because this game is hard as well so anyway this game is great to have in your snes collection and it is also great to have in your sega genesis collection as welli didnt to see a lot of these guys when i was younger but i did have the videogame
back then it was the first time id ever seen something so crazy as two teenagers trying to get pictures of themselves doing stupid things they thought were cool in order to get into a gwar concert
which is the premise of coursethose unfamiliar with beavis and butthead simply need to know two things  theyre idiots
and  they are so renowned for their stupidity and penchant for mayhem that everyone in their town of highland is out to stop themfrom cops to their neighbors all the way up to their teachers and the very birds in their neighborhoodpeople familiar with the show and very familiar with the episodes might recognize a few elements borrowed from certain episodes
the game borrows heavily off of seasons  and  of beavis and butthead with the most references being made to the episode babes r us the boxing glove on a bat the way they are slammed by their legs by buzzcut and other references coming from episodes like couch fishing and lawn and garden
characters like daria stewart and van driessen are your punching bagsallies whilst principal mcvicker buzzcut mr anderson todd and earl are like your nonfriends huh huhthe difficulty of the game depends on your familiarity with the controls and also whether or not you alternate characters
pressing the a button when both characters are together makes butthead thrust beavis into the air which comes in handy avoiding large obstacles
by switching characters at the exact right moment you can avoid getting any damage in entire levels
there are some levels in which you cant switch like in highland high school when you chicken fight beavis sits on buttheads shoulders with a bat and has to pummel enemies and balls
yeah
i said it
theres also a section or two in the game where butthead pushes a cart or gurney and beavis sits on it firing either a water gun or an iv
bag akin to a fastpaced version of rtype with morons instead of a cool spaceship you can upgradeyou can interact with the items and props in the background search for weapons and food and even get quarters from phones for vending machines
you can play arcade machines in turbo mall  which is ehhhhh but still fun and on top of that when you press the l button when both characters are a person away you can smack the other characternot perfect but fun as hell and highly recommended for the gameridiot savant inside you
now go and pick up a copy
like right now
do it
heh heh hehthis was purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday weekend i had her check it out
everything works just fineordered it because i remember how much fun it use to be and it is still a realy good game thats a classicthe lion king was pretty fun at first i thought it was going to be boring but it ended up to be pretty fun
kids of all ages will like this gameif you liked this game check out the other lion king games out therei do still have a super nintendo
i believe it was the best system of its day and i still enjoy playing games on it
the games such as this one are really good even when compared to todays games
this game in particular brings back fond memories  i was first introduced to this game at a dentists office it was one of the games you could play in a small room while you waited for your turn
it was second only to a sonic the hedgehog game as my favorite game to play in there
my mom saw me playing it and thought that young simba was so cute she bought it for me
its harder for younger kids than older kids as it was more challenging for me back then then it is now
still i can remember when i first got past the hakuna matatta level and simba became an adult it felt quite magical to control a young cub in the first several levels and then see and control him as an adult in the rest
beating the be prepared level and defeating scar were also proud accomplishments
the bonus levels were fun my favorite being the pumba one and even when i did finish the game i played it over and over and over
i did however never leave the easy difficulty blushes
still this is a wonderful game with many pros and no cons i can think of
if your mom hasnt already gotten you this and you still have a super nintendo then you need to get this game for your collectionthe lion king is a snes game made by virgin interactive entertainement
this is probably one of the hardest platformers on the snes
the game does however has a level select cheat and an invincibility cheat
but if you dont use them then this is one hard gamethe game of course is based on the  disney film and the levels follow the events of the movie
you have to quickly master the controls of this game and you have to learn to jump and grab onto rocks and ledges
once you learn the basics it isnt too hard but some of the levels are really complicated and the things you have to do are sometimes not obvious at all
but a lot of people love that kind of challenge and so did ithis a beautiful game to look at and it has great gameplay and amazing graphics
but if anyone decides to play this game i highly recommend you use a walkthrough
i like this game a lot and i was happy to have finished itone of the best video games based of of a movie for its time
the lion king is for children but there are some parts that can take some time to get past
i would suggest this for anyone
when i was a kid this was my favorite game as a kid and it is still a good game nowi just love this game
not only did it entertain me years ago during a time of video games with disappointing graphics it is very cute and will keep you busy for hours
any fan of snes needs to try it outi used to love this game back in the day of snes it was very easy to play and very fun and the graphics looked pretty good for snesbought the game for my granddaughter and she loves the game
plays it all the time
fun game to watch as wellthe formula for this game is simple  solve one mindnumbingly hard puzzle after another until you beat the game  simpleunlike any of the final fantasy suikoden breath of fire wild arms etc there is norandom monster battles every  seconds
experience points
a bevy of partymembers to mix n match and constantly upgrade
complicated and numerous menus to learn and navigatethe legend of zelda of the super nintendo era is the only game that plays like this one
why do they not make more games like this one
the game is hard yet the formula is simpleyou will most assuredly need the cheatbook to get through to the end  it is that hardthough the graphics are simplistic by most any standard they are still welldone and convey what they are intended to a fantasy world populated by friendly villagers and homey houses
the story is well thought out and interesting alsothe monsters and bosses are mostly easy  it is the puzzles that will impede your progressthis game is fun because it really makes you think
the pure unmitigated joy of solving  or  puzzles in a row wout using the cheatbook is fantastic
and when finally admitting defeat while stuck at a particulary vexing puzzle you will read the solution in the cheatbook and then shake your head in annoyance at the simplicity of the answer and ask yourself why didnt i figure that out myselfthe answer was so obvious
high kudos for this obscure little game and a wish that more rpgs followed alundras winning formula of less is morefinishing alundra was so hard it wasnt as fun as it could have been
i have never played a game where periodically i would think well i guess this is as far as i go so many timesthe director yasuhiro ohhori wanted to make a game you could play not just have a good story line
he wanted a game that the player felt at the end of it that they accomplished something
i do feel that and i had two guides to help me
the puzzles where just too crazy hard and they could have made the jumping easierthis game is as near flawless as any i can think of
not only does it offer an incredible challenge puzzles platforming bosses but it has one of the most memorable storylines everfinally a true answer to melodrama has been found
working designs penned a storyline that was fully based on the concept of melodramapeople die left and rightbut it does it in a way that is actually believable
said drama doesnt seem a cheap attempt to instill sympathy or emotion into the storythe story is based in dreamwalking
namely alundra is the dreamwalker the only at the beginning and has the responsibility of saving many people trapped in potentially and many times deadly nightmares
this concept had me hooked from the beginningthe action is reminiscent of zelda though it has enough individualism to seem as no ripoff
through the use of numerous weapons spells and items alundra will traipse through enemyladen dungeons solve perplexing puzzles and unravel the mystery of death hanging over the fragile village inoanot much to grip about aside from a few collision so minor as to be nigh undectable problems and some unfairly difficult jumps
the collision may have also been my fault for the control is picturesque in its perfectionblaming the game for a screwup is only reflective of your own mistake in this game anywaythe difficulty is considerable requiring much skillful button manipulation and avid attention
a definite must play for the underchallenged gamers out therei dont know how people can get bored of this game
i love it and i could play it for hours
its really fun and needs to be released onto newer consolesto me this is the best version of ms pacman to date
it holds  true to the classic
that is if you want it to
you are givin alot of options which allow you to play on different types of mazes
there are big ones mini ones strange ones amp classic ones too
i liked the strange mazes there was even a maze that hardly had any walls and ms pacman was out of control
it was cool though
the two player mode is great
you and another player can clear a maze together or alternating
but be careful if you play simultaneously you run the risk of bumping into one another this sends you both flying in opposite directions
in this case you could easily go flying into a ghost and lose a life
with all that being said remember if you just want to play the classic original its all here in this one super game pack
where would we all be if ms pacman didnt swallowyoud probably mistake this as just another regular cartridge port of ms pacman but if you did then you couldnt be more wrongthe sounds are taken straight from the arcade gamethe graphics are actually made more detailed than how the arcade games graphics arenow for the gameplay theres a lot to talk about
right after the title screen theres tons of options to choose fromplayers   coop  competitive  alternativedifficulty easy normal hard crazypacbooster on off i always choose on for this one
what can beat fast ms
pacman
maze selection my favorite option arcade mini big strangeyou can alter the game with all of those options
the main gameplay is pure ms pacman awesomenessyou cant beat thatunfortunately this game has been overlooked due to the fact that this version was released the same year as the nintendo i remember watching my older brother play this game and i thought it was the coolest thing ever
when i came across it on here i ordered it right away for my brothers christmas giftthe next game in the turok series turok rage wars is acclaims answer to quake  arena and unreal tournament
while it might not have the speed of moving around quite as fast as unreal tournament or the posh visuals of quake  arenaeven with the expansion pak turok rage wars fits the multiplayer fragfest for the console owners quite nicely
it has new weapons and powerups over  maps to play on smarter enemy ai and is one pretty lengthy game to play
ive enjoyed gathering friends together and playing a  player deathmatch or capture the flag game among others
its quite addicting and you can easily waste away hours on the game without even realizing it
if you like to play single player rage wars has that too but expect it to be something of a training session for when you do get into the multiplayer component
besides you have to play single player to unlock player skins and secret charactersdespite its not being quite a quake  arena or unreal tournament i still love turok rage wars
its strength is in its multiplayer modes and that alone is worth getting this game for
you and your friends will love itturok rage wars is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best turok rage wars rocksim a huge fan of the turok series on n
they are fun bloody adventures with some truly inventive weaponry
the first gameturok dinosaur hunter was great with cool weapons loved the alien gun and gory gameplay
the second gameturok  seeds of evil topped the first in every way and is still the pinnacle of the series
the third gameturok  shadow of oblivion was good but kind of a letdown after the masterpiece that was seeds of evil
its a great trilogy of games that lacks one thing quality multiplayer
yeah i know seeds of evil has multiplayer but its halfassed and feels tacked on
i wanted a solid multiplayer game where i could play against my friends and kill them with the wild weapons from the games
then along comes turok rage wars a ridiculously fun game that gives us pure multiplayer carnage with even more overthetop weaponsthe game has a decent single player and coop campaign but the only reason to play it is to unlock more characters and weapons
im focusing solely on the multiplayer aspect because its what defines the game and is a thrilling experience
there are four different modes each with it own set of levels deathmatch team deathmatch capture the flag and frag tag
the first three should be selfexplanatory the fourth turns one player into a monkey who must tag or elude the other human players for a certain amount of time
if they die they respawn as the monkey
if they tag someone or remain alive then someone else turns into the monkey
this mode is silly but can be fun if played on the right level
there is also an option to use bots and play against the computerthe level design ranges from mediocre to brilliant in my opinion
personal preference will dictate which levels youll enjoy depending on your playing style if youre a sniper or an explosives guy like me the open areas are ideal
if youre the aggressive type who likes to get upclose and personal the cramped areas will better suit you
i really dont like the industrialstyle ones they can be poorly laid out and hard to navigate
the best levels are large labyrinthian temples that have numerous paths powerups and secrets areas to duke it out in
some feature exclusive items such as the everpopular cerebral bore or a sentry turret that if placed in the right area can net you tons of effortless kills
many areas have underwater segments that are a blast to fight enemies in and can be used strategically with certain weapons
thankfully theres a skip map option that selects a new level if you dont like the current onethe weapon selection is second only to turok  the amount of badass new weapons here is awesome
they include a flare gun that shoots deadly radioactive flares it sounds stupid but works surprisingly well a freeze gun so you can run around spouting icerelated puns agrave lamr
freeze a napalm gel stickybomb launcher the chestburster that implants an alien fetus which will burst out of the opponents chestalienstyle unless they find a powerup the emaciator which shrinks the enemy until theyre thin and frail and my favorite the inflator which shoots a pocket of air into the opponent and inflates them until they explode
interestingly instead of picking up weapons within the level you select five of the available weapons two bullet two energy and one explosive and then start the game collecting the ammo as you play
youre also equipped with a default melee weapon a warhammer
this affords an interesting strategy to picking your weapons because selecting certain weapons together can be a deadly combination if you have the freeze gun and the inflator you can freeze the enemy solid and then load up the inflator and shoot them while theyre still frozen and defenseless making an easy kill
the levels have powerups that give you a variety of special abilities for a limited amount of time like invincibility massive damage and invisibility
also as mentioned above certain levels have special items to pickup such as the automated turrets and human bear traps that latch onto an opponents footthe character selection is adequate but really opens up once you play through the single player
all the characters have multiple skins to choose from and if you beat the game you can unlock the four boss character to use in multiplayer
the final boss talset has the ability to carry every weapon in the game which is very nifty but can be a hassle when trying to find the weapon youre looking for because they cycle through at random
you can even play as a raptor or other animal species that have special high damage attacks to compensate for not being able to carry weapons
the game also has an award system similar toxbox acheivements orpstrophies that rewards you with medals for various accomplishments such as  kills or  kills in  minutes
it serves no purpose but its neat to browse through and see what medals youve won after playing for a whilethe graphics are good but nothing amazing
the weapon effects look pretty damn cool especially the emaciator which looks like ball lightning
the music is fairly decent mirroring the previous games with a tribalwarrior soundtrack that suits the action nicelymy only real complaint is with the level selection
each mode has its own levels but i wouldve liked to had all the levels available no matter which mode im playing
you end up playing a lot of the same levels multiple times which gets a tad redundanton a side note what the hell is wrong with the newer turok games
the later iterations on more modern consoles seem to have forgotten the series roots and left out what made it fun in the first placeturok evolutionis the main offender
lets hope this is remedied soon with a worthy turok gamebottom line rage wars is an excellent multiplayer game that retains the satisfying gameplay and fun feel of the turok seriesrage wars is extreamly fun
when buddys of mine come over we play it non stop and play to the death
one time we played it for like  hours and we still didnt get bored of itits really good with great weapons to choose from
it isanother great classic from acclaim
the game is no sequali think
but it is a must have for any true turok fanif you liked quake  youll love this gameits so fun and out of controlthe gameplay is greatthe controls are greatthe weapons are beyond awsomeand the graphics are superb for the time that game came outthe secret characters are what get you to keep playing it causeits so friggin exciting
this is a most def if you want to keep this in your collectioni give an athis game is awesome
and is one of the best horror games it takes a while to get in tobut once you doyou will love playing this gameit is a really long game  to  hours with very complex levels and has a great mature story linethe voice acting and story is one of the best i seen in a video gamethe graphics are really good and is the best looking version out of the nps and pcthe music and sound effects are really good and will scare the hell out of youit is one of the most mature game you will ever play and no one under  should play this gamebasically shadowman is a comic and i have not read it but i have owned this game on the playstation  and believe me the graphics on the dreamcast version are better
the tone of the game is really dark and the story is  okay in my opinion and a very good game to play on halloween or during that season
i did put in  to  hours of this game so far but didnt save because i dont have a memory card yet but i can safely tell you that if you enjoyed games like soul reaver on the dreamcast you might enjoy it and usually you can find this game for a reasonable price usedcant really describe it from the look of it its just an ordinary action adventure game with shooting and platforming
but what really got to me was the atmospheremusic and characters
there all strangely intriguing thats not to say the gameplay is not up to par because it is
it plays like a cross between the legend of zelda and soul reaver
so picture a game with dark sinister levels with crazy characters with voice acting and gameplay reminiscent of legend of zelda that what shadow man is
but this review doesnt do the game justice i urge you if you have an dreamcast or a pc give this game a go its a gem and its something youll have to experience yourself
it has flaws that are common in the gameplay genre but its perfectly adamant from start to finish and theres replay value in the collecting department
must have if your a gamer from the sthis was the first game i have ever played and it was an amazing experience
this game truly has it all the story the enemy the monsters the places the items to collect great character 
i have played this game  times already over and over and it does not stops to amaze me how well thought it is
i truly wish there were another game just like it but there is none maybe one dayi own both the playstation  and the dreamcast versions of this game and the differences between the two are night and day
i cant really fault the shortcomings of the ps version given the hardware capabilities of that console it was simply too much game for the box and it suffered as a result but then it must be said that the dreamcast version runs so much smoother and looks several times better graphically
there just is no comparison
shadowman shows off the strengths of the dreamcast better than just about any game designed for itgiven the tragic fate of the dreamcast and segas announcement that they were not going to develop any future consoles only games i remember being extremely frustrated on hearing that because the dreamcast is still a damned good system that had a lot going for it having a  megahertz processor  megs of ram and  megs of video memory incorporating features such as antialiasing i attribute their patch of rough road on the fact that they tried too hard to be the first bit system on the market and that they didnt advertise it nearly as much as sony did for the playstation  this game stands as one of the consoles most epic titlesgameplay starsshadowman is set up on a thirdperson perspective basis
the controls are relatively easy to learn
theyre a little basic compared to todays generation of games but at the time this was one of the most involved games aroundthe format of this title is rather hard to classify
its set up as an actionadventure platformer and all of the combat is realtime but there are so many elements that put it in the realm of a roleplaying game that i hesitate to call it anything else
there is no system of experience points for it that allows you to accrue and improve your abilities or statistics such as strength intelligence or finesse but over the course of the adventure you perform activities and acquire things that up your health your level if it can be called that and grant you additional powers you didnt have at the onset
your gear also gets truly btching after a while particularly in regards to some of the projectile weapons and the magical voodoo artifacts you end up acquiring
as you improve so does the challenge level not only in puzzles or the number of creatures you might face in an area but in the type some spirits of which are undoubtedly tougher than the areas original inhabitants
theres also the length of the game
at the time of the dreamcasts presence on the market the average game length was around  to  hours
its possible to log in over  hours on this one before seeing its end
not only are the domains you roam around in large enough and convoluted enough to get lost in easily when you improve your powers you can backtrack and explore places that werent previously accessible adding an additional level of depth to an already deep game
you dont sit down an expect to finish shadowman in a day or two even if you have that kind of time
key word  patiencestory starsthe game itself is based on the longtime running comic book series also titled shadowman and its theme is as dark as it gets
it aint your kids saturday morning cartoon show
you play michael leroi french for the king
hes a daytime cab driver nighttime savior of liveside the name used to refer to the world as we know it
hes angstridden in the extreme and has ample reason to be so
the backstory is  after accidently causing the death of his kid brother before giving up on life and falling into the gutter mikes been tricked into his role of protector of liveside by a hundred yearold mambo priestess who looks like shes about twenty voodoo magic man
who infuses his body with the skull of shadows
this artifact transforms him into a fearsome undead creature at night unable to truly die bound to do the priestesss bidding whenever she commands it
for payment he gets a little somethin somethin on the side if you know what i mean which in turn helps her to keep her youthful appearance
resigned to his fate and not really wanting to turn down a little horizontal aerobic exercise he takes up the mantle of hero unthanked and unloved by a largely unknowing societybefore the turn of the twentieth century one of the most notorious serial killers known for his day jack the ripper prepares to commit the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of his art
his hand is stayed by the appearance of an avatar in the form of a welldressed man bearing a cane with a powerful haunting voice and blood streaming from his mouth legion who is possibly the angel of death possibly something else
he commissions jack to construct an enormous engine of destruction designed to usher in the end of all things liveside in the only place it can possibly be built deadside the place we all go to when we depart our mortal coil
jack agreesfast forward to the present
its a hot summer night in new orleans and shadowman is laying in bed with his priestess lover when she starts to receive disturbing visions and sees this as a sign of dark things coming
she sets shadowman on a mission to rectify things
he begins his trek starting out through the lonely twists and turns of deadsidethe story that shadowman encompasses is one of the most intricate that ive seen in a video game and is worthy of any horror feature film
you end up going against several different serial killers and i have to believe they were modeled on real life examples considering how absolutely twisted each one of them are who have been transformed into heralds of the apocalypse
they are the prophets of darkness and the only way they can be destroyed is when you are in your incarnation of shadowman you cant actually hurt them as mike leroi
the saying goes that sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind and through your quest you make it possible for the coming storm to occur in order to be able to halt itsound starsthe differences between the ps version of this game in sound as opposed to the dreamcast port are unbelievable
the higher amount of channels results in a much crisper clearer richer productionthe voice acting is awesome
the characters come across as natural reallife humans or demons as the case may be
the sound effects are not overdone and simply add to the ambience to add to your unease as you wander around a derelict apartment a prison the bayou and the dark corridors of deadsidethe music score is vintage voodoo african fare where applicable
there are some downright creepy tracks such as one that starts out as a music box jingle with a baby laughing in the background progressively getting worse as the baby starts screaming and a dentists drill whirring and splatter sound effects are introduced as it continues to playgraphics starsacclaim touted the introduction of the vista engine at the core of their graphics design for this game which enabled you to see all the way to the horizon with no visual popups or fade in
the hardware strength of the dreamcast allows the game to take full advantage of the engines capabilities without the framerate choppiness thats present in the ps version
the visuals might seem a little dated there were no true physics in games up to that point and for a little way past so everything reacted in the same fashion compared to what the current generation of consoles can put out but at the time they were second to none when considering shadowmans scope
the moodiness of the graphics also only serves to enhance the edginess that this game exhibitsreplay starsgranted it is the same game each time you go through it and with the dearth of online play some might consider the replay lacking but online gaming was just coming into its own back then so i cant really take marks off for that
also the length of time coupled with the stuff you get to do make shadowman worth more than one playthroughoverall starsthis was one of the first truly adultthemed games for a console and with the length of research the developers went through for example they visited gardell county jail in texas and toured it they said the staff was very gracious and more than helpful going so far as to provide them with blueprints to the facility to aid in the levels design to bring this game to life its worth more than one time around if youre in the mood for a few chills
its a shame acclaim went under because this game marked them as one to watch
two thumbs upthe dual strike is the best controller ever made for firstperson perspective
im currently playing deus ex and am able to crawl around shoot and gather with great precision because of this controllers unique twohanded motion
ive found it ergonomic no sore fingers and natural to use
plus it lets you program any function to any buttons
truly a welldesigned productive been aware of myst for around  years now but never got to play it until now when i bought this  masterpiece edition
but for many years i saw pictures of this game like in magazines and i thought the game was worth buying for just the graphics
well it has much more than just graphics going for it
never having played the original from  what i do know is masterpiece edition has improved graphics and features
its nice to see a rated e game thats fun to play
its the kind of game even recommended to those who think video games have contributed to the downfall of american society
its also truly a recommended game if you are sick and tired of those slasher or shoot em up games
the game is stuffed with puzzles where you have to open up secret passages look for clues activate a spaceship a tree elevator or whatever in order to look for missing pages from a book
the only drawback is some of the quests are a bit on the tedious side
but to make things easier just write down clues on paper writting some of this stuff on paper would help save time some of it is crucial
this package also comes with a screensaver with soundtrack cd
if you like the music from the game enough then you have this cd to hear the music on a regular cd player
as for the game itself the graphics are wonderful and in many places are quite realistic of course there are other scenes that look obviously like computer graphics
im glad to to finally get myst and i look forward to getting the sequelsive been playing the myst games for years they never get old
i left a review for the dvd trilogy boxset for the myst series so i thought i should review each individual game as wellfirst off myst is a classic
of course even with revisions it is completely outdated
but the intrique and spark is still there
beautiful scenery and lush sound
i wouldnt recommend this to first person shooter fans
but im a big first person shooter fan i still find myst to be an excellent adventuredig in and enjoywow
this game is the best game that i have ever played
it requires intelligence common sense and patience
the graphics are amazing and the whole concept of this game is just amazing
you have got to play this game
the sequel riven is even better hard to believe
the newest sequel that just came out is exile
buy them all
this is the best game series of all timeyou really do get the feel of absolute abandon and isolation while playing myst
the graphics may be rather dated now especially compared to the modern graphics in uru and myst iv but its easy to get immersed in the quiet lonely environment and believe your actually there
the sound effects and music are slight and subtle rather than overbearing like in other video gamessince myst the franchise has indeed developed and evolved
people still tend to think of them and point and click slide shows
which isnt very fair
yes myst is this way though it was made  years ago and graphic cards back then were not the frontiers of technology they are todaya lot of patience and intelligence is needed to solve the puzzles and put the clues together
a lot of reading and notetaking is required and those looking for shootemups and violence should look elsewheremyst is indeed a game for the refined gamermy dad got this game for me when it first came out and all we had was an outdated mac
at the time i was too young to understand it and i just threw it on my shelf
a couple of years later i noticed it pulled it out and started playing it
although it ran a bit slowly on the aging  computer i loved it
i loved the puzzles and the beautifully rendered  frames and videos
a couple of years ago i got a new computer and when i  saw myst masterpiece edition i decided to replace my old slow mac version  with the shiny new copy
i wasnt dissapointed
its simply a wonderful  beautifully constructed game
my only complaint  as ive noted in  several other games the graphics on the mac just look smoother and cleaner  for some reason
but it is still an amazing game on the pcive just completed the myst masterpiece edition game and found it thoroughly engrossing
while not familiar with the original edition certainly the masterpiece edition boasts arresting visuals and haunting  music
the major part of mysts draw is its puzzles some of which are  fiendishly difficult but this edition has a digital guide which can step  in with some assistance when needed
while making too much use of this  feature would undoubtedly take the fun out of the game every now and then  it can help keep you from becoming totally stuck and frustrated
this game  tests your powers of observation memory intuition and reasoning in an  entertaining context and solving one of the games tough puzzles on your  own is a satisfying payoffwhen i picked up myst iii to be played who knows when  i have a fiveyear backlog the package also contained myst and riven
i first play myst about  years ago so i decided to load up and play it
the masterpiece edition is updated with better graphics and some hints but no new content and ran in windows  with the windows compatibility mode with no problems
because i replayed the game in about ten hours or so it is difficult to meaningfully comment on gameplay
secret doors and the infamous underground railway give most players the hardest time and i will admit having problems on the railway
anyone having problems can google for hints and tipsregardless of difficulties myst is one of best games ever made especially for casual players
i rarely give five starsthere are very experiences in this world that are completely original
in terms of adventure pc gaming however myst is utterly without equal and if you are the right kind of person will quickly become one of the most endearing experiences of all your entertainment pastimesbefore myst computer gaming usually was in the form of either firstperson shooters wolfenstein adventures aimed more towards children kings quest and the tons and tons of sharewarepongsimulator games that flooded the market in the earlytomid s
in myst though gamers are simple dropped into an environment where little to no information is given to them thus requiring much exploring and a logical mind to determine not only the overall point of the game but also how all the levers and puzzles work in conjunction with each otherfor a basic plot summary you the stranger suddenly appear in a universe where a man named atrus can pen books that actually spring to life
however many of his worlds are dyingunstable and you must determine the cause
is it atrus himself who has gone mad and imprisoned his sons in his own prison books or are the sons locked away for good reason
the stranger must explore a series of five islands and piece together the mystery one puzzle and logical deduction at a timethis myst series is not for everyone by any means
if you are a bit lacking in patience and want a lot of action this is not the game for you
it can get a bit tedious at times and one has to resist especially nowadays when walkthroughs are available with a few mouse clicks the urge to look up hints all the time as that truly destroys the beauty of the experience so if you want to be blasting baddies or wreaking warhavoc look elsewhere are the risk of severe disappointmentfor those who really appreciate this kind of thinkingpersons game myst is unrivaled and i have tried many of its subsequent clones in the industry because of its riveting storyline
a lot of other games have tried to duplicate the puzzling style of myst but only myst has been able to successfully capture the emotion of compelling characters that never seem to get oldoverall i consider myst to be one of my alltime favorite pc games because of its groundbreaking intuitive style
in hindsight at least two of its sequels surpass this original but myst is always special because it set the groundwork for the master series
if you want your brainwits to be more involved in a pc game than your trigger finger then i strongly recommend myst if you havent tried it to this point
if you can let yourself become immersed in its worlds you will get hookedi have played a lot of games
i can tell you that soldier of fortune is one of a kind
some may disagree with me but i say that its the first realistic first person shooter next to maybe half life
i love the fact  that if you shoot a guy in the leg he hops around on one leg and head  shots are automatic death
i love the fact that when you cut a guy there  are actual slice marks and not bullet holes or nothing at all
i love the  fact that there are actual weapons to choose from instead say a worm  shooter made out of an aliens spleen
not to mention the great story line
when i look at a game like this compared to say quake  i think why am  i so bored with quake
the reason is this quake s single player  stinks if you want to enjoy it and many other games like it you need a  cable modem and play a decent deathmatch
however soldier of fortunes  single player mode was very well thought out with a planned storyline
the  effect and suspense that the levels create is sometimes spooky i am  always catching myself tilting or moving my head so i can try to peek  around that corner so i can see the bad guy and then jumping when he  appears behind me
if you want a game that doesnt require a cable modem to  enjoy the game soldier of fortune is a good betfolks i have played em all
and i can tell you that soldier of fortune is one of a kind
some may disagree with me but i say that its the first realistic first person shooter next to maybe half life
i love the fact  that if you shoot a guy in the leg he hops around on one leg and head  shots are automatic death

if you want a game that doesnt require a cable modem to  enjoy the game soldier of fortune is a good betthis is a game like quake but with an awesome single player game coupled with a fun multiplayer experience
sofs ghoul system which has  quotgorequot points makes for a game of blood violence and fun
players reactions differ but can be quite repetitive after a while
shoot them in the hand their hands fall off shoot them in the head their  heads blow off you get the picture  the only gripe i can think of is the  lack of multiplayer servers
unlike quake with my  ping im stuck with  pings in the range of     lets hope more servers are put up in the  futuresof is by far the greatest d shooter to come out since halflife
no d shooter even comes close to beating it out except for the already mentioned halflife
the game plunges you right into the action you dont have any  long introduction or anything you bust out into the sewers and blow the  snot out of a new york subway gangthe violence level in this game is  a major plus
you can blast your enemies anywhere and they will do  anything from having their heads explode to grabbing their manhood and  moaning all in an extremely realistic manner
they even limp around if  shot in the leg which was a really cool effect considering that that is  how it should be
then if you shoot them in the arms or legs with a big  weapon they will no longer be attached to the enemies torso
unforunately gibbing left something to be desired but it is made up for  with the exit woundsthe multiplayer game is slow and the long load  times make this a game that surely is not for the multiplayer fanatic
the  single player game is on the edge of perfection
while not as deep as  halflife this is a very realistic story about  missing nukes and a  personal vendetta that really seems to be at the end but then you are in a  whole new level with a long load time as usual but it is well worth itoverall this is a game that no gamer should be without
this game  truly shines in single player and if you ever get into multiplayer after  the load times the realistic deathmatch mode is greati have played almost every st person shooter out there
when halflife came around it blew all the rest away
when ut came out it took the lead
move over you guys
a new ones in now
sof
the best one of them  all
this game has everything that a st person fan will love
realistic  violence great storyplot and tons of nonstop action
if you thought  roguespear was good this is your next game
this out of all games is  definitly a game of the year on my listfirst thing i have to say is everyone who mentions half life in a review is a moron
i admit that game is good but if you like it so much what are you doing playing a new game
sorry if this offends you but this game is not supposed to be half life
thank yousecond i love this game
the  graphics and the story is pretty good
the ghoul system is great because  you can shoot different parts of the body
i love when i play games and  shooting a guy in the head will cause more damage then a shot in the arm
that is just common sense
but what if i shoot them in the foot
they  will still be hurt and probably hop around like mad in real life as in this  gamethe story is great
you have to see it to understand but yes it is  the usual mad guy who wants to blow up the world
the problem is that that  story is used alot in hollywood but not nearly enough in gamesthe  sound is ok but nothing specialand finally the gameplay makes you feel  like a soldier of fortune not a infinate strength grunt
you play this  game alone there is no help from a partner in the single player
also  you can have only a number of guns in your back pack and a number of items
plus there are many different factors on the skill levels
each level is  progressivly harder
and then there is the sound issue
if you shoot  rockets at everyone wont they notice
well not in most games
but in the  hardest two difficulties you will notice you have to try to be quiet which  is hard but possible  that is what makes this game  the innovation in  gameplay
look beyond the blood and see innovation which have never been  done beforethanksive been rather dissopointed with the lack of post xmas quality games
thief  and swat  have been worthy purchases and i was so glad the see the best fps game of the year so farsof
the best fps since unreal  tournment some months ago this game is shades of kingpin and goldeneye
unlike kingpin though if you took away the gore this will still be a  brilliant game
its not the gore that makes it altough its pervsersly  enjoyable
the story line is good took me about  hours gaming time to  complete and the levels are very varied
from snow to desert to new york  city it doesnt get boring
there are cut scenes rather than the free  flowing storylines of half life and system shock  but great weapons and  great graphicsgameplay make this a worthy purchace
excellant training to  get you going brilliant sniper rifle abilty to lean round corners  ability to shoot and cut limbs of dead opponants
not for the fiant hearted  but brilliand none the less
let me go shoot someone in the goolies then  blow his head off one more time
 no i am not a masacistthis game is everything a piece of plastic could hold guns exotic locations blood gore and tons of moving targetsif you get what i mean
sure this game is not for the sensitive nonviolent type but for people like me who could even eat through it its everything you ever wanted
there are unique places you can shoot people
shoot the guy in the leg and  he screams in pain
if you whip out a shot gun and shoot the guy in the  head there will be no head
shotgun in the limbs the guy is limbless
shoot him in the groin well id hate to be him
and even more shots but i  wont spoil it
well this game is worth the price all i could do is try to  convince you to buy this game
you are only cheating yourself if you waste  the money on another gamebest way you could spend your gaming dollarwhen the demo of thi game came out i was pumped
then i playedthe demo a bit dissapointed
so i had a few extra bucks to spend so ibought sof
was i dissapointed
heck nothis game is cutting edge technology
using an upgraded version of the quakeiii engine ghoul it gives the most splended graphics any game has had so far
there are many weapons
a lot of weapons you must actually slavage off the battlefield
most weapons deliver a massive punch and some dont
each one is very fun to play around with esspecially the heavy machine gun if youve played the demo and seen the cut scene the soldiers dressed in black have them
multiplayer isnt anything special and it shouldnt really interest anyone
one thing i found rather interesting about this game is that when you have a feeling that you are going to beat the game some guy coms up with more objectives and you go on some more suicide missions
overall this game is a super game and it should se the benchmark for any fpss coming out in the near and far future
endthis is the best
blow arms legs heads and you know whats off
this is a great shooter
there is no better action st person shooter on the market thats for sure
though it does lack a good overall story line and is a  fairly easy and short game to beat its still a whole lot of fun
lots of  weapons and enemys and inocents too
though your not supposed to shoot  civies i like this game because unlike rogue spear you dont fail the  mission for shooting them
overall i give sof  stars this is one to  havequite possibly the most fun to be had on the gbc
the fact that you can save and pick up your game at a later date is a great featurethis is an excellent pinball game
you get two different tables red and blue and a nice variety of targets lanes and other special shotsthe small size of the gameboy screen is compensated for by having the pinball table be twice as high as the screen
the screen automatically moves from  one half to the other of the table in order to follow the ball
i found  this a little bit confusing at first but very quickly adapted to it
the  tables are designed so that this doesnt really get in the way of gameplay
the ability to quotnudgequot or shake the table to change where the  ball is going is well done youll need to build up skill in when and how  much to nudge if you want to get good at the gamei was dubious about  the rumble feature but i found it to be kind of fun  you feel many of the  bounces that the ball makes with your gameboy buzzing and vibrating in your  hand
i didnt find that it distracted me from the game if you dont like  it or arent in the mood just remove the battery from the game  cartridgeand oh yeah theres pokemon in the game
if you dont know  anything about pokemon dont worry knowledge of pokemon is not important  for playing the game
if you are into pokemon during the game you get  chances to capture various different ones over time you build up a  collection of them
you dont really use the collection for anything but  it is fun to keep track of which you do and dont have and its exciting  when you manage to capture a rare onethis game is still fun and addictive but it is lacking in content
you can catch every single pokemon of the original set and evolve them and all that but obviously its not that easy
especially third evolutions and suchit is a lot of fun though and if you leave it laying around in an old gameboy color your friends are bound to pick it upthis is a very fun gameits probably one of the first pinball video gamesi like ityou will tooeven if youre not a pokemon fani love pokemon pinball
one of the best things on the face of this earth
a good way to kill timethis game is one of the good versions of pokemon
you can take all sorts of different pictures
its really cool because if you get them in a different pose then you will get more points
also the levels are very well made
the cave is really cool as the same with the jungle level
this game has some challenging parts to it though
like when you have to take pictures of the pokemon statues
its hard to find some of themoverall a good game with good levels and graphics
dont buy this though because youll get tired of it really fast
i recommend you rent it a few times
then youll be satisfieda great game with a unique concept  travel around an a constant moving vehicle and try and capture photos of pokemon
the better quality you get the better score you get and if you can capture a pokemon in a rare moment you get an even better scoreyou are able to interact with the pokemon on a limited basis  throwing food etc to get them in various posesin the end you are judged by prof oak and will eventually get to move on to a new location with new pokemon to seethis is an amazing game and it could be great for any naturelover who doenst know a thing or care about pokemon
its sad to see that this gem has expired and that nintendo has not made another entry to any series in the vein of this gamethis game is awesome
im surprised its not more sought after
this game has always been fun and is super fun to play again after all these years
its still challenging too which is a quality not found in all the games i played as a kidman theres a giant herd of hawks that you gotta take pictures of before they can kill this cat
you knock this one lizard into a pool of lava and he bursts out as a fire dragon and he gets so mad
then you think you discover them all and snap all the shots but professor oak puts you on the moon and says get to work this doctor is a mad man and there are rainbows and balls everywhere
best gamethis gane was so much fun i thought it would stink but it was suprisingly good
this is a game the whole family will enjoyi love this game
it is a puzzle and it is very creative
fun game and great for anyone who loves pokemon
i suggest this game to anyone who loves games or anyone who loves pokemonsuch nostalgia
still worked even when i brought out my old nintendo  cant seem to get enough of itgreat game works perfectly shipping was good
in all a good purchase
would buy again
a little dusty and rusty thoughthis is one of my favorite games from my childhood
pokemon snap is a very fun and creative adventure game that i still love to play even to this dayyeah im a serious pokemon fan yeah im  even though i beat the whole game in a little over an hour it was fun the whole time
i think thats how i did it so fast you are just like pulled in
i beat it a few times when i was younger then decided to buy it again so thats the only reason i blew through it but its so fun trying to find out the secret places and pokemon and getting new items to use
the coolest thing i think is seeing the pokemon run around all in d and realistic like and trying to find ways to take new pictures is definitely fun
i think its even fun to watch someone else playare you a pokemon fan
buy
this
gameloves pokemon and would play nonstop if he could
i cannot tell you about the game itself as i do not play video gamesone of my daughters took this game into game stop to trade it in for a different game without the others knowledge and she got pissed
now we have it back and paid less then a new one
now everyone is happythis is one of my favorite n gamesthe gameplay is fun and quite addictivethe graphics are surprisingly good for being an n gametwo bad things  easily beatable in a few hours or less no sequel what givesall in all if youre one of those people who still plays on the n like me this is a good game pretty cheap too to havethis game has so much to it
there is never an end
the very first course marion club is easy if you have the right drive height etc
the second plam club is a little more challenging
this is where it gets hard
the third dune club is very challenging
youll need a long drive with great control and meet area
you may not want to use the special club this is a club you get after you do a certain task
a place will open up and the club maker will give you a choice
control club or the distance club
i chose the distance club because thats what was vital at that point
i thought afterwards i should have chosen the control club because when you choose the disance club your meet area and control is not very good
so pick whatever suits you because you will end you hitting something or getting it in the bunker
the fourth links club is very hard
it has alot of heath which are packs of grass very thick and they are very hard to get out of
it took me a long time to beat this club
so the graphics are nice the color is nice and the levels scenery etc is nice
but there is one more challenge that awaits you
its thei put mario golf into my brothers lime green gmaboy color expecting mediocrocy
i really dont like gameboy games compared to the playstations and ns and dreamcasts etc mario golf however has amazed me
its like you are a golfer at a country club entering tournaments and playing other challengers and rivals
its like the real thing
the golfing is just  part of this great game
its traveling to different courses and trying to bring a good name and gold to your own club
the main goal in this game is to win the  big tournaments and meet mario
which i havewnt been able to do yet
yet i dont get aggrevated this game isnt impossible yet you cant win right away
you need to enter tournaments practice get your shot examined you need to compete in contests listen to what other golfers have to say and look for up mushrooms
i play gameboy mainly in the car or on a planride but this i will play just as much as my playstation
i hope anyone who has gameboy will go out and buy this you will be amazed when you see how much fun and how realistic it really ismario golf blends rpg elements with the great game of golf
you start out  by creating a character then putting points into different skills
as you  play courses practice or enter contests you gain experience and your  character goes up in levels
this earns you more points to put into each  skill level
the graphics are wonderful for a game boy game and the  controls are simple and easy to learn
four courses are available each  with a different theme and tons of mini games in practice areas help  change up the game play
the game is one of the best golf games i have ever  played and can be very addicting
if you have a game boy and like golf at  all do yourself a favor and get this gamei bought this game because it was on sale and after fighting over it with my husband for  days or so he emerged victorious and has been playing with it every day ever since
at ages  and  we have a hard time finding gameboy games that can hold our attention but i do fear hes going to get carpel tunnel syndrome soon
i just wish there were more courses available to us
although i am trapped on the palms course and it might take me a while to actually finish well so we have gotten our moneys worth out of this onevery addicting
have put more hours on this game than any other on the nintendo ds
the fact that the game is very accurate makes it very funthis is one of the best games from the last  years
awesome game play and art design
too bad it wasnt a hit
the ai of the bugs is amazing very hard to shoot them sometimes
i never completed the game either
i do think all of the endless collecting was a bit tiresome
perhaps the game only flaw
anyways pick this game up
where else can you play a game that has a dog with jet pack and machine gun attached to itafter the present game consoles have been released i never thought i would come back to this
but this is one thing i couldnt ignore
jet force gemini is without a doubt one of the greatest action packed third person shooters of all time
at first the game seems a little simple as you start off with one character and only a simple pistol
the level is also pretty straight forward and nothing greatly impressive happens at this time
but once you come across the second level gaining the machine gun for the first time you enter one of the most action packed epic experiences on an alien spaceshipand this is rarely seen through action shootersthe games basic goal is to search for and rescue the tribalsewok like creatures whove been attacked and enslaved by alien insectslarge and smallthe enemies carry a great deal of ai
they can run for cover dodge weave and they have weak points and defenses
some enemies use different attacks depending on whether theyve spotted you or not
others are mindless drones who use sheer numbers to overwhelmjet force gemini has such a wide variety of awesome gameplay that it could be broken up into four separate games and still receive its strong reviews
constant action adventure sniping and stealth and a great deal of exploration with both thirdperson and firstperson views
throughout the game as you come across each of the three characters who each have their different special abilities you will notice that some areas cannot be accessed by certain characters and require others to return to the same level to complete it the game is overloaded with atmosphere within both its action scenes incredible soundtrack and its great level designs that some may notice have a resemblence of hyrule from zelda
the graphics are colourful and stunning
the bosses throughout are probably the most impressive bosses ive seen in any game at that timethere is one thing about the game that isnt entirely a flaw but you still need to be aware of
its the controls that may take a little getting used to
for a game of constant action exploration stunning graphics and impressive story and bosses jet force gemini feels like the largest action packed hollywood epic everthis game is completely underrated i used to play this all the time along with oot it is a huge game very fun with many different characters and the multiplayer was great me and my cousins and brothers played together all the time and always had fun
totally worth itjet force gemini is no doubt one of the greatest video games ever made in video game historya wonderful and brillant science fiction video game which features three characters that must save an alien race known as the tribels as well as there own from the evil alien tyrant mizar and his gigantic army of antlike aliens called dronesthe graphics are the greatest that the nintendo has to offer
very colorful and amazing animation makes it any gamers eye candy
the length is of the game is very long and will keep you hooked to your tv for months
quite litterally toothe weapon arsonal in the game is very wide ranged from an average pistol to a fullpowered rocket launcher that obliterates all enemies in one blow
there are dozens and dozens of different planets that you get to visit during your run through the game even places that have nothing to do with the story at all but are still fun to visit
every planet even small ones are greatly detailed and designed and the length can be very long on each one when fully exploring themthe dialouge is perfectly written and scripted
every detail in the story will keep you playing
although theres no voice acting in the game the characters grunt gasp in pain etconce you play jet force gemini believe me you will not want to put down the controller until the game has been completedoverall rating  this game deserves a star rating as stars is not enough for a game this amazing
this game also deserves a sequel although it will never be made which makes me very sad
this game no matter how much you pay for it is something that you need to get if you play video games and have a nintendo
its that goodthis game brings me my favorite memories
it has nice melodies and nice trinkets
excellent for a twentyminute break
a plusemperor caesar has allotted you the task of building a city and managing its affairs in a certain region of the roman empire as your st assignment
you are asked to meet certain victory conditions such as food storage targets a desired population a certain amount of imperial favor rise in cultural rating and so on
if you are able to attain these goals the emperor promotes you to a higher rank of nobility and yet another challenging task to perform
if not you are fired and that is the end of your newfound career as a clerkbelieve me this is a superb city building game wherein you start your career as a clerk completing the various assignments allotted to you and finally get to be caesar himself
you have to build cities that are prosperous and well defended from unwanted invadersi played the demo it was so appealing that i had to try out the full game
playing the game was such a wonderful experience
i enjoyed every second of it
city building was a whole lot of fun especially when you can learn the opinions of citizens walking up and down the streets of your city
this kind of interaction helps a lot since you get to know what kind of changes need to be made in the infrastructure of the city to create more peaceful neighborhoods which are the foundations of a healthy and crimeless cityto make your city prosperous first of all you have to see to it that the basic needs of the locals are well taken care off  like providing easy food accessibility by placing a market in every neighborhood
placement of fountains is equally important for fresh water supply
their medicinal educational religious needs should also be considered important
another thing you find the citizens complaining about is limited entertainment so keep that in mind toothe graphics are simply neat
certain buildings especially the gardens and fountains serve the double purpose of adding beauty to the environment and providing relief to the citizens
this helps to attract people to your city which means more citizens
more citizens mean more jobs and more jobs mean more buildings to be built to erase unemployment
so far so good
but doesnt all this sound like spending a whole lot of money
help
the city vaults are running out of money
this is where trade and industry come to your rescue
open a trade route with a friendly city and with careful management your city vaults will have enough so as not to keep you worriedanother thing which might keep you worried is defense against foreign invasions
setting up a military will help you against enemy attacksthe game also allows a certain amount of interplay with the gods who prove to be a major influence on the people and thus threaten to affect the prosperity of the city
planning and dedicating festivals to the gods seems fruitful and loads of fun
make them angry and get ready to suffer their wrath
this often leads to shortage of food or unwelcome problems in trade routes which ultimately affects the citizens
it makes them either unhappy or rebels
the first lot usually leaves the city and the latter causes crimeanother interesting factor is that you can set a salary for yourself and you can use the money youve saved to send the emperor gifts in an attempt to increase your favor rating
not only this you can also set the tax percentage according to your own will set a salary for the employed lot according to your wishes etc
but at the same time keep in mind that too high a tax rate and too low a salary are going to affect the growing population of the city
attention given to such minute details of city management is what holds the interest of the player and makes the game play loads of funsome people find this game hard to play
true city planning and managing its affairs is pretty difficult especially when you have to please the people please the gods defend the city and to top it all send the emperor gifts and meet with his over taxing demands which seem totally unfair especially at times when you find your city vaults do not hold enough to meet those needs
but hey
are these not the very same factors that challenge your abilities as a good administrator and thus keep you interested all through the game and make it uniquethe game challenges your capabilities as a good builder and administrator
you have to supervise the affairs of the city and its citizens
you have full freedom to make decisions on the local financial and military issues of the city to make it a prosperous one but at your own risk coz if you fail to do so you are apt to suffer the emperors wrathplaying this game was a rich experience to me
i found myself in a totally different world a different era
you get to learn so much about the history of ancient romethis is my first game by sierra and i am totally addicted to it
i still have to try out the others
all in all its a great game
nothing less can be said about iti like strategy games very much and that is just the kind i like the most
tough with broad list of varieties and not too fast to play
it has two different paths you can switch between them as you wish whenever you  choose your next destination  governing in peace or battle with the  enemies
you must just follow some basic tips and the outcome will shorly  be positive its only matter of time and nerves
 build slowly dont  make too much housing at the beginning
you are usually limited with peace  rating and you can only gain it with the time so take your time
you will  spend too much money if you start too fast
 build with care leave space  for additional buildings
when you start playing certain destination take  yourself five minutes put in pause mode or to  speed to overview the  terrain
i had best results with  blocks of housing with stripes of   spaces on top amp bottom and  spaces left amp right
 watch your  ratings and advisors carefully
dont except everything they say to you  but keep in mind that people are very demanding and you wont be able to  fool them for long
 specials  you can have tax rate up to  dont  fool with caesar more than twice third time its six legions
and keep  the festivals running
for futher info or comments please email megreat old school pc gaming
play for hours enjoy the history struggle to control and lead a make believe society to successthis game is almost like age of empires and simcity put together
you are a governor of a province and start as a citizen and work your way up to caesar
many people say this game is hard
it isnt
i have never once  failed a mission but i have suffered the consequences of disobeying caesar  and the gods
each province you have different resources and things you  can build
the houses your people live in are influenced by a couple  things water food security desirability goods and services
your  houses start as tents and work their way up to grand palaces
overall this  is a game that no gamer can be withouti love this game
ive spent countless hours building my very own roman empire and downloading other peoples empires from fan sites
the graphics are great and you can learn a lot about the roman empire from playing this game
the best part is you really get involved in your city you control everything unlike sim city
thats why i think caesar iii is much better than sim cityyou can start a career and work your way up to the title of caesar or you play a scenario and not have to worry about being promoted
in your career you have two choices each time you get promoted after the training levels
you can take a dangerous province which has many invasions and battles
or you can choose the peaceful province which either has none or a very small amount of invasions
both are balanced out in difficulty so the dangerous province is not necessarily the hardest province
the peaceful usually has more obstacles and higher standings that need to be achieved in rome in order for you to be promoteda great game
this game is such a bargain at its extremely low pricethe caesar series of games by sierra have yet to let me down
this is another great edition
your cities are beautifully rendered now with improved graphics
you will also find walkers moving about your city which you click on to get interesting feedback about the status of your city
you will build legions and other military troops to defend your city and go on campaign at the request of caesar
the trade mechanics have been improved as well making it easier to trade and track what is being traded and your trade deficit or surplusthis game rocks
my friend let me borrow it and i made up excuses not to give it back for almost a year
i played caesar ii and quite frankly was very disappointed
it was impossible to win that game
caesar iii however is much easier
i read a review about a guy who could never win because of the ratings
i dont know what the hell hes talking about
i beat the game easily and then went back and beat it again taking a different path
and again
and again
thats how diverse this game can be
in the campaign you are always given the choice between to assignments
the combinations are endless
simply awesomethe one thing i did not like is the fact that once you get a thriving city going your housing starts to require a lot of things
and unless you are very good at planning ahead it becomes difficult to get them a steady supply of furniture pottery two wines a varied diet and olive oil at the same time
not to mention the education requirements need for entertainment and sanitation water restrictions and the need for arable farmland
thats probably the worst
ideally the farmland would be nearby to water and there would be some forest or scrub near that as well
not the usual setup however which makes getting pottery and furniture to the central populace who is near the farmland on the other side of the map a real choreall in all though this is a fivestar game worth all the money you spendive played the caesar series since  and enjoyed them all
unlike the other reviewers i have to say i thought this edition was a little easier
one minor picky complaint is that they dont use the latin based names for the two kinds of schools as they did in caesar ii
you can choose a course emphasizing military defense or development
i chose mostly defense because it was more fun to watch the barbarians
game has more than what is just in its democaesar  is unstoppable
you can play it a million times and each game will be different
the cities in the game can be huge one of my cities covered the whole mapthe game is very easy to play you have to build a roman empire and take care of its residents
you have to build loads of things like schools libraries theatres markets farms etca cool effect of the game is that every person says something when you right click on them
i had fun just by doing that in a city
sometimes in the game caesar sends you requests and if you dont fulfill them he gets angry and chucks you out the city taking away your place of mayoryou only get  in money i cant remember the name for money in the game and if you use it too quickly caesar gets angrytheres loads of disasters in the game  like fires building collapses riots and diseaseoverall a jam packed game that you will not get bored of
play and become caesarafter about  hours of gameplay i finished this game today
and as i look back i think this was a great game allaround
the animation and voiceover is a little cheesy but youll find yourself so engrossed in the story line that you wont care
the graphics are mostly cartoon calibur aside from a few great movie scenesthe battle system is pretty basic
enemies appear on screen as you walk through dungeons giving you the opportunity to avoid annoying random encounters if you are fast enough
fights are graphicmenu based and the quotviewquot function allows you to know the enemies tactics so you can plan your strategies for each fight
recovery points are all over the place allowing you to feel free to use your magic and techniques without worrying about using up your mpthe magic is based on the elements of wind water fire and earth and combinations of two
you can decided which elements you want your characters to learn as you go along allowing you limited customization
there are also special techniques that combine weapon and magic skills that each character learns
experience is earned on just about everything
like most rpgs your characters levels increase with standard experience points but your individual weapon and magic skills also earn experience points which later earn you new techniques and spellsthe best thing about this game and youll read this about just about every rpg is the story
the overall synopsis is not incredibly original  a young teen sets out on an adventure and ends up trying to save the world  but the characters he meets along the way are all very deep and emotional
you actually care what happens to them along the way as you would the charaacters in a good book or movie
the story is very emotional and you will be caught up in it from the startthis is a great game thats fun to play
it has a gripping story that will guarentee some sort of emotional response if you have any sort of emotions at all
i liked just about everything about it and id recommend it to any fan of crono trigger wild arms and of course the final fantasy seriesive been a fan of grandia since its release on the ps
the experience was far better than any other rpg ive played due to the action based combat system that isnt all that common for jrpgsmy purchase came with a near flawless copy of grandia with only minor scuffs on the cdthis game has aged fairly well
though the graphics are polygonal its held up way better than other games of the era thanks to its reliance on d sprites
the gameplay is as fun as always and if you dont feel like fighting you can just avoid enemies
always a nice feature on an jrpgthe music is great though at time minimalist with alot of areas playing simple beats rather then music
personally though thats part of the atmosphere of many of the areas with music being used for towns and cenimaticsthe voicework is pretty weak
its not so much that the voices are bad but the actors did a poor job on their delivery so it all sounds pretty cheesy
having to hear it all the time during combat doesnt helpthe biggest strength of this game is the characters and the gameplay
i liked all the characters by the end of the game and it was a fun mostly light hearted adventure
it had a feeling of exploration and discovery that few other games focus on delivery and so it gives quite a unique atmosphere because of iti cant really point out any major flaws i wish the game had better voice acting or none at all
apart from that the only thing i want from grandia is a remake
modern graphics gameplay technology would make grandia one hell of an adventure for those who missed out on it the first time aroundi heard some many things about the original grandia that i had to get a copy
since it was the beginning of the series i just had to see what started it all
i was impressed with this one despite it being really old
all three of the grandias emphasize something grand in there storiesgrandia  storygrandia ex battlegrandia  adventurethis game has one of the most original themes ive ever known
this game is all about adventure and the places you visit come from a long list of destinations
the game itself started the unique ip gauge battle system and the most unique way of learning moves and spells you have to have a certain numerical level to get a new technique
some moves and magic have two or three required values making this one interactive rpg that will mostly emphasize training
once you get a new move using it or its related statistic increases its power level and activation speed
also when a weapon or spell type levels up you get a boost in the related parameter for example if justin levels up his staff he gets a bonus of  hp added on to his max total as well as  point more onto his vitality
not a bad system at all a bit reminiscent of saga frontier s numerical value arts system
game arts should have kept this on for the other two games
maybe they might bring it back for the third onethe music is a definite highlight of this game considering the great noriyuki iwadare composed it
his town and battle themes are amazing especially disc s main battle theme my favorite battle theme of all time
there are entertaining and sad themes too and a romantic one for all of us who want something a little heartfelt
the voice acting isnt really as bad as everyone says
justin and sue are pretty much right on the dot with their ages  and  while guidos semiitalian speech is really cute
mildas southern girl accent is nice and burly and rapp definitely sounds like a kid who has no manners at allthe story seems a little closely related to grandia ex in terms of the grandia world having elemental spirits residing in it as well as the story of an ancient civilization where man tasted the paradise of supreme knowledge
not bad at allthe game spans two discs and has three sidequests of great difficulty on the second disc
unfortunately they are very easy to miss and have some sweet rewards inside
plus after a certain point you wont be able to go back and do them so pay attention on the second discthe flaw with this game is that is clearly not meant for the ps because of the constant data flow during battles and dungeons
if you still own a ps it will save you all the frustration of infrequent and unwelcome freezes especially if you havent saved in a while
also the music tracks on this grandia are cut somewhat in comparison to the saturn version which has them all so you might want to hunt down the ost which is even rarer than the game these days
all and all a great beginning game for a hopefully long running series in the futureforget about all the others that came after this one
they arent anywhere near as great as this one is
this the first one and original
the best one of them all
if you have the opportunity to get this game here than go for itgrandia is a great game all around
if not one of the best it is definitely one of the most fun rpgs ive ever playedthe first thing which strikes my memory like so many other games is the characters
they are good fun characters
if nothing else grandia does make you care about them and what happens to them
unlike almost every other rpg ever made there really arent any dark brooding characters or even evil ones even the bad guys werent very evil seeming and i know that will put a lot of people off
justin the main character is a total jerk
hes a nice guy at heart but just a little clueless
there is some voice acting which is entertaining and some of it is okay
i like it well enough to keep it
it set the characters well
there is a little love story too which is corny but it fits well with the rest of the game
nothing in this game is very seriousexcept the combat
the fighting system in grandia is awesome
it is still turnbased but instead of just standing in a row youre characters actually move around which is important against many bosses and special attacks
it uses a timing system with an action bar to determine who goes when
when you hit enemies or are hit yourself you move back on the bar
this is important for strategic reasons
basically you can do more damage with a combo than a critical attack but a critical moves them further back on the bar
the special moves and magic system is very well done
you level up specific moves and spells by using them
this makes some of your early moves devastating even into the later parts of the gameon a similar note the experience system is one of the best in the industry whether or not it is innovative or original
there are standard level ups running on the normal experience system
then grandia goes the extra mile and adds in the specific weapon and magic class levels
when you use a specific type of weapon you level up in that specific weapon getting a small stat boost and allowing you access to new skills
this makes it necessary to switch up what kind of weapons each character uses
magic also levels up in this same way and to get access to new spells especially the ones which are mixes of elements you will have to mixup what kinds of magic you use
it is a fun system to work withgrandia has a fairly simplistic happy plot
it is not unique by any right
i guess it kind of is by its lightness
it really is cheery and a total departure from dark depressing insight into the human soul type stories did someone just mention xenogears
you spend a large portion of your time on sidequests and adventures which have nothing to do with the overall plot but that was okay because you are a young aspiring adventurer after all
that and the combat system is great so fighting lots of monsters is fun
the main story is nothing special but it is interesting
i did find myself wanting to know what happens
despite the general and generic plot individual events and occurrences are still exciting now and thenthe graphics arent anything special like most playstation games that are three years old
the characters themselves are well observed done with a high level of detail and the character dialogue  portraits are neat
every character has two or three expressing different emotions
again nothing outstanding or brilliant but a nice touch
in general the dungeons themselves and the enemy monsters dont look so great
but then again ive never really cared much about graphics in rpgs
your callthere are a couple things which really makes grandia stand out above the rest of the crowd
for one thing there are no random encounters
nobody likes those
there are still wandering monsters but you can see them on screen before you have to fight them and they are avoidable
i thought that was absolutely awesome
the music in grandia was excellent
i think it is the absolute best soundtrack on a rpg so far
i absolutely loved it
people who werent watching would occasionally glance in to see if i was just listening to classical music
that is a bit of an overstatement but stillall in all grandia is great
it is an epic
it only took me  hours to beat
nowhere near this  hour stuff the other reviewers were talking about
i did almost everything too including talking to everybody in town three times in a row one of grandias more annoying points
the dungeons are well designed if short and easy
i had a more difficult time fighting wandering monsters than some bosses mainly because you can hit them so many times they never get to move
anyway grandia is definitely one of the most fun rpgs ever even if it isnt one of the technical best
and it has puffy
all rpg fans should pick it up
and beat it
it is greatokay for starters
i am offical a member of the  member abba anti brain bat association
if you have played this game found the optional dungeon fought those little buggers at a lower level you know why
baboomsorrythe game is cool
graphics are nice not the best but better than some
the music is excellent
the voice acting is skippy but it works
the magic system can be difficult to figure out in the beggining and hard to level but hey  there are places to level them without cheat codes
for water try standing in the green water at the tower and heal yourself
it does work though it does take a few hours for each characterrecommending feena to level  waterwind
i love the game overall despite the bad voice acting
nothing tops the original i suppose
oh and who can ever pass up having their final boss fight inside of a coachroachwhen i read a review about this game being better than ff i thought they were nut
after all ff is my favorite and i thought anyone including square couldnt do better
for good  years i never gave second thoughtsummer of  i saw brand new copy at fye and i decided to give a try
for a low price i told myself it cannot be waste of moneywhen i started to play i realized why sega saturn fans cherished this title
this is the one of two games that truly captured the ideal of great rpg
they feature likeable characters
all have style and sense of existence
they are not just a filling rather important part of story and the game itselfi do not care about their age or about drawing style
for me it fits very well
after all this is an adventure about adventure itself
battle system
i cant stress importance about having good battle system
with no random encounter and isomatric semi fulltime battle it is definitely more fun than conventional system set by ff for too longgenerally battle is easy side if you took most battle
it eliminates the need of excessive dependence on guardians
music
this is only title other than chrono cross that made me buy soundtrack
the composer gave his best to capture the feeling of this game and raise the level
graphic
other than character and battle scene they are completely d  they did it without losing details
much better than xenogears really
when you see this game you may notice that so many couldve gone wrong instead they perfectly excuted to create this amazing title
i just fell in love with itoh and fmv is done by links the specialist behind ff and star ocean as much as i loved the original spyro  the sequel blows it awayeverything that i liked best about the original  the interactivity the detailed and sophisticated environments and fun stuff like blowing things away with cannons  is back and cranked up several notcheseverything that made the original game sometimes seem repetitive  doing nothing but collecting gems and dragons the tiny worlds only being able to use a few moves in any given environment  is dumpedand while this game really is perfect for kids  the worst thing in it is some cartoon violence of dinosaurs swallowing cavemen and spitting out an enormous bone  its a hoot for adults with lots of subtle humor and a game thats challenging enough without having anything as frustrating as tree tops from the original gamean instant classicspyros first adventure was a groundbreaking experience that took place inside a giant world filled with colorful breathtaking beauty
it was awesome the way the game encouraged you to roam around many graphicallyappealing worlds searching for gems and dragons
spyro  riptos rage proves to be an even bigger journeyi honestly didnt think it was possible to surpass the original spyro game
it was truly one of the greatest adventure games on the playstation
i can only find a couple very minor problems with riptos rage
lets get them out of the way i think the biggest problem is the fact that once again the up and down buttons on the directional pad are still reversed
this means for example when you go underwater in one of the water levels you have to hit the up button to swim down and the down button to swim up
theres a couple other places in the game where the controls are reversed too
as far as i know theres no way to change it to normal
none of this may seem like a big deal but theres certain obstacles in the game that require you to move quickly through the water and you want everything to be as perfect as possible while you swim to your destination but thanks to the controls it wont be easy
personally ive never been able to adjust to it every so often i will forget that the up and down buttons are reversed when i enter a water or flying stage so i might swim or fly straight into an enemy
its mindboggling to me why the game creators havent corrected it or at the very least gave the player an option to change it i find it slightly disappointing that this time around every stage has exactly  gems
in the original each stage had a different amount of gems for you to locate which made spyros first adventure seem like more of a mysterious guessing game
not really complaining though a ton of cutscenes are included in riptos rage
you can skip over them if you want but im amazed that every level has a cutscene in the beginning of a stage and another cutscene after you successfully complete the stage
dont worry riptos rage is still a huge game maybe even bigger than the original
in other words the cutscenes dont suck up all the space on the disc
ignoring the cutscenes you still have a lengthy game this brings us to the next minor problem the reason we have so many cutscenes is because each stage has a different oddlooking creature living in it and these creatures who happen to speak english very well always want to discuss with spyro the problems inside their world that theyd like you to fix for them
just the fact that every stage features a different talking creature is both a good and bad thing
a player might think spyro  riptos rage is throwing in too much and therefore you may assume you need to try and remember all the characters you come across in order to follow a story which isnt true because once you complete a stage most of the time you never see that character again so please do not worry about having to follow along to any kind of complex storyline
but on the other hand all sorts of wildlooking talking friendly creatures communicating with spyro makes the game that much more adventurousthose are the only complaints i can find and when you think about it those are pointless complaints because the game does so many things righti honestly believe the challenge has been increased significantly in spyros second adventure
instead of three or four dragons scattered throughout each stage waiting for you to find and rescue you now have to search for three or four bonus games per stage and you have to successfully complete most of them which would be an extremely positive thing except for the fact that a small handful of these bonus games are really hard to completeeach time you complete a bonus game you receive an orb
theres  orbs in the game total and to reach the final boss youre required to find  of them
in my opinion probably no more than  bonus games are impossibly hard so you should be able to go through the stages collect  orbs and beat the game
just dont expect to get all  orbs because again some of those bonus games are difficultim not knocking the bonus games
after all its more interesting to tackle a creative and exciting bonus game than to simply walk up to a frozen dragon and rescue him like in the original
in spyro  you dont know what kind of bonus game youll encounter which makes the game overall one notch better than the original
to give a few examples of the bonus games you play one of them has you playing hockey on ice where you have two minutes to make five goals another bonus has you trying to quickly burn eight dangerous dragons before they eat the good guys dont even ask me what these good guys are supposed to be lets just say theyre friendly people that really love you
another bonus stage has you swimming through rings
a whole bunch of creative interesting bonus games await you
even if you lose at some of them you will want to try them again because theyre so much funpeople who are familiar with the original might be confused when they reach the end of the game and realize that they only explored three worlds
the original game featured five worlds however the three worlds in riptos rage feature more stages
so it balances outthe graphics are exactly the same as the original
i cant find a single improvement or at least anything different
the exact same graphic engine
oh and thankfully the creators remembered that very important option to change the camera angle to active
very importantstewart copeland from the rock band the police returns and succeeds with another fantastic soundtrack
another allaround excellent jobmy favorite thing about this game are the three boss fights you encounter at the end of the three worlds
all three of these bad guys are extremely awesome to fight sorry im in the mood to whip out the big letters
it is so much fun shooting fireballs at them
they also force the player to find a strategy in order to defeat
you never really came across a boss fight in the previous spyro game that required a certain strategyi love the fact that everywhere you go you find loads and loads of gems and other things
the levels and worlds in this game are packed with things to find
positively packed
a truly awesome game
the first spyro the dragon game was awesome too
swimming around really adds more flavor and magic to the game
yeah despite the control problem i mention above swimming around still manages to be pretty fun
of course theres a lot of running around too
in fact theres more running than swimming overallpick up spyro  riptos ragespyro  is a great game on a dead console
the second story is one of the best children friendly games ever
from the beginning when spyro and sparx leave for dragon shores to the time they actually get there i remember loving the different levels boss fights and challenges
this is a great buy for someone you love perhaps yourself
any one who plays this will have a great time
its engaging fun and something thats fun without gore
go figurepros great environments challenges are great brain teasers visuals are fantastic still
cons hard to play unless you have a psoverall this is a good buy glad to have an essential part of my childhood back
if you have kids these are the perfect games for them with well preserved graphics fun villains  its own subtle sense of humor
dedicated experts can probably complete the game in less than a day i would play this for weeks on end as a kid  never seem to run out of things to do
replay value is also excellent with a special feature that allows you to play though the whole game again with a permanent special power if you beat it definite must havethe first spyro was great game already but this game beats it by far
with loads of new features and tons of new characters this is one of the best spyro games out there
in this game you get to travel through  new worlds with over  colorful levels with your old buddy sparx and your new companion hunter the cheetah
you must collect over  tallismans and  orbs to finally come face to face with ripto
also in these game meet moneybags
he can open up doors or drop bridges for you at a small fee
some new features in this include some fun minigames the ability to swim and some new powerups like the super charge super flame breath and super flying power
here an overview of the gameimproved graphics challenging but not too challenging boss battles autosave not enough new abilities levels are a bit small storyline is a bit bland overall a great spyro game
it provides lots of entertainment and lots of fun minigames therefore its a musthavethis was the first game i got for the playstation back in the christmas of  the first time i played it i was hooked
the graphics are simply amazing in this game
everything is so interactive and it all almost looks real
i like all of the characters
you got spyro the dragon sparx the dragonfly elora the faun hunter the cheetah the professor i think hes a bear zoe the fairy moneybags i think hes a bear to ripto gulp crush and lots lots more
all the worlds are fun to play but not all of them are that easy
the controls are very easy to get used to so you wont have to be doing any confusing combos
everything is just kept simple
i personally thought that the storyline was very good but thats just my opinion
what you have to do is go through the big world avalar collecting talismans and orbs collect gems trust me thats what takes a really long time defeating riptocs bosses crush and gulp along the way
it all ends with your final battle against ripto and trust me i found this boss fight really hard
after that you get to unlock a secret level
but thats only if youve collected enough orbs or gems whichever
i hope i didnt spoil the whole game for you
anyways if youre a fan of the spyro series i suggest buying this game
even if youre not you might get some enjoyment out of ithave to love the old classics
probably my favorite in the series
showed up in perfect conditionthis is my favorite video game of all time and definately my favorite spyro game
i played it so much when i first got it i have just about every part of it memorized
its very easy game play and the levels are great there are very few levels with cliffs for spyro to fall off of thank goodness so younger players can relax when playing it its not really a frustrating game at all as compared to the legend of spyro series which is almost a joke
this is also the game where spyro first meets hunter the cheetah and hes still one of the best video game supporting characters of all time
if you want something easy to play pick this one up
its a total blastpositive excellent gameplay smooth controls tons of bonus missions and stuff to collect fun boss battles great level designnegative a couple levels really arent too great looking around doesnt work as well as it should spyro the dragon was a big success on sonys playstation for many reasons its excellent platforming gameplay smooth controls and tons of stuff to collect
naturally a sequel was released a year later riptos rage
this game further excelled areas that the first game already did well in and brought spyro into a whole new world both literally and figuratively
spyro  riptos rage is a really great game thats fun has a lot to collect and is just plain hard to not likeafter saving the dragon world from certain doom in the first game spyro now has his mind set on taking a vacation in the sunny dragon shores
however while he is in the portal on his way to his wellearned break a professor in the world of avalar intercepts him
he summoned a dragon to help because an evil guy named ripto entered avalar by chance a while back and now he is bent on becoming the new emperor of the unfortunate realm
with the help of his big and stupid cronies crush and gulp he has been wreaking havoc in the land
its now up to spyro to stop him as ripto seemed to mention having a fear of dragons
and for good reason because spyro is now only more determined to get his vacation than beforethe story progresses throughout three huge worlds each having somewhere between five and ten levels each
the levels are pretty big and although it wont take much time or effort to simply reach the end of each one there is a ton of stuff to do in each and every stage
beating a level earns you the talisman of the realm but there are also between two and four orbs and also  gems to collect in each level
the levels are designed in such a way that directly leads you to the talisman but there are so many side attractions within each and every one that theyre hard to ignoregems are found everywhere on the ground on a ledge inside stuff you name it
orbs however require accomplishing various tasks to obtain
you may be flying around a cave lighting lamps in one level or saving a prehistoric village from dinosaur hatchlings but all these side quests earn you orbssince there is so much to do in each level the game can last you quite a while if you go for completion although if you put in the effort it wont be incredibly difficult to do
it strikes a perfect balance in this area making for a game that you actually want to complete at some point and is not extremely irritating along the way
the grand total for the game is  talismans about  orbs and  gemsvisually spyro  isnt bad
the graphics are just a tad on the polygonal side but they really look good for a game on the playstation
the sound is great too the effects are quite nice and the music is pretty fitting
there is also surprisingly full voice acting for every piece of dialogue in the game which is pretty cool but youll probably end up skipping it to get on with the gameplayspyro s controls are very smooth and work almost perfectly
moving spyro around feels almost flawless and incredibly smooth and the button layout is very nice
the only issue here is using the triangle button to look around it doesnt really work exactly as well as it should but its not hard to figure outthe games three boss battles are surprisingly memorable
hurling explosives at the massive gulp and outsmarting the idiot crush is always fun but the best boss battle of the game is the epic threepart brawl with ripto at the end
the last part is especially fun flying around with the super flame power up blasting the crud out of riptos robot bird good times good timesoverall spyro  riptos rage is one of the most worthwhile games of its generation
it has so much to it with great graphics and sound loads of stuff to collect and tasks to accomplish and its just a game thats extremely hard to not like
if you want a game with lots to do and a great touch of personality look no further than spyro  even today its a blast to playgameplay graphics sound value final score hi everyonei just recieved this as a early easter gift from my hubby   he bought thihs on amazonfrom a amazon commited seller i have been a spyro fan since his st appearance yearsyears agoi havent played any of his games sincewell yrs
nawit may not be all that longbut it has been ages
my last spyro game i playedwas hero tail on psit was my last game with spyrobasically because i didnt like the way it turned in his seriestaking out the gem collecting i fell in love withand side kicks ways as they taught him thingsand money bagsreally bummed me outas our children grew upfinished schoolingmoved outwelli pulled away from gamingand just starting to rediscover gaming once again on gaming systemsand on my new laptopsowhen my hubby handed me several easter wrapped packagesi was shockedsurprised to see this gamepractically pristine condition
i was doing kart wheels and sommersaults and whooping it up
okokoki was doing those in my headif i attempted to do them now id be typing this from a hospital bed
heh heh hehsoafter hugging and smothering my hubby to deathand making him his favorite snackstack of pancakes buttered and smothered with warm vermont maple syrupi opened up the caseshaking handslooked at the blue discextremely pleased its flawlessi popped into gaming systemboyhearing old but familiar spyro gaming soundswatching it go through its demosit brought back memories of playing this when our children were homeand we all competed to see who got  stand figured out any secrets per level
it all came back in a rush  i actually called up our grown childrenbabbling like a mom who just got the greatest gift evermy hubby actually had to take my cellphoneand reassure them alli did not win the lottery drawingbutinsteadrecieved an old friend as a early easter giftthis is a great game from beginning towellid say endbut im still playing it  the colorssounds of this gameare fantastic
playing him on a huge flat screen is even better than the st time i played this gameon a old rca color tvit had no remote controland was big bulky back that weighed a ton
i noticed that i have slightly forgotten this gameand spyro unique movesbut having a blast reenjoying an old forgotten friendin factour children are already begging even bribed dear old dadin attempt to getting this game to play stwhen i am done with it
the other onetried to bribe me with a pogo gamevery tempting let me tell you
heh heh heh hehwhether your an old friend of spyroor a new friend discovering spyroyou will love this game
it has a lot of actionand plenty of questsand will keep you and your loved ones busy for weekswelli have other early easter gifts to open stilland a spyro game to playhappy early easter greetings to you all ps i do advise setting game play time settingsas hours an hourswill go by before you realize itand your hubbywife will be in bed snoring away
alsohave plenty of popcorn on handit goes great with this gameand makes a great bribe to a certain puppyin my case a dauschund puppywho thinks spyro on tv is something to bark an chase after
 after beating gnasty gnorc spyro is ready for a nice relaxing vacation
he and sparx set their sights on dragon shores a sunny resort world
meanwhile in the world of avalar a small mole known as the professor along with elora the faun and hunter the cheetah is programming a portal to transport a dragon to their realm
the professor has recently made a big goof and transported the dinosaur ripto and his cronies crush and gulp to avalar
ripto detecting no dragons in the area has decided to take over and make himself king of the realms
spyro and sparx gallop into the portal for dragon shores only to end up in the avalar realm of glimmer
the trio brief him on the situation before spyro begins his journey ready to flame broil every enemy that stands in his waythe attacks are the same as the first game your charge and flame
at certain points in the game there are powerup portals that allow different types of abilities in game
there is a flight powerup a superflame powerup and an invincibility powerup
each of these will run out after about thirty seconds or so and faster if you get too far out of range
sparx is still your health meter and there is plenty of colorful fodder around to keep you healthy
the levels are just as colorful and interesting as last time although rather than dropping gems your enemies release a sort of shining soul when theyre released that will unlock the powerups
your progress is saved by yet another new character zoe the fairy who zaps you with her wand if you lose a life you return to the last location zoe zapped youyour main goal in each level is to collect orbs which in turn unlock other levels and talismans the magic of which unlock boss battles
orbs are scattered throughout the realms as well as won in side quests and minigames
after ripto is defeated a certain number of gems and orbs is needed in order to unlock spyros original destination dragon shoresthis is a fantastic sequel to the original spyro the dragon almost all of my favorite levels are in this game
i have a particular attachment to scorch and shady oasisthe second spyro is even better than the first one
you get more power to make this action game that much more fun
it is great for kids or adultsi have played this game since it came out when i was  and it has never gotten stale
the graphics are wonderful for this era of game and actually are comparable to some of current timeswhether you are a diehard spyro fan and just missed out on this game or you just heard of the series and are looking for an ideal game for yourself or as a gift to another video gamer i highly recommend this game
as a child i enjoyed the colors sounds and smooth gameplay as a young adult it is fun to challenge myself to completing the game
the replay value is pretty high in my humble opinion ive completed this game numerous times and still play again and again
this is one of the three spyro games ive found to be truly enjoyable the first spyro the dragon and the third spyro year of the dragon are the other two  all of which make up the spyro trilogy for the ps as the later games just dont meet the bar of excellence these three games meetwhether a seasoned video game player or someone looking for a great gift riptos rage will delivergame play is not difficult for younger players and there are many bonus challenges and interesting goodies thrown in for the more advanced players
boring is an adjective that cannot be used for this installment to that lovable purple dragons seriesthis game is great
you play hockeyfire cannonsride a shark suba manta rayand fly in remotecontrol plane
it also includes the demo of crash team racingjust kiddingthis is a great kids gameall spyro games for the ps are great games but this one really hit home for me
unfortunately i never beat it as a child so excuse me i have work to doin this awesome cool game
if youve played the first spyro game then youre probably gonna like the second one
this game is also a platformadventure game like the first
but this sequel is even better
how
the graphics are pretty much the same if not improved
the story shifts into the world of avalar and a whole sequence of events occur
in this game you must collect  orbs by completing tasks all over the  worlds  summer forest autumn spring and winter tundra
this was the first psx game i ever bought and owned
i love this game and recommend it to everyone who loves adventure and platform gamesthere are many buried treasures in the playstation one library which is vast beyond belief but spryro  riptos rage is one of the very best
there are few games of this calibur and playability even on the vaunted ps
and in many ways this game is more than classy enough both in conception and graphical beauty to be a ps title anyway
hint to ps owners add this to your library because as you know you can play older psone games on your system and this is downright a steal at the price compared to some very expensive ps games that arent near as goodthis isnt a flight sim a space shooter a fps where you look behind some gun trying to kill its not a strategy game though some strategy plays a part nor is it some lord of the rings type of mythical bs
its all about this purple flying jumping swimming and more cartoon dragon character
exploring and learning and collecting within a magical dreamy peaceloving almost wizard of oz type land full of beautiful scenery and places lots of strange characters and creature and things and lots of pretty psychedelic colors lights and special effectsthis game reminds me of a d super mario game and while easy going trancy spacetype music plays in some parts adding to the strange otherworldly experience and a pretty simple platform game thats its main beauty and playability
this is truly like playing in a cartoon and not by any means a static cartoon as the graphics are almost studiomovie quality in animation
this game genre has been done in countless ways but this really does rank up there with those long hour killing days of manipulating mario around but in a magical fairy tale land all presented in intense colors and shapes and forms
while the gameplay in spyro is so simplistic on early levels that a  year old would have no problem with it in a way this is a game for all ages and most  plus year olds would probably get a kick out of it too
id also highly recommend it as a game parents can play along with their kids as its so much fun for both with enough interest and playability and eye candy for both as wellfor others between those ages i cant recommend this game enough as just a pleasant nonviolent trip into a land over the rainbow now and then and is even a good stress reliever in some ways
a lot of psone games leave a lot to be desired in these days of the secondgeneration consoles and higher end pc games that usually means graphics
then again a lot of the newer and a lot more expensive games of this type on those more costly systems are great looking but lack gameplaythis is not only on a par graphics wise with most ps games but in gameplay as well
psone or ps owners alike will not be disappointed in spending the low price of this game to add to their collection
i had tried lots of psone games still dont have a ps but have seen enough to know what theyre capable of graphically before buying this particular game and it was worth every cent because for all practical and graphical purposes this looks and plays a lot more like a ps game than a psone
my first reaction upon playing this was just wow
this is as good as anything on ps xbox or gamecube both graphically and in playability period
easy fun relaxing trips with a goofy little purple dragon and tinkerbell in a land of beauty and color and strangeness
what more could one ask from a game
buy this now while you still can whether you have a psone or a ps
this is a real gem of a video game for the kids and for those socalled adults out here who are simply and forever will remain kids at hearta sequel that builds upon a successful formula
more action more adventure more powerupswhat more can you ask for
if only all game developers and producers did this we would have ssoooo much more solid titles and sequels
got  more ps classics to go including spyro fun game to play
ages  to adults
many facets of the game
some parts hard to play for adults
good gamethis game is the greatest of all spyro games made
it is also the first one in which you can swim underwater and head bash enemies
this game was a staple of my childhoodlike game havent play for long time ago
enjoy play game as fun and better than boring
or what
no ideathis is my favorite twisted metal game and i totally love it
now i got it years ago but it was delivered very fast and damage free
buy it you wont regret itthis game is somewhat underrated
its not as good as the other twisted metal games but its still pretty good
though i dont really view it as a twisted metal game more of its own thingthis is a great tm game
its one of my favorites
everybody has been griping about how bad tm and tm are
sure they do have some flaws but theyre still great games
the graphics are great
its got a bunch of all new totally metal twisting weapons like mirvs auto lobs rain  and more
it has some neat characters and some wierd ones like meter maid trash man and the jones
you can even be rob zombie
one of the things i like most about this game is that you can create your own vehicle
you can even choose what they can say when they use their special like quotoooh
thats gotta hurtquot and quotcrispy fried punkquot
it has alot of phrases to choose from
it has cool levels like the carnival sweet tooths bedroom and minions maze
the only things i didnt like about this game is that some of the levels are large and like mazes and are hard to find opponents even with your radar especially when theres about  or  also sometimes when you ram a wall hard your vehicle gets stuck sideways in the wall but you can drive off if theres a corner where the wall stops
thats all i can say
this is a great tm game
i wish everyone would shut up about how bad it is
at least its twisted metal
it would be a great addition to your tm series or just your playstation collectionthis by far is the best twisted metal
blowing all the ones before it out of the water
featuring not only realistic cars but some non realistic cars it thrashes the competition
this is the best twisted metal
tm  is the second bestthis game is so fun
i love it
the graphics are not the best but the game itself is awesome
if you havent played it you shouldthis can be a very confusing game
the levels especially minions maze are
there are many  cheat codes to enter but graphics are good and levels interesting
if i can say one thing rent this before you buy itthis is the newest one for the ps and i like it the best
it has many new cars tracks items and things to do
this game is easier than most of the others but it still does get challenging as u get further into the game
the controls r eaiser to get the hang of so u can get better faster
after u beat the game it is fun to do the quick battle on single or multiplayer
u can create ur own type of car with its own saying like after u hit someone with ur special it will say something taunting
u can also choose paint its special and many other things that u can think of
the tracks r much more layed out and much bigger than the others
this one track has a thing that u can pick other people up with and try to destroy them
and each track has things enteresting like that hidden tunnels in a city hide outs in a kids bedroom and many many more
this is one of my favorite games on multiplayer u can either be on the same team or against each other
this is a great gameits not the best one in the series tm but still its a good time to blow everything up
good jobgood game but not the best the series has to offersolidwhen sony started the grandtrismo game they started a historical event
one disk is arcade to race against a buddy  and the other disk is for campaign other words the story mode if you want to use that term
there has to be at least  cars i did not play this for a while so i do not remember
this game gots wonderful cars
you can also upgrade and modify the cars with weight angle etca lot of people love a good driving game and im no exception
its fun to push the envelope in these games and this is a classici love playing theses games
brings back the good old days
i get sick of the new kind of games they come out with nowthe sequel is surprisingly leaps and bounds better then the first version of gt
i find it amazing that one of the best driving games i have ever played has been improved
great new tracks the dirt tracks are an excellent addition not to mention the music is equally outstanding
cant wait to check on part  on playstation i had this game for my playstation and loved it
many many hours went into playing all the races and all the carsthen i moved on up to the dreamcast
along came bleam
and i was back at this game again only with crisper graphics
i love it
the tracks are solid the cars keep on coming some suck and some rock
it depends upon whether or not you like rearwheel drive cars or frontwheel drive ones
etc
etc
my roommate and i had totally different favorite cars and tracks and we each loved this gamethen i got the ps and the madcatz mc steering wheel
the wheel will not work with gt
among other things gt has limited camera angles and just a few of the cars that this game hasafter using the wheel on this game for  weeks i have to say that gt is the best racing game out there for any system
and i should know i have played it on the original playstation the dreamcast and now psi have yet to find a driving simulator that does as much as this game
the camera angles rock you can even get a far away view the cars are realistic the races challenging and the license tests are excellentas far as i am concerned once this game was released the world could stop turning with no noticiable affect to me save the constant darkness or light
i love this game
gt is ok but this game is the meat
all other car games should be compared to this masterpieceseriously it sounds as if i am gushing but this title has lasted me for  consoles and i wholly expect it to dominate the ps whenver it comes outthis is such a cool game
there are hundreds of cars to buy from over  different dealers
you can buy from american japanese german english italian and french dealers
at some places you have the option to buy a used car tip buy a used car at the beginning of the game or youll get stuck with a car that has hp
believe me
i know
this game has magnificant sound
you can here the difference in the engine when you upgrade it and all the small details
if you want to upgrade your car just go to the dealer and select tune
the thing that makes this game better than the first is the fact that instead of just winning money you win new cars too
there are  kinds of races
special endurance rally and gran turismo
special is just a normal race for different horsepower or drivetrain
endurance is for people who like    or up to  laps
you can usually win  for first place
rally is offroad dirt driving and you need a special car
sometimes you can win one or you can buy one for  normally
gran turismo is racing around the world
you pick races in different countries and race
if you beat the pacific league or the atlantic you unlock a new set of races
like the first there is license training but most arent too hard
the hardest one in my opinion is the super license test where you must beat laguna seca with a viper
it sounds fun but the viper is always spinning out of control
the rest are fairly easy but getting the gold tip if you get a gold on all license tests the you unlock more races on all is very hard
if you have trouble watch the demo and try to recreate it ecactly
this game is so cool
i bought it a long time ago and its still practicley the only game i play
buy iti got this game when i got my psone back in july and i simply love it
if you love cars and just pure racing this ones for you
with over  cars and actual reallife tracks this game is as close to the real thing as you can get
this game focuses on the pressure to win
no jumps or shortcuts
just pure racing the way it should be
keep in mind this is not public street racing like sf rush but thats the way real gran turismo racing is
i like how you can upgrade your cars to be crazy fast machines
the driving is very realistic and you really learn how to use oversteer and understeer to your advantage
the bottom line isthis game is the one everyone needsgt has more cars than the first series but these cars are still in the series then eventually deleted by its publisher
subaru impreza mitsubishi gto nissan skyline ford mustang and many other cars are included in this versionso in disc  or simulation mode you have to race for money
get first place at all the races to get bigger amount of credits
i would recommend as your first car toyota supra  or  version
why
its fast not like the other cars
then move on with the next cars
as you progress after some races youll be awarded with new carsgo to my home for changing cars if you have  or more cars
you can also see your status
also you can sell cars
first look at its value
then if youre happy with it highlight sell and press circle or x to proceed to sellingto conclude this review i firmly say that drive safely in real worldi have searched for ever to find a racing simulator that actually simulates real drivingracing
gt does that and with a ton of other fun factors
graphics are good not super great but good
im not complaining im just saying that they arent the best see final fantasy ixthe car control is realistic even more so with a steering wheel
in addition you can purchase simulation tires for your car which makes it even more close to reality and therefore much harder to drive
whevener i race against my friends in the wonderfully designed head to head mode i always destroy them since they are so used to the unreastic arcade racers and cant even keep the car going on the straightawaysthe courses offered include somwhere around forty real racecourses from all around the world accurately rendered and designed to scale
everything from laguna seca to grindlewald to pikes peakthe cars
dont get me started on the cars
there are over  to start with
some of them can only be won but most can be bought
the cars are all priced according to their newness performance and class
in addition to being able to tune your cars to whatever extent you desire ie take a hp diahatsu and make into a hp monster that can beat a stock vector m there are specific model or manufacture championshipstheres something special about being able to choose your daily driver car and take it for a spin around seatles street course and recognize its handling
the only complaint i have is the lack of any italian sports cars ferrari lambourghini etc
they do include porsche but only as a tuned ruf version which is nothing to complain aboutoverall gt is the best simulation racing game in the world
viva polyphonyi was debating buying this game for so long but now that i bit the bullet and found it used for  thanks to amazoncom i have never felt so happy this game brought back so many old school feels of me racing listening to my jayz and wutang albums eating fruity pebbles at am trying to run a race before school it was the best now that im older and appreciate those times even more it makes it all the more fun
thanks amazon and the guy who sold it to me for gt is one of the alltime classics in any genre
the variety of cars is staggering and the physics model is topnotch
even with the advent of four new gaming systems since gt hit the scene the graphics hold up pretty well
its a must for the collection of any gamer that even remotely enjoys cars and drivingthe grandaddy of racing simulations for the playstation has a second childhood with gran turismo  with tons more tracks cars and options this time around it has the makings of being a virtual racers dream but can gt live up to the originalhighly anticipated eagerly awaited sequels to million selling blockbusters usually have a knack for disappointing but with gran turismo  the playstations premier racing sim only gets bigger and better
for drivers who loved the challenge of the first but who long for more cars and courses your prayers have been answered with over  cars and auto makers like volkswagen audi and mercedesbenz joining the mix as well as classic cars from the s and s
a rally mode has also been added for more replayability and different racing strategy as well as a game status screen that gives you the lowdown on all of your racing accomplishments
even with these new extras gt is still solid as a rock
each new car has been added with the same painstaking detail as the original and the new tracks as well as some old favorites also hold up pretty well
there have been some minor changes in gameplay like the addition of tire and car damage occurring during the race and massively affecting your handling and horsepower limitations have been placed on most races placing more of an emphasis on handling rather than on power alone
all in all gt does a remarkable job of staying true to the original without seeming old or tiresome
the glorious graphical detail of the first gt has been tarnished slightly with noticeable seam breaking and popup which have to be a product of disc limitations even though gt is a twodisc set and the psx showing its age
but the car models are still top notch the sense of speed remains accurate and the replays are still a joy to watch
the minor graphical complaints would probably not be so distracting if we werent living in the age of dreamcast
sound in gt is again top notch
the cars sound real down to minute changes in tone after you make highpowered modifications
the game includes a great modern rock soundtrack from the likes of garbage stone temple pilots foo fighters and filter
these tunes will keep you from popping in your own cds to cover up the usual videogame racing fare
the gt series will always be remembered for its control
not only while racing but also for the unlimited tinkering one can do on their car
more modifications have been added this time around but the feel of driving remains the same
newcomers may find it difficult to compensate for the differences between front rear or fourwheel drive but for old gt pros it will come back as second nature
even though gran turismo  shows its age and its systems age and rally mode doesnt live up to the rest of the game gt is still as close as you can get to the real thing and always worth the driveyou dont have to be a crash fan to buy this this will keep you hooked for at least a month and its  of those games that used to make me get up at  in the morning
its like mario cart were you drop bombs behind you and there are all sorts of power ups to collect
this has the usual collecting items thingas a big crash fan i could not help but love this game
not as good as crash bash because its too easy but enjoying all the way
another naughty dog classic with your favorite bandicoot in it along with dr neo cortex tiny tiger coco n gin dingodile polar pura ripper roo papu papu komodo joe pinstripe fake crash penta penguin and more
i cant wait until crash nitro kart the game that will be coming for the playstation  two thumbs up
plus its one of the games that does not get tiring
as dingodile would say gbyeplayed mario kart
this game takes those fundamental game ideas and expounds on them beautifully
with amazing gameplay and flow this game is a solid buy
plenty to do for every type of gamer
a true diamond in the roughthough this is not a real classic crash game it still beats the rest
this was the first video game i ever got it was  and im still playing it
it is a real simple game to beat when u are going for trophys but then it get challenging
i doesnt have good graphics but im not to picky about graphics when it comes to this game
all in all ctr is so fun it will keep you playing for hoursfun to play especially if you have a young child
youll enjoy playing this with your kids and theyll love playing it toothis video game is so fun
you can either play as crash some of his friends or even his enemys

gocart
game
everthe introduction of my review and the storyline of the gameim completely aware that nintendo invented the way this game works but i like this version better then mario kart
crash team racing ctr is much more creative
the storyline is that theres this new alien from outer space named n oxide whos come to earth to brag about his racing skills and is challenging crash friends and some of his past foes to see who the best driver is
of course they all think that they should be the one to race oxidethe racesof course this means trouble
you must choose your racer from crash coco polar paura cortex n gin tiny and dingodile
then you must outrace the other  competitors in  races to gain the right to race oxide
dont think you get away from facing bosses in the game
there are  bosses including oxide that you must race
when you have  trophies you have to race ripper roo
when you have  you have to race papu papu
when you have  you have to race komodo joe
when you have  you have to race pinstripe
when you beat pinstripe he gives you the last key that you need to unlock the front door of oxides spaceship
after youve beaten oxide hell tell you that you have to collect all of his time relics introduced in crash bandicoot warped and beat him again to prove that youre the fastest driver
i never managed to beat the game with all the relics so i cant tell you what happens after youve beaten him with all of thosethe controlscrashs controls are very solid
they used to spoil me a lot
but the controls in this game are very basic and easy to use
the left analog stick and the directional buttons steer your gokart the x button accelerates the square button puts the brakes on the circle button uses any weapons that you can collect i never paid attention to what the triangle button does so i couldnt tell you i dont remember what any of the shoulder buttons do so i cant tell you that either
but they respond amazingly wellthe tracksthere are  tracks plus several bonus tracks that i cant count them all
i know that the boss tracks are roos tubes papu pyramid dragon mines hot air skyways and oxide stationthe multiplayer featurethis is the first crash game to feature a multiplayer mode
im going to list all the things that you can do with  playersyou can race through any of the tracks that you have unlocked in story mode with or without computer players and you can battle in an arena
however to play with  players you must have a multiadapterthe closing to my reviewallinall ctr is a great racing game
i really recommend ithere come memoriesthis game was the first racing game i ever bought and it is by far the best racing game out there
fun tracks funny and interesting characters you name it this game has it
naughty dog knows whats good
i still have this game and im keeping it foreveri know that nintendo invented the cart racing genre with mario kart and usually when nintendo comes up with an idea they outdo everyone else
but here we have an exception
crash team racing outdoes mario kart in so many ways that it puts mario kart to shamectr basically uses the same weapons as in mario kart
they may look different and be called different things but they basically have the same effect
the two best weapons to have are the guided missile and the warp orb which when juiced up can cause all the racers ahead of you to crash and put you in first place
when you collect and hold ten pieces of fruit you go faster and your weapons are quotjuiced upquotwhat really sets ctr apart from the other racers out there is its adventure mode where you race through different circuits to unlock more racers and courses in arcade mode
the game is actually very similar to a crash adventure game in that each course has three objectives
first you have to come in first place on the course
then you have two more things to earn on the coursea relic for beating a certain time and a gem that you earn when you collect the letters c t and r from the course while also finishing in first placethere are also boss levels where you have to race against a boss on their course which can be very difficult
there are also a few gem collecting levels where you are in an arena and have to collect all the gems in a give amount of time
these additions may not be incredibly fun but they at least add a little varietyfinally i enjoy the multiplayer mode in ctr much better than that in mario kart
you can play with up to four players splitscreen either racing or playing in a battle arena trying to take out the other playersoverall ctr is a very solid game
for all i care there could never be another cart racing game made again because this is the best one i have ever played or probably ever will play unless there is a sequel to ctrgraphics   some levels have unclear pathways but the backgrounds are stunning and the characters are fulfilling in their designssound   it makes all the right sounds for a car
engine the wheel breaks all that sort of stuff
the crashing sounds are good and the characters who speak do so clearlyvalue   this is fun to play with or without someone to do so with you
youll do the same races over and over and youll never get sick of them
totally worth the money crash team racing has the power of longevityoverall   this is probably the best racing game ever
yes including gran turismo
crash bandicoot seems to be taking over playstationwow ie
people used to go really nuts i should say extreme over playstation gams and sony systems
that is why i have one or more than onepositive fun advanced techniques add depth to the gameplay great controls excellent adventure mode time trial mode is cool awesome tracks excellent music and sound effects lasts a long time overallnegative bosses have unlimited items no crash detection when bumping other kartscrash bandicoot was one of the leading franchises on the playstation and for good reason
a few topnotch games rightly earned him the position
after a few great d platformers naughty dog decided to take crash to the racetrack in crash team racing ctr a solid kart racer that has much more to it than your average mario kartctr is a blast to play
the controls are great and there is much to master if you want to race with the best methods
if you play as a character like crash or cortex you can make it around most curves by simply turning
however proper use of drifting can become extremely beneficial and it is a much harder technique than in mario kart and takes a lot to fully masterjumping is also a key to winning races
by pressing r at the top of any kind of bump ramp etc
you can get a boost upon hitting the ground provided you manage to get enough air
this element is really cool and certain courses require lots of strategizing with the jumps to make shortcuts and get the most boosts possiblethe weapons are also great
they are mostly modeled after basic weapons found in most racing games homing missile bomb that rolls in a straight line potions and tnt to drop behind you shield etc
however you have the opportunity to upgrade your items within the race by collecting  fruits
this puts all items you get in an upgraded form as long as you have the fruit its a neat elementbelieve it or not ctr actually has a story
an alien named n oxide has decided that he wants to turn the world into a giant parking lot
therefore its up to your character of choice to save the world from too much asphalt and a lot of white lines
you race against  other characters on  tracks and  fast bosses to become the world champion who gets the opportunity to challenge the alien invader
the story is played out in the adventure mode which is the main part of ctr that puts it above the competitionin the adventure mode you have to win a race on all  tracks thereby collecting all the trophies and then finally face oxide
along the way youll race four bosses too including the classic ripper roo and the komodo dragon joe each of which give you a boss key allowing you to reach the next area of the gamewhat did i just say
area
thats right naughty dog found it impossible to stray entirely from platforming with crash
the game actually has a pretty big world containing five areas and you get around by driving
you enter a level on warp panels or something of the like and race from there
its really neat way to do a racing game and its much more fun than picking and choosing what to do from a menuthe adventure mode also has extra stuff to get
youll be about  done with the adventure if you quit after getting the  trophies each level also has a ctr token and relic
there are also four battle courses to get ctr tokens on plus a handful of gems
so as you can see there is a lot to do in the main mode but to be honest its not all that difficult to complete overall
still its fun to do and lasts a while and does present a few challenges
i can almost guarantee youll play through this mode more than once if you own the gamealmost all of the games  courses are really great
theyre not exactly creative for the most part but theyre extremely fun
its hard to choose a favorite when theyre all so awesome
most of the tracks are dedicated to one specific character
several of them have shortcuts that can be taken by jumping with perfect timing and they can be quite difficult to make so more advanced racers can take the lead with ease provided theyre really good at getting the shortcuts that isof course there is also a regular grand prix mode like any other racing game
you probably wont get around to it until youve beaten the adventure but its there
there is also a battle mode also like most other racing games as well as multiplayer of coursethe time trial mode of ctr is really good
not only do you go for the best time possible you can stop the clock by hitting yellow boxes with numbers on them
this adds a cool element to the time trials and makes it so that you can get huge cuts in your timesthere are quite a few characters in the game
you start with eight crash cortex coco tiny ngin dingodile polar and pura
you can later unlock the adventures bosses too as well as a couple other characters
the original eight characters can be used in the adventure but only one per save file and you cant change them
weight isnt an issue in the game but turning speed and acceleration are the main statisticsgraphically ctr kept up with the times
theyre really not bad at all and playing it today isnt an eyesore
the sound effects have always been a strong point in crash games and ctr is no exception to the rule everything from shooting a missile to getting hit by one has a great sound effect
the music is pretty good too and youll undoubtedly agree that its a true classic in that senseoverall ctr is an excellent game
its the most solid racer ive ever played and it adds more to the normal racing formula with a great adventure mode a neat time trial method and having everything else your average racer of the day should have had
i highly recommend you get this game if you have any of the playstations its one racer not to be missedgameplay graphics sound value final score i got this game when it first came out and i was extremely pleased
excellent graphics fun adventure mode lots of secret characters one of them is extremely hard to get
 awesome battle mode and its multiplayer
you could have a  player race a  player battle which is where carts go headtohead trying to hit each other with various collectable weapons in a continuous area to a certain number
if you like playing by yourself play adventure where you play and beat each track
or do time trial and get some good times on selectable tracks
superb game no flaws and tons of fun
excellent choice for a playstation gamethis is a great game it has kept my six year old and husband busy for hours and they have not lost interest yetive played a few racingkart games in my time and i have to say this is one of the best
the control is wonderful
while other games may have you pulling your hair out about keeping your car going in a straight line these karts handle wonderfully
the tracks are rarely too hard to beat but watch out for the bosses  they have an unlimited number of a certain weapon so that will keep you on your toesoh yeah
the graphics arent too shabby eitherthis put the kart racing genre on the map
a fun game with many secret bonus characters  i you have ever played magical racing tour this game is easier
in some parts like getting the coins and letters ct and r it is harder though
if you want to find a shortcut to this game and any other game go to gamesagescom  this is a very fun gamethis game is one of the greatest games ever on all consoles
amazing artwork and great gamplay all together
i would only make one thing better
i would make harder ai
but dont even think about not getting this gamei can tell you that this game is fun for  years
ive been playing since i was  and i still enjoy it
im really happy that sony still sells ctrand if you never bought the gameyou are not a human beingyou must buy this game for christmasits great
i like the versus modethe tracks even include a colliseum and a station
eight wacky characters are allowed to play as at firstand as well as a few secret charactersohand another one of the tracks is a hot air skyway
another is a templeand one is a road parkto look at some tracksyoull love this gameso that means if my dad enjoyed it it musta been an extremely good game to playwarningthis game is really addictivemany people are very opinionated about their racing games but this one to me is top notch
if youre a crash fan as well as a racing fan then you need to get this
a wide variety of playable characters i dont even remember and tons of tracks
this is a must have for anyones playstation collectionwasnt on my classics list but had the urge to get it
great game
i used to play the demo for hours on end
i never really played the crash adventure games but ctr was one of my favorite racing gamesfrom the creators of the crash bandicoot series comes mario kart racing for the psx
built on a brand new game engine crash team racing is one of the best looking racing games on the psx with detailed environments and high framerates
select one of eight different characters to race across more than  different track in adventure time trail versus gran prix and battle modes
take your favorite crash bandicoot character and race him against  of your friends for bragging rightstheres a new mad scientist in town and his name is nitros oxide and hes about to wreak his own havoc on this little island paradise
hes absolutely obsessed with speed and fast just isnt fast enough for him so he concocts a crazy idea to speed the whole world up forevertune your own wheels pick up goodies and watch out for those environment hazards
this game boils down to pure racing funin my opinion this game is better then mario cart
crash is back with all his friends and enemies in a winner take all racing game full of nitro missiles and spinning tiki masks
this game is so much fun alone or against othersi still regard this as the best re when you think about it re is half a dozen games  scenarios between the main characters plus  unlockable scenarios with secret characters
thats not counting the arcadelike extreme battle mode and costume rewards
add that to the perfect balance of suspense puzzle and action gameplay with the fact its strongly replayable and this might be the most robust re they ever maderesident evil  has to be one of the most groundbreaking games ever to hit the original playstation gaming console
not to mention the most addicting
well dino crisis  is probably the most addicting but this game comes nextas i surf around the internet reading peoples opinions and thoughts on video games i like to search for reviews from people who reviewed innovative games back in the day and compare those reviews to the most recent ones to see if the general opinion has changed any as the years went by
sometimes a game that seemed unstoppable back in the day wont be remembered today such as earthworm jim
with resident evil  opinions have remained extremely positive all these years later
people are still talking about resident evil  today in  why
what is it about resident evil  that makes people keep coming back for morecould it be an addiction to shooting zombies over and over
that may be it because despite the fact that zombies walk slowly and predictably through each area of the game you explore something about wanting to keep killing them never gets boring
maybe its hearing that pop sound from the handgun and watching a zombie bleed and take a step back to gather their brain dead thoughts that makes the game so memorable
these zombies are actually pretty animated when you consider the age this game was released 
sometimes you walk into a room and a zombie will be walking the other way you shoot and it will slowly turn around and come after you
this is pretty cool
it means theyre not entirely stupid
they know when someone is trying to kill them againyou can literally blow zombies in half with a single shotgun blast
to add even more creativity to the game capcom allowed the tophalf of their bodies to crawl after you after theyve been blown in half
sometimes only two or three handgun shots will kill a zombie off while other times it might take up to eight or nine shots to kill one
its all part of the mystery and uncertainty that makes shooting these bad boys so much funother times zombies will trick you into thinking theyre dead only to grab around your ankle when you try walking past them
you really have to make sure you finished them off before heading towards the next part of the police station
otherwise they will be back when you return
or at the very least make sure you walk around them completely when theyre laying on the ground and dont come near them
i wont spoil anything but using a magnum bullet on a zombie will give you the ultimate satisfaction
i guarantee ittheres no telling what will happen
zombies will simply continue walking up to you until a puddle of blood forms on the ground confirming theyre finally dead
i like the added special touch of having zombies dressed in a police uniform in addition to having female zombies walk up to you and attack
you dont want to hurt a female zombie but you know its either you or her that dies
decidewhat else makes resident evil  still very addicting  years later
maybe its the multiple storylines and all the quests
you see the game is  discs long and each disc contains two different quests
to get the ultimate experience out of resident evil  you need to beat all four quests twice with the female character named claire and twice with the male character leon
each one of these four adventures has zombies and items appearing in different locations giving the game a ton of replay value
of course most of the replay value is found in just shooting zombies left and right
this is very addicting trust me
you will love killing them over and overbesides zombies giant spiders vicious dogs and these disgusting creatures called lickers also occupy the police station
id say lickers are definitely the most complicated enemy to deal with because they have a habit of leaping at you with their claw hanging forward and stabbing you
i love when you enter a room and you cant see a licker but you can definitely hear them
you might hear a ticking sound or a very deep breathing sound to alert you a licker is around somewhere
i cant put into words how disturbingly exorcistlike this game can beto save your game you need to put an ink ribbon into a typewriter
each ink ribbon you find actually holds two of them so you can save your game twice when you find one of these
most ink ribbons are found in the same room as the typewriter but others can be hidden in rooms where no typewriter is found
you dont need to find all of them in order to beat the game but it would certainly help you out in the long run if you store as many ink ribbons are you can
you never know when it might be a good time to savebullets are plentiful
handgun bullets especially
theyre everywhere on easy mode
so are shotgun bullets however make sure you save as many shotgun bullets are you can because towards the end of the game when enemies get meaner and angrier they will come in handy
you dont want to come face to face with three angry lickers and only have handgun bullets with you believe me
also the magnum which is found in the beginning of the game is the ultimate weaponof course shotguns and magnums are only available for the leon quest
in claires quest you have something called acid rounds and a bow gun which are equally as dangerous
they do tremendous damage to enemies which means it would be wise to save them until the end of the gameto heal yourself you need to collect green herbs that are laying throughout the police station and white spray bottles which heal you completely
they are everywhere in the game which means on easy mode none of the four quests are really that hard
just dont go around shooting everything you see and you should have no problem finishing the gamethe graphics are dated now obviously but back in  weve never seen anything like this before
outside on the streets is nighttime and the lights in the police station are dim and just as scary and fitting
its hard to believe how real the atmosphere is
the only negative is that the music isnt quite as good as youve probably read
neither are the sound effects except for the sounds those lickers make
silent hill has the game beat in this areathe only problem is that each of the four quests are between  and  and a half hours long
by todays standards thats incredibly short
however if you add up the play time for all four quests youre looking at a good  hours of zombieshootin
honestly youre supposed to go through the four quests to get everything out of resident evil  something i didnt realize until a year after i bought itsaying this game is groundbreaking isnt really enough
resident evil  opened peoples eyes about the mystery and fascination of zombies and how frightening they can be
capcom showed people how zombies walking around moaning and spitting can catch your attention and frighten you
the zombies shown in movies arent nearly as scary as the ones in this game in my opinion
zombie movies are laughable almost like comedy movies
in a video game its a more serious and terrifying situation
not to mention much bloodier in video game form
im sure you can find me an example of a scary zombie movie but i havent seen one yetit should also be noted that the playstation one had a bunch of similar zombie games available when the console was popular but almost every one of them went by unnoticed
the resident evil series was simply too popular and fun for any imitations to catch on and gain success
then again i havent really played any of the games that supposedly rip off the re series so they might be worth playing as far as i knowresident evil  also helped the whole survival horror genre gain major popularity
before this game the genre didnt really have a proper name
we just called them scary games or whatever
also the play control in this game was excellent not to mention important in helping people understand how to control characters in a d world
the resident evil series might not allow a lot of room to walk around but i dont think its supposed to
youre supposed to get a sense of claustrophobia
you spend the majority of the time in tight hallways and small roomsresident evil  stands proud today as a major achievement in the world of video games and a game people will probably never forget
owning it will do you some goodif you have any kind of playstation that can play the old games and are a true zombie fan then you must play this gamea must own for zombie fan gamers great action chills and good puzzleswhile its not as up to silent hill resident evil is the best original re game you will ever play
the puzzles arent insanley hard better camera anglesanimations and audioyou play as leon s kennedy soon to be a government agent six years later in re but now you are a rookie cop involved with the viral outbreak in raccoon city
you will meet claire redfield the sister of chris from the original resident evilyou can play as either of them
but the best thing is you know how to shake off zombies
and svarier than the uncut re
and in this resident evils rookie mode you get a rocket launcherminigunsub machine gun on the freakin first level of the game
if you are a re freak like me this will make a great addition to your collection
i give it a perfect score while i am begging capcom to reconsider the ground up remake for gamecube i think that it is safe to say that re  directors cut dual shock whatever ediction is currently the definitive version of the game
the aarange mode makes this game slightly more interesteing than the original version and while it makes it overly easy to play on rookie mode nothing is more satifying than a rocket launcher with unlimited ammo
especially on the bsides when youre up agains the tyrant who follows you arround like nemisis does in re  though not as much
the n version had garbled sound and grainey fmvs and was just not worth it but did have one advantage over this version the optional analogue control
update the graphics throw in analogue control and this game will be the best of the series again but only if it keeps all the fun extras that this one has
this is the version i ended up settling forwithout a doubt re is the greatest horror action game ever made
the first one was good but took place mainly in a mansion
re spans out across a city including areas like a sewer police station and even a laboratory
graphically this game is beautiful for its time and holds its own today
the cut scenes were amazing when it came out and still look fantastic
the voiceovers are also fantastic and are very memorable
many of the cut scenes are done with the games normal graphics and this looks great as well
i actually didnt play it till the n version game out but it was still amazing
i remember seeing the trailer when it came out for ps and i was thinking how amazing the graphics and realism was
even the little things make such big differences such as empty shells being released from a gun after shooting it
the game b mode is revolutionary allowing you to have up to  endings
and the tyrant is the scariest video game character i have ever seen
you never know when he is going to bust down a wall and jump at you and his theme music is amazingly scary as well
the first time you shoot him down after you leave the room you see a cutscene of the tyrant getting up and his theme music starts to play that is arguably the scariest moment i have experienced with a video game
many consider silent hill to be the scariest game but i disagree i think re is
re envolks emotions you thought couldnt have happened
having two characters is the best thing about this game though each having different puzzles and weapons and meeting new characters
overall this is the greatest horror action game i have ever played and you should definitely play it as wellresident evil  is most definitely a classic
i remember back in  when the game first came out i couldnt put down the controller
the puzzles and the weapons all were great and fun playing
i wish they would redo the game with the power of the ps that would make it even more fun to play
overall i give rs five of five starsawesome game
classic graphics brin me back to my childhood
i recommend for anyone who like classics and horror gamesthe series of resident evil continues with its sequel resident evil  on playstation released in  and developed by capcom once again
it takes place in raccoon city which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game
this time the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the tvirus created by umbrella
you get to play as two characters leon s kennedy disc one who is a raccoon city police officer on his first day of the job and claire redfield disc two who came into town to search for her missing brother chris redfield who was one of the main characters in the first resident evil game
both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines but it doesnt matter what order you play them inthe gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game
you have to solve puzzles use a limited supply of ammunition herbs to heal wounds carry only eight items and use typewriters to save
its nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and i wish every resident evil game in the series was like thisyou get some new weapons such as a bowgun sub machine gun spark gun and upgrades to leons handgun shotgun and magnum
the aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot
one downside is that auto aim isnt set by default
when you start the game you have to press select to get to the options select the controller settings and set the mode to type c to turn the auto aim feature on
a nice new addition is that the characters current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed
this makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you dont have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game
the item boxes are back where you can store items you dont need and pick up later but a new item you can retrieve is the side pack which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten
both leon and claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story
leon is aided by a woman named ada wong who is searching for her boyfriend
claire is aided by a  year old girl named sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in raccoon city
but even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons
the enemies in this game are really memorable there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful especially later in the game
then theres mr x who is like the terminator he always comes back to hunt you downthe most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game
say you play as leon and complete the game as him well you can then play as claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending
and you cant play claires second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her you have to unlock it first
so in total there are four possible scenarios in this gameanother innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario the number of saves and healing items you use
if you do well you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun gatling gun rocket launcher unlock special outfits and three new mini games
the first mini game you play as hunk whose mission is to escape the raccoon city police department with the latest gvirus created by umbrella
the second mode is known as extreme battle in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the tvirus in umbrellas lab before it can cause a lot of damage
you get to play as four characters leon claire ada and claires brother chris
each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game
the third and final game mode is called tofu and it is the strangest mini game i have ever seen
you play as this giant block of tofu yes i am dead serious a giant piece of tofu and in terms of the objective its the same as hunks mission except you play as tofu who is only equipped with a combat knife so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete
ive completed the mode as hunk but never as tofu
the good news however is that tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run
dont even bother fighting the enemies the knife in resident evil  is just extremely weak and isnt worth the time
still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because tofu says some funny japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt
its funny even though i cant understand it
it is also pretty difficult to unlock you have to get an a ranking at least six times to play this mini game
for the extreme battle and hunk you only need two a rankingsone thing i didnt mention yet is that the music is really awesome
it has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well
there were many different versions of this game
there was an updated version on playstation called resident evil  dual shock edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the playstations dualshock controllers analog stick and vibration function
the extreme battle mode i mentioned is exclusive only to the dual shock edition
theres also a rookie mode which gives the player a machine gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game but you cant unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an a ranking you have to play normal mode to unlock them
another cool thing about the dual shock version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo
you just go to the control settings hold r and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red
this version was later released on the playstation store as a ps one classic on the playstation there were also ports on the pc and dreamcast with slightly better graphics higher frame rate and an art gallery
there was even a port on the game com
it was a sty d black and white handheld console by tiger
that port is just pathetic im not even going to discuss it
the best port however is the nintendo  version
the sound on the nintendo  version is better than the playstations version it has updated graphics new costumes a setting to adjust the violence and blood color a more responsive aiming control scheme new files cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety
the only thing its missing is the extreme battle mini game
but this port is equally as good as the playstations versionany criticisms i have with this game
well its hard for me to think of things i dont like about this game i guess a minor criticism is that you cant skip the in game cut scenes you couldnt do that in the first game and its a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like i did and just want to get through the game
the problem most people have with this game is the beginning
you start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun
the first time playing you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombies corner and kill you
it definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies
my strategy is to just run away
hold square press up on the dpad to run and use upleft and upright to get around the enemies
once you figure that out it isnt too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room
it did take me a while to figure out the controls but ive mastered it and you can too
the voice acting in this game is much better than the first resident evil but still nothing too special
thats about all the criticisms i can think ofwhen i was a kid i used to play the s out of this game and in my opinion this is undeniably not only the best resident evil game but the best survival horror game and one of the best playstation games i have ever played
this game still manages to be very scary if youre playing this for the first time you are guaranteed to be so scared your heart will burst out your chest
trust me i had my jumps even to this day
its more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark with the volume turned up
this makes for a terrifying and memorable experience
i absolutely love this game its just a masterpiece
id recommend getting the version from the playstation store to play on the ps for only  or the regular playstation version or the nintendo  version
those are the best options
the replay value is very high for me and i could play this game at any time
you will admire this game and its by far the best in the entire seriesfinal rating  out of i originally owned this game until it got stolen
i now repurchased it again andwas able to clear it once again
i love this game and the classic survival horrorgenre
this game will make you want to keep playing it until you have cleared every singlescenario there is
not to mention the mini games and awesome unlockables you should notpass up the opportunity to own this game before it leaves amazon or any other outletboth a technical and narrative wonder of its day this game easily set and in a way continues to set the standard in modernday gamingto start off this game is gorgeous
its backdrops are stunningly real and complex its movement quality is superb and william birkin the big baddie is designed better than most hollywood creations i have seen
true i would be lying if i didnt admit to the games visuals as being outdated by todays standard shattering glass and blood effects do look rather silly today
however coming out only a couple of months after final fantasy vii one can see a character model boost
once one person said that graphics become outdated but art remains the same  these locations arent polygons or large sprites theyre coplete setsanother aspect i really loved is the sound
let me tell you that i bought the soundtrack when it was on sale thinking i would never really listen to it much
then i learned why in the end credits three composer names were mentioned the music is actually grand
the ambiant music is terrifying by itself and the music during the scenes is quite amazing and the end credit theme of scenario  is a very powerful track i have yet to hear an equal even from hollywood and squaresoft
also while the voice acting needs work here and there it is a serious improvement over the original and paul haddad who plays leon kennedy suits the character and tone extreamely wellfinally lets talk movie aspects story and atmosphere
both great
the story is rather unique twisty and sometimes powerful
strangely i felt a lot of emotion from annette birkin most of all the zombie creators wife i could feel the love she held for her dead husband who didnt necessarily mean to kill thousands of people and as i played over and over i went from hating her to actually feeling really bad for her
also one particular character dies in two different ways the two scenarios and both scenes are very strong and movie worthy
both scenes feature great music and she dies in a different way with the drama being delivered to you in different ways you have to see it to understand i cant explain well enough myselfall in all if you truly understand it this is one of the few games that can be best described as an experience as you watch it as much as you can play it yet it still focuses on gameplay
my freind sean owns this game and cant stand playing it yet he refuses to return it since watching this game being played by someone else truly is just as good hes proven it to me by sitting and not even looking away from the tv as i play for hours at a time when i play and hes aroundresident evil  is when resident evil was actually a survival horror unlike resident evil  and  resident evil  is actually hard has alot more puzzles and you play as leon my favorite characterthe game play is alot more about survival then just killing zombies sometimes you just gotta learn to run from a fight
the music is perfect
the graphics were great for a ps game
overall i really enjoy this game and if you loved resident evil  theres a chance youll like thisi love this game when it first came out
res was a smash hit for me and i love every time i played itthis resident evil game is the best in the series on playstation system wat can remember about this game u can the dual shock for itresident evil  greatest hits 
the rerelease of the  blockbuster sequel to capcoms survival horror serieswhen the playstation first started out one of the first games to put the system on the map was capcoms first foray into survival horror games resident evil
aside from the earlier series alone in the dark resident evil was the first game of its kind to really bring the survival horror genre to life complete with various puzzles and zombie blasting action
since re managed to build up a solid fanbase capcom was soon called to make a sequel the following year
initially they had  of the game completed and it was supposed to be released in early  but the creators werent satisfied with the way it was going saying that quotit needed a huge overhaulquot
so the original plans were scrapped forcing the fans to wait longer
but come early  the wait was well worth it when capcom unleashed the new and improved sequel the mustown psx game of re was the first title in the series i played and from the getgo i was hooked
when i say that its the best re title to date im not joking as just about everything from the first game went through a massive improvement
im very glad that capcom ditched their original plans so that a better sequel could be made
now im not trying to turn this review into just gushing praise but honestly theres so much to like about this game that beats out the originalfor starters the graphics are vastly superior to the firstgeneration visuals of the previous game
the character models are much more detailed the stillscreen environments are more vibrant but dark and pale enough to convey the games atmosphere and the crappy bmovie quality intro of the original is gone in place of excellent cg movies
the characters and monsters while still somewhat blocky are all brought to life much better now with numerous animations such as head tracking and physical gestures during cutscenes
also when your character takes damage you can now tell how hurt they are by the way they walk
if they hold onto their side and limp on one foot you know that theyre close to death
in addition the newer game engine allows many more creatures to be in the area at one time like when you stumble into a room with  zombiessecondly the sound is brought more into the front this time with howls and screams of the monsters standing out more so than in the last game
its especially noteworthy when something suddenly jumps through glass or breaks a wall
when this happens youll definitely jump out of your seat
as far as scares go itll certainly keep you on the edge until the end
same thing with the musical score
compared to the last game the music is quite a bit more chilling and it seems to know just when something will come out after you
and most importantly the voice acting is thankfully much better this time around
its not perfect but the dialogue and characters are very believable
for instance leons character shows real determination claire is quite sympathetic yet assertive and chief irons comes off as just plain creepy
these traits help distinguish the charactersthe story is also brought out very well
just a few months after the events in the first game raccoon city is overtaken by the tvirus and nearly every citizen has been turned into a zombie
two outsiders a rookie cop named leon kennedy and chris redfields from the first game younger sister claire wander into the monster infested city
the two get split up from one another only to end up in the police station
they soon find more characters and monsters to contend with and discover the deep secrets of the umbrella corporation as the game goes onthe controls for the most part remain the same as in the first game as do the menu options
you still have to backtrack often to quotitem boxesquot to store items you cant hold in your limited inventory menu
this grows tedious but oh well
i did find that the controls are a bit more responsive this time around
the characters have plenty of differentiation in gameplay such as how leon starts with the lighter whereas claire can open locks
plus both feature different weapon arsenals so there are plenty of gunsperhaps the best aspect of the game is the alternate scenario options introduced for the first time
what this means is that if you started and beat the game as leon you then play through the same story through claires perspective and vice versa
the alternate scenario takes place in most of the same areas as the first time but this time you have to contend with the menacing foot trenchcoat wearing neo tyrant
the idea is that hes constantly stalking you and could appear at any time this idea was perfected with the nemesis in re
the scenario features might make the game feel shorter than the original but technically youd be beating the game  times to see all the different endings
theres also a few cool mini games and sidequests to unlock so youve got plenty of replayability hereabout the only bad thing i can say about re was the fact that the puzzles were a lot more simple and not very challenging compared to the others in the series
its a minor flaw though and doesnt take much away from the gameoverall re is an excellent addition to the series and expands the original game to new heights
since its available on multiple platforms now its very easy to come across
new fans should start here or also the gamecube remake then move onto the othersthis game out back in  and it is still my favorite game ever
better than halo  and  all the silent hills  and every other game you or i could think of
now i wont lie it is not scary that is the only flaw to the game but who cares when its this much fun
some versioins have the extreme battle mode which isnt perfect but still very fun
i would give this this game a  out of  but i cant so it gets the when my cousin started talking about the resident evil series i thought i should give them a try
i got this one first since the first one was all out
i got home and put it in the playstation
i loved the beginning part although i was confused not having the first one
first off there are  discs for  different characters leon and claire
i found out later claire is related to chris from the first onethe graphics are cool and the zombies are awesome
i played the game in the dark recommended by a friend and i thought it was as suspenseful as a real movie
the controls are a little confusing at first but then i got used to them
the puzzles are the only really drawback in this cool game
it took me days just to figure out one puzzle
but i got the hang of itif you starve for a grusome game with awesome graphics look no further than resident evil   in fact try all the resident evil games i love them allthis is one of the best resident evil games in the series
ive beaten it dozens of times it never gets boringthis is my favorite game of the series for many reasons
first off you actually start out on the raccoon city streets and get to explore small areas of the city on your way to the police station
once there you explore this creepy massive building
the building itself is old and from another era and its very architectial style helps create loads of atmosphere
theres a lot of enemies and of course your resources are limited as usual
the storys great and you learn more of umbrellas history
the game has two discs and can be played as either leon or claire
its generally the same game but each has slightly different weapons and a few new small areas to explore
the game has multiple endings so to see them all youll need to replay it many times
improvements over the first game have been made such as more zombies on screen at once and nicer prerendered backgrounds
if youre just getting into the series youll definitely want to play this one
this is the one game most fans want to see capcom remake like they did the original
personally i think its the best of the older resident evil gamesgreat game
it brought back those old re memories with the scare and decision making
this was my first re i got and from this one ive loved the series every sincea must for the true re fansi owned this game on pc soon after it came out and believe me theres not a more fun title out there if you love to revv around a city in a vintage s car in the take a ride mode
as for the story mode
who knows  the ability to just get right into it and drive like a madman while cops chase you was too fun and i never touched the story mode of the game
why would anyonethats how long it took to get here in indiana  hours only i couldnt believe it
thank you ever wondered what it would be like to run from the police instead of just pulling over when those pretty red lights are in your rear view mirror
well driver lets you do just that
you are the wheel man in this great game
you start out as exstockcar racing driver who is hired by the local law enforcement to go undercover and infiltrate the local organized crime
but when your hired it seems as though your boss forgot to tell the rest of the force you were a good guy
you begin in a cheap hotel room with a decent ride sitting outside a car similar to a  camaro
you get jobs or missions by answering the telephone in your room
these consist of anything from giving someone a ride driving your car through the front of a store window or even being the get away man for a bank roberydriver pretty much gives you total freedom to go anywhere in the city you are currently at
the controls are very simple to learn but for anyone who wants to realy experience this game i would advise buying a steering wheel it realy enhances the game play
the actual game is pretty tough the police can downright be insanely tough to get away from
the graphics are wonderfull providing great eye candy around every corner
while you drive around the game records your every move letting you later on make a movie of your most recent drive
the options in this director mode are wonderfull
enabling you to recreate those cool car chases from the old s and s flicks like quotgone in  secondsquotoverall driver is a great game that will appeal to anyone who likes driving games
it provides fast furious chases a mix of different scenarios and some great extras
you may find it a tad difficult at first but stick with it and in the end you will be happy you did
dont pass this one up a must for anyone who likes any type of driving gamei played this game when i was young
i remember having a blast with it
so i decided to get it againi had forgotten a lot about the game but i still enjoyed it as much as i did when i was youngerin order to start everything you have to take a driving test
if you have no idea what to do because it ask you to do things you probably wont understand it has a tutorial
it took a couple of tries and i was on the roadit has a main story line that requires you to do driving jobs and make yourself known in the criminal world
the story itself isnt bad but not greatthere is other ways to play
things like time attack dirt track and my favorite survivalthe graphics held up pretty well over time
considering this is a ps gameoh the film editor which allows you to create your own replay is a wonderful idea
something that seems to be ahead of its timedriver is the best game out for psx
the point is to drive around doing missions
the story is something like youre an undercover cop and youre doing missions for mafia groups
its weird but the game s cool
if you dont want to do undercover mode there are a variety of other games
the undercover mode consists of  different cities
miama san fransisco los angelis and new york
each city has different missions and different cars
there is a test at the beginning of undercover mode that people think is really hard but i beat it in ten minutes without ever playing it before
just read the directions
they give it away
this is an awesome game
a must havethis is the best car game ever made
i get so bored with typical racing games
this brings a whole new dimension into video games
to me the most fun part about this game is just taking a drive through the cities
its so great to be able to drive however you want without having to pull over every time you hit somebody
they did an outstanding job in making this gamei use to play this all the time when i was a kid
i remember buying it at best buy wayyy back when it was on sale
just had to get this game back again and keep it safe
never know when ill crave to play it againif you ever had frequent reoccurring dreams of flying from danger this is the game for you
icaruskid icarus can never truely set sail into the air but he sure tries to
your power of flight is in the timing of the jumps and the floating time in the air before plummeting to your doom
this improved verson over nesi never played nes version is fun and the only thing that gets tired is your thumbs
i actually bought it new on release date in  or something from software ect
after much frunstration and frequent deaths i got the groove of the timing and shooting
it has a catchy nintendo style muzak tune and great cartoonlike drawings of greek structures and characters
monstrocities much like rygar get it for fun and put your brain in neutrol and your reflexes to tango modethis game is similar to nes version but its very good game and the levels are very nice and the boss is the challengei bought this game in the summer of  after my hopes were dashed when nintendo failed to announce the development of a rumored kid icarus wii game
taken in the context of what it is a game for the old peasoup gameboy this game was surprisingly well donethe game gameplay and graphics are very similar to the original nes game only better
first of all youll never fall to your death in vertically oriented stages because they can now scroll both up and down
horizontal stages can also scroll in both directions while the nes original was locked into scrolling to the right
pit is easier to control because hes larger in relation to the screen and now has the ability to float down with his tiny wings in a move similar to the raccoon tail in super mario bros if you remember the final stage of the nes version ill just say that this games equivalent stage is designed in the same spirit but fits the context of the other stages much better
the final nes stage was just too far out there
this game tones it down a notch and it just seems to fitextremely fun game
as a kid i was jealous of my friends that had the game when i first played it
i eventually got it for my birthday
played it many times through
only weakness is that there is no save optionkirbys dream land is the first game in the kirby series
in the game king dedede has stolen the magic twinkle stars and if they are not recovered the people of dream land could starve
kirby goes on a quest to recover the stars and save dream landin this game kirby doesnt have copy abilites
instead you can inhale a bomb and spit it at enemies you can eat a bowl of spicy food and temporarily spit fire at enemies and you can inhale a microphone and sing into it to defeat all the enemies on the screen
there are also items such as the invincibility candy pep brew ups and the maximum tomatothis game is really short and simple
it only has  levels and they dont take too long to finish
it is a game made for beginnersthis is a really cute and classic gameboy game
i love iti dont know who the idiot is and dont care
who ever gave this only  stars is an idiot and not really a fan of kirby or a real gamer
this is truly the greatest kirby game
i especially love the main charater
a rolly poley little marsh mellow
he is the perfect example of a boy who is willing to risk all to help others
i love the music too
with its upeat tunes keep you entertained the whole way
the storyline is cute too
anybody eho love kirby should get thisi was actually trying to go and get this earlier but i used up my amazon money for other games and stuff
and now that its ds eshop rerelease is available on club nintendo for only  coins if you dont know about club nintendo i suggest you join and see what its about
its a great service i was able to go and nab this classic at easeso kirby is known as a pink blob that sucks things up and copies enemy abilities right
well here since it is the first kirby game you dont get to obtain enemy powers whatsoever
youll be happy to know however that it doesnt affect the platforming experience badly at all
in fact kirbys dream land as a whole is spectacularthe graphics are some of the best ive ever seen on a game boy game and the music is very upbeat and fun to listen to
to top it all off the gameplay is thrilling
its unlike what youve dealt with in other nintendo classics like mario
not only do you run and jump but you can eat enemies and spit them out at others
oh and you can fly
there are also some cool gimmicks like shooting fire after collecting superspicey curry for a short period of time and being able to fly and shoot out puff clouds during one of the bosses in a similar fashion to shooters like gradiusthe only issue with this game is that it is pretty short
there are only  levels with the th level being composed of bosses that youve previously fought as well as king dedede the final boss
but just because a game is short doesnt mean its bad
and this game is excellentunlike kirby  and kirbys dream land  this game is not totally easy as theres surprisingly a bit of challenge here
plus the music sounds best hereanyways if you happen to own a game boy a gb color or a gb advance this is definitely one game to play
heck you should buy it on the eshop for your nintendo ds if you own one or go to club nintendo and get this without using actual money though this offer will last until the stironically this was my second kirby game that i brought
the first kirby game i had brought was dreamland  even though its the easiest game in my video game library its still great
ive played it several times and yet im not yet bored of the game
it was basic and all yet great
ya see i have a policy about games
every vacations winter midwinter summer regents week etc i replay all of my gameboy games old and new that way i wont be bored and i wouldnt be neglecting them
the graphics and the music i felt were good and the gameplay was averagethis is a classic game
good for anyone into playing older games
does require older system to llay on but it is fu  to usethis game takes the best elements of mega man  and  on the nes and puts them together for a gameplay experience you wont soon forget
youve got rush the robotic dog energy tanks and other innovations
once you defeat the robot leaders youll battle a mysterious foe and then enter wilys space fortresssee the melting clocks in the background
either wily has found a way to distort time or hes in to salvador dalis artwork
give this game a whirl if you have a game boy
it shouldnt disappointcastlevania the adventure is the greatest video game in the world a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a huge castlevania fan you wont be sorrythis was the best castlevainia on the gameboy period
awesome gameplay some new tricks and great graphics for the time
lots of funfirst off this is not the nintendo entertainment system title
dont be fooled by other reviewsthere are no rpg elements to this game whatsoevertwo years after the castlevania adventure was released in  gameboy owners were rewarded for their continued faith in the series
after that lackluster title konami decided to fix a couple glaring problems and the result is castlevania  belmonts revengejumping was a terrible issue originally as the majority of player deaths were caused by jumps requiring exact positioning of jumps usually jumping as christophers heel looked to be the last thing on the ledge
the other cool idea that of whip downgrades after being hit has been toned down with a modification that makes this less common only certain enemies can produce this effect on your character now
the inclusion of this system is more than made up for by the inclusion of special items you now not only have the ability to fling those cool mystic fireballs but get a special item now an axe or holy water if youre playing the us version in the japanese the useful axe is replaced oddly with a holy cross that works like all other castlevania boomerangs
this leads to another good replacement those silly coins found in the obligatory candles possibly a move to freshen the scent of the originals levels from adventure now hold the hearts which we knew youd like to have back
no game feels too much like castlevania without hearts that double as spare bullets
items hidden inside blocks have made their return as well with the familiar pork chops and other things found inside ledges over doors and suchtellingly the soundtrack has improved
the standout theme from adventures stage one battle of the holy is still competitive with tunes from belmonts revenge but imagine the whole soundtrack composed of similar titles we do know the names but only because the japanese versions sound test includes the names
the length of the soundtrack is about the same as that of castlevania  with  unique songs
this compares quite favorably to adventures selection of graphical details are improved while adventures details are very good and solidly constructed they dont quite match those of belmonts revenge
here the generic feel and drab corridors of adventure are scrapped for tiles that are well interesting
different castles have their own themes and the graphics reflect this quite wellenemies are still rather silly looking but more interesting in looks overall
fans of opening up floors with the explosive eyeballs from adventure will certainly be slightly disappointed that their creature is gone
still bosses such as the dual goat statues with spears more than make up for the lack of cheap rotated sprite based enemies
much of the other relatively poorly drawnstufffound in that other game has been replaced here to great effect
the frogs are quite annoying but the game doesnt focus on them you have everything from skeletons to beefy looking iron dolls rather japanese looking suits of armorthe games progression is a breakthrough on the gameboy for the first four stages you can choose what castle you wish to visit first and your stage select screen changes to reflect this untilwell ill leave this up to you to discover
its sufficient to say that the level progression system is the most interesting of any castlevania outside of castlevania  if you discard games that allow you to walk and teleport about a larger overall mapthis game is the highlight of the original gameboys library
challenging yet balanced i firmly believe it is superior to metroid  if youre building an original gameboy game collection this must be one of your first gamesfor those of you who do not know with castlevania you are a vampire hunter fighting dark creatures bats wolves grim reapers in the hunt for dracula
this game is the second in the castlevania series but it adds so much more to it
its not just straight ahead monster whipping you pick up items weapons and use your brain to make it in the game
after defeating dracula in the original game this is now a quest that will take you all over a fantasticly dark world in search for the five parts of the slain dracula
there are several challenges and secrets throughout the game some of the secrets are so difficult it will have you playing for years looking for them
this is also the very first game ever for nintendo games to incorporate the night and day routine
when night falls nothing is safe the towns flood with zombies and the enemies are twice as difficult toowhile im a big fan of castlevania im not really the biggest fan of the old school titles prior to symphony of the night
this isnt to say that i dont like the games done in that style or that i think the metroidvania style is better but it isnt until super castlevania iv that these games really grabbed me
however after purchasing and playing through belmonts revenge i can safety say there is another oldschool cv that gets my motor runningas other reviewers have mentioned belmonts revenge is the sequel to castlevania the adventure and i can happily say that this game is superior in pretty much every conceivable category
this is easily the best of the gameboy games and personally i like it even more than the games in the nes trilogy
great level design one of the greatest bit soundtracks youll ever hear combine with classic yet streamlined castlevania gameplay to make this one hell of a cart
the only real negative to be had with belmonts revenge is the last two bosses require a rather absurd level of accuracy but this is generally the norm with the games in the seriesanyway i dont know any other way to put it
belmonts revenge is not only an insanely great castlevania game its just a great game period
the game caught me complete off guard in a good way and i would definitely recommend it to anyone with an interestit is always a delight when a developer listens to feedback and fixes the mistakes made on a previous title
perhaps you would have to have played castlevania adventure to truly realize how great this game is
it excels with clever platform puzzles excellent boss fights and an endless amount of improvements over its predecessorfifteen years after the events of castlevania adventure christopher belmont throws a birthday bash for his son
but dracula crashes the party kidnapping christophers only begotten whose name is so weird i cant remember it even though i beat this game and saw it in the ending about an hour ago
while naming his children may not be one of christophers greatest strengths belmonts revenge has very few weaknesses as a classic castlevania game and is far and away the best castlevania on the gameboy besting its predecessor and the flawed castlevania legends which has a story so painful that igarashi eliminated it from the official canonchristopher is still anything but fast however he has adjusted very well to his prosthetic legs over the fifteen years since his last encounter with dracula
the graphics best adventures on every level characters are more detailed backgrounds have improved and there isnt any slowdown
this is one of my favorite gameboy games ever however keep in mind i have a heavy castlevania biaswhile the speed issue was moderately addressed the biggest improvement is christophers ability to wield subweapons and supplement them with hearts he can obtain by classic candlesmashing action
only the axe and holy water made the cut but it proves to be enough as christophers whip can still shoot fireballs when its completely powered up which eliminates the need for horizontal subweapons like the knife and cross
the other missing item is the stopwatch but gameplay balance would likely have been screwed up by its inclusion
the holy water gives christopher new leverage against enemies below him and the vertically flung axe means chris no longer has to wait for those blasted bats to descend onto his horizontal plane
other improvements include a password save and the exclusion of chriss whip downgrading after every single hit he takes
there are a couple enemy types that can cause this to happen but it now seems like a gameplay feature and not a way of handicapping the playerthe platforming is much more forgiving than that in adventure courtesy of eliminating the falling platforms that gave christopher no room for error in his previous quest
actually id say the levels themselves are too easy the game didnt really challenge me until the final two boss fights
in some ways its disappointing but not enough to erase the memory of the frustrating platforming from the original which basically forced you to develop a very specific technique to get through each room unscathed forming a very annoying pattern of memorizing level layoutsfor castlevania or gameboy collectors this one is mandatory
a classic vania adventure that is playable fun and diversewhen sega came along with their genesis system it didnt reach the attention of the already popular nintendo entertainment system nes
despite its superior graphics capabilities and sound quality it never touched nintendos sales at least in the states
why
perhaps well never know because i think the genesis is one of the best video game systems ever made right up there with the almighty super nes and this game is one of the reasons whythe goodi cannot begin to tell you how i love this game
its so simple yet a fun game
its hard and youll just be playing more and more just to beat this game
it has twoplayer ability which tends to make it easier subject to your comrades abilities of course
theres only four levels but its four levels of sheer oldschool ultimateness
the graphics are ok if not that great but hey we all know gameplay is what makes the game rightthis actually was the game that hooked me to the genesis
youd think that after playing tons of sonic  aladdin and xmen that i wouldve been thoroughly hooked and while those games are classics this one particular game somehow snatched me by my sensitive areas and told me to buy a genesis which i did with the eversoneeded sega cd attachment
guess im just weirdabout the game since my review would be pretty short basic story is that you with or without your comrade are raised from the dead by zeus to go save athena from an evil sorceror
in each level you transform into a different beast after collecting three orbs first level wolfman second level dragon etc
coolthe badif you find something wrong i highly suggest consulting a physician before dissing on andor playing this gameoverallthis is a musthave for your genesis collection
if you are a sega fan and dont own this game i dont care what your reason is unless you couldnt find it which is somewhat understandable youre wrong
part of my childhood consists of this game
a genesis gem and one of the finest the system ever producedthe genesis dayswhat funwhat a joyhow depressing im so oldanywayaltered beast came with the genesis i bought and its a blastmy first introduction to the new wave of  bit gaming and wow was i hookedawesome graphicsgreat soundan incredible amount of varietyits not a very long game but who careswhat is there is a blastanother one of those long forgotten titles that deserves to be played by todays gamers
altered beast may not be pac man or even sonic but its still an awesome game that should not be forgottenhighly recommendedthe arcade hit altered beast hit the us  and becamethe next game arcade hit  yrs in a row for sega
for  yrssega dominated the arcades with hits like space harrier shinobisuper hang on and now altered beasthowever the version for the pc is one of the sorriest portsof an arcade game ive seen
everything from the graphicsto the sound to the control pale in comparison to the arcadehit or even the  bit genesis versionhowever this will cover both the genesis and pc versiongraphics the graphics for the sega genesis were pretty cool and greatat the time
the pc versionuh
ahh
eeek
the first problem with the pc version of alteredbeast is the fact that the game only ega and vga color modeshowever the graphics still remain a bit of a pioneer cuzthis was one of the first arcade games ported for the genesissound here lies another fault in the gamethere is actually a setup program for the sound but in all thesetup program was unable to recognize my sound card andthus the sound of the game was reduced to those fuzzy and outdated internal pc speaker noises as soundplaying the sound on the genesis was a mix the sounds arepretty cool but nothing really coolcontrol like the sound there is a setup program for the controlsyou can choose between playing the game with the keyboardand using a joystick
however it took both practice and patience to setup the joystickoverall although there were great games made with the limited technology at the time the secret of monkeyisland leisure suit larry eye of the beholder altered beastfails to take advantage of itwell if you have the genesis version of altered beast you are not missing anything because the pc version is just an awful conversion of the great arcade classicspecial significance of my reviewto altered beasti wrote this review not only because i love sega and its game but i come to deliver great news that is that there is a upcoming sequel to altered beast scheduled to berelesed this fall
in fact ive got the game and its really decent sequel to the classicthis is an oldie but a goodie
i also grew up with this game so i repurchased it when i was finally able to find it
graphics are deplorable by todays standards but this game is fun and still a little challenging but like all other games of its time you just have to memorize the patternsegas altered beast is a video game classic
when it came out in the arcade system people would gleefully dump coins into the system to play as one of two resurrected roman centurions in hopes of beating the nefarious neff in the underworld as they rescue zeuss daughter athena from peril
regrettably those who had the original sega master system were likely sorely disappointed with the disjointed and disorganized gameplay that the title had on that platform
the resolution
sega released it on sega genesis where it played better than it did in the arcade let alone sega master system and allowed players the ability to customize the games difficulty there were control options that could enable a person to award or remove lives and health bars in addition to setting the game difficulty
the game itself takes you through five different levels where your centurion battles a collection of ghouls demons zombies and other unpleasant creatures that work to impede your progress
as you battle through each level you must obtain three orbs by vanquishing a blue cerberus whenever it appears on the screen
once you obtain three orbs you transform into either a werewolf a weredragon a werebear a weartiger or the ultimate creature the golden werewolf to defeat neff and whatever form he takes to attempt to defeat you
this continues until you finally vanquish neff and save athena
when you beat the game you get the credits and the option to play again but at a higher difficulty
beat the highest difficulty and you get to play again
not the greatest ending ever but the gameplay makes up for itthe controls are easy to figure out but the gameplay is far from being a pushover
the creatures have amazing abilities but youll need to push them to their maximum limit to make victory a possibility
the moments are never dull and the soundtrack remains one of the most legendary in video game history
this game is a true classic and if you have a sega genesis or get one of the sega comps for the latergeneration systems that features altered beast this game should be considered a mustplayi remember getting my sega genesis for christmas in and this gem came packed with it
what a great title to launch a console withsure ive played altered beast in the arcades and such and i was hooked on it from the start  it was action packed  a great side scroller beat em upi also liked the transformation into creatures aspect plus that morphing screen was awesome  but most of all its funthe genesis version is almost a carbon copy of the arcade classic  the graphics are  crystal clear and they  still hold up well  today for  bit you cant go wrong  with this game after getting the genesis  my nes  and master system collected dust for a long time even in   ill play alter beast every now and thenand its always a great timegenesis does 
what nintendont   you cant play this on nintendo
i  still remember the commercialsgreat times
i wish sega would put out another consoleit would be something speciali reviewed batman why not batman returns this game is loosley based off the  film
its basically a platformer it captures the the dark gritty style of tim burton you go and battle circus freaks catwoman the penguin
let me say this game is hard  and i say get a game geneie cause your going to need to keep you cool and eventually figure everything out this game differed from console to console the genesis was a platformer the sega cd had the same stages but with cool arcade style driving levels the snes was like streets of rage or final fight
the nes version was a beat em up too but was more like double dragon
there was a sega master system port that was only available in the pal region it had the same idea as the genesis but was half aed
i enjoyed batman  returns and forever
i hated batman  robin and s batman tdk was great i hope to review some of the movies from the burtonschumacher era and the chris nolan films
well this game is good but i also recommend the snes and sega cd versionsthis is one of my favorite sega genesis games ever
i love the ending and the gameplay is hella fun
this game brings back memories of the d  bit graphics days
this game is challenging but if you stick with it it is very fun
i love batmans moves on this game but i especially love his kicks
the graphics are good for the genesis but the playability and enjoyment are why you get this gameclassic styled castlevaina game on a bit system
two characters to choose from and lots of levels in many different locations not just draculas castle
this is the only castlevainia for the genesis and was kind of overshadowed by its brother game on the snes but this one is just as good
good sound
nice graphics
the controls are very good but a bit closer to the original nes games than the snes gamesthis game is one of the few where konami gave one of their classic franchises a chance on segas console
the result is this great title which while not as great as super castlevania is a worthy game for your genesis collectionthis is the only castlevania game i ever cared for the music is phenomenal and the graphics are so attractivefirst time ive played this game
it was great i still havent finished it yet and i plan on getting on it sooner or later but first impression is that its greatthis is my first time getting into the castlevania series and man did i pick a great game
castlevania bloodlines was the first castlevania game that featured blood in it
the best feature of this game is the fun factor
sure you dont have the vertical and  degree hit angles that super castlevania has
what it does have is two characters to choose from which defiantely adds to the replay value
i also liked the over all graphics and feel of this game
the dark yet colorful backrounds were very imaginative and looked great
the fact that this game along with contras hard corps were the only konomi games of their seriesthat made it to the genesis makes them special
since i own both of them i can say they trully are great games
back to castlevania bloodlines i must add that the music is excellent
it really captured the feel of the game with its dark feel and scary approach
the only possible downfall is that it is a slightly short game
to the games credit you can change the difficulty which adds to replay value
over all i would recomend this game to both fans of the series and those looking to play a great old school platformeran awesome entry in the castlevania series and one of the best genesis games everdo your duty and pick up a copy today huge starsthis is the sequel to the game golden axe i believe they made three
either way all three are fun
theyre basic games you probably have seen back in the day in an arcade but theyre great for hours of fun
bashnbeat
even more fun with freindsits possible to love old and new things equally
i love this gamethis game is a platformer
somewhat like vectorman or sonic but you dont shoot protons nor do you run like the wind and grab golden rings for no apparent reason other than the fact its tied to your life force
no
you go through levels changing into differnt things
differnt and diverse game play
fun for the whole familythis was a fun genesis game back in the day
got another copy not too long ago and had forgotten how tough this game really is
still enjoy the concept of the game and the gameplay is pretty good
still enjoyable despite the difficultythis is very challenging and fun because you can have multiply levels and  changing helmets with different ablilities to help you in your questyeah theres basically no other way to put it
kid chameleon is a super mario clone
from bashing blocks to jumping on enemies this game has mario written all over it
thats not to say the game is bad thoughit emulates the mario series greatly and that can only be a good thing
there are also some very cool powerups that are exclusive to this game such as turning into a ninja complete with sword
the levels also have really interesting designswhile there isnt really anything else to say about this game if you love mario games you should get this considering there isnt an official mario game ever released for the genesistruly amazing game
i played this game so much back in the s that i memorized and mastered everything about it
the music is catchy and the game is just plain fun
i cant tell you how many hours i logged with it
when i decided to get rid of the sega genesis i still kept this game even after i had no way to play it it was that goodthe goodgraphicssoundgameplayfun factorreplay factorthe baddance animation could have been smootheri saw this at a game shop today
i dont like mj so i bought it to laugh at it
basicly you go through levels rescuing boys
the graphics are poor but the sound is great
michael even talks
sounds like a girl
this is stupid yet fun
buy it if you want something to laugh atass unbelievable as it is michael jackson has made it into sega genesis
this is a great game to play
dance kill the bad guys save the kidnapped girls
what more could you want
oh yeahbubbles the chimpwhats up with some of the negative reviews on here about this game
its a blast to play
its really fun walking around saving kids from the bad guys and dancing them to death lol what makes it even better is you can jam to the tunes of mj while doing all of thisthis game is a nice collectable item for mj fans and people who like to collect rare sega genesis games tooif you see this game for a decent pricethen pick it up while you still cantry to get it with the case and bookletbecause that really ups the value of itthis game i had when i was a kid so i got a sega genesis nomad and i got this for it i didnt play it for a while because i sold my sega and now i got it back thats how fun it is but i had to remember how to kill mr big at the end because its hard to do if you never played it beforelike i said i know what everyone is thinking about by playing a michael jackson game rescuing little kids but step around that for just  minutes while you play it and just accept the fact this this is a great gamethe object of the game is very simple
kids have been taken they are all the same girl appearing  times per level and it is up to michael jackson to save them and stop mr big who
so each level contains  sections where every single level is different from the last and there are different ways to find the missing children
there are  levels and  final stage equaling a total of  normal levels and  flight simulator level so  total
its enough to keep you entertainedin the club level you check all the doors and the windows to find the missing kids
your enemies are bad guys in blue suits and waitresses
in the streets level you have to check the cars watch out some have bombs
your enemies are a bunch of punks and dogs
yes dogs that sound like cats meowing
i found it funny
the rd level is a graveyard even though the game calls it the woods
its clearly a graveyard with tombstones haunted scenery and zombies
unfortunately there is no thriller music even if you do the dance move
so there are zombies and birds for your enemies
the th level is a cavern
this place is really confusing but simple to beat
you spend a lot of time wandering around until you find out you are supposed to spin on the walls with the spider symbol and press upb on the circle symbols to find everyone
your enemies are spiders zombies and guys with guns
the next level is the enemy base i dont get it but you are in a large base from like terminator or robocop or something with a bunch of computers and turret guns
find the kids to win
the enemies are guys with guns
here you get to see mechamichaeljackson
he is a super cyborg robot that flies and shoots lasers
it is freaking awesome and puts transformers to shame
after this michael jackson turns into a car and flies into space
this is the flight simulator part and is very difficult to figure out
shoot down mr big and see congratulations
which is spelled rightthe graphics and sounds are amazing for the sega genesis
they captured everything michael does
everything from the dance the hat toss the crotch grab the spins and his poses
he kicks fairy dust for his attack which i didnt understand until later
he can even moonwalk
all of his trademark taunts if you want to call them that are in herethe music selection is really good and catchy
once the game starts michael walks through the first door flings a quarter into the jukebox as smooth criminal starts playingyou getstage  smooth criminalstage  beat itstage  some song for the graveyard this is where thriller should bestage  billie jeanstage  badstage  i didnt recognize itbottom line amazing game for any michael jackson fan or sega genesis fansi figured that i should right a review on one of the greatest old school scifi action games of all time
im definitely a big fan of both terminator and robocop and this game pleases me a lot
gamers like myself are known to love old games that they feel never get old and even review them and this is worth a good review
i have to say that this game is a high praise because unlike all the other robocop games that are a disgrace to the great character this game brings the best out of him
this game is my second favorite old school terminator game
t the arcade game is number  this game is number  and the terminator for sega genesis is my rd and final favorite old school terminator game
the story is excellent and it perfectly ties the two characters together
basically make long story short you play as robocop and you shoot up punks gangs and occasional terminators in present day detroit then go to the future join the resistance and battle skynet and future terminators
it has a great story line the game play music controls sound fx and graphics are indeed a high praise
robocop not only has his infamous hand gun but a selection of great weapons he can acquire throughout the game
the difficulty is a good balance not too frustratingly hard but not too cheap and easy
one thing about this version that i love is the gore
this is the only old school robocop and terminator game that has heavy duty blood
this is a wonderful game that i could spend hours talking about
robocop is a great hero and enjoyable main character to control throughout the whole game
the animation of the terminator  arnold endoskeletons are at their greatest
this is a great game for both fans alikethe best 
i extremely wish this was available for purchase on the play station store and xbox live arcade  especially an upgrade edition where the bosses in order from levels  to  are thug leader  t  robocop   t  rise of the machines   ed  t  the really muscular t  salvation  ted  aka ted 
 the tx  rise of the machines  and skynet
which reminds me  what were the names of the bosses at levels         ted
and  
who were the voice actors for this  better genesis version 
and finally  if not a live movie of the game  comics  why not an animated 
and it better be  minutes or more longthis game was probably one of the most violent and bloody i have ever played
even by modern standards
but it was absolutely impossible to finish
and i played it with the infinite lives cheat too and it still took hours and hoursthe premise of the game came from the dark horse comics of the same name in which robocops technology is linked to cyberdyne
in order to stop the technology and even himself ever existing robocop must travel to the future and defeat skynet
but not before taking on zillions of ts and ts firstone of the coolest features of the game were the powerups that modified robocops armour or game him massive new weapons
and you needed them as you were under constant assault from all directions
the sega genesis version was the best as the supernintendo had all the blood cut out of it
i hope one day this is reprogrammed for the pcvirgin sure did a great job of making the comic book into a game and how cool would it be to have a robocop vs terminator movie
it would surely be the greatest thing everilove the original robocop from  i liked the  sequels i thought prime directives brought the grit of robo back i absolutely hate the tv show and the cartoons i think t t are great films arnold schwarzenegger was killer especially t
t was just couldnt measure up bu is somewhat half decent
terminator scc is enjoyable
the thought of having robocop go around an teminate terminators was cool in  there was even going to be a film but they probably would have avped us
the game on the genesis plays like  the robocop arcade games
snes version was awful i didnt like it its preferance people
i prefer the gen version alright  levels the first  are gory and are true to the hard a robocop of the paul verhoven flick
all sorts of mayhem like terminators endoskeltons droids cool gam cc aa bb cc aa bb is all i have to say
 cybogs from the future in a game this is a cool game but not the best on the genesisrobocop vs the terminator  based on the award winning comic book mini series is an excellent game hands down
this is the robocop game to ownwhat failed with the nes film gamesis that they never really captured the spirit of the characterto me they were good but they were always a bit watered down  but this game shines all the wayits graphics are stunning genesis keep in mind  the gameplay is tight and action packed  the weapons are kick ass and this time around the auto  has some serious powerthe storyline is decent tooif youve read the comics  you know what im talking about heregoing up against the terminator is still fun this is one of my favorites for the genesiswhich in my opinion is a bit superior to the snes version i own both and the sega version is the one that gets the most  usetheres also  the trademark violence in this game toolots of bloodunlike the  robocop  game   when you shot enemies they burst the blood flies the boss battles are intense and challenging   you can tell they took great care when they were developing  this game   because its quality all the waythis game captures the feeling of the first  films perfectly the soundtrack is  great also  i remember when this game came out  there were some people that wanted this game banned give me a breakbottom line if your a robocop or terminator fanthis is worth picking upthis is one of my all time favorite genesis gamesits so action packedit is based off the frank miller comic of the same namethis version on the genesis is alot better than the snes versionthis versions got blood and gorethe snes version doesntthe game can be kinda tough at timesbut there are alot of pickups and cool weaponssuch as laser guns and machine gunsthe graphics are greatand so is the musici really wish they would remake this gamefor the current consolesthat would be so coolbut until they dowhenever that might bewe can always enjoy this old school classic in the meantimefive stars all the waythis is a great game and is completley different than shinobi in many ways if you liked shinobi youll love this or hate it it all depends on your interests
if you like to just run out their and start killing enemies you wont be very good or like this game
this game requires a little more strategy than the originall shinobi for the genesis or master system did
you have a dog that you need to stun certain enemies to killah shinobi shadow dancerthis game never gets oldi remember getting this game when it was releasedand i still enjoy it to this dayproving once again that the sega genesis was and is an incredible systemhaving been lucky to play the actual japanese arcade gamei was floored to see how authentic to the title it issure there are some changes but its not badand this game is a must own if you have a genesis shadow dancer was originally a side story taking place between the original shinobi and return of shinobithe graphics here are incredibleand really shows off what the genesis can do the music is top notch  especially in the beginning credits the game play is fast and excitingplus this time around our ninja hero  is teamed up with his attack dog yamoto
the bosses are challengingi especially like the fight on top of the statue of libertybottom line if your a fan of the series and dont own this onepick it upyoull be glad you did  genesis doeswhat nintendontshadow dancer is a genesis portremake of segas arcade game shinobi  shadow dancer
in terms of its quality as a port it doesnt attempt to use lesser versions of the arcade titles graphics
the style is unique to this version as well as the music
the gameplay is that classic kind of hard that is challenging but fair
you only have one hit per life but quick players will be able to learn the difficulty and master the control
the graphics are very crisp and clear
while playing this you wont be blind sighted by a wayward bullet from an enemy or have to take leaps of faith to progress
its rather fairly priced and is certainly worth owning
id recommend it for fans of games like contra or the classic ninja gaidenone of my favorite games
complete actiontons of action
genesis is known for opening up to the world of violence in the game industry until mortal kombat dotted the i
unlike nintendo
but this game kick and punch fighting is great a classic
and when you need helpget your dog to fight your battles
fun game graphic is good
for you youngsters born after you wont understand the gameplay nor the technology prior to playstationnot only is this the second part of sonic  you also get to play as knuckles
knuckles has differnt abitlies than sonic
for starts he can climb things and glide for long distances
very fun and challenging sonic platformer
get board with the levels but still wish you could play as knuckles
thats fine
becaus it also attaches to sonic  and sonic  so you can play as knuckles
a nice added bonus which takes this game farlove this game my favorate in the series followed closely by sonic  the only gripe is the bonus levels they can be a little confusing at times but regardless get this game any way you can totally worth itreleased only a few months after sonic  sonic  knuckles has this lockon feature
you can lockon sonic  and sonic  and play as knuckles in both of those games
sounds complicated you say
nope
the top of the sk cartridge has a top you can flip revealing a place to stick another cartridge in it
it will only work on  and  though
simpleas for the game it rocks
review timegraphics wow
pretty impressive for a  game
the backgrounds and sprites are simply colorful and beautifulsounds pretty much the samemusic great music
very catchy and stylishgameplay sonics back bigger faster and tougher than ever
but why play as sonic when you got knuckles
knuckles can climb walls and glide something sonic cant do
there are many worlds with  huge levels eachprosgreat graphics catchy soundtrack good level of challange play as sonic or knuckles bosses and minibosses are fun and interesting chaos emeralds are well hidden fun ring minigameslevels are hugeconslevels are maybe a little too huge wheres tails no player games like anybody cares
maybe too hard for the little ones cant save unlike sonic in conclusion got a genesis
then you have to get thisi have had this since i was little and i still play it between this game and sonic adventure for dreamcast they are the best sonic games you can get just trust me
if you like old school games and havent played these
buy themin my opinion this is one of the best sonic games ever released
it makes up for what i believe sonic  lacks
sonic and knuckles is actually a continuation of sonic s story and features the notorious knuckles the echidna as one of the main characters
you can either play sonic or knuckles in this game knuckles having a little less playing time with fewer levels and all and slight variations in the game for different points of view
let me go about my opinionated statisticslevels huge and often challenging
theyre very detailed and are all extremely original although some parts of certain levels remind me of old sonic games like certain things in flying battery zone remind me of metropolis zone in sonic grade best level flying battery zone nd level and death egg zone th level sonic onlygraphics beautiful clear and colorful
very similar to sonic grade bonusemerald rounds the bonus rounds are new one containing spheres where you spin around and try to catch ringsmore livesshields and a slot round where you can gainlose rings from a slot machine that you spin around it think casino night zone in sonic 
i like the sphere round a lot but i dont care for the slot round because you can lose rings
also in sonic and knuckles you dont have to have  rings to enter a round like you do in sonic  the emerald rounds have different versions but generally theyre the same as sonic  get the blue spheres if you touch a red sphere youre out etc
etc
grade characters sonic and knuckles are both interesting characters to play although i admit i do miss tails a lotgrade music the music i believe is one of the best parts of sonic and knuckles
the music is very catchy and i love it
the flying battery zone theme lava reef zone theme and the death egg zone theme are the best in my opinion but i believe every level theme has its charmsgrade bosses some can be challenging but i found that some of them actually are a little too easy
one thing i like though is that theres a boss after most of the zones and not one just after every level which is similar to sonic grade the only thing sonic and knuckles really lacks is special features basically having no verses mode or options menu
you cannot save games either like you can in sonic  the only real special feature that sonic and knuckles has is its connectability
sonic and knuckles in itself is a separate game but it can also be connected to sonic  or sonic  for alternative gamesif you connect it to sonic  it becomes sonic  and knuckles and its basically knuckles playing through all the sonic  levels
this might not seem very new to most people but with knuckles climbing and gliding abilities you can often explore parts of the levels in sonic  that you were never able to do beforehowever when you connect the game to sonic  you get possibly one of the greatest sonic gaming experiences ever
if you play sonic  and knuckles you are able to play through all the sonic  and sonic and knuckles levels with sonic knuckles or tails
you get all the extra features of sonic  verses mode saving abilities etc
with exception to the sonic  level themes all the sounds throughout the game are sonic and knuckles based and you have access to all three bonus rounds the gumball round from sonic  and the sphere and slot rounds from sonic and knuckles and obviously twice as many emeralds to get
if you obtain all the emeralds you can become either hyper sonic or hyper knuckles which is also pretty cool
even tails has a super mode
basically for all sonic  and sonic and knuckles lacks as separate games sonic  and knuckles makes up for it with unbelieveable gaming fun
it is the epitome of sonic gaming and is the model for all sonic gamesits unfortunate that sonic and knuckles is so rare now but i highly recommend it for anyone whos into sonic gaming
get one now before its too lateoverall game review find me ignorant if you must but i never owned this game before
when i finally bought it i was thinking that it was just a sonic  expansion
i did not know that you dont need sonic  on the top of it to play it and that this was its own entity
that was a very pleasant surprise
rebuilding my video game collection i had bought a genesis for my so and i wanted to buy her all available sonic games for the genesis with her being an avid sonic fan so i found all of the games this being one of them
i enjoy playing this game as well as she does
i recommend this game to sonic   and  fansthis by itself is a great gameplay as either sonic or knuckles and blast through stagesthe graphics and levels are great and its simply the best in the series at least the genesis era serieswhen you put sonic  onto this game you get a true masterpiece on your hands especially if you play as knucklesi say get this game you wont regret itthis is a review for sonic  amp knuckles not sonic amp knuckles single
well this is a great game
my sonic charts are
sonic  master system
sonic adventure dreamcast
sonic advance game boy advancejoint  sampk and sonic  megadrive or genesis in the states
sonic adventure  dreamcast gamecube and psthis game carries on straight from sonic  the death egg crash lands on angel island and eggman meats the owner knuckles
knuckles makes friends with eggman and gets convinced that sonic amp tails are bad guys
so when eggman hears that there is a master emerald on the island making it float eggman tells knuckles that sonic is after it
sonic is having a break flying in the tornado biplane with tails when he notices the island
sonic is keen to explore but knuckles steals all of south islands chaos emeralds from sonic
plus he sees badniks roaming the place
so sonic sets off to stop robotnik and get the emeralds back
the plot twists and turns and in the end it turns into sonic tails and knuckles fighting eggman in space
heres a list of the awsome levelsangel island hidrocity marble gardens carnival nights ice cap launch base city mushroom hills flying battery sandopolis desert lava reef knuckles hidden palace sky sanctury the death egg zone domesday nuclear secret zoneim not sure how you unlock thisverdict a great game that involves action adventure and sharp platforming skills
should be in every genisis collectionthats right
i got this game for christmas brand new
that was such an awsome december
i never put down this game and still play it on my og
seganomad
i even played this game in college
this game was so freakin good
probably the last great true sonic game before sega started to fall off
i reccomend this game to anyone that missed it or anyones thats curious about it
of course i will warn you if your a new gamer meaning from the post cartridge era excluding n
this game is old school hard and there is no magic memory card to save your hiney
when you play sonic you play sonic
so if your from the newer game generation and are used to being pampered by mystical frame rates rumbling controllers an option to save and online support you my friend are better off left playing suck boxthis review is so long cause the game originally was suppose to be one game but due to time constraits the gam had to be cut in half resulting in  sonic games
sonic  when compared to sonic  and  is a major step
with more options forverses mode and saving ability sonic  introduced a lot more options for sonic gaming funthe game also introduces the character knuckles the echidna whom of which is the guardian of angel island where dr robotnik lands after his defeat from sonic  dr robotnik manages to convince knuckles that sonic and tails are the ones who want to cause trouble so knuckles often gets in the way and makes things difficult for sonic and tails during the entire game
in verses mode you can play as knuckles as well as sonic or tailsin the usual game you can play as sonic and tails sonic alone or tails alone
one thing i really like about sonic  as opposed to sonic  is that tails can fly which often gives him a great advantage over playing sonic
when you do  player with sonic and tails tails can often fly sonic to high places but its not a long time before tails gets tiredbasically for sonic  the thing that was improved the most over sonic  was special features and graphics
not only did they add a verses round but they added more options such as time track try to beat your best time w separate characters
also the saving mode allows you to save where you left off from and also saves all your lives and continues
once youve completed the game you can go back and play any level you wish on your saved game
you may delete any saved game that you want at any time and you can even play no save
tails can fly which is an awesome feature
and another added bonus is the addition of shields to the game
in sonic  the only shield that existed was the protection shield good for one hit so sonic could be spared his rings or a life
however with sonic  three new shields replace the old protection shield
the flame shield protects sonic from any flame or fireinduced harm even lava
 the water shield protects sonic from drowning and is very useful in hydrocity and other levels since sonic  has a lot of water and the lightning shield which protects sonic from a lot of electric hazards and also attracts rings by magnet
sonic can do specialized moves with the shields but even when lacking a shield sonic can do an instashield which is useful when a hazard is near
tails can also use the shields but he cannot do specialized moves with themoverall sonic  is a great game but does lack in some departments
if you want a more intense gaming experience buy sonic  and sonic and knuckles together and play sonic  and knuckles
sonic  and knuckles is quite possibly the best sonic game ever and eliminates all the flaws of sonic  and sonic and knucklesso this time sonic must traverse the rest of angel island after bringing down the death egg again onto a volcano and stop dr robotnik once and for all
however tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as knuckles the echidna for the first time
he taunted and tricked you all throughout sonic  but now you can rip through the stages as him or get your revenge on him at last with sonic
either way sk holds up as its own giant adventure with the same size of levels graphics engine powerups and other features as the previous gamein sonic and knuckles sonic must traverse the rest of angel island after bringing down the death egg again onto a volcano and stop dr robotnik once and for all
however tails is gone for this round in place of being able to play as knuckles the echidna for the first time
he taunted and tricked you all throughout sonic  but now you can rip through the stages as him or get your revenge on him at last with sonicsonic and knuckles cartridge has a lockon featureif you stick it onto sonic  and youll get the massive adventure that sega wanted to release all along  in other words the best sonic game ever
play as all three of the furballs going through both games and collecting chaos emeralds to become superforms but when u lock sonic  with sonic and knuckles after the sonic  section theres a special ring which after collecting all the chaos emeralds u have to unlock the super emeralds which unlock hyper sonic hyper knuckles and super tails
on top of that stick it onto sonic  or any other genesis game and youll now have access to unlimited random special stages styled from sonic story gameplay music i give this game classic game incredible smooth action packed and fast
a must own for sega collectors and sonic fans alike
music is also some of the best in the serieswhile nowhere near as good as sonic sonic and knuckles is better than its predecessorthe plot is basically sonic  continuedwith sonic and knuckles looking for the lost chaos emeraldshoweverdreggman is looking for them tooso he can use their power to fly the death eggthe graphics are noticably betterand playing as knuckles is fun beyond beliefthe music is awesomewith some tunes that you are glad stick in your headoverallthis was definetly the last good sonic genesis gamethis was sonic in his last d triumphsonic and knuckles was made to expand sonic  by  and gives you a greater reward for collecting the emeralds twice throughout the game hyper sonic an even stronger version of super sonic that is truly a sight to behold
you have the genesis why not sk
youre literally missing half of sonic this game is pretty short but a little challenging especially without somebody else to help you like in sonic the hedgehog  and  but still pretty fun
the hardest challenge has to be getting all the chaos emeralds and becoming super sonicsuper knuckles but thats just how sonic games are
its also really fun if you own sonic the hedgehogsonic the hedgehog sonic the hedgehog  for the genesis
you can put the cartridges together to have some more fun
of course you probably already knew thatsonic the hedgehoga new special stage game where you have to get all of the blue spheres similar to the sonic  and sonic and knuckle special stages just there are so many stages and when they all finish they repeat and this time around their fastersonic the hedgehog knuckles is now playable as a third character in sonic  and knuckles can now go places sonic and tails could never go beforesonic the hedgehog probably the best game to go with sonic and knuckles this makes the game even longer putting together the stages of sonic  and sonic and knuckles
sonic  and knuckles is one of the best games ever
some paths are even exclusive to knucklesthe game itself without the extensions of the previous titles is very impressive and its really disappointing how segasonic team doesnt make games as good as this anymore
if you dont have it i suggest you treasure sonics glory days and get it
you wouldnt regret itif you liked sonic  youre in luck
sonic and knuckles has about  of sonic elements  levels  tails  save fileswhats even better is that the cartridge contains lockon technologywhat is it exactly
you plop sonic  on top to play as knuckles in sonic 
plop sonic  on to combine the two games together
sonic  on top unlocks blue sphere a game made out of sonic  special stagesso yeah
sonic and knuckles is the second part of sonic  and it is just as goodthis is one of the best spiderman games available
right up there with maximum carnage and the recent spiderman  the animation is smooth and making spidey webswing is is not a chore unlike some of the earlier spiderman games
the boss battles against spideys rouges gallery are all very comic booky and i like how taking pictures during the levels is integrated into your overall success
if theres only one gripe i have about it its that it is very difficult
other than that this is a very well done gamespiderman otherwise known as the amazing spiderman vs the kingpin on sega genesismegadrive is truly an awesome superhero experience
it manages to nail down a lot of important character traits while translating these to gameplay and the game works out wonderfully for itas spidermanpeter parker youre dropped into a platforming action game where you have the ability to climb walls web swing across the city skyline and shoot spidermans trademark web shooters
while the combat here certainly isnt as varied or deep as something like maximum carnage the level design here is wonderful and makes up a lot of what makes the game so great
there are air vents to  crawl through walls to climb hidden powerups to collect
its a ton of fun just traversing these levelswhat also helps is spidermans ability to take photos during these stages which parker then sells to the daily bugle to support his superhero antics
with the money he earns he spends it on the web fluid he needs as spiderman
this is a great addition to the game as its done very well its a lot deeper than you initially imagine it being photos become an essential part of this game and its absolutely character appropriate
on a regular basis youll earn  for taking photos of regular enemies and upwards of  for photos of super villains which appropriately make up the end bosses of these well designed varied stagescontrol is pitch perfect
climbing walls web slinging around and generally being spiderman all feels natural to the sega genesis
the game does a great job of making you feel like you can do whatever a spider can
the web slinging web shooting and even the basic  attack combat controls are superior even to some of the more recent bit spiderman outings
the web slinging feels extremely fluid especially when compared to the game based on the animated series or even the glorious maximum carnagegraphically the game fares ok this is an early genesismegadrive game after all
some things arent as detailed as i would have liked to see in a bit game of this type but for the time this released the visuals are definitely serviceable
there are great static cutscene images that look as though they were ripped straight from the comics and all of the characters are immediately recognizablethe boss fights in this game require a fair bit of trial and error to complete
while you may be able to get by with just beating down some of the bosses and hoping they die before you do for a lot of these encounters youll have to rely on a solid strategy
its about memorizing patterns and exploiting them
initially i hated some of these bosses
electro being the main offender
however once i played the game more and figured out how to take these bosses out i could get past any of them with minimal troublethese boss fights and the beating youll initially take from them lead me to the way health works in this game
while there are health pickups found throughout some of the levels most arent nearly enough to fill your health bar all the way if youve taken a moderate amount of damage
this is where peter parkers apartment comes into play
the entire game is set on an ingame hour timer
the timer moves quite slowly far from realtime though mind you but when you return to parkers apartment it speeds up significantly
this is because returning to the apartment is used as a means to regain lost health
you take spidey back there let him rest up for about an ingame hour about  seconds in realtime then youre back at the beginning of the level you left off
much like the photography mechanic this health system is also quite deep and works well considering the timer here was made with great care
its lenient enough to give you more than a couple of hours to spare yet when you die and have to continue youll lose  hours on the clock
granted there are unlimited continues as long as you still have time to spare but its almost always better to heal up at your apartment than to flat out die
the extra ingame hour you save is worth itthe audio here isnt spectacular
a lot of the music fares well enough though its nowhere near maximum carnage green jelly quality
the sound effects for punches kicks etc dont sound all too wonderful either
from an audio standpoint this is a passable game
which is a shame as every other aspect is perfect imo
it makes me wish this exact same game were released later in the genesis lifecycle with better sound and visuals
however there is a great sega cd version of this game that fixes a lot of the issues i have as well as adding new mechanics to the gameplayall in all i would recommend either version
the amazing spiderman vs the kingpin gets so many things right about spiderman its easy to overlook the flaws such as the poor implemented minibosses
that being said i believe every boss fight is fun up to and including the kingpin and theyre all intense in their own way
this can be a really short game but its definitely not an easy one
its not the hardest game ever or anything like that but its definitely a challenging enough experiencethis is a truly great game and honestly one of the best spiderman games ever made
it gets nearly everything down to a perfect character appropriate science and any spidey fan would be doing themselves a disservice by passing this one up
this isnt nostalgia talking either
i didnt even get the chance to play this when i was a kid
i genuinely love this game as an adult though and think it surpasses even later spiderman game entries
like i said the game is absolutely a great time
its a great way to spend an afternoon and i cant stress enough how fans of spidey really should not pass this one up
its still worth a look to this dayits actually funny how i got this game
i won spiderman the animated series game for the genesis off ebay and the seller showed a picture of that game
after delayed waiting i get this
a spiderman game i wanted to avoidits not as bad as i thoughtthis game isnt as cool as separation anxiety or maximum carnage but its more spiderman related
this time around you gotta stop kingpin who framed you saying you made a bomb that will explode in  hours an everyone stupidly believed him and are hunting for you
you have health and limited web which can be refilled by interestingly taking pictures of enemies or bosses getting cash and trading it in for web and to prove your innocence erri guess
you can attack web shoot web shield which is useful against some bosses or rest at your house to refill life at anytime in a level which is a gay feature because you have to start the level over and you lose time fast i better explain the time huh
ok so you have a time limit through the whole game which is supposed to be  hours in the game but more like  hours in real life
you gotta beat bosses like electro doc ock the lizard venom which is the only fun boss because the rest have a patternyes even electro
and more where you collect keys from them and you have to put in the right combination to stop the bombwhich is hell stopping the bomb cuz u gotta get the  keys in order right an u only get  tries orboom
game over
start from the very beggining
thats why this gets  stars
i only got past the bomb thing once
then its showdown time with the kingpin
oh an for those who make it to him remember to keep an eye out for mjor its back to the start you can web zip in the air but unfortunatly this is one of those indoor spidey games
i recommend using the cheat code for this game the one that requires  controllers cuz even with it this game is still tough
well ok only the bomb part
you wanna play the best spidey game ever made so far check out spiderman  for the xbox ps and gamecube
and no spiderman  does not get boring like people say
it only gets boring for alittle if you play it  hours straightupdate i know how to deactivate the bomb at the last level
ok so this is what you do
you will see  colors flashing on the bomb
the colors are black and one of the  key colors
pull out that colored key from the pause menu and press the web button as soon as the bomb flashes on the color you have to time this so you dont press when its black but its still easy
now the bomb will flash all  colors and the black color
wait until the bomb only flashes black and another color and do the same as above until you use every key and deactivate the bomb
now you can take the vents on the right and take on king pinwho is very very hard because its kinda like in the spiderman for playstation where you gotta save  mj from sinking from the water while fighting venom except now you are fighting kingpin and saving mj from falling in a tub of fire
so here is a tip when fighting kingpin when you see mj sinking web the top chain to prevent her from falling
but the web will soon disapear so you gotta keep doin this while handling kingpin
for if mj dies its game over as if the bomb were to detonate meaning you go back to the title screen
watch out for kingpins punches for they send you flying back to the other side of the room
now that i know the bomb combination i gave the game  stars instead of  and im not gonna cheat anymore d have fun and good luckthis game improves upon the  other ones before it
you get to play  differnt characters
either  male cops both have the same strengths just differnt specials a female cop and a little kid on roller blades hes fun to play
instead of just blowing something up with a rocket launcher like the first one each character has their own special
this is a very fun and time consuming game
i love itthe third installement of the sor series
this game is also one of the best walkthrough action beatthemup style game ever made
you have  characters to choose from with one secret character as well
this game is a little different  than the previous  games since there are multiple hidden paths you can take and depending upon how you select your path determines the outcome of the game itself it was a smart addition and added some level of detail for the game
anyways the game play in this sor game might be some of the best the controls are really well laid out and are responsive
each character has their own combination of attacks and speical moves and also each character has a variety of speical attacks that can be utilized with different weapons gathered through out the game
another very different aspect of this sor is the music its very high tempo and has some rather odd time signatures particularly on the song cycle and fuze
then there are tracks that sound like nothing but classic sor music such as the song moon and poets
the graphics are great and are the best in the series particularly when or if you get the  of the final levels the ending shows off the power of the genesis bit console
another thing i will say is that the diffuclty in this game is also pretty high this has got  be also the hardest of the sor games
play this game on the hard mode and you will see what i am talking about
lenght wise i think its perfect some people might find it a little long but i think its perfect in that regards
with sor you just cant go wrong and this like the other sor games is a great example of why the genesis is a timeless game systemstreets of rage  is a gr game lots of fun all of the streets of rage game are some of the best sega games made if you like any side scrolling fighting game like final fight the old tmnt you have to try one of the streets of rage games out you will like them lots of fun with a friend all are  player there is a reason the streets of rage games are not cheap there the best hope this helpsi like the game a lot
i use to play this game a the time in the arcade it is awesome that it is on the segat the arcade game was based off of the terminator  movie
in the arcades it was played with video game guns
the home ports for the super nintendo and the genesis are compatible with the super scope and the sega menacer game guns
however you may also use the controllers but the result of that is moving a cursor around shooting things
it isnt a bad way to play thoughthe game tries to follow the movies storyline by telling it in between certain levels
after waiting for the first part of the story to end you will end up shooting everything in sight
there are robots coming from both sides of the screen and enemy planes flying in the sky
kill them all
that sums up the whole game pretty much but the awesome action would obviously keep you playingone downside i must point out is that the level where you have to protect john konner is too difficult
there are several robots and planes attacking the pickup truck
however there is a way i know to beat this level only bomb the planes
dont concentrate on the robots
and bomb them right away
having another player help out would be nice i guessthankfully theres a player mode that adds to the games replay value
as both of you terminators get your controllers prepared youll be ready for the greatness of shooting mindlesslydamn what an awesome game this is
you get to shoot and destroy hunter killerst endoskeletonscyberdyne systemshelicopterseven battle the liquid metal menace t
sure the graphics are not as great as the arcade wasbut they are still pretty good nonetheless
the music really pumps you up and gets you into the actionas you blast your way throughusing different gun upgrades that you shoot at to get
this game reminds me alot of the old school shooter lethal enforcers
if you are a fan of the terminator filmsthen you will love this
highly recommendedt the arcade game was a port from the arcade it even played the same you could even use there gun i four get what its called it even came with it so heres tosega making a good gamethe simplistic design of the game is nothing compared to the game play this game is the first to feature the two cool doods from funkatron
check it out way cool gametoejam and earl is great fun and best of all the two player mode is cooperate not competative
i have spent hours and hours with my husband playing this game
it is not particularly violent  your best weapon is a tomato and your best survival strategy is avaoidancebad guys include a guy with a lawnmower a phantom icecream truck and a woman with a baby in a shopping cartreally a great gameit took me nearly  years but i only just finished toejam and earl for the first time last night
what a game
and such a simple concept toothe titular characters a threelegged eyeball type dude and a fat dude from the planet funkotron are jammin through the cosmos in their space ship when they are marooned on earth
with their ship in pieces we must guide them through  madcap levels avoiding loony earthlings and the danger of early s pop cultureset to a series of hip tunes toejam and earl is a very colourful funny imaginative and addictive experience that might seem a little dated in the st century but has certainly lost none of its charm
two sequels followed but neither were as highly regarded as this one
there might still be room for a new incarnation of the funky aliens but if you believe the original is the best then download this for your nintendo wii immediatelyits also worthwhile hunting down thesega tunes  toejam  earl in panic on funkotronsoundtrack cd
its rare but brilliantthis is pretty much the whole reason i own a sega genesis
this game is awesome and completely original
one of my all time favorite multiplayer games
its extremely fun and hard enough to challenge youthis game is easily in the top  or top  of genesis games ever made i would even rate it up there as one of the best games of all timethats a pretty heavy statement but this game was a true leader in a lot of aspects
the graphics were great and colorful back then and to this day still arent laughably bad
what really separated this game from a lot of the others out there was the unique and innovative gameplaythe whole mess starts where tj and e were cruising through space where their spaceship was struck by an asteroid courtesy of earls crazy driving
now on planet earth the most wacky insane dangerous planet in the galaxy you have to collect the pieces and rebuild your spaceship
you have to do this while dodging boogie men spellbinding hula girls devils crazy ice cream truck drivers  warrior chickens with mortars angry moms with shopping carts tattoo sporting cigar smoking lawnmower men herds of nerds
but youve got the ammo to deal with these punks sling shots
boombox
tomatoe bombs
icarus wings
you read all that right their are so many different power ups and styles of playing this game it just doesnt get oldi highly recommend this game and gotta give this the badge of a true classici also played this game with my brother when i was younger
there was so much to explore the powerups were interesting there was challenge and it was a rewarding experience to make it to the end which took a while to do it
there are some classic moments like honk of death alerting us to the crazy ice cream truck that would pop out and try and run us over
there was the discovery of level zero and falling off of the top levels to make it there to replenish and get sent back up
what really made this game was going through it with my brother though
the music was great and we found ourselves enjoying this world together
it might move a bit slow compared to more modern games but when you take the time you will find this is worth itfun classic game
this is a must have game for your collection
allot of people own the first toe jam  earl game but i highly recommend adding this its sequel to your library of games youll enjoy itthis one improves upon the first in many ways plus youre actually on funkatron
jar up nasty earthlings and send them back to where they belong
but do it with style style only toe jam and earl posessfirst let me say they dont make video games quite as creatively as they used toi guess its probably because it takes a long time to make a game with  bit graphics and nintendo wants to make money  fastive played  bit and even  bit games that were more fun than anything ive played on game cube and this is one of themi got battletoads as a christmas present for the nes and loved it but it was too hardi eventually decided to cheat with a game genie attachment to see what happens at the end of the game
about  or  years later i got toe jam and earl  for a present  for getting on the honor roll and let me tell you the game is one of the most unique and endlessly fun games you can getit is very similar to battletoads but not as frustratingthe graphics arent quite as amazing as  or  bit games but are still cool to look at and the music and gameplay is incredibleif somebody was selling a genesis at a garage sale i would definitely buy itgenesis and super nintendo still have the best games you can buy no matter what anybody else sayswhoa
this game is awesome a lot of s dreaded pop culture managed to crawl its way into this game but thats a good thing in a cheesy way
anyways this game is full of entertaining levels enemies fun gameplay and lots of awesome funky musicthis game is much different from the first and for those who couldnt understand the first one might like this one better
the gameplay is a little bit more straightforward this time around
this time the game takes place on their home planet of funkatron instead of earth and guess who invaded your turf earthlings
so you got fend off the huge earthling invasion with exploding jars super jars funk vacs those are handy sometimes
and other funky alien powers
also like in the original toejam and earl there is an element of search and collect
a little side mission you can collect some of the creature called the funkapatmus or lamont is his nickname and if you can get him to come out at the end of the game its an awesome endingoverall really good game and even though its different from the st one in terms of gameplay its very similar as it is full of cool characters power ups good levels graphics and replayabilityapart from what has already been mentioned about this game you also shake trees to get items you need along the way but sometimes get an old tire or garbage can that will hit you in the head if you are not careful
there are places in the game where you must fly up on a balloonmany fun areas to explore including under waterthe graphics are nice and the controls are smoothyou have a choice to play as toejam or earl
you will laugh instead of tear your hair outvery unique and enjoyable game
not too many of those around nowadaysi got my xmen long before i had an account on amazon
but my xmen did not come with the case still hard to find
you go through a lot of different areas all through the gamei got xmen eleven or twelve years ago when my parents got me a sega genesis
it was my first video game and to this day it is still one of my favorite games
and even now in the days of the ps and xbox ill still frequently pop this game into my genesis and play
its simple fun and familiarthe game lets you play as four xmen gambit nightcrawler wolverine and cyclops and has five backup characters archangel storm rouge iceman and jean grey that you cant play as but you can call upon if you need help
the game brilliantly features the xmens different powerseach of the six levels are recognizable to people who are into xmenthe savage land the shiar empire excaliburs lighthouse and asteroid m to name most of them
the levels are interesting and welldetailed for a bit game
theyre also relatively bigthe boss fights are really great too
characters like juggernaut sabertooth apocalypse mojo and obvously magneto show up
unfourtunately a lot of them are really difficult to beat not impossible without backup characters which is the only real problem with this gameif you still own a working genesis and dont have this game or havent played this game before i recommend looking for itthis video game is an absolutely amazing video game that still is a great memory on my partthe graphics on this game were absolutely amazing for their time when this game came out somewhere around in ish
while its definately a bit dated by todays standards the first xmen game was the best marvel comic video game that i ever got to playi loved the sound the game would make then an xmen character would lose a life and some of the sound effects were just so cool especially the air bomb sound effects when storm would come down and wipe out the bad guys in the picture
so funnythis game holds a special place in my memories and when i move on to heaven i hope jesus has my old sega genesis up there for me to play for a while before i take up form again in my next incarnationif you can find it buy it
its worth the price
they should rerelease this on computer or the next video game systemacclaim managed to make plenty of lackluster video games using popular marvel licenses xmen spiderman iron man and lets not forget that fantastic four game for the ps but to this day sega is the only company to make a great xmen game in fact they made two this game and its sequel xmen  the clone wars
xmen manages to catch the spirit of the comic  allowing you play as wolverine cyclops nightcrawler and gambit while getting assistance from iceman storm rogue archangel and jean grey
you go through a number of huge levels ranging from the savage land to a shiar ship to excaliburs castle to a ravaged sentinel filled future to asteroid m where you confront magneto
you are thrown against hordes of generic looking enemies but xmen is surprisingly difficult and features some great boss battles including juggernaut deathbird sabretooth ahab and finally magneto among others and the game effectively uses each characters different mutant powers such as wolvies berserker attack and gambits kinetic laced cards
the graphics are sharp colorful and surprisingly full of detail while the controls are easy enough to pick up
all in all this is one of the best marvel licensed bit games ever but it would only be topped by its sequel xmen  the clone warsactually it makes for good gamin
save your neighbors while shooting down various monsters a lot of zombies of course
using water guns popcicles shook up sodas and even a misslelauncherlikething
ontop of that you get power ups that make for fun bashing of zombies and monsters
go ahead turn the undead into yumyum chibitsman let me tell you this game is awesome
i wish i knew about this when i was a kidi wouldve wasted more of my younger days playing zombies ate my neighbors haha
everything about this game is sweet
its not really complicated or hard but it can be at times so the challenge is still there
the various different weapons are humorous and cool to use as well as the different characters involved in the game
the password system is also cool too its kind of like a save option back before saving options were available for any game console
the only thing i wish to change would be making the password system like the lost vikings game where every level has a password instead of in zombies where they have a password every  levels or so
other than that this game is still perfect
wordever had that one fave gamethat you wished had been on other consolesthis is one of those games
when i first bought it years agoi could not get enough of itthere were alot of silly thingsand silly ways to defeat the zombies and martiansthis is one of those gamesi wish that konami made for playstation and psif you still have the geneisi recommend this very highlyzombies ate my neighbors released in  for the sega genesis and super nintendo has a cult following for a good reason
this is one of the single best homages to schlocky horror films ever made
the gameplay visuals and outstanding coop mode also dont leave anything to be desired
this is a bit masterpiece and is absolutely deserving of the attention it gets todaythe differences between the genesis and snes versions arent exactly minute but theyre not huge either
whichever version you pick up youll be playing the same game for all intents and purposes
the genesis version is visually less refined and the screen is a hair smaller yet the map always being on screen in the genesis version is something i personally prefer
i also prefer using the genesis button controller with this game
if youre picking this up definitely invest in a button controller to go with it
it makes the game play much smoother and the dpad is better for traversing the  perspectivethe game starts out in a level that lives up to the title
choosing to either play as zeke or julie youre dropped in an allamerican backyard complete with your neighbors grilling out swimming in their pools and thegirlnextdoor cheerleader
the only problem is zombies are trying to eat these neighbors and armed with your uzi squirt gun and your wits its up to you to save your neighbors from these macabre monstersthroughout the game youll pick up different items and weapons appropriately assigned to two different slots
you can toggle between all of your items and weapons with a simple button press which is welcome as there are a lot of things to pick up in this game
from rocket launchers to soda can grenades silverware health kits keys etc the itemweapon list is extensive and this is where the root of the gameplay comes from
its up to you to figure out how to conserve some of these items and your ammunition all the while running at a breakneck pace to salvage what neighbors you have left from the undead hordeszombies will be the least of your worries though
throughout your adventure youll run into mummies werewolves vampires giant sandworms spiders blob monsters aliens giant babies and chainsaw wielding maniacs just to name a few
all of these enemies have certain weaknesses thats appropriate to the lore thats been established for them such as the werewolves being weak against silverware and vampires being weak against a cross
this system works well and makes for a game thats far more about running away from enemies to go item hunting than it is confronting them which fits really well into the horror aestheticthis isnt to say you wont be fighting enemies though
at the beginning of the first level youre given  neighbors to save
save all of them and youll have  neighbors in the next level to save
lose one youll have  in the next level
so on and so forth
given that these neighbors will die in one hit from any monster its imperative to either kill whatever monster is running straight for them or simply running to the neighbor  as quickly as possible
once you lose all  neighbors its game over
alternatively once you lose the  lives you start with its game over though there are hidden ups to collect throughout your trek
in between every  levels youre given a password to continue with
when you start with the password however you begin the game with only your bare essential items and youre forced to restock
this makes dying consequential but not infuriating
trust me this game is extremely hard but its always compelling
considering your only goal in every level is to save your neighbors as opposed to killing all the enemies every level is beatable sans for some boss levels without taking a single enemy outthis allows for a dynamic experience and if it werent dynamic enough certain item pickups are randomized increasing the replay value of this title through the roof
every design philosophy implemented into this game compliments an opposing one perfectly and thats what makes this such a well developed title
if you take the horror aesthetic and clear film references out of this game youd still be left with a game that plays just as well without it
its awesome that the horror stuff is there though as it makes for an interesting game with awesome enemies weapons and given the speed youre constantly running at a very frantic experience in the best way possibleits also worth noting that the soundtrack here is incredible
including digitized approximations of instruments like the theremin as a sendup to schlocky s bmovie scores the soundtrack compliments the visuals the sound effects of weapons are all very satisfying from a player standpoint and the added touches like your character screaming ow
when they take damage make this a wonderful sounding game regardless of which console youre playing it on
the tone is still present in either version and the soundtrack helps to make up a lot of this games campy atmosphereall in all zombies ate my neighbors is a great looking sounding and playing bit gem
everything included in its design just makes sense
the frantic pace plethora of itemsweapons and the general feeling of pure fright when running away from an enemy to search for a health kit before losing your last life make this an extremely memorable extremely fun experience that everyone should try out
simply put this is one of the best games from its generation
add onto it a well implemented player mode thats as cooperative as it is competitive and youve got yourself an instant classic
like i said it has a relatively huge cult following for a reason and i cant recommend it enough
given its price tag on genesis even for a boxed copy youd be doing yourself a disservice by passing this one up
its hard to ask for a better experience out of two consoles that are over  years old at this point
this is an absolutely fantastic gamei have been a gamer since i was literally yrs old
playing the old atari  when it was new
and all the other systems that would follow
i still have most of them and many of the games
among my collection is zombies ate my neighbors for sega genesis
still fun as hell to playand still one of my favorite games from the old days of cartridges
you can play  or  player simulatneously
its loaded with many levelsoddfunny weapons  various campyb movie monsters
let me just say that although i have played this game a loti have yet to beat it
which is fine cause that gives me plenty of reason to play it still
ive got up to level   that was challenging
it even has a boss thats a giant baby
if you love classic older games than this is for you
a must have for zombie lovers which i am
i have played this on both sega genesis  snes
either way you are getting a classici absolutely love this game
i was so excited to get this game
for the first time i beat the game
im trying to do it again with more goals in mind
it came in great condition and i would recommend to allthis game holds so many great memories with mei remember playing this game when i was about  years old with my best friend at the timethere was just something really special about running around and shooting zombies with a squirt gun lol there are also other cool weapons you can use against other ghoulish creaturessuch as vampireskiller dollshuge spidersjason lookalikes and sooo many morethis game is a thrill to playbut its even better when you play it with a friendso check it outi highly recommend italsoyou might wanna pick up a six button controller if you dont already have oneit makes this game alot easier to playi first got this game at agarage sale
a while later i learned all the moves and fatalitiesthough i couldnt perform them it was way funner than the crappy mk genesis game which i also had
any day i always mk first
heres whymusicthe music is the original tunes only made with video game beeps so its more cartoony sounding
still very fun to listen to
i usually get lost in itgraphicsmeh
the graphics are fair but theyre not the best
the oni in goros lair still blink the monks move their heads clouds roll
the graphics seem pixely chunky but heir pretty goodfunthis game is fustratingif i make it on easy difficulty its not challenging
if i put it on hard difficulty its too challengingmedium is perfect for newbiesbloodblood can be activated via a cheat in this game
even then its not the best
only a few pints or dots spill out of their heads when you punch em
but when you uppercut them its very fun to see drops of blood fall from the air
and who who could forget scorpions bloody spear
the fatalities are gruesome thought not as bloody
although subbies fatality as asscool to see blood repeatedly drip from their spines in his fatmovesthe classic special move are easy to do if you have a decent controller
if you do them more than once they drain more healthoverallthis is a fun classicfatalities are easy and funto watch gameplay is decent and not repeatitive music is beautiful
buy thismortal kombat is a great game
it is still one of my favorite games and one of my favorite mortal kombat games as welli know this game is thirteen years old has dated graphics and sound is cheesy as hell and the gameplay is sluggishbut its still awesome and a classic
theres just something about it that makes it good despite how dated it is nowits probably because its just a simple violent fighting game
seven playable characters kano johnny cage sonya scorpion rayden subzero and liu kang each with a few easy to remember special moves and one fatalitywith lots of completely unrealistic blood thrown in for good measure
on top of that theres two bosses goro and shang tsung a hidden character reptile and an easily accessible cheat menu
simplei dont care how dated it is mortal kombat is still a lot of fun
i liked this game so much that id wake up a little early before school so i could play it
i know it sounds lame but i worshipped this game with every fiber of my beingif you dig old school fighting games and havent played mortal kombatyou dont dig old school fighting gamesso many years later and many incarnations later how does the original mortal kombat stand upwellits still funthe graphics for its time were excellentthe game play was fast and freneticthe over the top gore was simply jaw droppingand reallythat is probably the single most important thing mortal kombat has given uscontroversyprotestsparents screaming about how their younglings were being corruptedyou have to appreciate how mk was simply in the right place at the right timethe game that helped revolutionize the home consol marketmk has gone from simple d game play to z axis d and now with the rebirth of mk due in  it appears mk kreators are taking the game back to its frantic d rootsit should be interestingwhy not its been a heck of a ride so farmortal kombat innovativeground breakinga must play even if its just to see where it all beganhighly recommendedi still own this classic fighting relic and it will always hold a place in my gaming heart
i was blown away the first time i played this in a local arcade as a young fellow and have followed the series ever since even up to the new xbox  version which is awesome as well
genesis version was definatly the version to get unless you had a sega cd system i found the cd version an almost arcade perfect port but those arent as common to come by anymore and honestly the genesis version is almost arcade perfect itself
the blood was available in this version unlike snes what was nintendo thinkin
lol the gore made this game
with a simple abacabb code
i still love pulling out my genesis collection every now and then and stompin down on this classic and taking on some friends who had forgotten these games still existed
hours of fun and  replayability strongly reccomend this and all the other great mk games the nd was always my personal fave but this one started it all i will always be fond of this game
just a year or so back i was working in mississippi and went into a laundry mat to do my wash and they had an original mk arcade machine in there i whupped it good on maybe  bux worth of quarters and even had the owner out there watching before i finally beat it i even tried to buy the machine off of him but he wouldnt sell
wouldve loved to have that in my living roomit was really good and retro
it had a classic fighting game look and looked good for  bit gamingtop  greatest game everi remember people standing in line at the bowling alley just to get a crack at playing this gamethen they released em on consoles too bad if you owned a snes sucka bwahaha all sweat and no blood for youstill remember the blood codea b a c a b b  get over here
then when i heard test your might i would rack my knuckles back and forth ripping off skin to the bonebut it was worth it cuz i just crushed that mofun diamondtoday mk is just not the same id almost say the idea of a story line ruined itbefore it was random fighters around the world fighting it out to saveend the world with only brief descriptionsnow everyone has feelings and st and superheroes some how jumped on board
booooooooothe first mortal kombat game launched so much its hard to believe
you see all these games nowadays that have gore you can thank mortal kombat for that onethis game was also really important because it found numerous ways to be different than other fighting games
finishing moves and digitized graphics were miles ahead of its day
this is also the best version of mortal kombat  other than the arcade verzion not only because it has the tomato juice youll know what i mean when you uppercut your opponent but also the gameplay is second to none
the snes lacked the finishing movesfatalities also the blood and gore of the original version as well as the gameplay was full of gliches would freeze a lot and so onthe genesis didnt have the best sound or speech in the world but still it was a very good game for its day and will always be a classici bought this game to relive a bit of my childhood
i love this game a lot
it is the most basic of the mortal combat seriesconsidering it is only the first in the seriesi grew up with the snes version and i have to say this version is better by a million
i love the music so much more
the graphics are about the same
it plays swiftly much better than the snes version and i love the snes version
i also like the fact that you can enable the blood code which makes the fatalities look cooler by a longshot
i highly recommend this version of the gameclassic mk
you cannot go wrong
you can get a better version though
seek them outi still have a funcioning genesis but one of my remotes died on me
the c button wouldnt work so i needed a replacement
this one did the job and i am once agaian enjoying all my favorite gamesi bought this as a replacement controller
this controller is so much fun to use and it is the perfect controller to learn how to play video games withi bought this sega paddle and considering how old it is its in great shape
i would recommend this to anyonetotally awesome dude going old school love it sega gneiss kicks ass cant beat the oldies still a classic if you like old video gamesi own it love it and gotta have it
sega
never liked the  button style much
this  button controller has always been a close friend lolgreat controller
i got this controller after my other one broke on me after about  years
i went on amazon to get a new one
great deal and in great shape tooah phantasy star ii made back in the golden age of video games when music and gameplay actually counted and because of the technological limitations back then developers had to work very hard to deliver various quality game titles such as this one and it forced developers to use their imagination and creativity to the best of their abilities and it certainly shows in this  rpg classic
it starts you off with a better detailed story than most rpgs at the time and a clear goal for the first  hours of gameplay and the anime style character designs are outstanding and jaw dropping for being from a launch sega genesis title and the music is very memorable as they were able to utilize drums very well along with other instruments that add to the atmosphere in the game and the combat system was certainly a milestone for its time as it was one of the very first rpg games to have your party face the enemy directly in rd person view which was used later in the playstation era rpgs and the best added rpg element this game introduced are dramatic scenes in some parts the game that take place which were also uncommon for rpgs made at the time
this game set the bar for future rpg games believe it or not
even though this may not be an xbox  rpg like lost odyssey or blue dragon one must appreciate the origins of the genre to fully enjoy it and phantasy star ii sure did set the bar for rpg developers in future generations and i am very glad to say that i did not miss out on one of the best rpg games of all time so what are you waiting for
play this sega genesis masterpiece as soon as you can
editi have recently gotten back to this game again and i must say not only is this the first bit rpg to be released but it is still one of the greatest games of all time not only did this masterpiece break the bit barrier but also revolutionized the rpg genre as a whole by combining amazingly wellanimated enemies with a mindblowing soundtrack nearly lifelike drums beautiful rather vibrant mangastyle character designs the addition of shocking plot twists and natural character dialogue this game accomplished what the early final fantasies werent able to accomplish at this time period and the fact that this game was released in  is groundbreaking to say the least this is a very big deal for the time
this masterpiece is to thank for changing the way we play rpgs
i still give credit to final fantasy for starting a very successful rpg franchise but phantasy star ii introduced elements that final fantasy eventually caught up with and phantasy star ii is without a doubt the most important rpg of the bit era yes even beating final fantasy iv and vii remeber first playing phantasy star  when i was getting into video games
it is what a jrpg should be a quest that easily takes  hours to finish
the graphics are very animeish with fitting music
i am now on my nd playthough of ps
if you play it be sure to download a faq for itphantasy star  without a doubt a game ahead of its time when it was released on the genesis years ago
while it may look simplistic now compared to the recent rpgs of late but everything from the anime style graphics to the excessively long quest made phantasy star  worth playing
the final boss was one of the most memorable bosses in video game history when i was younger it gave me nightmares
all in all if you can find it now it may be a bit pricey but next to gunstar heroes this is the second best genesis game everphantasy star ii was the best rpg of its generation
the seemingly simple game by sega introduced complex partybased combat to a generation of genesis owners who missed the original phantasy star on the sega master system
psii featured turnbased combat in which you could see your character carrying out the action you had ordered
this simple feature made combat extremely entertaining and provided incentive to get new weapons and abilities
watching rolf the protagonist run up to a dragon and deliver a vicious slash with his laser sword is one of my favorite gaming memoriesin psii you control a party of up to  characters
players wander around a world map until they encounter one of the random battles that are extremely common
this game is combat heavy
expect to spend most of your time wading through vicious battles and leveling your partywhile the combat is excellent and holds up very well over time the story is also extremely advanced for a genesis game
psii has a dark tone to it and there is an excellent plot twist midway through the game
in some ways the plot mirrors that of final fantasy vii despite the fact that psii came out years earlier
i dont want to give anything away but some aspects of those two games are very similarif you can get your hands on a copy of psii im not selling mine
check it out
the graphics are surprisingly strong for a genesis title and the audio isnt bad either
of course this is one of my alltime favorites so im a little biasedphantasy star  is a very very good rpg from heyday of the sega genesissuper nintendo era
it is probably the strongest of the four phantasy star games
the music score is excellent and the graphics are decent
the strongest part of this game is probably its storyline which is both compelling and mature
there is no lets beat the master archfiend or lets rescue the princess in this game
ps has a futuristicscifi setting rather than a medieval castletype setting
your mission is to find out why biomonsters are wreaking havoc on your world when the computer system that supposedly provides for all of the worlds citizens needs is supposed to prevent such outbreaksthus your journey beginslet it be known that this is an oldschool rpg
it features a lot of random battles which are all turnbased
the battle engine has some strengths in that you can choose the fght command which will let you fight on autopilot until you intervene
or for more difficult battles you can choose the stgy command to use items cast spells or defend
one weakness of the battle engine is that the only way to know how much damage you sustain from the enemies is to watch your own hp level
this leads to a few incidents of being wiped out by an enemy that can use mass attacks and you dont not even know it until its too late
blasters im looking at you
this game features about  dungeons on two different planets
many of these dungeons are huge and complex
it is strongly recommended that you either make your own maps or download some maps from elsewhere because you will not be able to just randomly bungle your way through these places like you could in a final fantasy game
even the very first dungeon can be difficult to navigatethere are also  playable characters in this game
you can have up to  in your party at any given time
each character has his or her own unique ability
some are great fighters
some are better with magic
and some are better depending on whether youre fighting a biomonster or a robot
so theres a bit of strategy involved here not everybody can learn every spell or equip every weapon
also you cannot breeze through this game by overleveling because there is a cap on how high you can goone flaw with this game is the fact that you will have to do a lot of grinding
equipment upgrades are expensive and when you are buying equipment for  warriors that gets pricey fast
also as you gain companions they will all start at level   so you often have to build up their strength before moving on to the next town or dungeon
that causes a break in the action
while that may slow things down a bit its probably necessary because you will have a hard time advancing in this game with inferior equipment and being underleveledthis however is a minor quibble
if you are patient this game will reward you with an incredible gaming experience
theres not much flashy about it in terms of cut scenes animations and voiceovers
but the gameplay is definitely solid and the storyline is very well thought out
again be advised that this is not a game for people who are new to rpgs or who like their rpgs on the easy side
some of the dungeons in this place are downright cruel
if you dont mind a challenge then get your graph paper ready and prepare to be amazedit is such a shame that there are barely any good rpgs to play this generation but this classic has you covered
this game has a very involved story plot with very emotionally driven characters and outstanding manga art style for cutscenes
as an anime fan i find the manga cutscenes and character designs a real treat and this game has plenty of that along with a very emotionally driven soundtrack that will keep you entertained every moment of it and this game even features an extreme heartbreaking moment in the middle of the game otherwise absent on many rpgs for the genesis
this game also has the challenge factor perfectly balanced not too hard or easy just right
this game certainly deserves all the praise it has received and it is a shame that many willturn down the game based on being old and overrated when this game has received abundant praise for a reason
phantasy star i ii and iii are still wonderful classics that have a place in my heart but this game has perfected the elements introduced in the earlier games and has added a greater attention to detail and overall game experience and i highly recommend this to any rpg fanatici absolutely love this game
it remains possibly my favorite console rpg to this day
the macro system used for battles is both creative and economical
you select each characters action before the battle set up a sequence including the order of those actions making combat very fastpaced
with macros it takes no more time to have everyone just attack than it does to have each character use techniques heal all defend etc
there are even combo attacks if youre adventurousthe graphics are dated by todays standards obviously but very functional
you get to see your attacks fire rather than the numbers game of ps
i still enjoy the artwork in the cut scenes which imply motion and character reactions in comic book style panels
a favorite feature of mine is the talk command where your party members converse among themselves to give you hints about where to go next each with her own personality
many things they say to one another are quite humerous and its unspeakably helpful if you pick up the game after a month or so and dont want to start all overthe game is a little short but there are extensive sidequests that push it well up beyond average for the day
it is very well paced too
theres little need for powerleveling if you are too weak or poor to move on
you can usually just do a sidequest and youre right back in business
some may say this makes the game too easy and perhaps it is easy if you powerlevel and learn all the secrets in combat
but its a blast and your achievements are directly related to your skill at the game
if you know what youre doing youll succeed
if you dont youll probably know why soon enoughnone of this would mean a thing if the story were lousy
fortunately this is the games strongest point
yes its a goodvsevil struggle but what rpg isnt
youve got some very interesting characters who will quickly win you over
rika the doeeyed ingenue of the bunch grows in maturity in subtle ways as she learns both the good and the bad of what it means to feel
chaz graduates from being alys sidekick to learning to think for himself and lead othersplay it
you need toi rented this from block buster and was blown awaylots of characters lots and lots of monster grinding thoughi would say ill play this game again to beat it even now it was that goodphantasy star iv is a perfect example of an oldschool rpg
it is one of the two greats for the genesis in my opinion the other being shining force ii
the entire series is one of the best ever made i find it necessary to mention or course that phantasy star iii is not very good as it was made by a different company
i would really like to see a new one for one of the next generation systems phantasy star online doesnt really countphantasy star iv is a classic
it has the standard combat system with you and the enemies on opposite sides with attacks special skills and techniques which you can perform
it is still a lot of fun though
it has a high level of random encounters but it is necessary to fight a lot and do a lot of levelingup to be powerful enough to fight the bossesthe characters are a lot of fun and are surprisingly well developed throughout the game
they are basically the standard anime style fare but of course all have their own traits
phantasy star has okay graphics but they are kind of strange
it also has the absolute best genesis game soundtrack ever madephantasy star iv has really cool comic book style cut scenes accompanied by well written dialogue and plot
the cut scenes to say the least are revolutionary and they type of thing which really puts this over the top of almost every other oldschool rpg i know of
without them it just wouldnt be the same gamethe storyline is fairly standard as you are a group of heroes trying to stop the evil dark force
within this setup it does a really good job of creating an interesting plot
i found myself entertained by it
for one phantasy star iv does have one of the most sad parts ever
i was sad at leastanyway phantasy star iv was a great game and for a genesis game is fairly long maybe  or  hours i didnt really keep track
it is one of my alltime favorites
if you have a genesis and some extra cash pick this one upfinal fantasy has a tendency to be over dramatic and dragon warrior wasnt dramatic enough
phantasy star meets in the middle and is a good break from both of the old kings of nintendo rpgs
a different perspective from both ff and dw but familiar at the same time
unique characters with slightly bland names new concept of hunter missions as side quests you unlock whilst completing the game and a solid and ongoing story throughout the series this game seems to make slight references to the past which i thought were nods to the older ps games but without playing them i have no idea
great title did not regret trying it outthis is perhaps the most fun turn based combat roleplaying game i ever played
the gameplay is wonderful and you really become enveloped in the story line
it may be an old game but it is truely a classic gamei played this back in  it was the game that got me into rpg games but the rest of the phantasy star titles were a let down after playing this one it holds a place and i will never forget this game
this is a game that i want to see some kind of update to
it is one of the best rpg games ever made and is under appreciated
people call this over rated
what
overrated you mean final fantasy  was overrated
this game used a comic book style story telling strategy and it worked out and was actually a good compensation to the limits of the sega genesis
i only wished it had more side quests and items to obtain because the end of the game was impossible for me at level  or whatever i was by then  had to level up a bit to finish the game
dont compare it to any other game until you finish itwhat youre expecting more
read someone elses reviewit really is the best game everlong before final fantasy tactics and arc the lad there was shining force   this one has an excellent story and great characters
the battle system is essentially the same used in tactics but not nearly as complex
the music is also very good and memorable and light years better than the previous installment
the graphics are also topnotchone of my friends introduced me to this game via the sega channel many years ago
its a great rpg and its sad that it goes usually forgotten i noticed many people tend to remember the first one more than this one which is a shame because this one beats the first one hands downif you happen to come across this game in a pawn shop or gaming store i highly suggest picking this up
its a great game and possibly the best rpg for the sega genesis
a classichehe this game is just absoloutly great in every wayhmm where to startfor one thing the graphics for the time are jaw dropping
the music while not superb is nice and the storyline is great
but the main thing that made me like this is that unlike the other strategy rpgs ive played vandal hearts front mission  etc the battles were a lot less repetitive and seemed to have more relevance to the storythe best genesis game ever made i reckonah the love of rpg games just keeps astounding me time after time
shining force    are no differentthis second installment has many similarities to the first ie
resurrection of the dark dragon but with a fresh new storyline and characters
in the prologue two jewels get stolen inside the ancient tower and a demon by the name of gizmo corrupts king granseals body
however sir astral manages to exorcise the gizmo out of his body
unfortunately the gizmo finds yet another victim  king galam
it turns him completely evil and so he decides to kidnap granseals daughter elis
his evil powers cause a phenomenon beyond epic proportions  he awakens the king of the devils referred to as zeon
this is a very long and satisfying rpg with lots of soap operadramabetrayal involved
if youve played resurrection of the dark dragon or even the fire emblem series then you know what happens  the battle system plays out as your army against the evil deadly foes
you will have a bunch of different weaponry to choose from  sword axe staff arrows gloves etc
plus some magic at your disposal
be sure to keep your strong guys in the front and the magic usersarchers in the backwhen you are halfway through the game and you are about to enter mr creeds mansion this is the battle with the skeleton army this is a very good time to promote your characters
unfortunately you have to wait until level  to do so
however they will be able to wield even more useful weapons such as the heavy lance battle sword assault shell buster shot etc
not only that but their experience levels will quickly increase
moreover you really need to promote your army in that particular battle because once theyve shrunk to the desktop kingdom they will have to face the evil chess pieces on the chessboard  they are extremely difficult to defeat and your nonpromoted weaponry wont cause them very much damageafter you meet mr creed you will be asked to choose one of four characters to take with you into future battles
theres karna the priest eric the knight tyrin the mage or randolf the warrior
i suggest karna because you can promote her into either a monk or a vicar
you will eventually be allowed to recruit the other  members but that is only after you defeat the greater devil zalberd and you find out that oddler regains his memory whom actually turns out to be a really bad guy
you will also acquire many other characters to add to your army and you will need to choose whom you bring with you into future battles
use the caravan that rohde provides you to switch out your desired characters
some of the secret characters are difficult to find
sheela is behind the monks monastery skreech is in tristan but only after you talk to the little birds in bedoe go to the bottom left bushes outside bedoe to make one of the birds fall on top of you then talk to the mother bird chaz is found on your second visit to yeel ie
when no one is there anymore kiwi the tortoise is found after granseal suffers an earthquake and everyone is abandoned taya is found after defeating zalberd claude is found after you return to grans island but you have to find his body and attach his arm of golem first and finally  lemon whom youll find out much later in the game  is actually one of the good guys
as for some of the super villains if you thought that mishaela and darksol were bad just wait until you meet cameela and geshp
cameela isnt as mean as mishaela but geshp is another matter
he is not only meanspirited and mouthy but he will double cross anyone who gets in his way
you will also have to face the red baron and lord odd eye oddler in disguise before you once again meet up with king galam
and yes galam is still possessed
the final battle will be against zeon himself
zeon has a wolf like facial appearance and his attacks are just as lethal
overall this is the premier game to be playing on your sega genesis  aside from resurrection of the dark dragon and phantasy star  through   be sure to download this game on your wii or wii u  excellent game
tactics based game that is fun and engaging with rpg like elements
one of the best games  ever made for the sega genesis
dont miss out on this oneshining force  is without a doubt the best genesis game ever made
i first played it on the shortlived segachannel and since then ive never put it down
after i bought it i think i played through it at least five times
in fact it was the first rpg i ever playedshining force  is a tactical rpg with game play akin to that of fire emblem or front missionwhich i also enjoyed
it is quite the challenge and the highest difficulty ouch
can give you a run for your money especially in the later battles
the primitive though still involved combat system was further boosted by a simple experience and leveling up system
the final touch to the combat which really puts shining force over the edge was the attack cut scenes
for the time this game was made they blow me awaythe overall storyline is rather generic but for me it took a backseat to the combat
some of the different battles and specific elements of the story were very original however and added a certain extra little flavor i dread the chessboard battle to this very day
one minor complaint is that most of the characters arent important to the story and join you for no reason
it isnt too important but most of the characters seemed cool enough they should have had their own backstory at least and some involvement in the game other than combatall in all shining force  is a classic rpg
it is long i would estimate  hours with nice graphics a pretty good soundtrack as good as you can get for electronic beeps and very entertaining game play
i highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in rpgsi first played this game at a friends house back in  and i loved it
he beat the game thanks to the codes they give you to pass through the levels so when you do play it just enter the code and you are back on the level you startedwhat made this game great was the violence this is not a game for kids but it is old and the graphics were good for that time but they kind of stand the test of time
it is nothing like halo but zero tolerance was the game that doom fans who owned a genesis which i did and still do and they wanted to kill some enemies with their shotguns then this was the game to play still fun after  years but still good no matter whati just got this in the mail popped it in and wow what a great game
kind of reminds me of an urbantype doom
very easy to control and the graphics are not bad for that time period
its a shame this game was not built upon like many others
if you dont have this game yet get itzero tolerance is a great underrated fps on the genesisthe graphics in this game are fantasticthe music really adds to the feel of the game as wellyou get alot of cool weapons to use to kill aliens withthere are a ton of maze like levels that you play throughthis is about the only fps on the genesisso that makes this game really speciali would highly recommend getting zero tolerance to add to your genesis collectionthe game starts out rather easy but gets difficult fast
for the genesis im surprised to see such qualitylet alone a fps in general
the story is pretty basic kill the aliens and bad guys  sorta like in doomthe gameplay is rather solid but like in silent hillother survival horror gamesdo not waste your ammo
hand to hand combat in this game is rather poorthe collision detection is far off towards the ai but towards you for some reason it is spot onwhy
it is an fps not survival horror though for some reason they designed it to be a survival scifi game giving you  lives thoughbut when you die you come back as different charweaker or strongerwith pros and cons in different areasthe only reason im keeping it at a  is because it is an early attempt at console fps gamesand i have to give them credit for thati love the way this game gives you the freedom to walk around everywhere
you can have over  different weapons which makes the gameplay far more interesting than id ever imaginedyou can change into different clothes which actually is important in helping you progress through the game
its not a normal style of gameplay but an interesting one to say the leastwhile its hardly the best game you can find on the market its certainly uniqueif you like maximum carnage you will love this game too
one of the better spidey games of all timethis game was a lot of fun back in the day
they made an awesome soundtrack with an economy of tunes
yes there were only like  different songs in the whole game but they are all really awesome and will keep your headed bangin and fist pumpin
the graphics are also pretty good particularly the backgrounds and worlds
it is very long for one of these sidescroller beatem up style games so if you stink at those no prob here because there are passwords to save your progress so no rush to get through the whole thing in one sitting but a word of the wise get those ups like crazy
while you can find extra lives and earn them through out the game you there are no continues
so once your out of lives its big fat stinkin game over
anyways its another classic game for the genesis for two players
also it has very big detailed story line for one of these sidescroller beatem up games
a true classic marvel comics game for the genesis overs i would recommend are xmen  the clone wars and the punisher are also great games for the genesisi own both spiderman and maximum carnage for the sega genesis
after noticing that there was a missing game in my spiderman genesis collection and reading a couple of the reviews disregarding the bad ones i decided to purchase it to complete my collection once and for all
after owning it for a few days and playing it nonstop it got hard to say i hate it
after hours and hours of trying to complete the game in cooperative mode i was spidey i felt like the game was well worth it
the guys to beat up get sort of repetitive and the game is very hard but it was definitely worth what i paid for it
i feel like the third installment to my collection is my favorite making the game a little less challenging with cooperative mode
lets not forget the storyline and webslinging which are both awesome to have in the game
even after more than a decade of this games existence i believe that its a great game that any genesis owner should havemy friends and i would play this all the time when i rented it
its a beatem up coop duznt get better than that
where one player is spidey an the other is venom
i was always stuck being spidey but i didnt care
you beat up people like in spiderman venom maximum carnage the prequel to this game
you fight other sympiotes quite like venom in this game because venom has been captured by the quotfoundationquot where he was somehow duplicated into five symbiotes that will try to pair up with a human and knowing what carnage can do a human with symbiote villian kinda like venom but he is more evil insane and red and you gotta stop em oh unless you want to deal with carnage and his symbiote gang venom escaped before being destroyed by the duplicated symbiotes
all what i remember is this level where your on the streets like in maximum carnage beaten people up then you fight this robot an this jungle level where you fight dudes in suitsoh an this level where your on some highway swinging over cliffs an stuff
no doubt its one of the best spiderman games ever made
i will most likely come back an tell ya more in the mean time get this game
its also on the snes but hella rare to get on that system
isaacoh and ifwhen the next person reads this review can you please answer if you like to be spiderman or venom in this game and why
thx i would luv to hear your opinionsthis is one of those consoles where you could feel a change in gaming like the atari or nes before it
the games were great mostly side scroll like anything else back then
the games made by sega were the best
you should get one if youve never played it before or even if you havethis goes way back in the early s to late s
the genesis has some of the best games of its time
sonic the hedgehog is one example
if you collect video game systems get this onetoday you have a bit world and with xbox and gamecube a few months away you have on the verge bit graphics
but forget that
what makes a good game
sure the water looks real
and oh boy that blood sure looksewwwell whats with all this hype
theres plenty of fun in the sega genesis
of course many of the games are a far cry from todays plotdriven video entertainment systems but there are many fun and innovative games available for the sega genesis
this console is from the golden age of the second video game boom
you dont get much more quality entertainment out of video game publishers than thisi own the v sega genesis
it was my very first gaming console and i sold it a long time ago
i recently got a new one and im very happy i did
i cant wait to deck it out with the rest of the addons
yeah the power supply is a monster of a plug and you need a coaxial input on your tv to use it but its worth all the nostalgia
my current list right now is sonic  rocket knight adventures might and magic ii gate to another world and some nba game that i hardly play
im always at my local play n trade looking for my next gamethe sega genesis is a legend
if you dont believe me then why after almost  years are its games showing up on multiple consoles such as the xbox  and ps
this console saw some of the best days of d and the earliest days of d gaming
the genesis core system  was the first to be released under the name and it was able to play old sega master system games the first home console with backwards compatibility
the core system  had a sleeker design and stereo sound unlike the core  which had only mono
both core  and  had ports of the sega cd add on
the last core the core  was a cheaper version
to lower prices on it the port for sega cd was removed on it and the manufacturing was somewhat below par
in my eyes the sega genesis core  is the better choice as it is stereo and supports sega cd
if however you want to play genesis and master system games then a core  is your only optionits back from  years ago but still rocks and is awsome i play this with my dad we love thisi collect sega genesis games along with the genesis x add on and looking to add a sega cd loved the fighting games era and genesis had the best in my opinion x mortal kombat ii was the best version when the game was released i know saturn had a better one but it wasnt until late  the adventure and rpg line and not to mention the sports titles hundreds and hundreds i was a fan of the snes as well but mainly for the rpg genres all said i still own my sega the snes got sold haha and i have quite a library of games for itlove my genesisif you ever wanted to play mortal kombat umk sonic ghouls and ghosts altered beast golden axe etc
genisis was the system to play then on
the games were awesome the controls were way better than super nintendo so was the game play
the gprahics were better on snes but i always will prefer the genisisi had a sega genesis back in the day when it came with sonic awesome system one of the greatest systems around
i own genesissnessaturnsold dreamcastxbox  ntwo pssplaystation and gameboy advance
i recently played some of my genesis games and a lot of them are still fun like sonic zombies ate my neighborssonic and knuckles wwf wrestlemania streets of rage  i like sega better than nintendo because sega comes out with creative games with all the systems like nights into dreams on saturn soul caliber on dreamcast and sonic on genesis
nintendo has mostly the same type of legend of zelda donkey kong and mario games with every systemi do not hate nintendo i just dont really like mario games and not a fan of role playing games
the genesis is a great systembut i think people just like snes better at the time
i think sega is always trying to bring arcade games to all of their systems which is why i like sega so muchthe games are easy to find at used electronics stores pretty cheapif you like d gaming you should get a sega genesispros system and games are cheap fun creative games reliable system button controllermortal kombat  looked better and had fatalities and bloodcons some games are hard to find button controller sucks crap addons like x and sega cdand the sega genesis is one of the best examples of a retro system along with the snes and nes
the product had some scratches but it works great and the reset button works so i can beat the first xmen game
as for the scratches its important to know the system is about  years old so itd be very difficult to find one without unless you bought it fresh from the box but thats be really expensivei purchased a sega genesis console back in november  my genesis is still in mint condition and i pull it out once in a while to relive the classics
if you do not own one of these gems i highly recommend that you pick one up
there are hundreds of titles available most of which sell for only a few dollars
some of these titles are among the greatest video games ever created you must own these if youre a collectorwhile playing these games its important to consider the limits the game developers were constrained to
unlike todays consoles  with seemingly unlimited cpu power bandwidth and memory  the developers were forced to work with a very small amount of storage capacity to hold graphics and sound data
over time the developers came up with some very clever techniques to overcome these limitations
i recall being wowed by the effects in games such as gunstar heroes and earthworm jimeffects i had no idea my little old genesis could do more than five years after owning it
over time i came to really appreciate these efforts and continued looking forward to how much further the envelope would be pushedbelow is a list of mustown games for the genesis
this is by no means a definitive list these are just my favorites among those games i have playedplatformers sonic     chuck rock  castle of illusion cool spot ristar alex kidd earthworm jim aladdin ecco flinksee bottom and shinobi fightersbrawlers golden axe streets of rage    eternal champions street fighter ii ce and two crude dudesshooters gunstar heroes sub terrania truxton gaiares musha ranger x and raidenrpgs phantasy star     beyond oasis shining force ii land stalker and crusader of centysports arnold palmer tournament golf madden and tommy lasorda baseballif youre inclined to pick up the sega cd addon you should also consider the followingflinkwonder dog sega cdfinal fight sega cd sonic cd earthworm jim se robo aleste silpheed ah thunderstrike and batman returns
the misadventures of flink is available on cartridge in the euro market only however its available domestically on the sega cdi recently found a sega genesis console at my local video game store and couldnt wait to start playing it
i havent touched a lot of these games for almost  years  with the exception of the sonic the hedgehog series
this console was the answer to the super nes and almost had as much life as the former console
but dont get me wrong  sega still produced a lot of timeless classics and its really hard for me to put down
the plugins are very easy too  all you need is the ac adaptor and av cable just make sure to switch your television to input mode in order to make the sega genesis worknow i will recommend the following titles to the gamers who are already familiar with the sega franchise or need something fresh to playphantasy star     cadashcastlevania  bloodlinesaladdinshining force   shining in the darknesscastle of illusion starring mickey mouseworld of illusion starring mickey  donaldghouls n ghostsgenesis pak  sonic the hedgehog  streets of rage  columns the revenge of shinobi super hangon golden axe golden axe   sonic the hedgehog   sonic  knucklesstreets of rage   vectorman   there is one more game that i used to play when they had the sega channel out back in  this was a monthly subscriber channel where you could select a different crop of games every month
its called mega man  the wily wars
this is the equivalent of super mario allstars ie
mega man   and  were completely redesigned with new graphics sound and animation
sadly you cannot get this title in cartridge format and you would be lucky if you could even find it on the wiiwii u channel
the only other way to get it is to order the atgames sega handheld portable console with some builtin games on amazons websiteif any of you fellow readers can think of any other sega games that i forgot to list above please feel free to sharesince i was a little kid i have always been a sega loyalist the only sega systems i never had were the sega master system and the game gear
i always loved my genesis and i still play it to this day but the one thing that always ticked me off was how the super nintendo always got more coverage than the genesis did
true the genesis didnt have the color pallete or sound chip that the super nes had but the genesis had a huge library of exclusive games that defined the bit era
naturally as with every sega system the best games are the sports and fighting games and the genesis has tons of them
without a doubt the genesis is a landmark system and if you still have yours hang on to it
below is a list of genesis games that are extremely recommended for your genesis library you can find many of them at used video game stores or yard salesgunstar heroes the best genesis game everphantasy star nhl revenge of shinobisonic the hedgehog castlevania bloodlinesstriderghouls n ghoststhunder force shining force eternal championsworld series baseball the sega genesis is the first video game system i ever played
i played this system before the nes
and i fell in love with it
it has classic titles that are still enjoyable today
with games like sonic the hedgehog road rash  ms pacman nba jam castlevania street fighter  maximum carnage comix zone vectorman and many more this console makes me want to switch it on and just play
at the time it was awesome and today its still a jewel
the simplicity of the genesis is something any gamer or nongamer should experience
if you dont own it its still not too late to get away from the complexity of todays consoles and just go back and play the titles youve always wanted to go back and play
as soon as i order an ac adaptor for it you bet im going back and playing the classics
i remember getting frustrated that i lost at such a far point and excited that i defeated the final boss
the sega genesis is awesomeevery gamer should own iti am a serious gamer owning  systems and a arcade machine
im  in april  still gaming strong
the sega genesis still gets plenty of play
my yr old son  i enjoy being couch bums on the weekends and getting our game on
the genesis has an expansive library of games great exclusivesect highly recommend getting this system
i got one years ago as a kid
and for whatever reason i got rid of it as a teenager
truly regretted it  about  years ago i finally got one again
and amazingly it was at a store brand new box and all
since then i have bought  games for it
and will continue to buy more carts for it
games i recommend arezombies ate my neighborscaptain america  the avengersboogermantoe jam  earlearthworm jim sonic  revenge of shinobialtred beastgolden axenba jamstreets of rage wwf royal rumbleleathal enforcersstridermortal kombat street fighter evander holyfields real deal boxingmercsvapor trailpigskin footballmadden  my favorite madden to datexmenspidermanincredible hulkghouls  goblinslast battleeternal championswwf super wrestlemaniaconsidering how old the sega is i was impressed with the condition it was it
i love playin the sega and its been a great product to haveright before the super nintendo came into the scene sega was taking care of business pretty easily by releasing the sega genesis
granted the master system was out before it but that didnt become a big shot consolethe genesis had a library of amazingly graphical bit games before the super nintendo
in fact when the super nintendo came out the genesis library was still growing
genesis production stopped in  though
yet the last game for it came out in the most notable genesis titles are the sonic games and perhaps gunstar heroesthis is my favorite video game system of all timei have sooo many great memories with this from my childhoodsega genesisin my opinionwas alot better than super nintendoi admitthat on some gamessnes had better graphics than genesisbut not on alland besidesthe games on genesis were so much better than snes games werei would recommend this console over super nintendo anydayi did back thenand i still do todaypick this upand all the great games that are available for itsega rulz forever remember that as you buy their titles from xbox live arcadegood times from one of the most fan focused companies out therebravo segai began video gaming on this platform at the age of  i am now yrs old and still going strong on video gamesi love this platform because it is sleek and the controller was the first to be ergonimically designedthe games are very enjoyable and i go back to them regularly
they had some very unique ones such as boogerman zombie ate my neighbors toejam  earl on the planet funketronit also had the best pinball games ever to be released to date
dragons revenge and dragons furyi recently purchased phantasy star iv on this platform and am enjoying it very much
i also liked the rpg sword of vermillion a very underated game but a good onethis system had superb graphics for the time
was very far ahead
i go back and play the sega games since most games today are just clones of clones  sega was way ahead of its time in platforms too bad they did not know how to run a business or they would have given nintendo sony and xbox some heavy competition
you will not be disappointed with this platform that began a lot of fine thingsthis is the best version of the popular arcade game to ever grace a video game console
mortal kombat  is perfect on the playstation
its exactly like the arcade hit with the same moves stages combos music sound fx characters and intense brutality
mortal kombat trilogy for playstation was also a great game however it did lack in originality
but mk does not lack in originality
it is perfect
infact since mortal kombat was so extremely popular mk put playstation on the map for good
the arcade story mode is here and all of the blood fatalities animalities babalities and friendships are here
the nailbiting stage fatalities are also here including the gruesome pit iii fatality
the game also has a couple of secret cheat menus which allow you to do all sorts of cool stuff
i highly recommend this game to diehard fansi liked the game
it was similar to the original mortal kombat side scrolling fighting games
i had the ps control to the gamei reseved this game when it before it just came out and believe when it hit in  it was impossible to get i playstation did one hell of a job this game was awesome i had this game before anyone my friends so they wanted to come over and play it the genesis and snes versions didnt come out till in the further year but i had fun playing my version so thank you playstation for making a version that rocks and its also one of the best mks made because i didnt like segas version it just didnt have it like it should being the new versions and allthe most basic and challenging resident evili love itits a classic its scary and its a sin to not ever play itin the city of raccoon city there has been reports of cannibalism and creatures attacking people in some parts of the city
the local police sends stars alpha team unit that consists of chris redfield jill valentine barry burton and albert wesker to investigate in the outskirts of the city but when they discovered one of their members joseph died from a creature attack they all seek shelter in a large mansion
inside they separate to find missing members of the team and investigate the strange happenings for they discover horrifying things like zombies mutants killer snakes and other monsters that roam the mansion as they arm themselves with weapons that they can find including ammo and solve puzzles to complete their mission and get outa groundbreaking game for its day since  when it became one of the most critically acclaimed and unique video games of all time influenced by films like george romeros zombie trilogy and horrorscifi films this game is a very thrilling and chilling beginning to an awesome series
i first played this when i was  when it first came out as i rented a ps with this game and it blew me away as it became one of my fave games sure some of the controls arent great neither is the graphics but it still remains creepy at times
sometimes the dialog is laughable such as you the master of unlocking or you might have been a jill sandwhich it reestablished survival horror
it has spawned many sequels a remake movies merchandise action figures and all that kind of stuffnot only is this game great to play but its really scary
i remember the first time i started playing this game was really late at night around  pm i locked my door closed all the window curtains got me some snacks and drinks and last but not least popped the game into my original playstation and turned up the volume on the tv
this game really scared the hell out of me i would use another word besides hell but i dont want to be rude to anyone else
the music and sound effects sended chills down my spine and i got goose bumps but the game was still fun and addicting to play
by the time i started to see daylight i was not that scared
so give this game a try and see for your self but make sure you play it till daylight or you will have to sleep at a minimum with your reading lamp on
just kidding for real try this game out its really funi have had this game sence it first came outeven today i still love it but the voice acting is bad but it is hard to come by now a days so i am keeping it but noe i have the gamecube version so i dont play it much anymorein the midnineties i forget the exact year capcom turned the video game world on its ear with resident evil a game which at the time was nothing like anyone else had ever seen before
what many condider the first survival horror game although the original alone in the dark can be considered that as well you play as either chris redfield or jill valentine both of whom are members of stars
 an elite special forces group who are investigating a series of murders and attacks in raccoon city
they are led towards a mysterious mansion in the outskirts of the city and are sent in when the first team sent in is never heard from again
inside the mansion you are pitted against a horde of zombies mutated dogs beasts called hunters and many more mutated lifeforms all straight out of a b rated horror movie
what made the game so fun and addicting was the suspense remember the part where everything is quiet and your walking down the hallway when out of nowhere the dogs come bursting through the window
and the graphics engine which combined fully d models of the characters and beautifully prerendered backgrounds
while the quotfind the key to unlock the doorquot puzzles are tried and true especially by todays standards this original installment in the resident evil series is still loads of fun to play and if youve never played it before than you should consider this essential playingresident evil is the game that brought survival horror to the masses
although the game is very much dated especially after the release of a remake for the gamecube by todays standerds it is still a ton of fun to play and get lost in for hours at a time
while playing it now many people experience a so what
sort of feeling twards the game but you have to remember that when the game was released the things featured in the game were all new
the game now is hard to find and hardly played with a gamecube remake of it out which improves on this game in every way this game is important because while it wasnt the first survival horror game released it was certianly the game that redifined the genre and paved the road for the silent hills and fatal frams that we all enjoy todayold school scares at their bestremember just because its made for a next generation system doesnt mean its better
resident evil was made for the playstation and it still arguably scarier than most of the new scary games out there
plain and simple dont miss this game
its one of those titles that everyone knows is good
it is such a great game that its reputation precedes itself
there really shouldnt be any reason why you shouldnt buy it
unless you dont have any type of playstation or computer
if youre interested in what all the fuss is about with quotsurvival horrorquot games well this is originial hit that started it allnothing can compare to the first time you play this game
this game is the only really appropriate introduction into the survival horror genre  fitting because it is the game that started it all
sure there was alone in the dark but the unfortunate fact is that the game is too old for most members of the current generations to care or even acknowledge
at least with the playstation    there is still room to include games of an older but not necessarily worse generation
as long as you know what you are gettingbest playstation graphics outside of the final fantasy seriesscary music good enough for a soundtrackalso availableclever controls and game mechanicsengrossing storylinescary moments never before experiencedfairly easy puzzles to solve and move the plot alongmultiple endings and secrets to findthen you know aboutgraphics are slightly outdated for todays standardsscary moments arent so scary if youve play resident evil  or other newer survival horrors ie
youre quotused to themquotsome frustration due to learning a new control schemesome backtracking and thinking to solve puzzlesit features a story appropriate enough for its setting and purpose and gives the player a reason to keep on playing
the graphics are great for the playstation  and trust me
the scary environments music sounds and gameplay totally makes up for anyone spoiled by todays generation of consoles xbox gamecube ps
keep in mind that this game did have superb graphics at its time so its not like it looked terrible from the start
if it looks ugly and grainy then its probably more of a personal problem
the quotspoiledquot issue doesnt helpthe controls are tough to get used to if youve never played survival horror games before
but in retrospect it is understandable to have tough controls since the game was the first of its kind  featuring much of which has never been done before
in that sense learning how to ride a bicycle is similar to learning resident evils controls or just like learning your first quotshoryukenquot or quothadokenquot
it is something that must be learned in order for progress to be made
no major arguements can be made with the controls other than it being necessary for the unique experience of playing something completely different and new
it couldnt have been done any other wayive been playing since the intellivision and atari
i suspect some may not even know what the first system is and thats a shame
those games created the foundation to what we have today
they are the quotrealquot classics
resident evil is a game which represents a huge leap in this continuing evolution
sure as of now it pales in comparison to other titles but at its core is an experience that will blow away any fancysilkysmooth d graphic churned out in todays industrythere are millions of reviews out there on the internet basically saying the same thing
this game is undeniably the reason why there is a survival horror genre
wouldnt you want to play the game that invented the quotadventurequot or quotactionquot genre
of course you would
you would want to play the brand name that started it all not some cheap ripoff
but even the price tag is a no brainer
at such a small price you can purchase one of the best games ever created
better now than never
thisll probably be as cheap as it gets before it starts getting expensive due to lack of availabilityresident evil started it all with its zombie filled mansion with nothing but sheer terror and this game is truly original
it was the one to start it all and spawn great classic sequals and also boost up one hell of a remake
the game has a pretty linear story but its still great
the game was really scary back then but now when you play it youll laugh out loud at how bad the voice actors wereit had some great classic moments like you fighting a gigantic plant to fighting a huge snake
it really had its share of great horror moments
its the sheer brilliance that capcom had in making this amazing game
its more like an adventureehh sort of
the game lets you choose between one of the two main characters
either way youll still have a great time
the best is chris
and now lets get startedthe graphics are awesome
for that time it was great
just brilliant capcom rules
i love the backround in this game its simply terrific and i loved it
short and sweetthe graphics rulegameplaywell its pretty much puzzle solving and sometimes some zombie killinawesome
the gameplay is were this game gets really good and its survival horror at its bestsoundwell the acting is horrible but the rest is aokespecially the musicits greatover all i must say this has superior graphics for that time and age ok sound and some of the best horror moments in the survival horror genreand that is why this masterpiece gets a out of  stars
and for my final saying in this amazing game its sad to know that the us only carries the censored version of the game which takes out a few gory moments in the game like when one of your faithfull team member is getting torn apart by a zombie dogerrr goryand some other scenesi happend to see the videos shown on re fancom and it was funny yet very very explicet to see  oh well it still doesnt stop the games mood
and thankfully there still are some violent scenes in the final us version such as weskers deathewwww nastybut over all it still is a neat censored versionand thats about itlatesresident evil is one of the best video games ever madeand helped start the survival horror genre in the videogame industry more then alone in the dark did on the pci first played this game back when it first came outfor the playstation back in  or  it was trulya groundbreaking game at the time it came out
manyvideo game magazines such as egm gamepro and websiteslike gamespot gave it good reviewsthe game on the original playstation console has pretty decentgraphics that were groundbreaking at the time for consolegamesthe game itself has you select between two characterseither jill valentine or chris redfield
jill is an easiercharacter to play then chris is and items such as ammo andhealing items are more plentiful for herthe gameplay is not to tough as you are mostly exploring acreepy mansion running into the undead every so often suchas zombies zombie dogs giant spiders that are poisonousand even giant man eating plants
there are certain waysto kill certain bosses such as the giant man eating plantby killing it with weed fertilizer for example
this isalso a puzzle of sorts that some people may as such andmany more puzzle are found throughout the game some oftenrequiring the use of a strategy guide thank god for egmgamepro and other guides at the time this game came out espthe internet as well
the games story centers around towards the end anywayand evil organization known as umbrellaresident evil has a good storyline excellent sound thatis both haunting and creep at the same time and when anenemy is nearby is changes its intensity
i like how oneof the characters plays moonlight sonata on the piano atone point in the game to open a secret passageway or doorthat is hiddenyou get a good selection of guns healing items and ammothough they are almost always in short supply
thankfullyyou have a knife for backup that each character has on handonly a certain amount of items may be carried at any given timeyou may store items in item storage boxes found in some ares ofthe mansionthe same is saved via ink ribbons you find throughout thecreepy mansion which you then use on typewriters you find tosave your gamethe characters youll meet throughout the game in the mansionare kinda cliched but thats ok with me
the storyline may beas well but again its still interesting to see how it unfoldsthe whole game itself is pretty well made and should warranta playthrough at least twice as there are also secrets to unlocki like finding notes journals and books and reading throughthem to get a sense of despair isolation loneliness and dreadthe previous residents and people of the mansion had beforeall hell broke loose in it and it does add to the storylineand give clues on how to solve puzzles as welli give resident evil on the playstation  stars for creepysurvival horror fun haunting music beautiful graphics andscenery the cutscenes are ok but nothing spectacular exceptthe end maybe surprises a feeling of isolation and despairesp
when playing the game alone late at night and revivingthe survial horror genre and making way for games such assilent hill and others like it
one of the playstationsfinest games it has to offeri purchased this game on my playstation  the part that started my unending passion for resident evil and for all the parts that came after this oneour heros jill valentine  chris redfield are the main characters of this part members of the famous stars team they go through the horror event of this game
jill is my ultimate and most favorite charater of all re herosi recommend all re fans to play this part not only because of all the fun the horror an the satisfaction of playing and completing this game but also to follow and live through this games amazing story linegamemanualcase all great condition
game runs with out problems
received it within a short time frame
thank you for great condition of a great findthis game still to me is the best horroraction game available for the playstation one
it is a solid allaround game that must be experienced by all playstation one owners
the storyline and action alone is well worth it
add in the horror aspects and youve got one hell of a game
the controls are the only weakness in this game but even then they are on par with most  dimensional games out there
i believe that the graphics are topnotch for ps
even today i would still play it and i own a lot of game consoles including the ps and gamecube
i would never sell my copy of resident evil because i still go back to it and it is in my opinion a milestone in video gaming history
it will go on to become a much soughtafter game years from now
why
because it will withstand time
the graphics may be outdated years from now but all the elements that are there historically will be seen as a work of achievementsay listen im not going to say anything different than anyone else have said about this game but i would like to say that this game was the sole reason i got the playstation
so its great that a game sells the console
otherwise i wouldve gone with nintendo 
yikes
im a fan of the whole creepy game genre silent hill resident evil etc
but i must say it was much more creepier if the game wouldve stayed in the mansion because once it went into a lab thats where the game kinda became boring
i love the whole mansion concept
imagine the main boss loose in the mansion lurking around every corridor
thats be pretty scary
i mean the main monster was very scary
i kinda hoped he wouldve been the main monster in the first resident evil movie
instead it was a licker from the resident evil  games
i wouldve been more scared of the tyrant than the licker in the movies
nevertheless this game is a true classic
get it before it becomes a collectors item and youll have to spend big bucks to buy itthe resident evil series has been one of the most successful game franchises of the past decade resulting in numerous sequels and remakes of older installments in the series as well as spawning two motion pictures
but this is the one that gave birth to not only a new game franchise but a new genre as wellalthough the survival horror genre has all but disappeared today in the late s it was one of the top genres in the gaming business
players assumed the role of a hero lurking about an eerie creepy environment battling supernatural and superhuman entities
the trademark of survival horror was its intention to scare the living hell out of the player much like a horror filmif youve never played this original i strongly suggest you do so
but make sure you first wait until the middle of the night and turn out all the lights in your room except for the tvby the end of the first cutscene you may no longer have clean pants
thats how scary this game was when it was first released to unsuspecting fans a decade agofollowing a string of bizarre incidents and disappearances on the outskirts of raccoon city the bravo police unit is sent to investigate
things quickly go wrong however and four members of the unit seek refuge in a creepylooking mansion on the edge of the woods sound familiar
now they must find out what the hell is going onyou play as either jill valentine or chris redfield blasting zombies and other undead enemies while exploring the mansion
the prerendered background graphics and dramatic shifts in camera angles heighten the suspense that rival alfred hitchcock films
you always have the fear that something deadly is waiting for you in the next roomthe plot and gameplay experience are outstanding and the graphics arent that bad either considering that this title is now ten years old
but the best part of re is the mysterious frightening mood that is conveyed while playing
there are some moments that will scare the living hell out of youthis game is something amazing
you cant say anything about it
zombies are living in the house and you cant get out of it there are a lot of creatures living in the house but you cant get out from this nightmare
is the best on the series fear is the perfect word for this gamee if suspense doesnt kill you something else willxeviousmappygalpussuper pac mangrobdadragon busteri paid full price maybe more for this compilation just for xevious and super pac man alone each is perfectly emulated and have distinct exhibits in the museum with digitized images and other paraphenalia from the sprobably didnt sell as well as it should have cause everyone was expecting the ms to be on itgreat for the whole familyplays on playstation i bought this game and loved it
you can play as a supersaiyajin  goku
also at the end you face super monkey baby from dragonball gt
it also has characters from dragonball z like future trunks and vegito
anyways u will love this game if u like dbzgti had first saw this game in   it immediatly climbed to  on my list
the story was decent but the platform was unique
it played like no other rpg at the time
there were aspects that were confusing but what was really neat was that depending on what character of the seven you choose depends on the progression of the game
certian characers will intereact differently with the npcs then others
if you are for the classics then this rpg is the one to find
currently only for snes
its worth buying
a splendid gamei have to be man enough to admit that yes i missed out on a lot of good super nintendo games when i was a kid but to my defense i had fantastic titles like illusion of gaia and legend of zelda a link to the past to keep me occupied
but i cant believewith any ounce in my mindthat i missed out on this
seeing as i just got the game for christmas of  less than a month ago and finished the game completely within one week i think its only fair to give my two cents worth here in the form of a review
lets get started shall westory epic
every fiber of my being believes that soul blazer and terranigma got the basis of their plots from this bad boy
you are the master otherwise known as god but they changed a few names because of religious conflicts over here in na and you have just reawakened from an ancient war with tanzra otherwise known as satan but again religious conflicts the lord of darkness
after a long and arduous struggle neither force was victorious but tanzra summoned forth mighty demons to imprison the souls of the people of the world
as such it is your duty as lord and savior to restore the world to its former glory resurrecting the people of your world and developing every major location across the globe through civilization
consider this games story a sort of postapocalyptic masterpiece more so than any game of its kind
i was hooked from start to finish and found myself greatly intrigued by the morals and beliefs held towards the end of the adventure
every game has a story to tell and this one told it exquisitelygameplay very interesting
actraiser combines the gameplay of both actionplatforming and world simulation and rolls it all up in a beautiful golden biscuit sandwichwith extra awesome
during your adventure you will switch between action mode and simulation mode
in action mode you will take the form of a mighty statue created in honor of the master as you slay the hordes of demons summoned forth by tanzra defeating the lords of each area and restoring order to the world
in simulation mode you will assist the people you bring back to life in developing the world increasing the population constructing houses and growing crops and more
depending on how many enemies you kill during the action mode as well as your final score after defeating the boss of the current act you will release an according number of souls to develop civilization
you will hold this practice from beginning to end and youll love pretty much every minute of it
the only real complaints i had were some of the enemy placement options both in action mode and in simulation mode but even those problems can be fixed by being patientpresentation very impressive
this games choice of play style was simply fascinating
never before have i seen actionplatforming and simulation done so well together and i dont think i will ever see that
the games level of difficulty is what drove some people up the wall some parts are easier than others granted but there were a lot of instances that were just flatout unforgiving
but again just like with the enemy placement complaint i had this can be solved by simply being patient and analyzing your surroundings carefully
relax
take your time especially on your first journey through the game
once youve gotten the hang of things youll find easier ways to get around the difficultymusic freakin amazing
i was hooked to every single track in the game
theyre all unforgettable they all match the settings they are in and theyre all catchy as hell
my only complaint is that they recycle some songs for other areas when i know that seeing as this is enix were talking about here the geniuses who gave us the soul blazer trilogy not but a year or so later they could have made a couple more tracks
still the battle with satanerrtanzra is a fight i will never forget mainly because of the awesome musicoverall rating actraiser is one of the few treasure of the super nintendo era though surprisingly not many people knew about it
im actually a little ashamed to consider myself one of those people but even so im glad i finally decided to collect this gem case manual everything baby
i cant really say anything more other than i think you should definitely pick it up if you havent already
lead the way o merciful masters of amazoni think that this is one of the best supernes games half rpg half action and the music is fantastic i recommend i purchased actraiser  online because it was less money and i wanted to see how the game play was
i really liked the second one so i purchased the first
the first is great the has some creative game play for its time
would suggest buying this gameactraiser  is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best actraiser  rocksi was not sure about this game because i have never heard about it
played the game and it was really fun and needed to buy the first game
the game is hard but that is why it is funthis is a great sidescroller game in which you throw weapons at your enemy and collect fruit
it is on a tropical island and has tropical style music calypso style the only bad thing about it is that it is not as fast as the bit counterpart but still enjoyable
gotta love the skateboard
it is sometimes difficult but enjoyable
i highly recommend this game this game is fun i love it my kids love it to thay bet it in a week thear gamersi cant believe noone has reviewed this yetat the time of its release it was hailed as one of the best games for the snes
today it stands the test of time as one of the best games everhopefully nintendo will come out with an snes compilation disc with this game as one of the featuresthis game is loads of fun i really liked this game
in this game you get to play the predator who hunts the alien
this game started it all with alien vs predator games
and this is a true classic
i recomend this game for everyonelove this game
first of all  i have to say that this version of alien vs predator is not a port of that awesome capcom arcade game from the mid showever this version is a welcome addition to the snes library and is worth checking outyou play a predator  in new shanghai  who is on a quest for the ultimate trophyguess what that is 
aliens
there are lots of xenomorphs  to hunt downthis is button mashing at its finest
the screen is literally filled with aliens whats there not to likethe predator has all his tools of the tradefrom his gauntlet spear the smart disc  the shoulder mounted blasterits all herethe bosses are hugeand are pretty easy to defeatonce you discover their pattern
the graphics here are excellent for the snesand still hold up  pretty well to this dayif your a fan of old school beat em ups  and these film creatures its a no brainerbatman returns rock
this game is so awesome
this game is actually one game that you go through it like you were in the movie
i love this game
its full of batolicious stuff and the penguin is one tuff dude
this game is for everyonethis game is a must have for fans of action and batman
buy itthe punching in this is none stoping actionfor snes batman returns is the best action game out theirps get it for the actionbatman returns is a brawler game for the snes much like final fight and turtles in time
you go through several stages beating up the bad guys
some stages are d with minor platforming action
one stage is simulated d and lets you drive the batmobiletwo things make this game one of the best batman titles ever released
gameplaywise batman has tons of moves to keep the fighting from getting boring
besides your basic combo there are jump kicks a glide attack and multiple grab attacks that let you bash heads together slam bad guys into the ground or smash them against objects and the background
multiple enemy types environmental hazards and fun boss types keep the levels freshpresentation wise konami went allout with making the game feel like the movie
graphics and design are accurate to burtons unique visionary style and almost all of danny elfmans hauntingly rich score has been captured on the snes cart with amazing accuracy
rendered shots of characters and scenes from the movie give the game that authenticity that we are only starting to get on a consistent basis with todays movie tiein offerings
plus tiny details such as being able to duplicate batmans encounter with the stun gun clown make the game come to lifethe only thing missing is player mode which really wouldnt have fit with the movies structure
definitely sets a high standard for all batman and movie tiein games and an essential piece of any batman game collectionnow you can play batman just like in the hit film batman returnsthis game rocksand batman will kick ityou must save gotham from an army of clownscatwomanand the penguina game for everyoneim glad they have a game or two with captain america in it
he is one of my favorite superheros
i really enjoyed this game
it was really fun to play
i recomend this game for everyone
in this game you also get to play iron man vision  hawkeyei first saw the original captain america movie back in betwen th and th grade i thought i was decently shot
here are some strategies and boss defense and attack statisic that you can be used for the bosses starting from the begining with cheat or with out cheats if your playing this on easy mode and have practiced a decent amount
the next boss is likea giant sentinetal staypuff marshmelllow maan size robot like they original were from x man cartoon and comic series before they were shronk them down to about maybe  to  feet in hight like in marvel versus capcon  or about maybe maybe about  taller than juggernaut
depsite his height boss has a high damage resitanc percent of about  you can take him down quickly in a bout  to four minutes because your hover crafts shot up to three to four shiedl out of a time ata super fast machine gun lik speed
since this giant robot seldom block his face with his hand his health will go down quickly
it will lose about  of his health for every unblock hit of the shield projectiles that hit his face
next you must fight a foe of the avengers known as the reaper
he has about a  dame resitance to shield attack either by literall throwing the shield or punchinh him with hand thats holding it
hit him  times with this attack successfull when he come with in the strike attack range and he goes down
the next boss fight the wizard with and ll percent resitance to punch and kick attacks you can take thisa guy down quickloy ar a lose of  of his health if you memorize his attack pattern well enough if playing with no cheats activated
use the same technique used of the sentimetal like boss and this squid robot wil go down with about  shiled blasst attack of about  lose of vital per hit
you next fight mandrane who has at  resitance against against  shield throw attack punches and kickes and a throw or two  occasional
to decrease damage resitance use throws more often to do double or triplle the damage per attack a normal kick or shield throw act
this might increase lose boss vitral from about ameasly  to  percent damage pere succesfull performed attack move to about maybe  to  damage per move when performed correctly at close enough range
the next boss is called juggernaut
he has about and  resitance to the shield throw and normal punch kick attack cuasing a maxium of  lose of vital per hit to double the lose of vital try to do throws because in early games like king of the monster  the throw attacks tended to do more damage than normal punch and kick attacks
the next bosds ultratrons is the toughest boss in the game stamina wise having a  damage resistanc to puucn kich and the shiled throw attack
these attack probably do very small amount of  damage maybe a little more than  percent vital lose each time sucessfull performed and he has and beam like weapon similar to that of iron man
so you so you should probaly body throw and slammed technqiues to speed up the battles
cross bone has a   defense resitance against normal hits to cut that in half tru to used the up close throw slash body slamm attacks to no more damage per move
for the red skull first partof fight he has a  resitance
so about thirteen blows our about  to  body slams  throw will do him in
after this you face the final boss one more final robot
you justed beat the metal skull the boss with the highest stamina of  against normal attacks that means  your blow take a super pathetic amount of  vital per hit
this boss has porjectile weapon create tornado projectiles and has a barrier of elctric around him you can still hit up close with no cheats on
but this may mutilate your health bar if you dont have infinite halth or contiunues  on so attacking from a far away distance with your shield throw may be the easy ways to defeat this boss since the elctric barrier is around him very frequetly
defeat this boss you have save the world from the red school and  now hit tail it out of there as the bases collapsesi love castlevania and this is one of the reasons why
castlevania is one of the best video game series of all time
the fourth installment for the super nes is one of the reasons why
simon belmonts theme has never been better and the gameplay is superb
its not as advanced as castlevania symphony of the night but for the old skool gamer its a great buy
some people tend to compare this to castlevania bloodlines on the sega genesis and of course symphony of the night for the playstation
my suggestion get all three
you wont go wrong with themthe snes version of castlevania not the subpar quotdracula xquot port still remains not just one of the best vania games but one of the best snes games as well
one of those rare games that actually improves not just the visuals of its predecessors but the gameplay and challenge as well
if amazon rereleases this and you have a dusty snes at home pick this one upin the fall of  a few months after the super nes made its debut konami began its full fledged support with gradius iii and the classic gem super castlevania iv
finally after players romped through the excellent castlevania iii for the nes the castlevania series swung to the snes in classic form but upgraded with  bit graphics music and sounds that took advantage of the strengths of the new console
many players had regarded this particular castlevania title as one of the best in the series
read on to find out whyplayers take control of simon belmont whose family were comprised of legendary vampire hunters who protected their land from all evil
when dracula rose from the grave again to spread evil simon takes off to find and destroy him
his journey takes him through  stages filled with enemies traps and boss characters atop various backgrounds and scenery
armed with a whip that you can strike in eight directions and can swing from door handle hooks youll use your main weapon throughout the entire game
along the way you can pick up sub weapons such as boomerangs daggers holy water and axes as well as hearts weapon ammo money bags pointsand turkey legs  pork chops health power ups
a password system lets you write down a password to continue your game later on but the game gives it to you only at the continue screenthe pros never mind that the bump in graphics and sounds from castlevania iii was obvious but everything blends well
its a blast to play thanks to the crisp and gorgeous graphics featuring cool special effects spot on controls brand new music plus remixed music from previous castlevania games a huge variety of enemies and bosses and a difficulty curve that rises as you get further into the game that doesnt overwhelm you
and when you beat the game the first time you automatically start over where the enemies move faster take more hits while you take more damage and the clock runs down faster
top it off with a password system that is easy to use and you got a great castlevania game that showcases what you can do on the super nesthe cons the only minor flaw i can say is that the game is short compared to the last game on the nes
while super castlevania iv featured  stages castlevania iii had a whopping  plus stages and was considerably much much harder to completewhile super castlevania iv wont challenge you like the previous games in the series it was and still is fun to watch and play
konami went all out to show just how good it can be and they exceeded everyones expectations
to those who missed the chance to play this particular entry youll be paying a pretty penny to buy this brand new
either get a used copy if you have a working snes or if you own a wii you can download this game from their virtual console service for  points 
its a great deal considering what you would pay for the cartridge
dont wait any longer
if you havent played this masterpiece do so asap
i highly recommend this gamethis is itthis is the game that would change my view of videogaming foreverimagine if you will a perfect soundtrack a perfect story a perfect game
a game about a mans fight against the ultimate evil dracula himselfyes you may ask why bother reviewing this game now that it is so old
well i can see there are a couple of used titles left so get your copy if you havent played it
this game belongs with the games that go to the ultimate cloud  heavena must experiencethis is a side platform fighting game the fourth in the series as you are trevor belmont vampire hunter working your way through a massive fourteen level castle killing nightmarish creatures in an attempt to destroy dracula
this is an amazing platform game it incorporates every capability of snes such as the rotating room of the castle
the entire room rotates in an attempt to kill you
you can attack with your whip in a  angle and there are several new tips and tricks you learn with your whip such as how to whip onto a ring and swing on it to another platform
the quest of this game is a little dull because you constantly move forward looking for powerups items weapons and secrets
the challenge is still great in this game and everything is fully detailed graphics wise
fantastic game
the features were a bit disappointing after castlevania iii because there are now less weapons and less modes of playoldschool castlevanias are those with completely linear quests that is you go from point a to point b killing everything in your path the nonlinear games such as aria of sorrow or sympony of the night are sometimes referred to as metroidvania
in super castlevania iv simon belmont steps out to defeat count dracula on a side note its not really iv konami later admitted that this game is just a remake of the original  nes castlevania
this being said simon has a lot of moves at his disposal
it this gamethe only game in the series to do thissimon can whip up down left right or diagonal
he can flail the whip around
he can swing from hooks in the ceiling
controlling simon is 
well its a joy
play control has never been this tight on a castlevania game before or sinceall the levels are deep and atmospheric with perfect music well except for the atlantis shrine anyway
the music to level one is my personal favorite
rooms scroll in the background vines creep up rail fences as you approach spiderwebs actually look dusty
the graphics are absolutely amazing and look better than many graphics on  or even bit sidescrollersan absolute masterpiece of a gameback in the good ol days when the super nes first came out there were many good games which came out for it shortly afterwards or on the day of release
super mario worlda link to the pastfinal fantasy iv iithen there was the latest in the castlevania series super castlevania ivsc iv is one of the better cv games out there
this would probably be my rd favorite behind symphony of the night and lament of innocence
the graphics were great for the time
control is pretty easy once you get used to it
overall its pretty challenging
some of the levels are really fun others are mediocre
the story is basic castlevania stuff but for the most part all of the castlevanias have been about the gameplay and this one certainly doesnt fail in that area
if you ever want to look back for an old game to play try this one out
you wont be disappointedim a collector of ff games and i enjoy having this as part of my collection
i recommend it for anyone that is a big collector like i am
its expensive but worth the pricemaybe its just me but i love the game
i was  when i got my hands on it and im  now but the game is good for the both age groupsthe mp system is redone in the past which clearly is the last of the each spell takes one point system
ffj only in japan was the first to introduce the system of magic points and such cure takes  and meteo takes  complicating
final fantasy mystic quest is probably one of my favorites simply because it was easy to understand and the storyline was actually understandible ff confused me
the music was some of the best and i couldnt stop playing the game
i used to stay up until am playing the gameffmq is no ffx or lufia  but it specializes for the younger ons such as myself
i still play the game to this day but then again if youre in the adult ages id consider you to rent it then again itd probably be cheaper to buy since it came out ten years ago
it was the game of its time and it truly is the beginning of ffs sucess clearly a great start to new rpgers to the rpg systems of today and a good way to bring up the confidence in yourselffinal fantasy mystic quest known as mystic quest legend in europe and as final fantasy usa mystic quest in japan is a fantasysword and sorcery rpg for the super nintendo
it was released in north america in  and in japan and europe in  this was the first final fantasy game to be released in europethis is an easy rpg made for beginners
it is also one of my favorite final fantasy games
in the story the  elemental crystals of the world have been stolen by monsters
you play a knight named benjamin and you must join up with other fighters in order to save the crystals and destroy the dark kingthe characters that join you throughout the game are kaeli tristam phoebe and reuben
phoebe is my favorite character and she is the character that joins you in the final battlei really like this game
its a fun short and easy game
it also has great music cool sound effects and colorful graphics
i recommend this game to any rpg fanmystic quest was the one of the first games i ever played and i hold it near and dear to me alot of people think this game is stupid but to me its one of the best snes games ever made
i have played this many times its a great game and i love it but
if you dont have a snes anymore you may want to get one they havent released this for the wii virtual consolei gave this game a  star for what it is an entry level basic rpg
dont expect much but if you want to pass the rpg torch onto your kids its a great game i know my daughter will love it  i remember playing this game non stop as a child at my moms house on the weekends because my dad wouldnt let me play video games but to his surprise i became a stronger reader and more scholastically developed playing these sort of games enjoy
but like i said dont buy if your a seasoned rpg vet or a new age rpger you wont like this but it is what it isfinal fantasy is the best rpg franchise out there
there have been some black sheep viii x xiii but the whole series is great overallout of these main games in the series have come side stories like final fantasy tactics or final fantasy crystal chronicles
one of the side games is final fantasy mystic questmade for new beginners this game was designed to be a shorter quest
it is full of subtle humor and quirky moments but it is by no means a bad game
it also contains one of the cheesiest endings in a final fantasy game second only to chrono cross
but the game is relatively good despite some quirkiness
i enjoy playing it because you can save anywhere its extremely short only  hours from start to finish and excellent musicif you have never played a final fantasy game before or if you just want to relax while playing a final fantasy game not spend hours grinding or going through story events then this game is a nice diversion
i give it a  out of there was one mysterious enemy that i could not find required to beat in order to continue the quest until i looked it up on line
still since i enjoy these type of games i loved being stuck for a period of timeold skool game
ive had it forever
no collection is complete without it
i may go play it here in a minute
actually no but it was a great game
i enjoyed it
took a long time to beat
personally i like the snes games better than the playstationi have to admit this has a simple story simple graphics etc
but it was the starting point for my love of roleplaying games
and for its time its a decent game
its fairly easy to figure out the puzzles and the bosses arent too tough
if i picked an rpg now id probably prefer a game with better graphics and all such as ffx but dont let this stop collectors or beginnersi have played and finished this game and plan to play again
this game is straight forward and you dont have to guess at anything
you have limited freedom of where to go so you cant get lost
its great for when your tired but you still want to play a nice game
it is not one of final fantasys best game but it is oki played this game because i devour any rpg that square puts out
it was targeted to quotbeginningquot rpg players but i still enjoyed playing it
my young niece and nephew enjoyed walking around and hacking up the monsters without really knowing what they were doing
the graphics were a little more simplistic and so were the sound effects and music but it did not reduce my enjoyment anyfinal fantasy quest is one of the best snes rpgs  i had a great time playing this again
the game play is awesome and the games music kicks ass
i will play again in a few monthsthis game was such a drastic change from the original ff for the nes that aside from fighting the imps on the plain i barely noticed it was a ff
they really did well with this one eventhough some of the japanese to english translations were a bit off but thats what gives the game its originality
the storyline is great and this game really set the standard for the following ffs to come
although the graphics werent that great they were pretty good for the time
the music however was superb
it feels like theres an orchestra in your living room especially when you go in caves
this game is a definite must have and if you dont own a snes i think they put this one on final fantasy anthology for the ps also can be played on the ps
i think its known as ffiv on that onei had this game back in the early s when it first came out
over time i lost it probably let a friend barrow it or something
anyway im a collector of ff games today
nice to have this for my collectionanyone who is a collector of ff games needs these older games for their collectionps dont open the boxone of squaresofts finest rpgs in the popular ff game series final fantasy iv mistakingly named ffii here in the us back in  is a classic installment and also the first ff to be released on the snes
how can we all forget the epic storyline the unforgettable characters or the beautiful soundtrack composed by nobou umetsu
who also did the music for other various ffs without doubt this all brings back memories of when days were just perfectalthough the original english translation for the cartrige is not that good it makes the characters seem more like cardboard cutouts at times its still a rare classic to ownadd to your snes collection
obviously the game contains what later installments to the saga had as well summoning magic abilities and even side quests
leveling up is also pretty easy to do
later you will get to fly two airships one of them which can drill deep into the ground in order to reach the second world and go wherever you want when you wantthe story concerns cecil harvey a dark knight who serves the kingdom of barron
however something strange is happening at barron as the king vows to collect all four elemental crystals of the earth
with the army known as the red wings as his resort captain cecil and crew are hired on numerous missions to find all four crystals
but when cecil is relieved from his post after questioning the kings orders he is given another mission to deliver a small mysterious package to a small town
with the help of dragoon knight kain the two arrive at the village of mist where an incredibly destructive power is unleashed upon the village
realizing his mistake in trusting his majesty cecil vows to return to barron and seek vengeance against the kinghowever with a mysterious knight known as golbeze on their trail itll be no walk in the park
this villain also shares some kind of connection with cecil
what could it be and why does golbeze seek out the crystals himself
as you progress through the game you will find out
cecils girlfriend rosa and many others also joins you in the battle against eviloverall  this is definately on my top five list of favorite ff games next to final fantasy viii final fantasy vii final fantasy vi and the original final fantasy
if youre a longtime diehard fan of the series as i am and would not prefer the new stupidly pathetic installments such as final fantasy x then i highly reccomend this
the classics are always the bestthe story in this game is definitely the best out of all of the ff games
the scope spectacle and score of the game speaks to the incredible imagination of the creators
it should be made into a movie
motion picture not animeit would be a great epic worthy of an academy award
perhaps ten or so games stick out in my mind from the snes that are worth having this one is in the top fivethis game is only topped by final fantasy iii jp  and final fantasy   it is among the best in the series and the first with an absolutely astounding soundtrack taking advantage of the then avanced technology of the snes
you take on the quest of the dark knight meeting all sorts of new and interesting allies along the way
the story is great the first you can really get involved in final fantasy i used variable characters so the story wasnt as involved
if you can find it play this gamefinal fantasy  was the second ff game to be released in america but even today it is one of the greatest games i have ever playedgraphics  back when it first came out and when i first rented it on the snes i remember the graphics looking pretty good for its time
still i wasnt blown away but the battle graphics and the overworld graphics were amazing
it didnt quite have the charm of zelda link to the past but considering the size of this game and its release date the graphics were very goodmusic  okay this is where this game shines
without a doubt this game has the best music i have ever heard in an rpg
every snes ff title had great music including  which was originally only released in japan but can be picked up with ff anthology and this game started that trend
the battle music is amazing literally
but it doesnt stop there the boss music is even better
in fact i am willing to say that ff has the best boss music ever out of any video game
you will have it stuck in your head for years
in fact super mario rpg for snes has a hidden boss that has the same music theme as ff
i think ff mystic quest was my first ff game but ff was the first one to really get me into the series and the music sure helpedgameplay  the battle system is flawless and the levelup to gain magic system is one of my favorites
i just love battling in order to gain abilities it just feels so oldschool
all in all all of the gameplay elements are flawless and the story is great
you also get to go to the moon in this game which is very fun and not many rpgs offer something like that
although this game is also available on ff chronicles i would recommend buying the snes version even if it has translation issues
i think the snes version is better because it loads faster mainly on the saving and loading data screens it has a more oldschool feeling and just because its snes
snes is the greatest system ever and i think every game originally for the snes is  times better for its original system even if it costs  more dollars but it is well worth itoverall  this is a pretty old game okay its very old but it is one of the greatest games ever made
overall ff is slightly more enjoyable and is a little better but ff is still in my top three for greatest ff games and probably in my top ten for greatest games ever
it is well worth the moneyseems like theres a score of different final fantasy games out there these days but despite the grandeur of ff  the melodrama of ff or the outright eyecandy of ff theres really no beauty like that of a simple classic
if you find yourself surrounded by people whove been playing games for a while and the subject of final fantasy comes up youll find that most probably veer towards the new ones especially ff  and  but if like me youre asked which is your favorite and you reply oh ill always love final fantasy ii most of all you will get respectful nods from all directions
and why notfinal fantasy ii was a snes game that came out in the beginning of the s catering to the same crowd that was sucked into its predecessor on the original nes
by this time rpgs were becoming more prevalent on nintendos owed almost entirely to the original final fantasy old and new and so squaresoft threw this wonderful game on the us market
unlike the first final fantasy this one had an actual plot with characters that became an integral part of the story
new characters were introduced as the game played out usually enticing you with answers to your characters questions but also leaving you with more questions
by the time you reached the last boss of the game you were really surprised at how much time you had put into the whole thing and pleased with the payoutthey never made an rpg game that gave the player the epic feel quite like the final fantasy games did
i bought final fantasy iii for my nephew about  years ago for ps one and it was like a real stroll down memory lane
i cant wait to add this one to the collectionlooks and really plays well i just love these type of games ive no problems with what so ever thanks for this game very muchif the original final fantasy nes first got me interested in rpgs it was final fantasy ii that got me hooked
ffii was really the th game in the series but was only the second to make it to the united states
as opposed to the first game this one had a story and well defined characters and the whole thing just sucked me inthis game had one of the most interesting stories i had seen in a game up until that time
you control cecil a dark knight serving under the king of baron
after taking crystals from the magician village of mysidia cecil questions why he is doing this taking the crystals from innocents
he is sent to deliver a package to the village of mist
opening the package the village is destroyed
cecil now works in opposition to baron to try to save the crystals and not allow baron to get them all
during this quest the stakes get larger as cecil learns of what is really going on
some of my favorite characters in the series are in this game golbez kain rydia rosa fusoya edge yang the twins
the cast of playable characters is large as characters come in and out of your party
some final fantasy staples are included in this game summoned monsters a guy named cid airships chocobosthe game is simply fun to play and remains one of my favorites of the serieswhile i accredit final fantasy mystic quest as the game that began my twodecade plus obsession with roleplaying games rpgs it was final fantasy ii now iv for the snes that confirmed my fanaticism
ffii was one of the first console games to incorporate a fullydetailed storyline that actually moved the player while phantasy star ii while accredited as the first rpg to incorporate a complete narrative didnt match ffiis moments of high emotion as you hate the villain love the characters and lament when good ones die in the game or you think they diethe death of aerith or aeries depending upon which version youre playing in final fantasy vii while invariably pivotal in the history of the final fantasy franchise was not nearly as heartwrenching as watching a husband lose his fiance towards the beginning of the game in ffii
yes the scene would seem lame and underwhelming now but to an audience that had never seen such a dramatic death in gaming up until that point in the early s it was incredible and it was only the beginning of the death scene or scenes of loss in the game
back in those days such scenes made any gamer with a soul want to take the villain string him up the wall and swiftly introduce him to a falcon punch if only they were invented yetand yet the story was simple if not overdone now an evil empire once ruled by good turning upon the citizens of the world forcing a former hero from that empire to rise up and fight against them
its the quintessential story that takes you for a ride and actually has a twist or two that just cant be done again
along for the ride are your typical colorful cast of characters with their own stories development and personalities that still hold their value todayin short the story back in those days was second to none and would only be usurped by other legendary titles like final fantasy iivi breath of fire and the legend of legends chrono trigger
ffii was the game that began it all with the japanese rpg jrpg storytelling and turnbased gaming of which has now been abandoned in lieu of more realtime actionbased games like oblivion fallout and mass effectindeed ffii sported a realtime turnbased battle setup that had good flow meaning it wasnt too quick thereby making it meaningless lord of the rings the third age or too drawn out making it a complete drag xenosaga ii persona
the flow of battle was just right and the music to accompany it was nothing short of legendarynobou uematsu the musical composer of ffii is a legend of his own right
hell i would say he is to japan what john williams hans zimmer michael giacchino and steve jablonsky are to us americans
despite working with a bit console system and its musical limitations uematsu created one of the most famous gaming compositions of all time second only to his later masterpiece in the ff soundtrack
the composition has held up very well over the past  years has it been that long really
as it has been redone in various formats including celtic and still is performed at various gaming musical concerts
even breath of fire and my beloved lufia franchises couldnt hold up their music this well save for a track or twothis brings me to my overall point of how well this particular game has held up over time which it has done more than any other game in history
yes ff is widely considered the most popular and has spawned two spinoff games dirge of cerberus not staring martin sheen and crisis core and the film advent children which was ok but ffii has been remade and rereleased an unprecedented four times playstation  gameboy advanced nintendo ds and playstation portable with its soundtrack composed in even more variations
it is and has always been the gold standard of rpg gaming the one which all others are based on
the game put then squaresoft now squareenix on the map as well as nobuo uematsu thus creating the everpopular final fantasy mythosgranted the final fantasy series is not nearly as dominant as it used to be for reasons best suited for discussion elsewhere but ffii made it the juggernaut that it later became
ffii also proves to be one awesome nostalgic piece that makes us something year old gamers feel like old men looking back upon the good ol days when turnbased rpgs were the standard and the do had promise ha
all in all ffii holds my highest score a  as there could have been just one more sidequest to top it off but those werent entirely invented yet but they could have beenfirst of all ive tried all of the final fantasy games and this is my favourite one of em all
ive never tried the nintendo version but i do own the origin version of the playstation and i treasure it with all of my heartthe storythe evil emperor is using his power to take over the realm and to submit his evil influence in the worldbut not everybody will be bending to his will and a group of freedom fighters escapes his malice and hords of dark ridersfirion is the leader of the group i have to say that his the least ineresting person in the game maria her brother leon disspears after theyve been captured but only to rejoin em later in the game quotmuchquot later
guy a strong man with a vital and private thought of ways
theres many other characters in the game but youll have to find out for yourselfthe gameplayfairly hard the battle system is alot different and so is the way you gain levels strenght hp and mpsome of the bosses are also extremely hard to beat ive spend many of hours trying to beat rsoul for exampletheres many of random battles but be sure not to go where your not supposed to if you do so the monsters will outclass you by far
chocobos are being introduced for the first time in the final fantasy series and the chocobo melody has been used in many future final fantasy gamesthe musicthe best ive ever heard in any game the world map theme is spendid absolutely fantastic the most memorable melody of the entire final fantasy serie
many of these tunes will also be used in many final fantasy games in the future refering to the chocobo theme used in ff
many wonderful themes splendidthe graphicsfine but the updated version for the playstation is alot better its been improved alot many more colours are squared into the scene and the battles are alot more lifelike such as the mountains in the background with green grass fields on the side theres also been made some fantastic fmv movies for the updated version actually theyve come to be some of the prettiest fmv thats out on todays playstation consoleall in allquotthe best final fantasy game in the entire serie the coolest story the coolest cast of characters the coolest music and the coolest battle sytem
i love it i love it i love itquotone of they best ff games every made who cares about  just get  and this is my favorite classic jrpg
if you have not played it by now it may be hard to go back but it was an importaint part of my gaming world as a kid
it really helped anchor the whole jrpg genre for years to come
luckily square has remade it  times so you can play it on everything from snes to a light brighti love this game to death and i cant wait for it to come out of gameboy advance this december im so anxious
the story gets really complex and its hard to keep up sometimes but thats alright because it all comes clear at the end
i reccomend this to anyone who likes old rpgsi dont know what my friend and brother in metal and ff would think if i told him the facts behind ffii which is his alltime fav snes game its really ffiv
oh well what he doesnt know wont hurt him
anyway i must say that this game is by far the best ff for any nintendo system and the second best rpg for snes next to the amazing chrono trigger
lets explain why
note all scores are based on the time of the games release visuals  out of the graphics are very early for snes and while so many games didnt look a whole lot better than that of the nes this one was just as good as zelda link to the past and super mario world
the magic effects and characters are simply designed but once more this is  were in not sound okay so some of the sound is a little bit irritating not to mention the occasional recycling of an effect
however the true triumph in the sound is the music
the boss theme and battle theme have stuck with me ever since i first played it at a friends house six years ago
there is no denying how awesome some of the other tunes are as well but the battle tunes are pretty much always the best in ff games as well as many other rpg titleschallenge though its not as hard as ffvii or viii it is quite difficultbut the beginning is easier than any ff game the mist dragon may be the easiest boss i have ever fought and the monsters can all be destroyed in a single hit imps have  hp
but after that it becomes very hardinnovation of course every ff game has to feature new characters and have nothing or very little to do with the previous
and this is very different from the first which is probably why ffx is my least favorite the characters still have classes but they actually have real names
all the characters prove beneficial and a few even change
the battle system is fine but no ff game has a better battle system than that of overall so it isnt  perfect but everything in the game is beautiful for the time of its release
i can recommend every game in the series from ixi xii is coming soon except x and ff tactics is also excellentthis is the rpg that caused me to go out and get a super nes console back in  so i could play it
my brother had this game and gave it to me when he was done
ive been hooked ever since
looking back of course the graphics are definitely rather primitive compared to nowadays but the music and storyline are compelling
i actually cared about these characters cecil rosa rydia kain and others
ive played this game from start to finish at least a halfdozen times since i first beat it seeing how powerful i could get my characters using the game genie to quotcheatquot and see how it would play differently
a great sentimental favoritefinal fantasy iv called ii when it was first released out of japan for the snes because we never got the real ii and iii back then is yet another wonderful final fantasy
originally released in  this was the first ff for the snes
many great snes squaresoft games would follow secret of mana and final fantasy vi iii to name a fewff iv follows cecil a member of the baron red wings
the king of baron has been acting strange lately and he asks cecil to deliver a package to the town of mist
cecils longtime friend kain accompanies him
little do they know that the package burns down the entire town and the game takes off from there
every character has their own skills ex
kain is a dragoon so he can jump like in ff vi and ix
i like the ffs where the characters have their own skills more than the job system although both are very goodmusic was really upgraded to snes quality and it doesnt disappoint
youll find the famous ff prelude chocobo music an awesome final boss theme as well as many other wonderful tunes
they all go together with ff iv very wellthe challenge for this game isnt very tough because this was the easy type released out of japan
they had an easy type and a hard type
you can only find the hard type by buying ff chronicles which contains the original ff iv hard type and chrono trigger
hard type has more magic skills etc and the enemies attack much more often
but still ff iv easy type is a good ff to start out on if you havent played any other ffs before
it has all the qualities that make an ff good great story exceptional graphics for the time it was released very good character development wonderful music and its easy to play
if youre an ff fan and you havent played ff iv yet i recommend doing so quickly its one of the best ffs out therefinal fight  is a nice side scrolling beat em up just like the original
this one you go to different countries and you still can choose haggar
the moves are pretty sweet to
i love the weapons knives all that cool stuff
i can play this game forever it is so addictingi guess the only thing that is equal to this is the game genie for the genesis and nes
my original one broke after  some years now i own 
i never want to be without one of these again
great for when my young cousins come over and visit me limitless endless funbeat the game with game genie
this is an awesome device that works by intercepting the game code from the cartridge on its way to the console modifying that code and then sending it on to the super nintendo
it works very very well
there is also a switch for deactivating the codes and reactivating them on the fly
its built very very well and works with most games
you must look up the codes to make this work but trust me its simple
once again this is a must have for snes loversback in the day when the snes was king i found out about the game genie for the snes in a major video gamemagazine
there were some snes games that were really tough
if you were a snes fan like i was you know whichgames im talking about
i would wish that i could add infinite lives unlock secret characters etc
with the snes gamegenie my wishes were granted
whenever i bought a new game i would play it through and beat the game withoutusing codes
just using the genie with a new game was not a challenge at all
how i wish i could have all thosewonderful snes games i had before should never have sold them all at our neighborhood block garage sales inoctober
some of those games now fetch a pretty penny i tell you that right now
in  i bought a snes gamegenie from a seller on amazon
when i received it the genie was very dirty
had to spend some time cleaning it upand on top of all that part of the piece of the clamp that holds the genie onto a snes cart was broken
luckily i wasable to fix it with gorilla glue
it works well nonetheless
ill tell you the sellers nickname on amazon wolfwoodhe operates out of fresno ca he had the genie listed as acceptable
it looked as though it had been left outsidein the dirt
it has someones name written on the front dirt and spiderwebs on it when it first arrived at my houseavoid doing business with him hes not very honest to be honest with you
there are plenty of snes genies for saleon amazon just be careful who you buy them froma piece of broken crap
this is not even for the nintendo  i got robbed and was givin a broke ass toygotta love the old ways of playing around with your games to do things that you normally could not do
at first i didnt want to get one because i figured it just does what you can already do just cheating
technically thats true but you can also find some strange ways to use stuff and it can enhance things that normally could not be enhanced
if you are hesitant to purchase one look up some of the game genie codes scattered across the internet for your favorite games
then you can see what you could and could not do with this powerful tool in your hands
i dont always use it but when i do hee hee heealright i bought this for a mod to get around region locks via breaking the two plastic pins on the top that lock the american games in place
man are those things sturdy
took a while with a razor the sharpest dagger in the world and pliers to get through those things
anyways id rather break a cheating device slightly rather than my consoles cart slot to play super famicomjapanese snes games on my console such as dbz super budoten  and dbz hyper dimension
not every game from japan will work on this and same with english cartssome have a chip to detect the game genies sw bios and all the crap to stop you from cheatingwhich sometimes you can get around with the right codesi dont remember when i got this or where
but it did come useful when i got stuck
but with the wrong combination of codes or wrong codes can have weird effects
but otherwise its interestingcant wait for my son to try out this gamehe is going to love it lots of action and adventuregame looks greatwhen i first owned the super nes back in  this was one of the games that i started working on besides super mario world and a link to the past
this series is known to be one of the hardest but also satisfying in many ways
its one of the best games for anyone to own
in fact the soundtrack alone should be enough to grab the gamers attention
its very haunting from start to finish but my favorite levels of the game are level  the shipwhirlpool level level  the lavatower level and level  ice level
however level  is probably one of the grossest you are inside a demons body
each time arthur faces a boss the soundtrack is completely different so it keeps the players on their toes
arthur has a lot of weapons to use to kill the ghouls and various demons but whats additional here is that he can upgrade his armor to green and eventually golden color even the weapons will become more powerful
but be aware folks even if you get hit you still lose your clothes and arthur is practically naked  ahem until you find a chest with regular armor or you somehow manage to clear a leveland if that wasnt hard enough just wait until you have to complete the  levels a second time
unfortunately its the only way to get the best ending of the game and using cheat codes might not help you very much
the reason for that is you need to don the magic bracelet in order to kill the final boss in level  make sure that you are wearing the golden armor first or you wont be able to acquire it
you need to aim at his head
the good part is if you are struggling to defeat him you should have endless continues until he finally goes downtheres also other titles that you need to pay attention to  ghosts n goblins for the nes ghouls n ghosts for the sega genesis and ultimate ghouls n ghosts for the playstation portable psp
be sure to pick up all of those games if you love this seriessimply put this is one of the best games ever made
and not to mention one of the more difficult as well
you play as arthur and fight off wave after wave of demons and other beasts and some of the boss fights are just impressive to behold
but just dont expect this to be a game you can beat in one sitting
no matter how much youve leveled up your shields one hit and youre back to having a pair of boxershorts as your only protection
so despite the difficulty curve some people might have to overcome to enjoy this classic game as long as youre not the kind of person that would throw down your controller after dying a few times this game is highly recommended
nnycw for capcom citynot compatible with yobo fc twin snesnes systemgraphics on this game are the most creepy and horrifying that probably was ever seen on snes and to this day will haunt you
zombies on here is stuff you would only see in george romeros films
they actually look dead and the animation is so awesome it pretty much throws you into the game whether you actually fight it or not
the zombies make you feel like you are in a horror film in your own living room
the demons are randomly spooky and disturbing
you can almost see the evil in their eyes when you look at them
the hell hounds on this game will have you watching the family chiuahuah from the corner of your eyes whilst you play
its a really disturbing game compared to its predecessor ghosts and goblins
random traps on this game will have you back at the beginning of the level in no time
they are everywhere and you wont be expecting half of them until its too late
from human skulls hurling out of the mouth of demonic totem poles to being on the wrong platform when a massive wave takes you out
this game keeps you on edge so much you might panic and end up failing the level
it is one of the most spooky and difficult games ever invented for the snes
i cannot stress enough how difficult it will be
the best and most addicting part of the game is the little voice reminding you that you can do better next time only to end up getting farther and failing again to a trap you werent expecting
the zombies randomly appear but unlike ghosts and goblins are slower and somewhat predictable
meaning that some pop up in the same place when things get too hard so you know to watch out
each level has tons of different weapons from crossbows and super swords to super armor and shields the sheild gives you  hits instead of  and your dead
all the enemies are unique and not repetitive
the bad part of this game is that its not compatible for the fc twin snesnes system by yobo
it works in the system until you get to the third level and then everything goes black
another con to super ghosts and ghouls is that its extremely difficult and challenging
the pros are that it may just be the very first and most realistic horror game for the snes
the graphics are indescribable
lets hope if you buy it youll do better than i ever could
if you beat it i tip my hat to yougradius iii is an awesome scifi game in which you can pick from a selection of weapons or you can edit the weapons you want to go on your ship good graphics awesome music and its a one hit youre dead game which makes it a fun challenging and addicting game
the person who sold it to us was reliable the game was in good shape and it arrived quickly
i love this game and yes i would recommend itive been a fan of shooters for a long time and gradius  has always stood out from the others
not that the others are bad there not gradius for nes and lifeforcegradius among others such as rtype are classics in there genrewhat seperates this one are a few factors a major one being that it is possible to beat yet still with enough challenge for all novice to advanced players
the controls are very nice and smooth and you deal with the a and b buttons only
b fires your primary and your a button selects your next poweruplasers force fields speed missiles
the music is awesome and has great visuals for its timethe best part of the game is the powerup option editing for whatever you fancy your weapons and shields to be plus edit them for beneficial reasons such as numerous enemies and difficult bosses you can change it up for a different game every time
you have three options of difficultywhich is greateasy normal and hardand do not use the famed konami code during paused play its a suicide codelolthis game is pure fun and addictive and is number  on my list of all time shootersi have to say even since gradius made its way to the super nintendo system  beyond i have taken an interesing in gradius games gradius  for the snes is one of the best there is because it offers you more variety of weapons the stages are very nice with sharp colors   bit graphics  it is not as hard to finish unlike the original nes gradius game  also you have an option menu that can let you change the number of lives  adjust your game level whetjher its easy nomal hard etc
the harder the level you play the game on the better the endingi used to play this game when it first came out but last month i thought i would dig it back out of my collection
this sequel to the nes title will blow you away
the graphics and music will be enough to get your attention but there are also  challenging levels to deal with
being a hardcore gradius freak there are certain levels that i enjoy beating particularly the bubble level level  and my personal favorite the easter island level level 
in the latter the music gets very intense
the easter island level music is actually my favorite soundtrack in the entire game
i prefer to use lasers rather than the doubles cuz the statues are easier to destroy
once you progress in the level you will have to deal with columns of easter island statueslevel  is a fire level you have to deal with raging infernos and fireballs alike
i would use lasers if you have trouble beating this onelevel  is the most difficult part of the game
as it starts out the autoscrolling will go really fast and if your ship cant keep up then you will have a hard time
use the reduce shield to make it much easier to get by
but the most challenging part of that level is  six bosses
and yes they are consecutive
the good part is if you beat  of them for example but lose your ship you dont have to beat every single boss again in order to beat the entire level
whew
the greatest part about level  is that the boss battle music keeps changing every time you kill one of themlevel  is the level that i hate the most
i love the music to death but you have to deal with grossedout enemies and a grossedout boss whom you cant even touch
it spews out its attack  times then the game ending starts
this happened in the first gradius as well  ie you couldnt kill the boss
the other great part about this game is being able to choose what weaponsshields to start with and the infamous konami code will work but not if you keep losing lives
this is one of those rare games that has no flaws whatsoever
the designers really put their all into it
its excellent for all ages and all types of gamers so dont miss out on it
i promise that you will get your moneys worthyes always loved the gradius series ever since i first played the minigme of it in mytcial ninja for the snes i was thrilled to find that it was an actual game witt many series to boot
gradius threee is one of my all time favoritesthis game iswas fantastic
its sooo japanese
thats the first thing that comes to my mindill explain later
i first played it about  years agoyep its fairly old
it was an early snes game
i remember it was around the time of classic street fighter   those were the days ah how nostalgic
i played it again last year on computer emulator and it was just as charmingthis is a  or  player coop game which is always fun with a friend
the experience is richer if youve got a buddy alongside you
along with double dragon for nes this was one of the early great coop games i played
both heroes have the same abilities but some differences in appearance
some parts of the game are straight up d platforming sequences
other parts of the game have a d element where you can move up and down as well as left and righti dont remember how many levels there were maybe   each one takes under an hour if youre decently skilled so its a short adventure
the first half of every level is the d part which tended to be humorous and lighthearted with a bit of exploration
still its a pretty straightforward game and you wont be doing much if anything in the way of puzzle solving or mazesbut i think this is good and keeps it simple without dead ends
you just run through the levels and dispose of the wimpy goons that come your way
the weapons and goons are really funny not very serious at all
the d parts also have small shops and huts you can enter to perform various interactions
there is a money component to the game you get some for beating goons and you can spend it in shops to buy various goodies including health armors and ability powerups
you can also throw it as a projectile weapon in fact
another way to earn it is by performing a number of jobs in some of the huts which require dexterity and timing with controller
theyre fun especially if you compete with a friend
other huts just have random villagers you can talk to some serious and some comical
a final type of hut has this judo instructor who charges you heftily but teaches you these special magical techniques you can use in the levels
these arent required but make the levels easier and more entertainingonward to the d parts of the game
theyre distinctly different
the nd half of each level is where the d shows up and the music and tone become more serious
more importantly enemies become harder and better timing and skill are requiredfor example jumping around on spinning platforms avoiding spikes and fireballs etc
somewhat mario worldish
each level dutifully concludes with a boss battle and the fights are all goodlike any good game the difficulty level starts low and increases reasonably
the story and characters were solid i thought
it involved kidnappings and some high level ninja clan who the lowly heroes had to take on
the music and sound effects were unique and amazing imo
i mentioned at the start how this game really reflects a japanese charactermore so than any other game i have ever played
and that is one of its strongest points for me
anyone would know right away that this is not an american game you are dealing with
games like mario or zelda you might mistake for american if you didnt know better but not this one
every character and song oozes japanese flavor
its neat check it outthis is one of the longer reviews ive written but its because i have fond memories of this game and this time period of gaming
i highly recommend giving this game a whirl if youre able to
konami puts out solid japanese styled games for those who are into them
ive stressed that aspect of the game many times nowits just that i miss that foreign feel and ive always enjoyed games that have it most recently ddr or early versions of it anyway
i am always on the lookout for morethe plot  saving the princess from the evil otafu army  leaves much to be desired but the included mini games and the gameplay make up for that ten fold
back when the snes and the genesis were the consoles competing for your money this game was sold pretty inexpensively but its still a favorite of minethere are dozens of little games you can play like lottery maze quiz concentration horseracing 
just to name a few
gradius is also playable during your journeythe boss fights are pretty epic for an snes game
a lot of thought went into making them just difficult enough for a challenge while keeping them engaging and fun at the same timethe soundtrack is a classic example of catchy chiptunes with a flavor of traditional japanese and that characteristic dissonance found in their musicalso of note is the coop system in which two players are on the screen at the same time a la contra
you can even ride on each others back or compete in minigamesfun little game that any gamer should havethis is a game to pick up for the snes because just like pocky and rocky its an action game that does not and can not miss
its funny quirky and challenging
its well worth the replay valuei loved it
one of my alltime favouritesawesome game
flying and landing airplanes skydiving jetpacks all with realistic graphics and dimensions by snes standards never gets oldmy family loved this game it is very fun but diffucult at times
i was the only one to actually ebat it in my family but since i only did it once while no one was around they dont belive me but i didlove this game it is a beautiful game with a great storyline
it makes the game fun and interesting to play and have a cooperative rpg gamethis game is one of the best ever on any platform from nes all the way to ps surpassed only by chrono trigger
unfortunately the sequels to this game absolutely butchered it removing all the features that made it great
however despite what happened to future versions gamers can still enjoy the original and bestthe graphics of this game are good looking very colorful stylized and very rich as if they were drawn and painted by hand and your adventures take place in a wide diverse range of environments from caves to deserts to lush green wilderness and waterfalls
the music is wonderful always inspiring and fitting the mood from the eerie and strange song of thanatos castle to the slow wintry theme of the ice palace to the heroic theme of the battle with the mana beast
the story is great with all of its plot twists and it manages to be linear and coherent without dragging you along by the nose
the three characters are very likeable especially that quirky little spritebut the gameplay
despite all else this is where the game really excels
secret of mana has been compared to zelda because of its realtime battle system but i believe it surpasses zelda in all sorts of ways
instead of one character you now have three and they can fight extremely well because of a wonderful feature known as the action grid
this allowed you to set all actions of a character including whether they should fight aggressively stand back and defend themselves or use hitandrun tactics this works extremely wellwatch your allies step in whack the enemy then deftly backflip out of range before he can counterattack and you can even set whether they will use their stronger special moves and what level of special move they should charge up to
this is the best idea for computer ai that ive ever seen in an rpg and it was absolutely stupid of squaresoft to remove it from the later games
in seiken densetsu  secret of mana  japan only your allies all mindlessly rush in and attack even if the enemy is much stronger than they are resulting in healers and mages in your party getting creamed in battles
in legend of mana your allies are absolutely brainless simply staggering around the battlefield like drunkards only bothering to fight if the enemy happens cross paths with them
another example of squaresoft throwing away what was perfectly good in an attempt to be quotnewquot and quotoriginalquot  the saying quotif it aint broke dont fix itquot comes to mind when i think of squaresofts latest gamesyou have  different weapons to choose from so there is a weapon for everyones taste
weapons are upgraded and as they are upgraded new special attacks can be learned
for your allies their mana powers can also be made more powerful by usesome complain about the time delay between attacks having to wait for the meter to recharge but i think this is a good feature
it adds some strategy to the game and maintains its status as an rpg and not a beatemup
you can also use your quick weak attacks to simply distract an enemy while your allies hit them with mana powerand by far one of the best features of this game is the multiplayer aspect
three players can get together and control the three characters and the fun never endssimply put among action or adventure rpgs this is the best no contest
among rpgs as a whole this is second only to chrono triggerthough i would not say this is the best snes action rpg due to a few issues i have it is nonetheless in the same group of secret of evermore and zelda pros  music is masterful despite the snes lack of hardware graphics are superb and only ff had better snes rpg graphics the game is long and well thought out leveling magic can be time consuming but is fun and focusing on one or two types helps create a customized mage feel the translation is pretty good seeing that they were able to keep the witty feel of the script there are also some great extras towards the end of the game such as finding the ultimate gear and extra orbs and santa and rudolph make an appearance
funny because it is a japanese game
cons  though the game was difficult the last boss is super easy leveling all of your magic takes forever the other two characters often act annoyingly in battle despite the setup on tactics especially the sprite getting stuck behind obstacles all of the timeseriously though this is in the top  snes rpgsthis crono trigger and final fantasy iii are the three essential snes rpgs
although this follows a live action combat system the gameplay is very well programed
the story is very good and the game system magic fighting etc
is well done
this is absolutely a must i for one hope it gets rereleased as so many other games have been latelythis game will have the golden formula of originality for times to come i have no seen modern videogame even resemble this games awesomeness with the complexity of its storyline
i remember the game so vividly because of the concepts that it represents
its like living a dream it just takes you to a faraway place that youve never been to and just captures you within its moments during the game it really has its shining momentsbetween this game and xenogears i have difficulty sorting out which would be my favorite because they both simplyare
i really loved the story gameplay mechanics spells and characters of this gamethis will remain an unchallenged favorite game of mine for times to come
this perhaps is only nd to chrono trigger for the snes
if i had to make a list of my favorite rpgs for the snes it would be secret of mana
chrono trigger
super mario rpg legend of the seven starswhat i didnt like about the game is its endingi felt like it was so plain and obscure that it made me wondering what would happen to the rest of the characters
that and the sequels to this game adds no justice to it at all
i definitely feel that they could have easily made a sequel to this game based on the same cast of characters and i still would have enjoyed it just as much
it really deserves a much better sequel
in fact ill even make the sequel if i have tohaha this is one of those games that if i were stuck on an island and had to pick a game that ill have to play for a long time  it would probably be this onesecret of mana is a fantasy actionadventure rpg for the super nintendo
it is the nd game in the mana series
in the game you play a boy named randi who finds the sword of mana
he later meets a princess named purim and a sprite child named popoi and they go on a quest to save the world
as you travel you find new weapons that can be made stronger by fighting and getting them forged by a blacksmiththis game has a beautiful soundtrack the graphics are colorful and breathtaking and the characters are well designed and good looking
this is one of the best rpgs on the super nintendoi just had to tap the game hard against a hard surface because the game card was not straight so other than that im happy with the producti am an avid rpg player and i personally think that this is one of the best that ive played
i think that ffvi ffiii and the secret of mana are best snes games out there
i have never had so much fun playing multiplayer than i have with this game
for once an rpg that you can actually play with a friend and not only in the battles
the story line is a little corny but then again so are most
the graphics compared to now days are weak but they are very well done for a snes game
they make the game all the more enjoyable
the music is great as well
very midi sounding of course but adds to the character of the game none the less
i find that playing it alone can get rather boring but its the most fun ive had playing video games with friends
it provides hours of entertainment and it is one of my favorite games of all time
five big stars for secret of manaat the expense of sounding like an old man at the age of  i just have to say that they dont make games like this anymore
not quite sure if this is my favorite game of all time but its definetly in the top three and ive played quite a few games
the original secret of mana is just such an awesome game
its a zeldastyle adventure but with three different characters a wellworked system of magic great musical selection a vast world to explore and an engaging story line
a multiplayer addition where a pal can control one of your three characters makes the game so much more enjoyablethis is a game that proves that an older game with a great concept beats the hell out of a more modern game with the greatest graphics in the world
if i wanted characters that look as close to real people as possible id watch tv
video games are all about the concept and creativity behind the game
secret of mana epitomizes that
probably out of production by this point but if you can get your hands on it youll definetly be pleased
or at least download it and play with an emulatorhow many ways can i say that this game changed my life as a child
its almost impossible to say how many ways
most people fell in love with squaresoft now squareenix because of final fantasy but not me this game was the catalyst for me
dont get me wrong i love final fantasy games but secret of mana is my most favorite game of all time
the formula was perfect it starts out kind of like something out of king arthur
the boy finds a rusty sword that looks to have sat in a stone for years and then suddenly a spirit appears in front of him
the spirit tells the boy to pull the sword little does he know that this spirit is actually his father and that by pulling the sword he will start down a path that will change his and many others lives foreverit was  when this game came onto the american market as secret of mana when in truth it was actually the second game in a series that would grow into a large franchise
the first seiken densetsu was on the gameboy handheld but in the states it was renamed final fantasy adventure as a way to make it sell better rather shrewd id say
nowadays they never would have done something like that but back then square was still something of a fledgling company that had to battle the likes of enix ironically its future partner and even nintendo itself due to the sales of zelda games and the like for shelfspaceunfortunately the franchise that this game created was a hit or miss kind of deal
some of its sequels were great like seiken densetsu iii which to this day is the closest thing to its predecessors greatness it was for the super famicom the japanese snes and was never released here due to the fact that stupid decisions like that were the norm back then they were afraid that it would be too difficult for american gamerstsk
but there were also many awful manas like sword of mana for the gameboy advance
it had so many quirky things about its gameplay plus the music was like regular gameboy music which was vastly beneath the gbas technological prowess it was just lame it could have been a sure winner had it followed the formula better and had a musical score that didnt insult the gbas technology
people that have never played the older games might like sword of mana enough to give it a chance howeversecret of mana is a wonderful adventure that has great graphics for its time and an incredible musical score im not kidding i love it hiroki kikuta is right up there with motoi sakuraba and nobuo uematsu
 it can be played by just about anyone that understands rpgs and even by novice players because it starts out simple and builds up from there
the adventure is quite linear however so some might be turned off by that but that in no way takes away from its greatness
the gameplay mechanics of the game were amazing at the time with so many weapons to level up and strengthen with orbs there was something for everyone to enjoy plus you could charge up for a special attack and eventually you could do an ultimate attack later in the game after much experience is gained
the way the story went was very fairytailesque with many comical moments and very funny animations to the sprites no pun intended
you could even get some friends together and they could control the other characters for even more fun adventuring i had a lot of great memories of playing this way with my father and my brother it was a blast
it changed the way that rpgs had to be and it did it better than the legend of zelda a link to the past people will hate me for saying that i know even though i love that game tooi just wish theyd either rerelease this or seiken densetsu iii on gba or both either that or remake them for the wii or ps
it can be done squareenix you have more than enough money and more than enough influence to round up all the original creators rather than these new guys that make all the new manas that apart from children of mana nintendo ds great music great graphics and a great story simply pale by comparisoni was first introduced to this game around  about the same time it came out on the snes
it made an impression on me even back then with its graphics  but mainly the music
even now as an adult at  the game is still one of my alltime favorites and stimulates feelings of nostalgia when its played on the wiiof course i dust mine weekly because im a video game enthusiast with several up and running game consoles
quotsecret of manaquot is without a doubt one of the greatest games in history
anyone that gives this game anything less than their highest rating has no business rating games to begin with
there may be games out there that are equal but none surpass it
ive been playing it for a solid week now
now you know a game is excellent when its bit and your ignoring bit games to play it
however like movies the classics are always the best
in addition to this game i highly recommend legend of zelda a link to the past illusion of gaia and yoshis island
all for your super nesthis is one of the best selling epic games on the snes console
great story and characters and even  years down the line i still like it as much as i did when i was a kid
if you have an snes and dont have this game i have no clue what your doingit should be no secret that the snes gave us some of the most elite classics that have stood the test of time
why secret of mana hasnt gained the success of many of these classics is beyond me because this is by far one of the classics when it comes to rpg gamingin this game the hero of this game finds a sword and pulls it out only to unleash a barrage of monsters and to be banned from potos
with further accompaniment from a sprite and girl the hero must find the mana seeds to power up the mana sword
i will just leave it at that to prevent any spoilerswhat makes secret of mana such a highlight is its gameplay system
many rpgs developed by square have been known for its turnbased battle system
instead of utilizing this the game uses a real time battle system akin to the legend of zelda series with ring style menus for each character to use items and change character settingswhen it comes to unique skills by the characters mentioned above the hero is a physical battle warrior
however with the use of magic acquired eventually in the game the sprite can use battle magic while the girl can use magic that powers up the skills in combat
more skills are obtained upon discovering mana seedsa final mention is to the games soundtrack composed by hiroki kikuta
the focus on woodwinds and percussion instruments drives throughout the whole game provoking the appropriate mood for the setting
dont get me wrong a lot of square titles have been well known for the soundtrack used but secret of mana manages to excel beyond with these compositionsif it wasnt for the fact that a game likechrono triggerwas released this could definitely be the greatest rpg to ever hit the market
but for what it is secret of mana is an unsung rpg classic that is mandatory to play if you are a fan of this genre a strong soundtrack or just a classic unique soulful gamereleased in  squares secret of mana is a game in their line of snes releases that was perhaps a bit overshadowed by final fantasy and chrono trigger
the game has a graphical engine that would be expanded upon in chrono trigger but the games realtime battle physics make it more directly comparable to something like nintendos own zelda a link to the pasthowever there are a number of aspects that set this game apart from all of those mentioned
it all starts with the characters and the way in which they are controlled
there are three characters a boy a girl and a sprite
with the relatively obscure super multitap adapter up to three players were able to take the journey together
in oneplayer or twoplayer controlled adventures you can switch which characters you control with the simple push of the select button those you are not controlling will be thus taken over by ai
this creates a separation from those other games rather than have one player control a full party at once or just have one character more freedom of choice is given to the player about who they want to control
sometimes the ai can be a bit sloppy when it comes to moving from place to place but that rarely becomes much of an issue as you can just switch character control and get them to where you want to bein this game the weapon system is quite vastly different than that of ff or ct and different still from zelda
there are  main weapons in the game sword axe spear whip glove javelin boomerang and bow and they are powered up as many as  times each by collecting orbs and having them forged with the help of a blacksmith
granted many of these weapons are the sort of thing youd typically expect to find in an rpg but the ability to level them up as high as this and to need more than just money to do it adds a bit of depth to this system
on the other hand the equipment system is pretty standard fare armor headgear and armgear can all be purchased in item shopsthe battle system is also a unique feature for the game
it is in realtime like zelda and you can also charge your weapons as they level up like zelda but the difference is that you can charge them up higher and higher for more and more powerful attacks  and your weapons level up with experience points
also rather than hack blindly at enemies you have to wait til you are at full power to deliver a decent blow to an enemy
sometimes they can evade attacks which can get a little frustrating
but thats what you have magic for
your magic abilities based on the elements of water earth airlightning fire dark light lunar and nature can be leveled up and deliver on enemies when physical attacks seem to be getting you nowhere fast
perhaps thats a fairly common thing but here levelling up magic is done by using it  and it works in your favorthere are other positives toogood if not fantastic musical scoreadditional characters in the story that add a bit of depth to each playerrespectable challengetight controlsdungeons dont drag on forever mostlythe few negativessome slowdown and glitching in situations with lots of enemies on screen at oncesometimes the story doesnt make much sensethe occasional overlylong dungeonbut all in all this game is highly recommended as it is a lost treasure of the snes
its a good purchase but it does run a little steep so wii users should consider downloading it to their virtual consolethis is a groundbreaking action rpg that allows a  player or  player with a multitap coop experience
flying around the world on a dragon being launched from one continent to another in cannons an exiled orphan and a flying fortress this game has it all
you control a boy a girl and a sprite and have  weapons and  spells to level up
some glitches and bad ai pathing are easily forgiven in this masterpiecesecret of mana is in my opinion one of the best games of alltime
squaresoft really set it off with this game
i first got a chance to play som about  years ago so i really missed out on it all that timethe story follows a boy a girl and a sprite on a big adventure across fields deserts snowlands and much more
after the boy pulls out the mana sword he gets banned from his hometown by the elder
the story really takes off from there and it will keep you entertained throughout the whole gamethe music in som is my favorite of any snes game
each area has music that is amazing and will really take you into the game
i have the soundtrack and every song is greatgraphics were really good for the time 
the animations and artwork used in som were very colorful and easy to look at so it doesnt hurt your eyeslast but certainly not least while the game is a lot of fun while playing it alone its even better when you have a few friends around
being that this game is players you can go through it with  friends
its like a multiplayer zelda
som is also pretty challenging and has excellent replay value
i recommend it to anyone who likes the zelda series or the ff seriesrating out of a niche title in every sense of the word shadowrun received mild praise when it was first released for the super nintendo years ago
however as the game is based on a role playing game much like dungeons and dragons it has built a strong fan base over the years
those who can remember playing this game can easily be brought back to its seamless world which some might overlook and just brush off to the side
the idea for the matrix movies obvioussly extends from this role playing series as the game centers around your character who wakes up after seemingly being dead to continue his search for vengeance against the ones who killed himthe gameplay is very straightforward in termsof shooting as when you press the fire button a crosshair appears on the screen and allows you to shoot anywhere in the range of the screen
as you progress forward into the game your character builds up karma points that can then be used to raise his strength health weapon or magic skills
while the shooting is a bit harrdto get used to and the game offers a steep learning curve as the difficulty in this game is pretty tough the storyline itself easily makes up for it and drives you toward the end of the game as you search for the awnsers leading to your demiseas you fight your way through the game you will get new weapons get new skills that allow you to hack into the matrix better as well as recruit other shadowrunners as well to help you along your quest
you fight several bosses along the way and the game never fails to impress with its startling revelations hour after hour
overall an excellent game with well done music as well although some of the songs ae repeated numerous times this was snes you know but this does not take away from this fine gaming experience
but yeah what the hell did happen to part  thoughthis game is an old family classic for us
for its time it was an amazing game especially the hacking in the gamehere we have another great game that was vastly overlooked by the gaming community in the early s
the only thing i can think of for it not having the success it should have had is i believe it was ahead of its time
shooterswith guns didnt catch on until well when golden eye  was made then everything shifted in that direction
a great game to play and collect and affordable for around  dollarsaction rpgs were certainly in their prime on the snes secret of mana secret of evermore zelda  illusion of gaia etc and this was a winner among championsthough secret of mana and secret of evermore were much better and much deeper games this game is still tons of fun
fighting is easy to grasp and fun the magic system is very well done and the game has some extras and secret areas that make revisiting and exploring fun
the music is good the graphics very good the different realms are all unique and interestingplus its fun to unlock towns and villages by releasing the souls that are trapped
pretty uniquemy only beef is that the game is a little too easy and too quickin my opinion piror to this game they only real rpgs that had came out so far in the usa where the dragon warrior games not including gameboy or maybe motherearthbound but i believe that only came out in japan for nes
firstly judge this game for its time  for its time this game was ahead of its time
firstly the saving feature this game is easy to save none of that hold the reset button then power off
of coarse many would argue that legend of zelda for nes was a good game piror to this games release
sorry not a huge zelda fan so id beg to differ this game is weird and simple
however trust me for its time this game was pretty advanced were a kid in the early s you know what i mean
just give this game time it is pretty goodi first played this game shortly after it came out in the early s during my th grade spring break
the game is an action rpg meaning you fight the enemies in real time and not in a separate screen like the final fantasy series
in the game you play one of a gods servants who is trying to help free the world from the grip of deathtoll who is essentially the devil
as you go through the game you pick up different weapons armor and magic which allow you to advance through the game
i remember that i found the sound and music to be quite beautiful at the time and i still enjoy it today
the game is definitely worth a look if you can find it
if you enjoy games such as actraiser or illusion of gaia youll love this onesoul blazer is a simple straight forward action rpg
it has its challenging moments but overall it is not a very difficult or long game
then whats all the hype about you may be asking
well bottom line is the game is just plain funthe game has you progressing through  main areas that are more or less villages
to progress you must enter a nearby dungeon and begin to clear the area of enemies
as progress is made through the dungeon you free souls from the monsters captivity and they get sent back to the nearby village
as souls are freed the revive inhabitants and structures of the village
you speak with the village people to fill in story elements and receive items
restored structures may allow access to secret areas containing other itemsthe dungeons are varied enough in design and the game is just short enough that it does not get too tedious
i found it very rewarding to plow through half a dungeons worth of monsters and then return to the village and see what new things i unlocked
apart from the gameplay itself i really enjoyed the design and aesthetics of the game
it has a very comfy atmosphere with great music and art designalthough the game is not superlative in any particular category it is just a fun and memorable dungeon crawler that i will look back on very fondlyi actually played illusion of gaia over ten years ago and only recently found that it was part of a trilogy
i also hear that this game is better than gaia and having completed this game i must agree with everyone else reviewing this game
i like the levelup system for this game much more than i do for gaia as well as the item system
i also like the various different worlds separated into zones with more and more of each world being shownfreed as you go along destroying monsters and sealing their lairs
that was actually pretty cool id never encountered such a game beforethis game might not be as impressive as games that came later like final fantasy  and up but for a old snes game it is definitely a wonderful game and even better than some of the games released on todays gaming platforms
it was rather memorable and i liked the ending
illusion of gaia was a nice game but after playing this game im disappointed that iog wasnt more like thisused to rent this game all the time couldnt get enough of it feeling nostalgic bought it and couldnt be happierthe game maximm carnage is cool
you can play as venom
i think this is the only spiderman game that you can play as venom
you can play as spiderman too
they both have different story linesmany star fox games have been released since the very first one that appeared on the super nes
the only one i have ever played was the original on the super nes which also happened to be the most groundbreaking of all the star fox games and its a challenging and exciting game
perhaps the only game on the super nes to have more enemies to shoot at than the mega man series
the levels are packedyoure a fox and you fly a plane
you fly through the universe shooting and avoiding all sorts of wild looking creatures
thats basically what you do
you have animal friends available to help make your journey slightly easier
its a good idea to try to help out your friends if theyre in trouble because keeping them alive might be to your advantage later on in the gamein star fox you really have to tap that shoot button because the further into the game you go the more enemies you will encounter
this is one tough game here folks
much harder than the super nes mega man x games and certainly much harder than the mario and donkey kong country games
but come on
you need a solid challenge every so often
but its certainly beatable
and this game never gets tiring eitheri remember when this game first came out and how a certain store in a mall had nothing but this game all over the shelves
this game was packed on the shelves on the wall and the shelves in the middle of the store
it was everywhere
you couldnt avoid this game if you had to
there must have been thousands of star fox games at that one tiny store that one weekend when the game first hit the market
the game was that populareveryone was making a big deal about this game because of the neverbeforeseen graphics
sure today the graphics look pretty outdated and even more so compared to the newer star fox games but at the time this was some new unique stuff that showed signs of the future of video gamingi always feel satisfied making my way through star fox not only because its a hard game but also because its a fun game
not a dull moment to be found anywhere
enemies constantly fly at you from all over the place
exciting stuffyou have three routes you can take
level  is the easiest and level  is the hardest
i cant even beat level  in all the years ive been playing this game
i can make it to the end on a good day but basically im lucking out
that doesnt mean the game requires luck
just the final two places in level  require some luck
i can beat levels  and incredible music
i love every theme
very much like outer space music
it all worksyou can find this game for a couple dollars these days
one of the coolest games on the super nes happens to be reasonably priced
pick it upbecause when i purchased this i thought it was a special edition or something
maybe it was from japan
but i thought surely something must be difficult to understand about this and it was that this is just another copy of star foxstar fox is one of my all time favorite star fox games included star fox adventures and star fox  d
the graphics are awesome included the hyperspacethis game is hard and i beat all of the pathes and my favorite path is the first path
you have  pathes to chose the top path is normal the middle is easy and the last is hard
if you chose the last path you beat all of the stages to you will fight andross at the last stage and he will change his face to a devil like monster that is why the third path is hardstar fox is so fricking cool
yes its very dated with the d visuals but at its time this was amazing and still is
i play this on the retron  and i love how amazing it sounds and plays
it runs smooth as well
star fox was the foundation that was built on with star fox  another awesome game
this game changes views from rd person view to st person in space now thats awesome and in my opinion the best way to play the game
theres really nothing bad i cant say about this game only that you need to own this game
you will appreciate the game play and the look of the gamelooks and plays very of the utmost great i love this game too thank you very much for this game too bye nowstarfox is a classic for the super nintendo that uses the systems first super fx chip a modification of game graphics making things look dyou can choose a few paths each with different levels to go throughthe gameplay is pure fake d shooting at probably its finest
you can see all kinds of wacky machines shooting at you andor passing by
you also have  teammates to help you
slippy is annoying though as a bad guy would always chase him and you would have to rescue him from being attackedtheres always a boss at the end of every level
everything even before the bosses is just plain epicthe graphics music and gameplay are all just awesomethe game may have around just  levels in one path but its one of the few games to show even the smallest game can succeedthis is the original snes star fox game which puts you as fox mccloud in an epic space opera railshooter adventure
the game was notable for including the super fx chip which gave programmers the ability to create d objects with simple polygonsi booted up this game today and its still a blast to run through
yes its very primitive d  you can count the individual polygons on each object  but the designs are creative and nintendo found some commendable ways to make distinct varied worlds with what they had
it always marvels to see the programming feats and innovations of the bit era and star fox is the pinnacle of thatmore importantly the game plays well
a couple of the later fx chip games suffered by pushing d at the cost of gameplay
the framerate in star fox does suffer a bit in the later levels when theres so much onscreen but overall the game plays exactly like a fastpaced shooter should
you get your upgrades barrel rolls adjustable settings multiple difficulty levels and a few secrets to discover  not bad for a game that couldve just cashed in based on its graphicsin the end this is a super nintendo classic
like the original mario kart it holds up well despite the numerous sequels that have followed
worth adding to any snes librarywhen it comes to d onrails shooters panzer dragoon star blade sky gunner there are a few that stand out
this is one of them
perhaps the first of its kind most notably because of its polygonal graphics star fox transcends the limitations of the super nintendo to become a classic for the agesgranted the first stage isnt quite as lovely as i remember it being the graphics are indeed quite simple and the draw distance is sadly quite limited but once you get past it things really take off
the incockpit view is awesome featuring one of the coolest looking targeting sights in gaming history
your fellow wingmen will get in trouble and need bailing out
you can boost past your allies to avoid accidentally shooting them or to keep from getting hit or slow yourself down
your ship can lose a wing causing it to control awkwardly and you can dodge enemy fire by spinning your craftnormally i would talk about negative points but besides the date of the graphics and perhaps the sound capabilities of the system if midi music bothers you could possibly hinder this game
the gameplay is awesome and only improves with time
there are three different routes to take and secret levels
which adds to replay value tremendously
and lets not forget the fact that the levels are incredibly well designed the graphics are used to maximum effect man that hyperspace jump is awesome looking
 and the music is some of the best in any game everthis game is truly a classic in every way
if you love great games youll love star fox
and if you love donrails shooters you must have this gamemy childhood came back to me within  minutes of playing the game it was great having this back in my hands i would just like to say this game although i see one possible flaw in it and that being hondas reach and power
aside from that this game is well balanced and still stands up to modern day fighting games
i must admit this is a pretty big deal considering that most new games have more combos and buttons
really i base this review not on fan boy of the classic game honestly it just a good game thats why i bought it
i have no big interest in the street fighter franchise it just this gamethe street fighter ii series have been one of the most popular fighting series of all time and capcom has been releasing many upgraded versions throughout the early to mid s
the first one was street fighter ii the fighting game that revolutionized the genre then street fighter ii champion edition which featured the same fighting engine only now you get to play as the bosses like mbison vega balrog and sagat
and finally comes street fighter ii turbo which featured the same characters including the bosses but with faster and superior gameplay
fans and critics agree that this was one of the greatest street fighter titles since the very first release of the series
no one has forgotten how great the game was even today
the graphics look pretty much the same but cleaner
the animations to each character look extremely vibrant and colorful
the audio is improved and tweaked
so far we dont have any bad voice actors that is until super street fighter ii comes up in this game
and the sounds of hitting still havent changed one bit
as for the line of characters still the same as champion editions
you have ryu ken chunli guile dhalsim blanka sagat mbison balrog and vega
and as for the gameplay still unsurpassive and unmatched comparing to todays sf titles
the controls are still well balanced but much faster than the first two sfii titles
theres even an option or code where you can increase the speed
there are no other things i have to say about the gameplay but all i can say is its still one of the best playing street fighter games ever 
if you still have your snes and youre planning to sell it you might want to think twice 
if you have street fighter ii turbo in you collection you might want to keep it 
who knows 
if you end up selling it and later on feel like playing the game again itll probably take forever to find the game again since its a rare product now 
but all in all a true street fighter classic 
even today not even the newest sf titles can live up to the superior gameplay balance of street fighter ii turbo 
this game should definently not be passed up street fighter ii changed when it got super and everything felt tacky and wacky
street fighter ii hyper fighting is the last official revision before the super games and remains a fan favorite especially for you alpha haters out there
egm placed this game  in their top  games of all time issue  so you can see the impact this game has in historynow you can download this game on xbox live arcade but it just isnt the same because microsofts  controller has a truly awful dpad damn you m
it also has some bad lag why cant they get it right already
when playing online so that isnt so much fun
i would recommend buying the super nes version if you cant track down a copy of street fighter collection  for playstation or capcom arcade classics collection vol
 for playstation xbox these are the arcade perfect versions
i remember renting this game about  times from my local video store cuz my mom wouldnt buy me any fighting games due to violence scares back in the early s
i could pretty much play this game forever and never get tired until its time to sleep or eat
it only gets better when you have a friend to play with and then gets totally awesome when money is involved
ill bankrupt anybodyokay i know gaming has evolved over the years but the street figher series helped ignite mortal kombat killer instinct virtual fighter tekken etc
out of the ones mentioned street figher always has a special place in my hearti was very addicted with the first street figher to come out for the snes
it wasnt until turbo fighing came out that it put this game on another level
for one its faster like the name obviously implies
you can choose the speed up to  stars but if you type in the secret password d r up left y and b after seeing the capcom emblem when turning on the game you can go buck wild and choose up to  stars for speed
 stars is insane and isnt most ideal bc its so fast but its a whole lot of funyou can play any character and in vs mode there are no restrictions sagat vs sagat etc
graphics for its time is sensational and is pretty darn comparable to the arcade
one small difference is that if you use ken or ryu and win his hand kind of raises straight up as opposed to an angle like in the arcade
but its not a knock on the game just an observationoverall its a game i still love to play whenever i see it in the arcades
i especially love it when i get to compete against othersstreet fighter ii is the most influential fighting game ever created
if that wasnt released in  you wouldnt be playing soul calibur or tekken or virtua fighter or deadoralive or mortal kombator even fatal fury
considering the immense success of the snes version of sf capcom decided to do a snes version of the games second quotsequelquot  street fighter ii turbo hyper fighting
this version includes playable bosses minor alterations to the original fighters and of course turbo speedthe first thing youll notice as you turn on the game is its quality
the graphics and sound effects are as vibrant and powerful as they can get on a snes conversion
although lacking the extreme detail and heavy animation of capcoms modern d fighting games it had great graphics for its time
the sound effects are plain dazzling
memorable background music includeshell all of em
you can also listen to all the audio in the game in the options menuif youve played any of the other fighters by capcom youll pick up the controls in ten seconds
there are three kick buttons and three punch buttons
blocking is performed by pressing the control pad left or right
special moves are standard capcom fare and nothing complicated except maybe though not for me zangiefs spinning piledriver
the replay value is higher by far than its sequel super sf in which the poor sound kills the longlasting appeal or any other bit fighting game
the turbo speed is just the icing on an already solid cake
plus if you enter a secret code you can play on a tenstar speed setting which should be experienced at least once
the playable bosses complement the old fighters with their diversity of moves and the original cast have a couple of new moves as wellthis is definitely my mostplayed video game and with good reason
for those of you who still have a snes i simply cant think of a better fighting game you could buy
if you have sf then this may not be necessary although i think it would still be worth checking out due to the low price
this is the definitive snes fighting game
prepare to get your face bashed in for good measure
shoryukenjust like the st one but three times faster you get four boss fighters trust me this is a must have for the street fighter fan o a tip beat it on the hardest seting without losing a round to get the master rank easy for eny master to complete laterwell it all started when my grandma had a snes and she had street fighter ii for it
me and me brothers played it every time we came there
then when grandma let us have the snes we never found street fighter ii
then years later we bough street fighter ii turbo at a yard sale and it was better
speed and all that
you could play in normal or turbo mode
lots of characters from the campion edition
awesomeprobably the best fighting game of the cartridge era without a doubt takes some time to get good at but really entertaining and brought back a lot of memories
great working condition looks great label intact athis game is a lot faster and there are more characters
i cant think of a better game than this
my advice is buy this gameway better than the original street fighter ii
this version includes extra boss charactersthat are now playablehyper fightingwhere you can adjust the speed of gameplaygreat graphicsand top notch sound and music
this game will provide hours of fun
especially with two players
one of the best fighters ever madestreet fighter ii is one of my favorite fighting games alongside smash bros
the super nes version is an almost perfect arcade copy except with more characters and turbo mode where things are sped up
the controls are perfect and smooth the action is intense and multiplayer mode is epic
every chracter has awesome moves from zapping your opponent to extending your arms  feet
the graphics are great for the super nes and the soundtrack isnt the techno junk found in most games
throw whatever xbox  game your playing out the window and try a real challengethis game is a no holds bard its hard but than again most early nintendo games were
this game good its interesting the arcade game this is based on was made the same hear a similar arcade game was made cowboys of moo mesa
personally i would rather play cowboys of moo mesa but im sure the rights or something were an issue if not the graphics
none the less this is a good game really hard and at sometimes kind of unoriginal in its design or just blah
all and all  stars its a fun gamewestern shooter that is all action and all fun
if i could give this game a higher score then  out of  stars i would
a great game that is fun for all ages
games is getting pretty rare and going up in price so get yourself a copy now there selling around  bucksi bought this used and in good condition
shipped in  days even though it was expected to arrive by next week
the game itself plays flawlessy
the packaging was the same as most games that come in the mail
no complaints there
there is very little to no wearfading on the game label surprisingly since it was in good condition maybe it was because it had someones initials written in marker on the backanyway i have no complaints about my purchase
ahhhh it feels good to play a game i grew up with again
dif you grew up playing this series our the more dark harder games depend on erxperience thar came out after it like teeken series when the oponets are even bigger sometimes and the special movies are even more damage if not dodge
there are two way you can beat this game with zangef and other characters with about  to  blows or combos in under thirty minutes more or less
firs way is the more fair method try puttinbg the game on the easies difficult setting if you are still having problems dogging att least  ten percent of the attacks for each two round battle
or do a lot of trianing or practice battles with friends who also have this game and learn through observation when to duck and blocked and back off more efficently and you could become good enough at counter that you could beat this the normal way in under twenty minutes in about maybe three months to a couple of years more or less depending how often you practice
if you can do that you might get reactions to response about the speed of this player with out the secret enhacement without hackingthen there is  another somewha more disrespectful method depending on the opinions of fellow gamers which differ drastically
activate as many cheats as you can or now how to do with this game that are hidden that enhace your characte  extra or infinite health faster than normal speed with out going sonic the headhog speed lif you were use and emulator which actually can cause more defeats and continue if you do not use another code in a same system or similiar to give you infinit lives or health s or bettern strenght and speed ehnacement for combos and normal acts
what ever way you choose you can have fun eithe use either one of these methods the fair or unfair with practice and enough experience
now go foward and unless the fists of justicesnes games like this you have to make sure you have friends lol or it will get old an boring quick
but defiantly a collectible like other top snes fighting gamescapcom had a mega huge hit on there hand when they made sf
harldy anyone even knew what fighting street was nor how it got a seaqul
but sf was an over night smash back in  or so i loved the original i loved hyper edition but this super edition was by far my favorite
but this was the last interest i had with street fighter games
there was far too many versions coming out and i didnt like the animie graphics
but still to this day this is my fav
sf game in the world
introducing  new charactors cammy dee jay fei long and thunder hawk
with new an improved sound and graphics and a few new moves
re drawn backgrounds and cool options
the only thing that was missing was vega no longer lept on to the cage in his stage he just bounced of the wall and a couple of the moves where changed slightly like chun lis blue fart ball was changed into a back flip bubble and executed differently and the airiel moves didnt span accross the screen anymore unless you jumped in that direction but it still didnt take away the hours of fun beating the 
 out of your friends and fire blalling your way to victorythis game has since been revived on the gameboy advance
they have pretty much used the ssfturbo edition that has combos and sort of finisherspecial move things
but its still as good as this version because it pretty much is still this version
one of the originals and the besthello fighting game fans and old school heads alikeso yall wanna know where it all started today there would be no mortal kombat no killer instinkt no tekken no virtua fighter no soul calibursoul blade no marvel vs capcom no street fighter alpha no super smash brothers no actual fighting games period without street fighter  and super street fighter  is hands down the best iteration of the seriesssf features the best visuals most characters  in all and most dynamic gameplay
literally every character in the game was worth experimenting with
all of them had their own specicific moveset with special attacks to juice things upthere were  versions of this classic the arcade version snes version and sega genisis version
while the arcade version exposed fans to ssf most found themselves purchasing the snes and genisis versions to enjoy at home
and these puppies did not disappoint
the graphics visuals of both console versions was very close to their arcade counterpart
the gameplay of all  versions was identical
the exception of the genisis version was requiring the button controller an optional game pad for the sega genisis that really helped with fighting games
the snes version was flawless right out of the boxif you own an old schoolretro bit console do yourself a favor and get super street fighter this was the best they could do on nes as far as the street fighter games that came before
they decide to change it up a little bit to make it more mature cause after the street fighter  the animated movie which was for mature audiences made capcom step it up a bit
in this game you dont have to fight all the appointed cause they added dee jay cammie fei long and thunderhawk
i wish they had akuma
ryus power that he shoots out of his hand has a different look just like in the movie
when ken jumps up to do his upercut fire comes out of it
vega does more kicking and punching instead of turning flips
the screen even has in words telling you how many combos you made
i realy like it when you first put the tape in the first character you see is ryu he looks very mature then he does his signature movei dont know if theres any reason to get the snes version now that super street fighter ii has been included in so many newer compilation sets but in its heyday this was arguably the best fighting game you could own on bit consoles
sure ultimate mortal kombat  and street fighter alpha  eventually offered more playable characters but those ports were visibly incomplete and hampered by limited cartridge space
with super street fighter ii youd be hardpressed to tell anything was missing or changed if you hadnt played the arcade originalso we have a mixture of  new and returning fighters with the old ones slightly tweaked in typical capcom fashion
levels and music have also been slightly remixed and you get redrawn character sprites for the versus screen
there are also bonus tournament battle and time challenge modes which would become a staple in all fighting games
the only things missing are the faster turbo mode of the previous installment and akuma who wasnt included until the next iteration of the gamea very meaty and worthwhile fighting game
this is a required play for fans of the genre whether on the snes or newer editionsstreet fighter  is without a doubt one the best fighting games to ever see the light of day and super street fighter  is no exception
the game features a variety of new and old playable characters including the super fighters from the original and new additions like thawk and fei long
the fighting system has improved making the game run a lot smoother and quicker than before
this is an excellent fighter and needs to belong on the shelf of every fighting game fan out there
its pure genius
this game is really goodi love this game
i first played with my brother as kids and we couldnt get enough
ryu and ken show strong as well as the new challengers who have interesting moves
there is a lot to master and the basic crosspad and four button combo provides a lot of entertainmentyou dont have to be a ninja turtles fan to love this awesome game
it features some of the best coop play ever and its never tiring to pick up the controller and play this game with a friend
even when you play it alone its still funthough not as much
when you travel time in the game you travel from the time of dinosaurs to the future and all the levels are awesome to play through
the only problems with the game are the stupid enemies some camera problems and some control issues
these you probably never notice during your time as a ninja turtle
there are even side multiplayer games like a sequence in which its like a fighting game so you challenge a friend to a duel
this game is a blast to play and should never be missed by anyone who likes awesome gamestmnt  rocks i hope they make a tmnt game of the new tv series it would rock too
this game is tons of fun
and it is non stop game play
everyone will like this gameif you liked this game then check out all of the tmnt gamesturtles in time was my absolute favorite team actionadventure game because it kicked serious 
hopefully most of you have heard of them but if not you play as the teenage mutant ninja turtles or leonardo donatello rafael and michaelangelo
your mission  stop the shredder from conquering and destroying the world as you chase him through new york city to the sewers and through time hense the titlein this one you start out in new york city where the turtles live battling many of the series best enemies from baxter the fly to krang to slash the evil turtle bebop and rocksteady and of course the turtles enemy   the shredderi loved this game
turtles in time played exactly like the original tmnt the arcade game but with new and better and more challenging boards such as the prehistoric board where you have to compete with foot soldiers running you down with dinosaurs and the night riders board where you fight krang on futuristic skate boardsthis was one of the last turtles games but it was easily the best
id get this one even if youre not a fan of the turtles youll still enjoy this onehere is boss static and startegy used to beat this one hard mode in  about a measly  to  minutes these techniques not recommend for less experience players dont be this lazy
the charge supoer attacks are super effective agsinst boss but they drain large amount of your vital to use them that i why yopu use your default  slahing with you weapon on and airal jump kick normal that due not require you to scarcfice your characters vital in order to use them
he makes this game look easier than it is especially with the bosses like leather head
unfortunately leater head you dont she die because he jumnps of the train then explodes its not like slash where you she him exploud and go flying into the lava
leather head and slash were also boss on another ninja turtles games called  ninja turles three the manhanttan project for nes but there not animated well  since there are only about  bit images instead of about  to  bit which is how good the graphics on super nintendo are
also leather head has been scaled down is only half a massive and a brawny as in the super nintendo version
slash is the same size but i did not recgonize him because  he was not animated as good i only found out after watching the credits for number three
for thoose of you that do like the new cartoon  series four kids tv channel on channel  on melborn florida has recently bought the rights to the fifth or six season of  the new ninja turtles cartoon show which is more darker and less kid friednly
shredder was and alien murder slash fugitive  of a species of squid like alien called untrons in season one but i belive he killed by one of the tricertons who joined forces with the turtles
play the ridiculous hard game battle netxsus to find out more
it makes the arcade game look like a walk  in the park i though beaten that in about  minutes was a long speed runtotal boss damge reitance on hard with super movies and normal moves combie about  will send individual boss statistic on hard mode tommorow as well the total  boss dame resitance for all the boss again and indivudal for a medium diffcult with normal attacks like the jump kick and blow from weapons that dont drain your vital
total damage rsitance for baxter stock man and metal head
 perect damge resitance his move differently  slightly and he does move as fast and jump around as muchthe remain boss data will send tommrow for the arcade
because there is only  minutes left in study hall
i probably want to play another cpuple stages of yugio and watch mosquito if daniel is not around
the condition is sligtly poorer than last time i would say it would be worth about maybe  dollars in its condition because of one part when one of the victims is going in and out house with the fuzz lines appear for a few seconds
they had this one dvd but it was the same price each timeturtles in time four individulm boss damage resitance on hard with super moves and normal and airal  usedbaxter stock  damage resitance strength lose of health about  percent per hit max healh  bars if using super moves and fast reaction speed not recommend because these moves drain massive amount of vital in order to be performedstage two boss metal headmetal head had and even lower damager reistance of only about  with the super attack
maxium health  bars
so that about a  percent health lose per bar or about  hits to deplete each barstage three bonus stage rat king on hard mode with same settings and movesthe rat king has a higer damage rsitance strength at about  or  hits to defeat with the ssuper attacks and normal combinednext boss tooka and razoor in the same conditionsthey have a combine total damage resitance of  under these conditions
however unlike the bebop and rock stead fight later on you have to deplete the health bar of both of them to end the battle and to disable the laser beams blocked the elevator entrancethe next fight is normal shredder but he is behind a tank like machine so you cant use your special energy drains on him
instead you have to throws his own foot soliders at him
the difference is this fights is harder it may take longer on hard mode because instead of throwing the normal purple solider ones you have to fight through the rare pink soliders who are the stronges normal enemies in the game with the hights resitance against your normal  jab and slash attacks that dont drain vital
shredder has a  damage resitance meaning each solider  that hits does about a litte more than  percent damage three soliders will take out one barthe rest of the game until the final teenth stage is in the pastshredder  sends you thhrough a time warp gate
you go back in the days to the dinsosarus and then you jumped to the like  century for the  and  century than return to the presentthe next stage in the prestoric period the boss fight at the end varies depending on if you are playing the original arcade version or the supernintendo the stage boss will differ
the original bossn was changed for the super release  probably to make it harder for the proffesional players
the original boss was the  clay monster that baxter stockman created in the second season of the cartoon series use an alien technology
here is the boss statisic  for the next boss on of the fastest and hardest boss in the super nes game the infamous  fifth turtle slash created through the dna of the four originally turtles when combined some howhis  defense resitance followsin this version salsh only has  damge resitance
hit hit with   normal slash and super attacks he shot of the screen and straight into the boiling lava in the back ground
any body want some turtle soupthe next fight i am going to mention is leader head
in a not going to bother with bebop and rockstead damage resitance  this or the normal version unless you you had to to defeat them both at the same time but if you did it would prably be about  to  resitance because that whatm tooka and razor had  because you do have to beat both of them at the same time
since  after you only have defeat one of them the other one automatically is defeated at the same time i guess maybe about  hit will do it on hard mode with the super attacks combine with normal default onesletter head and other bosses static coming up later today
interestling about letter head is about which side he is on actually you include all the encounters include the newer more supernatural version with a strength partially that of supermans from the first season of newer not as popular cartoon show as well as the original episodess he was in and the original cartoon show epsiodes including his origon episode and the episode called letter head meets that rat king from the middle of the fourth or fifth season of the original cleaner cartoon show  pluse the encounters with him from the comic book in which the games and moves were based or partially based off
letterhead has actuall been a double character being both and ally and enemy depending on the series episode or comic volume you have seen or read
i belive from sometime i think i reed on wikipedia a long time several months ago like  back in maybe in mid may or junior later on in the comic letter head goes good or tries  betrays the scientist or who ever it was that caused his transformation and tries to become less of a threat to society and to his fellow mutations and controll his body and insticts better
he is also a boss in battle nextsus and is a lot harder to beat than on this game this was before they had invulerabilty as unlockable hidden easter egg cheat built into the gameletter head goes down with only ten hits he is the most musclar boss if you fighting the fair way with the normal weaker default attacks
this guy may be using and imulatorsuper shredder  barely touches him when i fought super shredder on hard he was move at like super shan speed and it took me like  lives in like ten minutes maybe more or less took take him down i am estimating this was a while ago about  to  years ago when i was like a measly   foot  maybeless
letterhead seems  to have better defense when i thought him even on easy his kinfe throwing attack speed plush punching  taill spin speed are annoyed  he also has another  less effect act when he throw losbsters but he only throws them one at a time in stead of in groupf of  or more in a row and ground attack are annoying even on easy until you learn to dodge them even when the extra barrells are not falling down when he does itthe next boss krang the first time in his  foot for robot body they guy gets more lasily using normal attacks for must of the battle except for about the last maybe   so he has a  damage resitance because he fights more fairly with the weaker normla jumped and slash attacksfor the final fight with  krank the kids is only half as lazy use the super attack twice as often giving krang in the space ship on a meager  damage resitance
krank has high speed and  high attack strength not as high in the arcade or extend altered arcade version of the original game
the robots get annoying he starts dropping them after he lose about  to  of his five to  bars
that it for today the final ridiculous quick fight with super shredder i will send tommrow
the guy literallt take him down in a minute that how much faster reflect he had than eye and the remian six minutes is the dang credits
i belive the are done in donkey kong countrey  stile where at the very end they so you pictures and names of all the normal enemies and bosses
none of the enemy in the sewer stage he attempted to take out for even more livces and extra points except the boss the rat kingsuper shredder static on hard with the same attack combinationsthis guy takes down the might super shredder all  of his health bars with a measly  resitance when normal and charge attacks are used
sup shreder does launch some attack like his fire stream on the floor and his green energy ball attack which you dont want to get hit by it shrink you
the attack strength is so powerful it drains  a whole bar of vital take one whole life if it hits
i recommend starting on easy and normal modes where there are less enemies and the boss attacks and strength and defense status are lower well at least super shredder is but boss baxter through krang seemed in his ship seemed about the same dependinhg on your experience  and reaction speed
i used to be able to beat this in about maybe  to  minutes on easy once i practiced enough with usually one continue inbetween the slash stage and the second boss fight with krang i put on the maxium total of about  to   lives this guy only put it on about  to  i could beat it in about  to  minutes on medium maybeless never used charge attacks
only used the jumped kick on baxter only about half as often as this kid did the other times  i attack him normal will dogging his gun blast attacks
use a strategty like this and you can take down shredder
you actually have to do hard mode to really beat the game
go foward and defeat the foot cowabungaawsome fighting game so you select your turtle leonardo raphael donatello  michaelangelo you go threw each level fighting foot clan soldiers colors dont matter anyway at the end of each level you fight a boss and theyre all villains from the show
baxter stockman metalhead rat king tokka  rahzar shredder slash bebop  rocksteady leatherhead krang krang agian then super shredder
there is also coop mode and vs mode
so if you could somehow get ypur hands on this id check it out  its still fun to playthis is one of my alltime favorite snes games
i just now replayed it and its still a blast
you can play as either leonardo michelangelo donatello or raphael to defeat shredders army of ninjas
once you reach the technodrome shredder sends you into a time warp
you must fight your way thru the past and the future in order to get back home
i highly recommend turtles in timewolfenstein d is a great game its not as good as the original but its still good every snes fan should have this gamethis was ordered as a christmas gift for my daughter and i know shes going to love it
she likes all of the wolfenstein and doom gamesbreath of fire is an awesome rpg game with good graphics good music and awesome ways of fighting enemies
the person who sold it to us was very reliable the game was in good shape and we also received a nice thank you from the seller
i can remember reading one of the other reviews saying that this is one of the best rpgs made for super nintendo and i agree with that person because this game is truly amazing
i would most definitely recommend this gamesquare soft made a nice impact in coproducing this game with capcom
the game is fun challenging and unique
i cant count the number of times i went hunting and fishing
battles are turn based but seem to be in place
the bosses are really tough
often they stay going after their hp bar is depleted and even start unleashing more powerful attacksthe game is long and complex and well worth playing again if you enjoy retro rpgsupdate  played through again on my snes emulator on my phone its still a remarkable game but decidedly lopsided
once you get karns transformations the game gets too easy
the last boss is a joke if you use agnii will probably play through again and not use karns transformations in order to try a tougher challenge well seealso the game is rather short compared to lufia and final fantasy titles and lacks some depth overall
nevertheless it is a solid snes rpg and hard to overlook when talking about the snes rpgs without the word final in their titlemany kids who grew up in the s would agree that it was a decade for entertainment on many angles
for rpg buffs the s bore many classics and the first game in a series called breath of fire was just one of them
released in  it was one of capcoms first attempts at an rpg series and it wasnt a bad one at thatgraphics the sprites are colorful and rather fluid but other than that its your average snes graphicsmusic nothing memorable really but nothing bad
i do dig the dungeon music thoughstory bofs storyline is simple but pretty intriguing just the same time
in a world filled with humans and other humanoid creatures the dark dragons are trying to resurrect the goddess tyr and its up to the light dragon ryu along with other colorful characters to try to stop them and rescue ryus sister sara who was kidnapped by emperor zogs henchman jadegameplay its turnbased of course so its similar to many rpgs at the time
but it has its own twists such as each character having their own ability outside of battle
ryu can fish bo can walk through forests karn can fuse with other party members and more
each enemy has their own hp bar while the bosses have one also but most have an invisible hp bar once the first is depleted
when you die you go back to the last save point with everything with you but your money is halved
you can store it in a bank to prevent that along with items
whats cool about the fight system is that you can switch party members in the middle of the battle and characters not in the battle will still level upthere is one thing i dont like in this game however and that is the  abbreviations
almost every item spell and weapon is abbreviated causing confusion sometimes
it was kind of unnecessary for capcom to do that but fortunately you can view what the items dobuy this game is available for both snes and gba so choose which one you like better
either way you cant go wrongthis game was amazing
nice graphics
nice story
loved the characters
this game will make you wanting more after this game
everything in this game is awesome
the story is told perfect
love the controls
everything to this game is perfectthis is truly a classic
i enjoyed playing it many times
there are plenty of treasure chests to find and the puzzels can be quite challenging
the difficulty level is ajusted to the players level so it gives you a fighting chance not like in some games where you cant win for loosing
i highly recommend this gamecharacters with blue hair teammates that turn into giant fish or birds in order to provide you a means for transportation party members who turn into more sinister creatures to aid you in battle  this game was pretty wild at the time it came out
it has floating castles sidequests turnbased combat and is long enough to almost feel epic
this was one of my first rpgs as a kid and i definitely give it a lot of credit for feeding my addiction to the genreaside from usas ffii this is the best final fantasy ever
the music in this game is comparable to that of games played on the psx the bit sony system
the graphics are also great dimensional
besides that the story is awesome and the game will keep you busy for awhile
its a long one
theres so many twists and turns and things you can do in this game that its almost unbelievable
its a wonder why i didnt choose this one to be  instead of ffii
i guess its because in my mind ffii is the one that started the greatness of the ff series
since ffii the ff series has had a great story and the graphics started looking pretty good
not to bag on ffi but the story was rather weak and besides it was on the bit nintendo system
if you have been let down by any final fantasy youve ever played this is the one to play
theres so many different characters you can get in this game as well but you have to know how to get them
my favorite is the ninja because he has a mind of his own and you never know what hes going to say or dosimply put this is the best final fantasy game squaresoft ever made
it completely changed what people expected in terms of production graphicsstory and especially music
it pushed the snes to its limits and was a rewarding fun experience from the opening credits to the final boss
if you somehow missed this or have never played it do so immediately
this game proves that a classic fantastic videogame experience does not depend on graphics or technology
youll be sucked into ff iiis engaging world from the moment you pop this gem in your snesinitially released as final fantasy  on snesnow we know it to actually be   for the casual fan you should no longer be confused
for years i have heard two things and i will avoid numerals for this review
onethat final fantasy  was the best final fantasy and had the best final fantasy villain
twothat final fantasy  was the best final fantasy and had the best final fantasy villain
this is where ive found that there are three camps of final fantasy fans although it applies to most rpgs but im sticking with this series for right now
camp  the old school die hardthese fans tend to love the originals because of their nostalgic value medieval setting and more majestic storylinescamp  the next generation die hardthese fans tend to love the later entries because of their showcasing of technology darkbleak setting a la blade runner and innovative systems like limit breaks and materiacamp  the die hard final fantasy fan whatd ya think i was going to say
these fans tend to respect and love all the games and maybe dislike just one or two but whose reasons have no relation to camps  and obviously camp  will often claim final fantasy  or  as the best entry maybe even  while camp  will very very likely claim that  is the best
camp  is mixed although ive found a few of those happen to like the third game the bestas much as i respect and enjoy final fantasy  i gravitate towards the first camp because thats the style that i grew up on
i like swords sorcery and high stakes
i keep an open mind but a game like final fantasy  or chrono trigger is like a soldier returning home for me
anyways without further explanation heres my review for final fantasy this game has a very complex plot and despite its totally separate storyline from  it is a wonderful leadin for that game
the world has previously gone through a horrific war of the magi in which the espers powers were misused and brought great destruction espers are summons essentially
the espers were given free will but their powers were sealed never again to be used by man
the main character essentially is terra or tina depending on the translation youre playing a halfesperhalfhuman that went through excruciating circumstances before taking control of her life
theres a slew of characters you meet in the entire game locke is a treasure hunter with the steal technique
edgar is the king of figaro an engineer and twin brother of sabin
sabin had forsaken his royal heritage to study martial arts
celes is a former imperial soldier who also has esper powers due to their experiments on her and can absorb magic through her swords
cyan was the king of doma a kingdom of samurai and he seeks revenge on kefka
theres also shadow a ninja with a mysterious past and has a dog named interceptor that aids him when he needs it
there are other memorable characters that include setzer a gambler and a feral child named gau but ill leave you to discover the others preferably by playing the game but i suppose i cant stop you from wikipediaing italthough it appears emperor gestahl is the main villain in the beginning our main antagonist is kefka
while other villains like sephiroth  and kuja  have interesting motives kefka has my stamp of approval for being the absolute best villain in the series
ive got three reasons why
he is the most ruthless villain in the series
he wipes out the entire kingdom of doma by poisoning the water including cyans family captures the esper god statues and unleashes terror and shows unconditional contempt for the good qualities in humanity
he turns on his emperor in the blink of an eye hungry for the power of the espers
he is one of the goofiest tyrants ive ever seen in a video game
before he marches off to figaro he orders his soldiers to wipe the sand from and off his boots figaro is in the desert
he also torments cyan for his misfortune repeatedly laughing in his face
when the heroes confront him before the final battle he says hate hate hate over and over and over again shaking his fists in an animesort of way
he also has that funny laugh that makes its way into chrono trigger
he has one of the coolest boss themes in any video game periodthe game takes on a late industrialwestern feel to it largely in part to the artists and nobou uematsus variant score
uematsu hit a bullseye in scoring this puppy from terras slow journeymanlike theme to shadows spaghetti westernstyle theme to some of the catchiest battle music youve ever heard in your life to the ragtimeopera suites in the more artsy sections of the gamethe music score overall is perhaps uematsus most diverse music that ive ever heard in a video game
there are majestic moments that will remind you of final fantasies  or  but here is where the two camps merge into one
magic is dying out in the storyline and the music reflects thatawesome music adventorous map theres two worlds by the way play and find out complex plot interesting characters all of them having a unique skill and the ability to have up to four fighting at once innovative battle systems theres three points in the game where you split your characters into two or three teams depending on where you are in the game and you can switch between them and fight a lot of battles gameplay longevity without ever getting boringi have not found any fault in this game and while i do find it to be a long game it does have a replay value to itso who do i recommend this to
because of its difficulty level which isnt impossible but it may be troublesome if youve never played an rpg before i might suggest trying final fantasies  or  first but if you happen to be in the third camp that loves both of those games i guarantee that you will enjoy this game
it is the perfect leadin to final fantasy  by aesthetics and setting alone and i cant think of a better way to intrigue both the medieval fantasy fans and the more modern fantasy fans
i also guarantee that you will love the characters and love their backstoriessaddle up turn on the nostalgic dial grab your weapon of choice and march into battle for one of the greatest adventures that squaresoft er square enix has to offer
i see no reason why you would dislike this game
perhaps the best final fantasy game in existence with ff and ff in close proximity and ff following thoserecommendations chrono trigger classic snes game super mario rpg snes the perfect beginners rpg final fantasy  worthy rpg for the firsttime fan castlevania symphony of the night a combination of classic rpg elements and super metroidstyle gameplaythis is hands down the best in the series although now easier to get as a rerelease on playstation
there is not a gamer alive who shouldnt play this game
the story is wonderful the game is innovative the first to have you split into multiple parties preforming different parts of the story at different times much like active time events in final fantasy ix but much more lengthy and the gameplay system is incredible
this is a must for anyone who even claims to be a video game fanfinal fantasy iii known as vi to some is a timeless classic
they had this game on display at a used game store but not for sale
but eventually they decided to sell it for only 
i snatched it knowing all the great things i heard about this gamegameplay its an rpg
duh
but this one is so fun
the battle system is pretty simple but boy it rocks
each character has a unique battle feature
the game has lots of secrets so keep your eyes peeled
also this game is long
it took me about  hours to beat as long as it took for vii and viiigraphics very well done for a  game
the only better graphics in  was donkey kong countrymusicsound ff games are known for awesome music
same here
the music is well donestory the story is pretty simple for a ff game but deep
even though some parts seem to be taken from star warsoverall a classic rpg
if you have an snes its a must have
if you dont its been remade for playstation but with slow loading times
now its time to play ixthis game is the best in the entire seriesno other ff game has came close to the amount of emotional depth and charachter development
each charachter has their own stories their own chalenges and their own demonsthe storyline is nothing new and follows the story of evil corporation seeks to take over the worldcyanhas to deal with the guilt of failing to protect the kingdom and feels responsible for the murder of his wife and childlockehas to overcome the guilt of not protecting his wife and her death as a resultrelmuseful charachter with the ability to paint the mosters and use their attacks against them
no real depth in this charachter
hints in the game point to the fact that she is shadows daughternot exlored enough though unfortunatelycelesalot of emotionalcharachter depth is the grand daughter of cid
in the second half of the game you decide whether to let him live or let him diesetzernot a very useful charachter but has some emotional depth with him dealing with the death of his friend darylmoguseful charachter with is dances but no real depthumaroive finished this game dozens of times ive used this charachter in only a dozen or so battlesa useless charachtersabingood charachter development has useful attacks simalure to a fighting game
him and his brother both struggle to overcome the death of their fatherthe old man forgot his namegrandfather of relmhas to overcome a childhood challange of not defeating hidonterrastruggles with finding lovegogothis charachter has no story or nothing
can mimic other attacks also you can program his comands with commands from your entire partyshadowhas a mysterious past with only cluesis the father of relm it was a mistake not delving into this more in depth besides by dream sequencesgaucan learn monster attacks
he reconsiles with is father in the second half of the gamethe graphics and the soundtrack were incredible for its time
umatsu is a musical genious
you can visit his website at nobuo uematsucom for proof of his vast work in movies and videogamesthe only thing i have not been able to find is the relic ringgrab an emulator and play ityou will not be disappointedi would have loved to have seen this made into a movie instead of the disastor of final fantasy the spirits withinok so for those who arent aware of the numeric order ff on the snes is actually ff in the series but at the time the us only had  ff games hence the name final fantasy  with the rerelease of final fantasy  and  renamed final fantasy  and  on the ps and gba along with translation issues
hehe sabin
anyways so what can be said about this game that hasnt already been said
well this was before ff and the d era of gaming
the music is amazing next to chrono trigger the music really sets the mood
the cast of characters is huge and by far the biggest in the entire final fantasy franchise
all with their own personalities
i dont want to get too deep into the story but its a great game intense story and the most vile antagonist youll meet in the series and right away youll know who this person is  minutes in the gameis it a guy or a girl
i dont know
the graphics has aged well say what you will about d games d games especially age very well and the graphics at the time are amazing
its really at the heart of it all an rpg game the random encounters and open world traveling is here and since its a final fantasy game you will not be disappointed
this was before ff came out and in my opinion ff is better than ff
just sayingthis cart is a bit hard to find i was lucky enough to find mines in a local retro store for about  bucks thats a steal
if you can find a cart in good condition and a reasonable price go for it
so what are you waiting for
get this game
and chrono trigger and you got yourself the awesomest games in the snes librarymeet celes chere who at a young age was infused with ancient technology transforming her into a sorceress
she has never fallen in love and wonders whether the two things are connected
meet sabin the twin brother of the king of figaro at one point ironically referred to as a puppet state
sabins contempt for power and those who use it was so great that he exiled himself from the kingdom after deliberately allowing his brother to cheat him out of the throne
and then theres gau abandoned at birth as a demon child who survives by running with packs of wild animals
and shadow the battlehardened mercenary who has killed his emotions and takes the most profitable side of every conflict rather than thinking about which side is right
or madonna who discovers a portal to a world beyond the human world and upon discovering how unselfish its inhabitants are never wants to leavethese are just a few of the inhabitants of final fantasy vi squares  epic which at the time of its release was on the cutting edge of achievement for a narrative video game
although the theme of the motley crew uniting to work towards a common cause has been abundant in japanese storytelling since hiroshima in everything from seven samurai to evangelion final fantasy vi is unique in its love for its characters
while some of the characters personalities are childishly overexaggerated and accompanied by wagnerian synth leitmotifs from series composer nobuo uematsu never has eclecticism been made more plainly beautiful
this game is wellliked by children as well as adults and fans of the game each have their favorite characters including a renegade faction of fans devoted to the games villain a renegade imperial general named kefka who dresses like a clown and highspiritedly spouts nihilist philosophy think nietzsches beyond good and evil as an excuse for well evil
you sound like chapters from a selfhelp booklet
he tells the heroes when they confront him with their individual reasons for wanting to defeat him
and only the most hardened realist will be able to play this game without becoming entranced by its many interlocking stories however implausible each one may be and wanting to defeat kefka himher selfhave you ever wondered how the cast of les miserables would fare in a steampunk world where they were pitted against darth vader and emperor palpatine
play this very entertaining game and find outvery fun game and played it for hours so far
i looked up a guide to see how far i was and holy s
i have a lonnnnng way to goits been a long time since i played this but i remember it fondly  im not an rpg guy
the battles held my interest with the variety of options including one guy that did street fighter like moves which was cool since im a huge fan of fighting games
i remember likeing the story a lot
there were so many charactors in this that it was fun for me naming them after the xmenagain not an rpg fan but loved it  looks like the rpg fans liked it too so obviously a pretty solid gamefinal fantasy is a household name when you talk about console rpgs
dating back from the nes and found on virtually every console from that point on final fantasy has come in a variety of flavors and has matured quite a bit
looking to final fantasy vii which has been hailed as one of the greatest games of all time to final fantasy xii which is one of the absolute best in the series its easy to get lost in the mainstream final fantasy titles
its equally easy to get lost in the obscure crosscountry numbering system square had for the series
but deep inside the final fantasy vault lies this gem final fantasy iii for the snesso the actual plot of this game is your typical antiestablishment movement
you have a group of people called the returners who are fighting against the empire
as you can imagine the empire is a big militaristic group who seeks to take control of the world through fear and brute force and the returners wont have any of that going on
however the empire seeks to use the ultimate power known as magic to enslave the rest of the world
so its up to you to stop them
however as fate would have it the empire has quite a few tricks up it sleeve namely a psychotic egotistical maniac known as kefka who will do anything to get his hands on the ultimate magic and rule the world for himself
even though you try your hardest kefka ends up obtaining this power and destroys the world as you know it
once you take control in the postapocalyptic world your task then is to gather up your friends wherever they are and go beat the snot out of kefka and restore peace to the worldtheres almost nothing bad to say about this game
the battle system is probably the pinnacle as far as fastpaced atb goes
the graphics are on par with snes games of the time and the impressive utilization of the sness mode  for the world map was highly appealing
the characters are still some of the most memorable out of the entire series
locke still happens to be one of my alltime favorite characters in the entire franchise
to top it all off you play in a world bordering on total destruction and you continue to play in the postapocalyptic world as wellthe esper system is also unique to the franchise
i like to think that this system provides the basis for the materia system found in final fantasy vii
its very similar in a lot of ways
with the esper system one character can equip one esper at a time
each esper has a set of spells that the character can learn and each spell has a learn rate
the learn rate specifies how fast a character can learn a spell while the esper is equipped
each fight gives your party magic points and those earned magic points are multiplied by the learn rate for each spell
once youve accumulated  magic points per spell the character learns the spell and retains the spell even after the esper is removed unlike the materia system in final fantasy vii where you can master the spells in the materia but once you remove the materia the spells dont stay with the charactera lot of people have complained about the difficulty of the game and to be honest with you i really dont see whats so difficult about it
there are certainly more difficult final fantasy games in the franchise for instance the ability learning system in final fantasy  and the yiazmat hunt in final fantasy  which usually cant be completed in under two hours
the only real challenge to the game is the inconsistent party members up until the near end of the game
youll spend a lot of time with varying party members some more than others which has a tendency to unbalance your entire party which is not a good idea
some times youll really have to take a major break from the main storyline and spend some time leveling your party and learning spells
you can attempt to push straight through the game without preparing your party however its not a very good idea unless you know what youre doingin terms of soundtracks the game features the great composition of nobuo uematsu who once again created an absolute masterpiece
some of the games premiere tracks are found in some of the earlier locations such as narshe the world map music for all three worlds the battle music and as always the great reprise of the classic final fantasy victory fanfare
the theme for all the music is similar in atmosphere and really drags you into the gamefinal fantasy iii is an absolute musthave for any snes enthusiastvideo game collectorrpg fanaticanyone who wants to play a good game basically
it spruces up your personal collection of snes games makes a nice conversational topic amongst likeminded individuals and is just one heck of a game to playthere is no way around it
this is the best game of all time
forget that this is the best piece of entertainment of all time
final fantasy vii comes close and is often hailed as the best in the series but the true veterans who have been on board since the beginning know that this is the peak the monument that defines the realm of rpgs
this analogy is probably overused but accurate that ffiii ffvi j is for video games what the tolkien books are for fictional literature
the intricate perfect flawless interlacing and balance of art music story and gameplay push this above all the competition no matter what era the contender in question may come fromperhaps the most vivid profound point that ffiii makes is that a good game is not in the graphics but in the gameplay which is the soul of a welldesigned game
not to say that the graphics arent beautiful released in  the backgrounds battle engine and overworld effects are gorgeous considering its birthdate
but the gameplay the foundation of final fantasy iii is one of the two main elements that make it the gem of all the industry
there are a ton of items  to be exact from swords to paint brushes from plumed hats to paladin shields
one of the best things about ffiii is that most characters are not limited to one type of weapon as we see in ff vii viii ix etc
there are indeed limits on who can equip what but they are very pertinent
for example locke the thief uses mostly knives in battle
he cannot equip large swords like the masamune or sky render but he can wield short swords like the regal cutlass
some items abound and others are one of a kind
magic and special skills are also plentiful
every character has his or her own unique ability that can be wielded in battle and there is a hefty amount of magical spells including black white and gray types
esper summoning is also available with each esper yielding unique attributes and benefits for the characters in battle
additionally characters with espers equipped will learn different types of magic and will receive stat bonuses that reflect the type of esper the unit is joined with
the system is very efficient and funthe story is simply awesome
its so long so enchanting so  smart
there are a lot of links and loops that will make you say ah ha
unlike ffviii see my ffviii review to see my opinion on that stinker you will see motivation
you will see why every character acts the way he or she does
why is locke so afraid of failure
why does cyan nurture a deep deep hatred for the empire
part of the charm of final fantasy iii is that you are introduced to characters that do things that make you say huh
but later on you discover the events that shaped and molded their personalities
and the best part is that you feel as if you know them  as if youve always known themthe music  oh the glorious beautiful enchanting music
again none of the other titles can match up against this score though vii and ix give it a good shot
folks you cannot beat this
we have an opera
we have a wellthought theme designed for each character made specifically to convey to you their love fears hopes and pain
we have music that compliments whatever environment you may venture through
youll be hardpressed to find any other game that attempts this and you will never find one that does it this wellthere you have it
the power the raw passion emanating from this little cartridge is astounding
no game has lived up to it and though that day will eventually come this masterpiece will still stand as one of the best pieces of entertainment in all the history of manout of any rpg or any genre of game this game has the strongest storyline of all
sure the graphics are pretty poor but they arent bad considering its snes
there are many characters to choose from as the story progresses and all of them have different abilities and personalitiesi think that ffiii or ffvi has the best music out of any ff game as well
even though it all has a very old midi sound to it it is very effective and well put togetherso many twists and turns happen throughout this game that you cant possibly get bored
its incredibly well done and i have to say that it is one of the best games out there
i highly recommend iti remember christmas morning staying in my room and playing this game all morning until it was time to eat the big dinner
i just could not put this game down
it had a fairly cinematic opening with terra wedge and vicks an error in translation he was supposed to be biggs traveling to narshe to capture an esper
this is still my favorite of all the final fantasies and is one of my favorite games of all time in any genrefor the first time since the first game there is no singular main character
the cast of characters changes throughout the game and even at the end when you can use any character there is still no main character most other final fantasies had followed one character cecil cloud squall tidus etc
the leads are usually considered to be terra and locke but several other characters can step up to that position edgar celes cyanthis game has an incredible depth to the story
like most games it starts simply and escalates from there
the beginning is locke haunted by his past rescuing terra from the soldiers of the empire
locke is a member of the resistance the returners
as the game progresses it gets bigger as different cities and characters get involved
the main villain kefka starts out only trying to capture espers and magicite for the empire as well as reclaiming terra
we get to a point and the game branches in three
three characters get their own segments to return to narshe and this introduces us to more characters and more of the world and it opens up the story even more
kefka emperor gestahl and the empire affects more lives than at first glancethe story for this game broadens significantly and as a whole this is the best final fantasy game of the series
i know that many people who first started with ffvii think that game is the best and i do love that game as well but this is where my heart liesbefore i begin i would like to say that this is by far the greatest game i have ever come across and i have come across metroid mega man and chrono trigger
this game never gets old unlike the new final fantasys and produces maximum fun to the gamer unlike the new final fantasys
another victory for squaresoftonward to the reviewstory i have never given a game a  out of  but this game deserves it
this game circles around the magic espers creatures that contain large amounts of magic and power
an evil being named kefka seeks after these espers and drains power out of them until they are obselete
a small rebel resistence force battles against him in a long battle which later on becomes a battle for the human races survivalcharacters the characters were not that bad but there were some that were terrible
that is okay as you rarely ever have to play with them
i am judging the characters by not only their usefulness in battle but their personality alsoterra branford an interesting character who sulks a bit much but definately not as annoying as selphie from ff
an early magic user and can transform into an esperlocke cole a sly theif who is dedicated to his promises
can steal items from enemies during battlesedgar roni figaro a ruler of figaro castle
uses useful tools in battlessabin rene figaro super cool super funny bodybuilder who uses strong blitz attacks during battlesshadow your uncommon loner ninja with quite a past who will slit his mommas throat for a nickel
he can throw swords and items during battleceles chere she is pretty cool and really useful during battle as she can absorb magiccyan garamonde a persistant devious character
during battle he can use certain sword techniques some proving rather powerfulgau a useless character who acts like my  year old brother
he can permanently copy and use enemy moves once again like my brother setzer gabbiani a sly gambler who has a ratherinteresting personality
he can perform a slot move during battlestago magus another worthless character who is extremely weak even in his lores which he can use in battlerelm arrowny an annoying little girl who wants her way with everything
can sketch and control enemies in battlegogo this person has no personality and says nothing during the entire game
he copies off of anyone during battlemog interesting character but not annoying like the moogles in ffix
can dance during battleumaro one word monster who is quite strong and good for battle
he has no special move for battlegameplay this is where the game gets its highest scores
the nonstop fun of playing continues on from beginning to end except for the squid ultros i thought that was tedious
your party consists of four characters each being different in battle and you battle enemies that are not insanely hard but not easy and still producing fun to the gamer
the summons while not proving that much use at all dont take the usual full minute watching stupid animations such as the later final fantasysgraphics for a super nintendo these graphics are superior
compared to final fantasy  these graphics are superior
not much else is to be said heremusic and sound effects i am in love with the battle theme song for this game
not only is it extremely catchy but it is very memorable
the boss music isnt that great but dont get me wrong its memorable
in my opinion however i think that squaresoft should have taken the boss theme music from final fantasy  and beefed it up as final fantasy  has the best boss theme musicfor sounds they are phenominal
they have different types of sounds for different swords whips ninja stars throwing darts and more
when you block an attack with your sword it really sounds like two swords are being crossed
when you block with a shield it really doesnt sound like it but it makes a nice noise nonethelessreplay value i have had this game since i was  and i have beaten this game time and time again and yet i still want to play it
i have never played final fantasy anthology but it sounds real nice so im gonna get it
my thoughts tell me that the super nintendo version is the way to go howevera little emotional something as i leavethe first time i ever beat this game which was a long long time ago i encountered a feeling that made me feel rather sad but blissful sad because there is no more to play of this game blissful because the storyline and ending gave me the feel of true fantasy
after beating this game time and time again i bought final fantasy  when i beat it i did not get that same feeling even though it was a great game
after that i bought final fantasy  and i barely got any feeling at all
after purchasing and beating final fantasy  i felt extremely happy to beat and be rid of that crappy game
now i am working on  hoping to beat it and get that same feeling again which i probably will not get because final fantasy  is a one of a kind gamefirst off why any idiot would give this one star is   definately not a gamer   dosnt know shit about video games
i do not possess words enough to put into scope the greatness of this game
the designer staff outdid all other final fantasies
in my book nothing comes close to this in the rpg department
the final fantasies after ff just dont have the fantasy element in them
you cant blend fantasy  technology into a book or video game
its like trying to blend  entirely different music types into one song
however in this rare instance the creators of final fantasy were able to  pull it off
thier were  things that got me about this game   the outstanding musical score and   the ultimate boss keefka palazo the nihilistic phsycopathic clown
he will stop at nothing to achieve his sadistic goal
his final form reminds me of lucifer who got kicked out of heaven for trying to be godfinal fantasy iii vi in japan is the greatest video game of alltime
the game was the us followup to final fantasy ii iv in japan which vastly improved on the excellent predecessorthe story involves a madman named kefka who is essentially trying to destroy the world by harvesting espers which are basically beasts from an alternate world who made their way into the human world
you control the protagonists who are trying to stop him
one of the greatest twists in video game history in my opinion occurs at the midpoint of the game and forces the party to overcome division and hopelessness to save the world
while the game might appear to be juvenile and cartoonish in the storytelling the story is such that i appreciate just as much now at  as i did when i first played it at there are many playable characters which was very diverse in their personalities and abilities
a handful sabin edgar terra celes are much more useful than others gau mog relm but at many points in the game you can choose to use whichever ones you pleasethis was the first game of the serious where you pack some serious firepower towards the end of the game
some of the abilities and equipment make the end battles fairly easy but it doesnt detract from the overall experience at all
it actually is quite satisfying pounding your enemies into oblivionin summary final fantasy iii is my favorite video game of alltime
i used to make it a tradition to avoid family time and fire up a new game everytime thanksgiving and complete it by new years
i still play the game the whole way through about once per year
it will never lose its charm to me and it has my highest recommendationa thousand years ago the power of magic was harnessed in a terrible war that threatened the entire world
now an evil empire is trying to use that mystical power to conquer the world and only a few brave adventurers stand in its wayi first played this game in high school when a friend lent it to me
i hadnt played a final fantasy game since the first one which i had never beaten but i had recently seen the trailer for final fantasy vii which had captured my interest
so i borrowed final fantasy iii in japan final fantasy vi for a few weeks
and that is how i fell into one of the greatest fantasy adventures ive ever encounteredeverything about this game is done perfectly
the world of final fantasy iii is a great fantasy setting a steampunk world of magic and swordplay threatened by a rising evil
the gameplay has everything you could want in an rpg great character building cool weapons and armor upgrades magic spells and creatures to summon to your aid
and an airship that lets you take to the skies on your adventurethe characters are memorable
locke the treasure hunter
terra the young heroine who wields the terrifying power of magic
shadow the mysterious ninja
cyan the tragic knight
sabin and edgar the twin princes of a rebel kingdom
celes the magicinfused former knight of the empire
and the rest of them is it just me or do they not make rpgs with characters this awesome any more
and then theres kefka the jesterwizard villain of the piece who sinks to unimaginable depths of wickedness over the course of the story finally becoming perfectly evil and wielding godlike powers of destruction which he uses whimsically on a world that cowers in fear of him
by the time you face him in the end you want to defeat him like no game villain you have ever fought beforethe story is epic
uncovering the mystery behind the force known as magic fighting the empire learning the pasts of the characters who are the games heroes seeing the rise of kefkaeverything unfolds like a storybook fantasy
and when the world gets destroyedyou are only halfway through the game
there is still a story to tell of the champions of a ruined world and their last stand against ultimate evil
if you are looking for this game on a different game system it has been rereleased in final fantasy anthology for the playstation and as final fantasy vi advance for the gameboy advance
both versions are good
final fantasy vi advance has a bit of added content and some translation changes including the song celes sings in the famous opera house scene
this is as good as rpgs get a classic that deserves every drop of the love fans have for itcome to my website if u are stuck on ff or  at  thankswords cannot describe how brilliant and wonderful this incredible game is
i unfortunately never got to buy this wonderful game when i was younger even though i owned almost every other super nes game
i also never owned chrono trigger either but guess what
i now own a nice emulator that i got online and i got ffiii ffii and ct all three are probably the best games ever
i began playing both ffiii and ct and felt instantly the awesome feeling i got in the good old days from the original super nes games that wed always rent but never got to buy
i actually did rent chrono trigger a long time ago but id forgotten all about until i played it and i became entranced in the wonderful music intrigueing storyline cool characters and really sweet gameplaybut as for final fantasy iii this game has now hooked me and it refuses to let go
ive spent the past five days playing nothing but ffiii ffii and ct final fantasy iii has a thoroughly complex storyline and an awesome cast of characters
i was actually on the verge of crying at certain scenes they just were so sad
the game begins with only terra who is confused about herself and is being controlled by the empire to find the espers which are magical beings from a world that is only enterable through a cave deep in a mountain
terra is rescued by locke whos a member of the returners and he is friends with edgar the king of the kingdom of figaro
they then meet his brother sabin and then locke rescues general celes of the imperial army who joins them because she doesnt believe in the evil deeds she is forced to do all the time and because she reminds locke of his lost girlfriend rachel
soon the game branches off into three different scenarios where you must guide each of the newfound characters back to narshe the city where the game begins
you soon meet several more characters like cyan who might be my favorite character and is a loyal knight of doma and who feels guilty about the death of his wife and child due to the poisoning of the castles water system
theres also gau a boy who was raised from birth by wild animals in the woods who is met fairly early in the game
in addition there is also shadow a mercenary ninja who can be hired by the player at various points in the game until he is permenantly forced to join you and when he seems to want to join you as well
you also meet setzer a world travelling gambler who owns a big airship called the blackjack and theres also strago and his grand daughter relm who are magic experts who accompany you much later on
aside from these main characters who form the storyline there are also three others who must be found and placed in the party
theres mog a moogle umaro whos a yeti and gogo whos a mimic who never speaksone of the key characters in this story is the villain who is hailed as one of the best in video game history or otherwise
his name is kefka and he has a fiery personality that soon engulfs the world in a war that was begun by his commander emperer gestahl
but kefka soon advances to being the true villain of the story and he says lines that have made me laugh for hours on end
son of a submariner i shall build a monument to nonexistence and the famous you all sound like chapters in a selfhelp booklet
these are only a few of the unusual things youll hear from kefka and in my opinion he makes a far better villain than sephiroth
i think if sephiroth were more like kefka he would be more effective
i never really cared as much for ffvii the way everyone else on earth did and it seems that that game gets to a point where it becomes impossible to progress further
there are bosses who are simply too insanely hard to beat and it really takes the fun out of the game forcing you to have to spend weeks battling enemies on the field until youre halfway ready to fight the boss
yep thats ffvii
no i shouldnt talk about it like its bad
its a good game
it just totally loses its epic feel once you leave the city of midgar
it took me seven years of learning how to play ff properly before i ever managed to get past the battle at the end of the shinra building
but anyway getting back to ffiii what i love about this game is not only the flawless incredibly massive storyline the loveable great characters the wonderful musical score the interesting world map design something i pay attention to in each ff game just for grins and the good graphics i dont care if others dont like the graphics
theyre good
they are
how can you honestly say theyre bad
 other than all that what i really love about it is you are very much free in this game to go virtually anywhere you want especially when you get the airshipthis game seems like its several different stories interwoven into one which is pretty much what it is
there also really isnt a particular main character either
certain ones seemed like they couldve been at first but then a new one comes along who seems to take that role
usually the lead roles are considered to be locke edgar and terra
theyre only the ones you start with though
locke is cool but he isnt the actual main character
ffix revolves around zidane and ffiv revolves around cecil for example
but this game has a different style
it revolves around all the characters not just one
the actual main character could be a number of them
celes terra cyan edgar sabin locke and even shadow seem like they could be the main character
whats interesting is how you are put into a position in which it feels like youre looking through the eyes of the character youre controlling
it really feels real to a certain extent
its also very easy to become attached to the characters
i remember feeling very sad when i saw how cyan felt seeing his loved ones pass away
i also almost wanted to yell at kefka when he killed general leo
kefka is just a very sinister villain who couldnt care less what happens to the world or anyone besides himself
thats one thing that makes him very different than sephiroth who thought what he was doing was a good thing for the planet
kefka thinks in reverse
hes actually very likeable though
its hard to explain
but my advice is if you dont already own this game on super nes or the playstation remake download an emulator at wwwemuparadisecom or this one other website where i got mine sorry cant remember what its called
im not gonna spoil any more of the game than i already have so play it and find out why its truly one of the three greatest video games ever created or concievedthis is the greatest rpg for the super nes and one of the best games ever made
it beats out chrono trigger and secret of mana easily some of the closest competition that square had
final fantasy iii technically vi fires on all cylinders in so many wayspros graphics
for the snes these graphics are some of the most amazing d graphics i have ever seen
colorful vivid characters and lush vast landscapes make for some truly epic gameplay plotline
so deep so well thought out and so worth playing it over again because of this soundtrack
easily some of the best nobuo has dished out in his tenure at square and probably the greatest soundtrack ever to be heard on a bit platform
from majestic castles to dramatic battles to flying through the sky at breakneck speeds this game has the soundtrack to fit it all characters
each of the  characters that the player can play as is highly unique and innovative challenge
good enough sidequests
plenty as usualcons length
compared to its three immediate successors this game is a childrens book in sizethe positives truly outweigh the negatives here
by all means buy this game as it is or if you feel you must pick up the playstation packagefinal fantasy anthologyto get a moderately enhanced version of this game with some extra cgs plus the neverbeforedomesticallyavailable ffv which is decent but nothing when compared to this masterpiecetheres very little i can say about this game that hasnt been said before
what i can say is as someone whos played every version of this game released stateside that this particular version still holds the dearest place in my heart
theres something to be said about playing a game the way it was meant to be played an snes with no load times no unneeded forcedin cut scenes a beautiful score and graphics that were unbeatable at the time
to this day it remains one of the best rpgs ive ever played with the most endearing characters subtly terrifying villains and more than a few laughs in between
no spoony bards though
if youre on the fence about buying this game all i can tell you is that its one title thats never lost its original magic no matter how many times i play it and its worth every last pennyfinal fantasy vi iii in the us is considered by many to be the best rpg ever made
it is a very deep game and will provide countless hours of fun
it is one of my personal favorites in the rpg genre
i highly recommend this game and it is worth every pennythis is my personal favorite final fantasy game
it introduced the ability to teach any magic to any character with the esper system which is like the materia system in final fantasy  except that an espers spells are learned permanently
with a huge cast of playable characters each with unique special abilities this game offered a level of party customization not found in previous entries in the series
the story while a classic tale of rebellion against an oppressive empire is rich and takes itself seriously
a great musical score also helps make this game a winnernote i will refer to ff iii as ff vi throughout this review since that is its japanese name and the name given to it when released in ff anthologyff vi was first released in  for the snes
it received great reviews and critical acclaim from people all over the world
this was also my very first ff the one that got me into the other ffs and rpgs for that matterff vi has it all a great story some of the best character development seen in any rpg music that is still hailed as best video game music ever moderate challenge and one of the longest rpgs for its time
all the characters have their own background and its pretty tough at times to tell who the main character actually is
terra locke edgar sabin mog cyan shadow and everyone else is an unforgettable cast of characters which really draws you into the gamethe usual ff summons are here in the form of espers
equip them to a character to learn magic ex
ifrit being firebased will teach fire
this makes for a whole lot of customization and good replay value
every character has their own skills like in ff iv and ix ex
edgar has his tools sabin has blitz commands etc
if youre a fan of ffs or rpgs and havent played ff vi yet you really should
one of the best ffs one of the best snes games of alltime and my th favorite game of alltimecheck it outnote it would probably be better to buy ff anthology which contains this game and ff v despite longer loading times you get both games for the price of onehad a big case of nostalgia wanted to do some retro gaming so ordered mortal kombat ii and it came in super fast and works perfect the game is still awesome as it was years ago
if you are looking at it buy it now
its kombat for petes sakemk  rocks this is a really fun game and its better than the first
there are new characters and returning characters
and ther is new fatalities
this is one game you gotta playif you liked this game check out all of the mortal kombat games movies books  cdsmortal kombat ii it sounds so funny to talk about this game now as the next installment of this game is coming out mortal kombat  deadly alliance
but lets say it mortal kombat ii was a perfect home version of the arcade hit and from then on it proved to be that if mortal kombat was going to do well on any home systems it had to be clear uncut uncensored unlike mortal kombat and it had to play just like it did in the arcadethat and this was the last mortal kombat to be somewhat serious before it became a fighting cartoon in mortal kombat  and ultimate mortal kombat honestly i still play this every now and then
it takes me a little while to get back the information of the game because its been that long lol
but its still worth it to just do thati say this a lot but this was another game in the history of games that a person needed to get to complete a collection
personally i skipped the snes version of the original mortal kombat and went straight to mortal kombat ii because it was uncutif you still have your snes and you dont have mortal kombat ii you have to get it
after all you might regret it later when the only time you can find any decent games are at flea markets and garage sales and for me as a collector of some of the quotold schoolquot game systems and games i despise rummaging through piles of junk just to find that needle in the hay stack
why go through all that trouble when you can do your collecting herei had a great time hosting a mk ii tournament at my house
however im not much of a fighter game player but when i won the tournament i was like whhhhhhhhhhaaaaat play with subzero
when you fight raiden you must use only low punches do not block and get at least one flawless victory
fight johny cage anyway you like but you must have a double flawless victory
when fighting kitana everytime you hit hershe must be frozen first
do not hit her if she is not frozen
last one
when fighting jax you must get a flawless victory using nothing but uppercutswhen you have accomplished all this you are ready for the easter egg
as the screen is scrolling up and you are ready to fight the last boss hit start then up up down down left right leftif you have done everything right sindel will appear and fight the final boss for you
after she defeats the final boss your character will bow to her and she will command you to return with her to edenrealm to be her servant
who would not want to be the slave of sindel
it is so kool to see sindels mkii versionlong live her highness sindelgame arrived on time actually ahead of projected delivery date and in secure packaging
the plastic and label on the cartridge look incredible and the game plays  without any sort of issues
i strongly suggest you buy this game
nothing feels quite as satisfying as hearing scorpion yellget over herethis game is truly an snes gemstone
and is one of the games that proved the true potential of the bit processor that powered the snes
this is the sequal and is considered  of the best maybe the best instalment in the series
mortal kombat  was also ported to many systems such as playstation sega saturn x genesis game boy and game gear
and the snes version competes very well with even the saturn playstation and x versions
this game may not quite be as refined looking as the x but its soundtrack is very similar to the arcade and its sound effects are still better in some respects
the genesis version is very close to the snes but again the soundtrack backgrounds and sound effects arent quite as well crafted as the snes version
the voice acting on this version is also very good quality probably the biggest area where it surpasses the genesis
the gameplay though is where the genesisx and other versions get a small edge
the gameplay of this version is really awesome but its biotchin hard
not only is this one of the best versions of mk its possibly the hardest also
i could always get to kintaro but that four armed monstrous thug always demolished me every time lol
there are a few things missing from the arcade version but this game rolls great with out them
 of the best versions of mk and a classic fighting game in general on the snesthis sequel was great even better than the original
unlike the home version for the first game this home version for the sequel has the gore and the fatalities that mk fans love
this time some new characters like kitana milena baraka reptile and more
and my favorites from the last game are back like sub zero scorpion johnny cage and raiden
the graphics are outstanding the fights are very fun and the characters are even better here than they were in the first game
this is a musthave for all mk fansa year ago i bought this game cheap
i loved it
mortal kombat  has all the good graphics fatalities and more characters on the snes version
newcomers like baraka jax kung lao and many more are what make a sequel game more fun to play
there are also new bosses such as the emperor shao kahn and the huge fourarmed kintaro
also the hidden character reptile and shang tsung that were found on the first mortal kombat are now playable
they also included new finishing moves which are friendships and babalities
what can i say
this is simply the best mortal kombat game on the snesmortal kombat was a great fighter in the arcades but when the sequel came out the series already blew over the roofthe digitized graphics were better the gameplay was better and they even put in more amusing sound effects
in fact remember the toasty
guy
that is random and cool at the same timethe gameplay is oneonone fighting at perhaps its finest
you choose from a wide selection of characters and then you duke it out with one of them
fighting moves include punching kicking uppercutting and using a special move
it is incredibly fun and it would always keep you playingthe music is really welldone and neatly composed
sadly youd be concentrating on the fighting and given how the sound effects are being heard as you smack the opponent to a pulp its like as if youd forget theres music
that happens in almost every fighting game you can imagine existedoverall this game is awesome
it will never die outthe snes version of mortal kombat ii was a whole lot better than the original mortal kombat on this systemit included the main thing that everybody missed in the first gameand that was the blood and the gorethis version still holds up as one of the best versions of mkii to ownthe gameplay and graphics are fantasticat the timeit was the closet thing to the arcade that you could possibly getthe only little flaw that i remember about this version is when you are player oneand you pick johnny cagehis belt is redthe player two johnny cage has the blue beltwhich is how player one is supposed to lookand vice versa with player two having the red beltthats how it was in the arcade and the rest of the versions of mkiii found that to be a little strangei dont think alot of people even noticed thisi meanits not a big deal or anythingi just thought that i would point this outanywayoverallthis is still a great version of one of the best video games of all timei highly recommend itmortal kombat ii is widely held as the best installment of the bloody fighting series
graphics and sound have been given a nice upgrade since the first installment and controls are tight and responsive
the game walks a fine line between dreary violent gore ripping torsos apart cutting people in half impaling them etc and light humour friendship moves babalities
too much of the latter turned the next installment of the franchise into selfparody but its kept in check here
the game features one of the most memorable roster of fighters since the original street fighter ii and gameplay is loose enough to let players develop their own combos
finally lots of secret characters and easter eggs await those who search hard enoughthe snes version is definitely superior to the genesis port this goaround with all of the gore intact and presentation true to the arcade
still one of the best conversions of mortal kombat ii
if you own an snes and still dont have this gem get itvery little differs between the arcade version of mk and the super nes version
you really cant ask for something better out of a game converted from a cabinet to a  bit systemmk is probably the strongest game out of the whole mk series
it has plenty of fatalities friendships etc but not so many that theres an endless list of button presses to memorize
it has great graphics and great characters my favorites being baraka and kung lao
its just as fun to watch as it is to play
like all mk games though its challenging as all heck
dont waste too much of your life on this game but play it on the easiest difficulty and be sure to look up fatalities online
try to buy it cheap somewhere
its a good gamegreat game but there are so many other ways to play this besides on the super nes
i recommend that you playthis on the psp or the ps
you can get it at the playstation store online or on the midway arcade treasures compilations starsgreatthese are two great puzzle games with instantly recognizable themes korobeiniki for tetris fever theme for dr mario they both are highly addicting and of course fun
they look stunning in bit and i couldnt be more pleased to have them in one cartridge
they offer cerebral benefits and are highly enjoyable
i highly recommend this cartridge great games tetris is one of the bestselling puzzle games and there is reason for itits easy to learn but so addictive
dr mario is one of the best adaptations of the japanese puzzle sensation quotpuyo puyoquot ever seen
you get two great puzzle games in one cartridge
you cant go wrongwhat you see is what you get with tetris  dr mario
as should have been the case with the official nes version tetris is now twoplayers
not that ridiculous fake player with a game genie where one player moves the blocks while the other rotates but headtohead vs the music in tetris is a bit representation of the gameboy version so music a sugarplumb fairy and c from nes is not there
sorrydr
mario is essentially the same as the nes version except for bit graphics and music
you still have the two tunes fever and chillthere is a third mode in this cart aimed at twoplay
you start in one game then go to the other
its neat but nothing specialthe controls remain faithful to there nes and gameboy counterparts which can be good or badcrosspad moves pills in dr mario blocks in tetris and selector in the menu screensbutton advances in the menu screens and rotates obects clockwise in both gamesbutton b cancels in menu screens and rotates objects counterclockwise in both gamesstart pauses the gamethe y x l r and select buttons do nothinganyone who enjoys puzzle type games will love this cartridge
its got tetris the classic and dr mario a fun variation under one roof so to speaktetris is one of my favorite games ever mainly because every time you play it its different
the order of the pieces and your own brain determine so much
the object in case you dont know is to arrange falling shapes of various designs to fill complete lines
these lines then disappear
you get extra points for clearing more then one line at once
you can either start with nothing and clear as many lines as possible before you run out of room at the top or you can play until you clear  lines
either way its a fun test of reflexes and thinking powernot enough fun
challenge a friend in head to head competition
this is something that was missing from the release on the original nintendo so i was thrilled to see it here
i love to play with my friendsin doctor mario you are shown a screen with some viruses on it
your goal is to clear the viruses by arranging the vitamin pills that mario throws in for you
when you have four color blocks the same they disappear
while this is a fun game its basically a variation on tetris  which is what i usually reach for when in the mood for a game like this
it also includes two player optionsjust in case these werent enough for you you can challenge a friend to a mix and match game involving tetris and dr marioi have spent many happy hours playing tetris and its variations and i dont see that changing in the near future
if these games are up your ally you wont go wrong by getting thisthis is the old hardcore tetris game
the new ones let you have holding and hard drop
its childs play compared with the old time tetris
this is where it all began
can you play without fifty million props to make it easier
gotta love that old time tetris music tooprobably on my top ten snes games list tetrisampdr mario is a gem to own on your classic snes
ill be a first to admit that i at first only bought this game for tetris
i didnt play dr mario on the original nes but i knew that tetris was down right addictive
so i was a little reluctant to play dr mario
but when i did that was fun too and just as addictivefirst dr mario
the game shows mario throwing pills in a jar and you must match the color up with the virus until three of the colors in a row are stacked up
then the virus disappears
yep thats all
 levels that you can select right away but the game goes on with no real ending eitherjust like tetristetris im sure many of you have played it before
whoever thought that making lines could become so addictive
you just place your blocks down until you form a line and then voila the line disappears
what was best about this game for me
there is no ending
you select up to nine levels and there is actually a level and and and  etc
the second best part
if you ever lost in tetris it was mostly your fault not the games fault
its you who must find the proper place for the block
and please tell me im not crazy when i say this but did anyone else look at tiles in buildings and form pieces from tetris
also did you dream of these blocks falling too
well i did because the game was just something branded in my mind and its really nice to see it released for the snesboth of these games are great in another aspect
the fact that theyre both simple
anyone could play these games and expect to have some sort of mastery at them
i think a lot of video games are actually aimed at male players such as myself and a lot of female gamers cant get into them as easily
well this game is easy for anyone to get into
sure it aint shoot em up style kind of game and you dont kill anyone but hey its funits great to see a game that can actually mix these two puzzle games from the nes
in mixed match two players can compete in a race to get the most lines in tetris typea after completing a stage of tetris typeb and a stage of dr mario
besides that tetris and dr mario are two of the best of the classic puzzle games out there
it is great to be able to play them on the snes if you missed out on your chance to get them while they were games for the nesgreat game
in better condition than expected
i am inept at dr mario but tetris is great fun to playkirbys avalanche is one of those spinoffs like mario paint or pokemon puzzle leauge
i bought this game because i had and fc twin which can play nes and snes games its not offacial and all i had for it were two nes games super mario bros and the legend of zelda
when i read on wikipedia it couldent play kirby super star i was pretty disapointed so one day when i was looking for kirby snes games i came across this
after reading reviews and watching videos on google video it reminded me of tetris but with cute blobs
i wanted a snes game
i wanted a kirby game
i wanted a tetrisstyle game
i wanted a game with cute blobs
and finnaly i wanted a dollar game xd
so i bought itnow for the gameplay
this is how you play different colored blobs will fall down in pairs you must have four of the same color or more attached by having them fall to the ground or each other
when this happens they will explode not like a bomb theyll just kinda go poof if they fill to the top the game is over and you can retry the level you were on
the main way to win is to get chain reaction where a set of blobs explode the different colored pair on top of it will fall down on to more blobs of its clolor causing them to explode as well and on and on
when you do this gray blobs will fall in your oppontens side of the screen depending on how much chain reactions you cause the only way to get rid of gray blobs is to explode blobs next to them
the ones the explosion was next to will dissapear
the controls are bassicly the same as tetris
on the start menu you have the choice of playing competition p vs p two player mode player one versus player twopractice and options
competition is where you have a chioce of choosing learning stage which is only  easy levels normal which starts you off at the beginning or hard which is about three enemies later after normal
how it works is you start playing one computer and keep on advancing
practice is selfexplanatory but ill tell you how it works anyway
you choose a diffuculty and play alone actually  a two player can play if he or she wants to but this is beside the point when you get a game over you can restart
then theres versus
whoever has there blobs get to the top thus losing first will lose
then you can rematch or quit
finnaly theres options
this most likley the coolest options screen ive seen
you can change the controls listen to all of the music and sound effects in the game etcall in all its a good game just challeninggot this game quite impulsively without taking much thought
found out it is was a tetris game with kirby in ithaha was a little sad at first but gave it a little time and relized i love tetris
the game is as difficult as it is addicting and is a good buy 
get this game if you love tetris and watching cute little kirby dance around while you play tetris hahathis was purchased as a christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday weekend i had her check it out
it works perfectlythis is the first one ive ever played and still my favorite
it is magnificent
anyway here is my reviewgraphics  very clean and colorful and detailedsound mega mans buster sounds like a frikin pea shooter
other than that the sound effects are decentmusic  pretty catchy especialy the first level of dr wilys castlegameplay  oh yeah
this is what im what im talking about
there is now an intro level and  bosses
once you beat the  bosses another  pop up
there are tons of hidden goodies
collect rush letters to get the super adaptor
the rush coil and jet are back as well as rush search
and the bosses are creative
and some weapons  interact with objects
you can also find beat and he can help you
there is also an item shop
bass and treble are here tooa classic
get thisthis was the second to last game with the original megaman  and his originally nemisis doctor willy if you exclude the mega man games from the original series in gameboy format like mega man  through  redone  for game boy inbetween  and  if you don conclude the foreign games that were not imediately release in the united states
this includes the two stretfighter fighting games power fighter one and two and megaman and bass megaman
thi s game cam be fun but challange if you use normal shouts on the bosses and dont no there exact weakness
here
i will start with thye second boss fight with doctor willy and move backword dont want these tips then close the page
for boss docot willy the second time there are two way that you can beat him if you have enough enery tanks and doge enough
willy has about a  restitance against spring mans  spring ball like weapons but about  hit from spring mans ability will defeat the crazey doctor if you have enough eazy and change recharge the energy meteor for the ability up frequently enough
second method but possibly harded method due to willy frequently turns his squacer invisible is to hit him with a full power mega buster blast this should take him down with about  to  hits if you can surve long enough with out infite health if your shoots do not miss him or hit him when he is invulerable
for doctor willy the first time batte  he has a slight partial weakness against the electricn white energy ball like attack there is a likely hod of about  to  pecent that this special move will take away  or about  of his life bar away each time it is fire
to do this it must hit this skull like tye walker walker like boss  in the eye area when its face foward about sixteen times
a quicker faster method is to once again hit him with a full power mega buster attack this attack if it hits the right spot will cause about  to  more damge pure hit than the electric ball caused the ship to explouded with about  direct hits if you dodge his attacks and use your enerry tanks if you have any to heal at the appropriate time
for the th boss fight  the second battle with spring man his rsitance against normnal shot is strong at  percent there are two way to defeat him that doabout the same amount damgage you can defeat him with about  to if by use of either a directly hit from a full power charge mega buster shoot or  to ten hits from slash man ability a point bank range wil defeat him quickly if you doge fast enough
he is drastically weakerwith only a   percent resitance from damge if he does or he is out of the short  inches to  foot strike range of slash mans ability
for the th second boss fight the turbo man rematch
using a fully power mega buster shot will take him out with about  hits
but there is another techinque thats even quicker
turbo man for some reason is weak again soom wave like attacks like used my guile in stret fighter
you have suck and attack you get it once you death the robot master shade man
it is a sonar like sonic protetile weapon its super effective  his resitance is low at only  percent hit him five times with out it being dodge in the front or back and its back to the master heap for him
for the th boss fight the ice boss re fight you have to method that do the same damage hit him with seven full power mega buster or have him touch you when surrounded by the junk mans equivelnt of wood mans leaf shield from mega man   times and he goes down like the truck from duel
for the  rematch with cloud man  use a  ability similar to that of buble man from megamnman  to is super devstating and take him down with only about  hits give him only a  percent restiance for a slihglt harder mroe difficult battle you can try the extend the battle another  if your good enough at dogging know you can defat him and heal before he defeats you
for the slash man rematch he also has super low restitance of only  percent against the ice robots ability blast him five times and you have your self a fromzein wolverine wana a bee on a stick
the gigantic clown like boss has highj attack strengthhis weak point is a small gem on his you can either try to hit him fiften times in the head with sonic weapon you get from shade man or you can do the same process  with  to  hits by using your normal buster shoot fulling charged instead
for enormorus turtle bus i dont recomed ussing coil mans movie because the turtles has high resitance against the effects of it take  to  hits to defeat it if you dont hit it when its recoils inside and is temporarly invulerable will in sends out  a few  smaller minions
i recommend the charge shoot at full power to take it down in about  shout if they hit properly you can cut cut down another  to  of running time more or less
for the final battle with bas  have at least one e one you because base and treble the ecvil mega man and rush joing together
i higly recommed  hit him with  to  full power charge shot instead of  hitting him with  to  times with the ability of the current ice robot
to beat up the giganti guts man like robot with the giant claw you can either hit him  time with slash mans low strike range attack or you can use full power charge shoot will doinging  and healing at the right time and reduce him to scrape in half the time if you hit him every single ytime in the right area
for the second fight with bass hit with about  to  of  sonic wave blast attacks you get from deathing shadow man or blast him with the mega blast full speed if you think you can out match his speed and take him down with out invulerability or armor enhacement cheats on to reduce damage which i dont think they had back when this came out
its getting to late i may send you startegies for the other bosses at a later date but use what i have advised for now or watch the  guys speed run on you tubve you might be able to beat this game in a phonilmal time of  to  minutes depending on practic and if you do things legal which people seldom due in these games thanks for reading this if you didmega man fans have something to keep an eye out for with this the only game in the classic mm series for snes
it has eight all new never before heard of bosses
it actually started a new custom in the classic series first a single level then four bosses to defeat in this case cloud man burst man junk man and freeze man then another single stage as sort of an intermission four more bosses shade man turbo man spring man and slash man followed by wilys castle
the game is fun with catchy music and surprisingly difficult stages
overall if you own an snes look for this on here or on ebay its worth itafter the explosive debut of mega man x one of the best games ever made in my opinion the future seemed a bit bleak for the original mega man franchise
would the original be left in the dust of this offtheroad wunderkind
thankfully that didnt happen as in a few months creation time mega man came storming back in a new bit format
and what a storm it was
now granted many seemed underwhelmed by this game and slogged on it unfairly due to their infatuation with the x side of things but if you look into what mega man  has to offer youll find an absolutely solid game easily the best original mega man title in quite a few years
all sorts of new elements came into play in mm dialogue a more engaging story line the addition of new characters auto bass and treble the bolt currencybig eddies stop system and bonus items hidden throughout each level r u s h plates which create the super rush armor power converter autos super bolt beat and even proto mans protoshield but all the negativity abound should to be forsaken due to above average level design fancifully created bosses powerful weapons and that enveloping energetic rush thats been a bit lacking in other titles postmm
hardly the weak jackstraw title others have made it out to be mm should be appreciated for what it is and is to be seen as the last good classicera titledont listen to anyone that says this is bad because this is the best and most unique mega man game ever
this game introduces bass and treble which are amazing cool characters
you have to get this game if your a mega man fanatic or not
this game takes place right after mega man  for nes
a rare must have
capcom put so much effort and thought into this game and that is why it is the best original story mega man game everunlike the first two snes games this is not part of the x series
rather it is a sequel to the nes adventure mega man  in which wily was finally jailed
here a secret plot is revealed and wily escapes prison
shortly after you meet the mysterious warrior bass and his robotic dog treble odd how similar they are to mega man and rush isnt it
the rush coil and rush jet are back along with the new rush search rush digs in the ground for items but sometimes just pulls up junk the super adaptor which gives you a rocket punch attack and double jump
search hard enough and youll battle proto man the mysterious brother of mega man
defeat him and youll get a special item
pretty much any aspect of the nes mega man games is present here making this an awesome bit return to normalcy for the blue bomber
this is the best game in the mega man series despite a few flaws
if you have a super nintendo then do not be without this gamea mostown that that far surpasses perfection
it can not be wasted as it is a truly legendary gem from the good ol days
worth the price and to buy a snes forits about time i found a listing for this on amazon
ive been looking all over for this game
this is one of the best ones i played on the snes and i still like it todayin terms of graphics its very cartoony and the battles are done in dragon warrior style with some weird swirling color patterns in the background
the music in this game is pretty cool though it gets weird at times
but well this game is weird thats the whole point of itthe gameplay is much like the old dragon warrior style and a few old features like limited inventories have come into play
i personally dont like that but it certainly does add some challengeone of the best and most unique features of this game also is the battle system
first there are no random battles
you must run into an enemy in order to fight it
if the enemy is stronger than or equal to you it will come after you
if youre far stronger than they are or you have already beaten their area they will usually run away
also when you come into contact with an enemy the beginning of the battle is determined by how you met them
if they caught up with you from behind they get the first strike
if you caught them from behind you get the first strike
and if you met face to face its an equal start
one other feature of the battle system which i truly like is the ability to skip pointless battles
if you are far stronger than the enemy and they run into you you will automatically win without even going into a battle screen
that is an excellent feature and i dont know why it hasnt been implemented in other games
final fantasy certainly could use something like thatthis game is placed in modern times which is another thing that makes it unique
also it is purposely comic and i enjoy that a lot more than ffs dark gloomy overtones
i also like the interesting choice of weapons that the heroes use to fight bad guys
baseball bats frying pans 
 slingshots
this game is wacky and its not the least bit shy about thatunfortunately it came out at a time when people were saying quotif it didnt come from squaresoft it cant be any goodquot so as a result it was either overlooked or scorned
but this is actually a great game
if you can get your hands on it go for iti cant say enough about this game
it was an epic rpg that didnt take itself too seriously
the other day on the forums someone asked if they knew about an rpg like this one and i honestly could not come up with anything
this is truly a one of a kind game and i dont think well ever see another like it though i am praying for a current gen sequelbefore reviewing this be ready to visit your local import stores to get the japanese version of mother  earthbound for the snes and the original nes earthbound zero combined in one cartridge
its coming soonokay people i love this game
i just got it from my friend a year ago and i gotta say the game rules
i like the storylinethe graphics are the turndown
the characters are good and the scenery is swell too
the battles are what i dislike
you cant see your characters only the people you are fighting
the backgrounds are what help it survive they are animated colorful colors that swish and stuff to help make up for the factt the graphics are lacking
the monsters have seen better too i mean who wants to fight a taxi car or gas pump
its more like possessed objects and animalsi love the music
earthbound feautres the best of the best and lots of it
it really brings out the mood like in winters or the town of threed at night
it truly is the gem of the gamei also like the characters
ness doesnt talk but pokey sure does
hes like your rival and he always says random stuff
its funny at timesif you see this game youll want to get it
it isnt lufia ii or ff but its a great game to relax withok before you look at the price and have a heart attack let me ask you a couple questions do you love rpgs are you a fan of funny humor thats childish yet nice for adults to understand do you hate fat kids that brag in your face do you get scared easily are you boringif you are like me you should answer yes yes yes semiyes nobehold my favorite game so far earthboundstory i dont need a good story to play a game even if its cheesy ill still play it
this games story is a little thin though
basically a meteor crashes into the top of onett the town you live in and who else but a fat jerk named porky comes along and shows you off
after helping this incompetent idiot out by finding picky a small insect will tell you about giygas the embodiment of evil and the  melodies that you need to collect
when you do you will be strong enough to fight giygas and save the future from his clutchesgraphics warning
if you are a graphicshead n a word made up by me someone who cares about graphics and nothing else they will spend  on games that look good but all you do is walk around and after  minutes beat the game after your head blows up then youll want to find another game ill play donkey kong on atari  so i really dont care about graphics
to me theyre great but to others not so much
take a look at some pictures if you are actually concerned rolls eyesgameplay this is the meat of the game the thing i go after
in the words of aran ryan i love it
you choose your psi choose your action attack find weaknesses copy your opponent the list goes on and on
i cant describe you have to play it yourselfdifficulty this game is medium difficulty finding where to go can be a challenge and that monkey cave will make you go insane
the gameplay shouldnt be too difficult but beware that some people might not be able to make it past certain parts without grinding leveling up isnt that bad in this game
age range i recommend  because some people are frightened by the final boss giygas im not giygas is just a crazy loon and ive heard the theories
the puzzle solving might also be difficult for small childrentips ok this tip is for giygas form  at the end of the game
even though its tempting to take him down you should take the person hes paired with instead because giygas has a shield the person hes paired with i wont give away as it would be a spoiler
also in the monkey cave be sure to take the pencil eraser
you will need itconclusion the price seems like infinite fun for just a small price
overall stop reading this weird review and pick up the game nowedit yeah i made a lot of grammatical mistakes and errors stupid young kids d but i fixed them
btw its still my favorite gamenot to say that earthbound is a bad game i dont think it is by any means  however lets think about a few things is the game replayable yes and no
yes because you could have missed something or maybe for you no because the game was kind of silly in the first place
dialogue game play interesting game play mechanics and  strange story is what makes this game
is this game worth  bucks with no manual or anything
that depends would you could you ever play an rpg more than once also if you buy the game most big time gamers will give you decent money to buy it from you after you beat it
so honestly its hard not to play the game or own it when the game is so well recycled and is a pretty fun experience
if you havent played it consider trying it you can always sell it to one of your gaming buddies after you beat iti first played this about  years ago  on the snes super nintendo and i absolutely loved itits an rpg
instead of swords and magic spells you use yoyos and psychic powersthe gameplay is nothing newmusic is memorableawesomewriting is the best part
its sometimes sarcastic dry funny most of the time and it really pulls you into the storyoverall this game is in my top  games ever
i highly recommend you play it either buy it or find it online do whatever it takes
play this gametotal time to play is about  hours kinda short but this is snes rmemeber earthbound snes is the best game everechoechoecho if youre an rpg fan and even if you arent one then i recommend that you go out and get this game right now
i know its hard to find and expensive but trust me its worth it
if you have alot of trouble finding it then you can probably find it on a boot disk for dreamcast or something
one cool thing about this game is that in the beginning you can customize the names of everyone in your party your favorite hobby favorite food and more
the game starts out in onett which is your hometown and a meteor has just crashed close by your house
after investigating it you travel from town to town trying to figure out whats up with the meteor and such while doing sidequests in each town
there is a wide range of environments that you travel to
from hot deserts to snowy forests to very large cities
the graphics are d but what do you expect from a snes game
theyre simple but still good
but hey graphics arent everything
the sound is very well done also with catchy beats to go with each town that fit the mood just right
overall this is one of the best rpgs that i have ever played and i think that you should go and get it nowthis game is a must buy for snes
if you love rpgs get this game
it is well worth the price
the game takes place in a town called a onett
this small rural town is the place where an asteroid hits
once this happens ness the main character finds a small bug from the future in the asteriod
the bug said the he is destined to destroy the evil gigyas the root of all evilnesss adventure is filled with monsters and people to join you
along with paula jeff and poo
the game is filled with fun suprises that will keep you wanting to more
will gigyas take over the earth or not
you decideearthbound is easily my favorite game
but lets get of my life story and talk about why this game is so underrated
earthbound is underrated because it was released in the time when chrono trigger secret of mana and final fantasy iii the three kings of the snes rpgs and when it released rpg gamers just whiffed earthbound off like that thus nintendo lost a lot of money due to low sales on the game making hard to find like harvest moon and mario rpg
now thats the history part of the review
now lets hear why this is my favorite game
first of the controls are simple and you pick them up really fast the battle system seems similar to dragon warrior and xenosaga the graphics pretty good but theyre no ff the sound effects are kinda forgetable but the music is amazing and something youll remember for a long time my favorite is the hippie battle music for an rpg it has a high replay value
earthbound is one of the best rpgs ive ever played next to chrono triggerxenosagaearthbound zero and final fantasy xand its my favorite game
id give it a  out of this game is sweet there is so much to do so much to see theres a lot of cool places to go my personal favorite village is summers
it has the biggest over world map in the snes library and it has a mysterious final boss that turns into a fetus weird huh buy it if you can if you cant save your money dont be distracted by any other games get thisi own this one
have not worn out my scratch and sniffs yet
a must for collector of snes cartswarning spoilers included in this reviewi feel as though i should offer something of an explanation as to my decision to wax philosophical on a title that is as old honored and tested as earthbound
granted retroreviews are indeed all the rage but i cannot say that i have been moved to ever actually commit to a writeup on one before
there are certainly other games that as an experience are by far more readily cited as an example of technical or artistic meritthats the issue though earthbound is not so much a technical achievement or artistic triumph as it is an experience a part of one mans life story told in a surreal third person
shigesato itoi earthbounds creator undertook a profoundly personal journey choosing to tell the tale of childhood utilizing his most familiar medium  game design
the result was a journey so profound that those with even the most tenuous grasp of childhood emotions sensations and innocent awe could not help but walk away without feeling its effectsfor a game with the original title of mother  perhaps this childish world view is simply par for the course
in earthbound the world is on the brink of ruin giygas an alien entity has grown strong thanks to the darkness of the world
its corruption hatred greed violence and depravity eventually allow him to grow powerful and conquer the world
a sentient bee named buzz buzz a resistance fighter of a distant future travels back in time to our present to find a young boy who was said to have the power to defeat giygas before the aliens strength becomes insurmountablethat young boy is ness an average kid from onett who lives with his mother sister and dog
nesss father while constantly away on business can be reached by phone and provides pithy guidance to his son and maintains his savings account
the implications regarding absentee fathers are hardly understated in earthbound but seek to offer a comforting picture of positive maturity to children
fathers are important the game tells us but so much that their presence  or lack thereof  need not define your identity or sense of selfworth
you travel throughout the world battling all manner of whimsical and sometimes downright terrifying foes who have been corrupted by giygass allpervading influence
the player will meet friends who share their goal and eventually they will overcome many obstacles and face off against giygas himitself
however even this final confrontation is hardly the overwrought clicheacute that one might assumein fact the battle is one of video gamedoms most famous and with good reason
what makes the final battle with giygas so amazing so profound is its summation of the childhood journey
while we are given some details of giygas in mother there is very little that we know about him especially regarding his metamorphosis into the embodiment of evil fear and hatred
what is giygas
even in his mindless state of complete hatred he seems lost hurtlike a child calling out for his motherperhaps if we look at itois inspiration for the final confrontation with the end of all things we can gain an appreciation for his conception of innocence and indeed the gray that lies between the black and white absolutes of established morality
this is no mere quest to topple the villain but an examination of the journey itself which is captured on numerous occasions by an itinerant photographer to remind you of your travels and experiences with friends
at games end it feels almost like a scrapbook and one cannot but help and reflect on their childhood adventures as wellearthbound is a tremendous game and an even greater examination of the creators own worldview
in that it is impossible not to see something of ourselves in the game of our own years of innocent wonder those that led inexorably to maturation and knowledge
to top it all off it is also a solid rpg though some might find its mechanics to be dated by modern standards
others will find comfort in its oldschool charm and use it as it was intended  as a vehicle through one of the greatest narratives not only in gaming but modern mediathis game is amazing
near perfect
next to chrono trigger this is probably the best rpg on the snes
the graphics are unique the world is very imaginative and the cast of characters really make you care about themthe nintendo av cable works great and came at time
i give this review ps the av cable works great with my super nintendo systemmy daughter had to replace it for the one she had before  for her nintendo game cube console and it is very good and useful cableseriously its a cord
one end goes in the tv the other in the gamecube it works and that is all a cord really needs to do
so if you need one then buy itwhy not lets go off the xanax with this one for gits and shiggles heythis cord is amazing
it offers the new technology of the ages allowing attachment to the superior rca format of connector
the striking contrast of the life giving blood red  yellow that could only be defined as having the delicasy and creaminess of egg yolk and the absence of life defining white provide a true striking contrast that only the worlds finest artisans could possibly hope to create
the black hole darkness of the length of the cord is wrapped in only the finest rubber by the hands of the wonderful  year old children who operate the machines
truly a work of art by any standards of such  this cord is to be purchased and displayed in a place of honor in a room of your house were only treasured guests are allowed passage
there are rumors this has been hung in the private halls and studies of royalty
it has even been whispered that kim jong un has the largest collection in the world in a salt mine guarded by the norths finest military force  hand picked by him
i think this says it allworks fantastic on every nintendo console ive used them on including snes n and gamecube
the picture is vibrant and ive had no interference issues as ive had with other cablesfor cereal they totaly work and its like my nintendo can turn on and i can see it and junki compared these wires to the original coaxical wire and the picture is clearer and the fuzz disappears
good buyit does exactly what i need it to do
now off to find a converter and power cable ii this product was great
instead of flipping your tv around all the time just plug this into the back of the tv and the cables in the av spots and your ready to rock and roll
i love my snes and have extension chords and everything else for it
this av cable is great and hasnt had any prolemsthis is a very relyable cable
i am glad that i have bought it for the kind of price that i didgot a used gamecube but it didnt have this cable
got a great deal and looked real quick to see if could get cable from amazon
love the ease of it allmy roommate got an old n and a bunch of games at a yard salethe guy at the yard sale said all we were missing was the av cable
so we ordered this and it works perfectlynow were playing mario kart like its  all over againlove itit amazes me how these old wires for these old systems seem to never break along with the system but these new game console are suppose to be so advanced but yet they break for no apparent reasoni bought this item for the super nintendo and it works as it should
no problems with it what so everyou dont want to use the rf adapter on your hdtv so this cable works perfect and will work nintendo av for those lucky who own one snes famicom av super famicom n gamecubei bought a couple of these to always have handywell i have to say something about these and all i can think of is that if you have a super nintendo then you need thesegreat nintendo av cable package works like a charm theirs never any problems with it works like a new diviceits cheap and it works great
i was looking to get some old classic nintendo systems and this helps out a little given the prices of the consoles themselvesthis is a great av cable to work with your gamecube n or super nintendo
if you lost your av cable then this is what you neednintendos first party gear is usually high quality stuff and their snes controllers are no exception
although years of use and abuse has shown that they arent as bulletproof as a genesis controller theyre still the one and only gamepad youll ever need for your super nintendo experienceive tried using other controllers and unless you need a turbo or rapidfire switch this is what you needi have owned my snes for over  years now since the year it was released
with the system i also got super mario world and this controller
it has a great design and fits comfortabley in any sized hand
my controller has worked ever since the day i bought it
its never had a glitch in it
all the buttons still work and it doesnt show any wear and tear
if you need a controller for your super nintendo this is the one you should get
avoid super pads they break too oftenthis controller is especially good for people who have small hands
the controller is small so it fits well in a small hand
the controller works very easily and it is very easy to get used to
i highly recommend this controller if you have small hands
if you have large hands id go with a larger controllersettle for no other that is unless you can get your hands on the japanese famicom controllers with the minor difference of colored a b x and y buttons drool
ive played video games since i was  in that wonderful time of the death and resurrection of video gamesummmmgrandstanding aside its also known as the s
anyways in all the years that ive played ive never found a controller for any system that could take as much punishment as this one besides the original nes controller
ive taken both this and the nes controller apart to examine the parts and the adamantiumlike plastic casing i even did some tests with a hammer among other things if only the controllers of other consoles still retained such quality
i played tecmo super bowl with my elder brother all the time so destruction of peripherals was a natural action when i wasnt playing fighting games or rpgs that is see my other reviewsthat was a shameless plant i know
i could throw it like a boomerang at a wall and it would stay together without any rattles to be heard
no i wasnt playing zelda when i threw it like that but that would have made a good pun wouldnt it
xd bare with my bad humorits late and im out of mountain dewon a closing note just make sure that when you find one used or whatever way you get your hands on this classic that you give it a good cleaning with a game wipe and then beat the snot out of the buttons on a good fighting game or two first to really break it in if it hasnt been used in a long timenow i can finally play two player games on my snes
always worried about getting a knockoff brand when i find a cheap retro gaming accessory but this is the legitimate real deal nintendo brand controller
all the buttons work perfectly and the cord is flawless
fast shipping great quality
thanks a bunchthe official snes controller is one of the best ever
the button layout is perfect for any type of game
the controller easily fits into any size hands
they are super durable
the dpad is very comfortable and easy to use
heck the start and select buttons are even easy to reach
this controller is absolutely perfect and a must have for your snes system
make sure you buy two of them so you can play with your friendsoh and one more thing make sure you get the real nintendo made controller
dont buy those cheaper quotnewquot third party look a like controllers
they stinkits a super nintendo controller
you play super nintendo with it
this will allow you to play all of the great games that were made for the snesenjoyid like to say that i am extremely happy that i have a brand new authentic snes controller in my hands
i just thought it was too good to be true to get it despite that the fact that they were like hundreds of dollars for a brand new one
and until i saw one for only  new
thats right new just by buying this i saved over hundreds of dollars of buying a new one
i bought it because i wanted a collectors item so that i can display it in my room
i will never use it or take out the controller cause i want it to stay new and fresh till the day i die
lolthat and i already have a controller thats the sns and sns so yeah no need to take it out
and im also happy that it looks just like the one on the picture
only thing is that i just wish it could of been shrink wrapped but doesnt matter
as long as its new and smells new ill take it
i think i might buy another to wrap it as a gift for my brother in law
all thanks to gamegiantonline it made my dream a reality i never liked those extra feature controllers out there
keep it simple and enjoy the game
you are not flying a jet in real life you knowthis is the standard controller made by nintendo for the super nintendo entertainment system snes
this was the first controller made by a video game system manufacturing company nintendo amp sega at the time to have buttons on the sides of the controller where you usually put your index fingers the l and r buttonsnot much to say about a video game controller manufactured by the company that made the system in which the controller is used for
but i can say this  you are going to need some if you want to play video games for the snes and if you do not trust off brand productsvideo game controllers would not be the same without the snes controllers unique mark on history
just as the nes controller had mare the crossshaped dpad standard so did the snes make four face buttons and two shoulder buttons standard
i cant think of a controller on the market today other than nintendos own wii controller oddly enough that doesnt incorporate these
when a controller is this good it honestly doesnt need much changegot this as a second controller for my snes and works just as good as the controller both authentic i got with my snesive owned my good old super nintendo for almost four years now and if youve seen any of my reviews you know i love the system
in fact i own  games for it but i want to expand and get more games because i have three more cases to fill
the system has some of the best games ever like chrono trigger super castlevania iv final fantasy iv vi and mystic quest super metroid contra iii two super mario world titles super mario rpg mario kart the first good licensed games like aladdin alien  and the terminator games cybernator bob axelay gradius iii breath of fire i and ii secret of mana starfox doom street fighter ii mortal kombat and so many other amazing games await you if you play this game console and you have the right games
i absolutely love this system and would not trade it for anything because it is so awesome and it never gets old to play
the only flaws are the bad bad games like ultraman an incredibly broken piece of vile garbage
luckily you will rarely encounter these terrible games because there are not very many of them
if you love retro consoles the super nintendo is a  musthave especially for its classic gamesi got this when i was in rd grade new and sealed with super mario world seperately
for some reason my controller was diffrent from all my friends as it had multicolored buttons on teh controller and a lighter tone of white
i have yet to see another controller alike it
it makes me wonder if i got a special edition version
i know nintendo makes it as it has the logo
anyways super mario world and super mario all stars are the greater games
and super mario rpg was one of the first d games ever made
easy to use left purple bar on console is power right is reset you pull down or up on bar to turn on or off or to resetthe super nes is the best video game system by nintendo bar none
while it had a slower processor than the sega genesis in which case future games had fx chips to enhance the games it had better graphics and sound quality
why is this system among the best
obviously the games are what count
no matter how advanced nintendo gets the super nes has the most of the best video games ever made by anyoneheres a list of some of the classics super castlevania iv contra iii the super mario series super turrican a rare and often overlooked gem super metroid final fantasy ii final fantasy iii tales of phantasia the mega man x series un squadron zelda a link to the past breath of fire i and ii chrono trigger secret of mana starfox super mario kart the donkey kong country series super mario rpg street fighter ii probably the best one to get is turbo but super street fighter ii is also worthy series ninja gaiden trilogy which is basically ninja gaidens  from the nes system ninja turtles iv turtles in time and rockman and forte aka
megaman and bass
there are plenty more that are also worthy classics but i thought id mention these above to get you started although tales of phantasia and rockman and forte would be hard to get considering theyre only available in japan for the super nes
so dont vote no because i forgot one gameis this the best system
maybe thats not true but those times were the best the rivalry between nintendos super nes and the sega genesis was considerable
both had extremely enthralling games that were of great quality nintendo had mega man and mario sega had sonic and vectorman
so depending on your preference you might want one or the other
as far as im concerned both are a musthave
the days of genesis vs super nes are the best in video gaming history
i say this as a true gamer those were the good ol daysi bought mine at a yard sale with starfox and sure the system is great but it will get boring if u only have  game
there are other great games that i am looking for
if you are going to get one look for a place where they sell games for it at a veru cheap price
if u get bored after u bought one i recommend the nintendo  or the nintendo dsworks great and as intended
it does everything that it intends too and i couldnt ask for more
good buyi love this system
i have played it for years
mine finally went out so i ordered another one
as always snes rocksnow unlike before you can choose between different snes players i personally recommend the snes over all them however
for one thing the snes you know it will be compatible with all snes hardware the super scope arcade controller and so on
secondly although a factor more in the nes knock off the sound will be perfect as well
solid construction made in japan and who is known for making quality top of the line products most knock off brands made in korea known for lesser quality products
lastly if you want to play imports in the usa they offer a convertor that plays the games well
in fact the import snes i have plays the games worse and thats  bit than my snes does
go snes for super nintendo gaming you wont regret iti had a super nintendo when it first came out and it was a fantastic system
ive gone through all of the consoles up to the wii and psi bought a wii and realized the games were for  year olds or families so i sent it backthen had a ps and noticed it was mostly first person shooter games which gets old very soon
plus feeling like im a captive of the great sony corp with them checking for upgrades and also the games are  a piece is stupid
i returned thatso i kept my ps which i like but i started looking into retro players and remembered the fun i had on super nintendo so i looked for one and got one in new condition for  bucks
all of the games are only around  bucks at the most
the games were fun back then and the emphasis was not on frame rate or dpi it was on challenge and fun
ive bought mario all stars metroid donkey kong country donkey kong country  lost vikings to start and those totaled up to the price of a ps game
one thing that is a must if you have a hdtv player is to get a svideo cable
another thing i bought is nex gen wireless controllers for the snes but make sure they are made for the snes not their the nex gen consolei love my new old snes and feel this is one of the best buying decisions ive made to datedurable and reliable as all hell great games still fun today and just a totally awesome system
this system alone killed segai read an article that named the sega dreamcast the best system of all time hmmmm i have that system too i have the atari   nes genesis and so on and so forth how do you define a system
there is only one way the games
this system had the best and most fun games probably to date only reason why i dont really play this system anymore is bc ive played it so much already when i bought my ps all i did was still play my snes  i bought this on amazon bc my original broke and they cant be fixed or really arent worth fixing
i dont know the games were just so much fun and entertaining on this system starting with all the originals such as super mario world pilotwings zelda original super mario kart then castelvania iv maybe it was just the types of games i have forever loved unbeatable system for sure
im sure this posting will stir up the pot too dont comment if you love ps   or beyond ps had  games and  were lousy and the stupid controller that feels how hard you press the buttons you can have it
the system and all its gamesthis was my first system ever and is still my favorite
it has tons of  great games mega man x mmx mmx mm super mario world smw yoshis island super metroid chrono trigger final fantasy ii  iii donkey kong country dkc dkc zelda starfox super mario rpg earthbound and many many many many more
anybody who gives this a negative review worships satansnes foreverfavorite retro system
lots of great games and lucked out with not getting a stained unit
i would recommend this to anyonebest system for d sidescrolling games though you can now get a lot of the games through wii or wii u so be sure to look there first assuming you have a classic controller for one of nintendos new consolescall me a nostalgic fool but i still think the snes era produced the best videogames of all time
super mario world was the pinnacle of platform games street fighter ii is still considered by many to be the best fighting game of all time in at least one of its bazillion incarnations and console rpgs really came into their own with final fantasy ii amp iii which to this day are still my two favorite games
a lot of what made games fun has been lost in the move to sometimes overlycomplex d games and anyone who values gameplay over graphics should own a snesit is a great product great for my collection still need to buy more and more games so i can be a true collectornintendo had a of success with its bit system the nintendo but sega decided to release the bit genesis system that blew away any other system
so nintendo decided to make the super nintendo to compete with it
it was a great successup until the release of the ps in  the super nintendo was the top system on the market
with the biggest variety of games the snes was well ahead of its competitionthe snes has great sound graphics and great games
nintendo also made a great controller for the super nintendo
just like the nes it has a dpad to move around with a b x and y  buttons to use for certain controls in different games and a start and select button used to start pause the game but they added the l and r buttons on the top of the controller and made the controller more rounded and much more comfortablethe games for the super nintendo are great
super mario world and donkey kong country top the lists as nintendos best games ever made but there are other great games too
there are great rpg games including final fantasy iii and the legend of zelda great adventure games super mario world yoshis island super mario allstars the donkey kong series and earthbound great racing titles super mario kart and fzero and great fighting games mortal kombat and street fighterif you own a snes or are interested in getting one you should get some of the games i listed above which are some of the best snes games of all time but there are hundreds of other games availablethe snes has provided years of fun and entertainment for me and has never let me down
i recommend that you check out one of the best systems of all time
go out and buy a super nintendo and some great games while they are still availablehere is another classic from my childhood well i was in my teens when i first got one
anyhow i still have my original even the adapter for it a neighbor fixed due to a incident our bunny done to it
this had some pretty good games for it such as zelda a link to the past super mario world super punch outlagoon final fantasy iisuper mario all stars i see lot of folks on youtube who also share their consoles and what impresses me the most is when younger folks pick consoles like this up and acknowledge you know what theres be no call of duty no halo without these older consoles that got the ball rolling first
i love my consoles and continue to collect and rebuy some i had or ones i naver did have but this one is one of my originals stll in tact and in good shape i bring it and play it so often specially that mario all stars thats my fave right there 
i recommend this to newer gamers of today wondering how it got to be so cool and this far with the d worlds and beautiful renderings of today if you want to see how capture the past and find one of these on ebay or here in marketplace and enjoy one of the top and best consoles ever made
or if you never had one buy one ore if yours broke rebuy there good to have all consoles and  such
gives variety 
great for in the winter when its gloomy and dreary and boring and theres nothing to do but play video games this console system here had some the best rpg titles just for those occassionsa friend and myself were talking about games and systems the other day when i happened to bring up old nintendo systemshe mentioned that he had an old snes system and a bunch of games that were sitting in his closet so we negotiated a pricewe agreed at 
this was my first nintendo system
i also have a psone dreamcast genesis and recently bought an n not too long after the snes
maybe down  the line i may get a gamecube
i set up the snes and played super mario world and i was hooked
sure the graphics are antiquated but who cares
thats what makes these old classics so lovable and great
i also have wolverine nba jam and many others
i went to a flea market this weekend and happend to come across space invaders and also bought wolfenstein d a very hard to find classic
i am also looking for metriod and mega man but they also seem to be hard to find
anyway i am so glad i was able to score a snes because soon they will become rare as welli consider the snes to be by far the best nintendo gaming system to ever be made
none of the other gaming systems even come close to comparing to the snes
the super nintendo has a ton of games that go with it and are quite fun to play as well
also you dont need any addons to play any of the games like some of the other nintendo systems need
it is easy to play and the graphics are quite nice for the age of the system
it is also very easy to operate
the only problems that ive ever had with my super nintendo is that the games sometimes wont load when i played it but this is easily fixed by blowing out the cartridge to clear any dust out of itive been out of the gaming scene for a few years nowand i want back in
what to choseps or xbox 
well sh ill never be satisfied because neither will ever compare to this great system
this is what i grew up on and loved for so many years
great games reliable just  in every aspect
why cant they do it like this anymore
seems like every medium of entertainment has just gone to hell in the s
movies music videogameswtfoverall this is the best console everdozens of great gamesonly thing lacking is sports where some are better on the sega genesislets face it this is one of the greatest systems every built with some memorable exclusive games like super metroid zelda a link to the past super mario world donkey kong country  yoshis island and so on
this was many nights and weekends of fun in the s
the sound was excellent the controllers had a dpad  shoulder buttons  face buttons start and select
it was awesome
most of the games have been ported over to game boy advance or the wii virtual console so you dont need this grey box to play those old games
but there are other consoles that play super nintendo games
i kid you not the hyperkon retron will play super nintendo cartridgesi love the older gaming systems
their graphics are not that great but they are still awesome to play
i recommend them to everyonei remember getting one for my th birthday
i played it non stop because it was so addictive the games i had for it when i got it  years ago was kirby superstar  tetris attack
i also enjoyed other games such as street fighter ii super mario world donkey kong country  mega man x along with fire power the product was accurate in adequate shape and delivery date was as welli give this user and its dependability i would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others due to fairness in pricing and integrityall gamers want out of a video game these days is graphics and half naked women
but if they would look at the days before graphics was made part of the rating system for whether a video game was good or not theyd see the good days
the days when mega man didnt have to be remade in d just to make it on a ps
the days when if youre game was fun thats what it boiled down to
if youre game had graphics thats even better but what you looked at in the days of snes was the fun factor
yep
this is the greatest gaming hardware ever made
its got some of the greatest games in historymega man xx super mario rpg starfox and super mario world its got a great life spanive had it since  and ive never stopped using it and the  bit graphics give it the nostalgic feeling that says you want something you can play in  dimensions
kiss my 
yepsnes
good stuff
find some way to get your hands on this thing its easily the greatest console ever madei remember it wellthe year was  and i had rented this system along with super mario worldf zero and super r typei can remember how excited i was playing nintendos brand newat the timesystem
it looked betterplayed better and sounded better than the standard  bit nes and many of the super nes games were very creative with great innovative gameplay
compared to the sega genesis and necs turbo grafx  the super nintendo had better graphic capabilities and if i remember correctly it was the first system that had audio cables that could be hooked up to a stereo instead of just a tvgraphics and sound aside the super nintendo was a superior system because it had several great gamesmany of which are still referred to as some of the best video games ever madethere were many great games from different genresfighting games such as street fighter  and mortal kombat racing games such as f zero and super mario kart platform games like super mario all stars super mario world and super mario world  yoshis island puzzle games such as tetris attackrole playing games like final fantasy  and action adventure games such as teenage mutant ninja turtles iv and the great zelda game a link to the pastthe games were what made the system greatthe controllers were also new and innovative for their timethey had more buttons than sega genesis and turbo grafx if you dont already have a super nes i suggest you go out and buy one
it really was one of the best systems of all timewell my brother owned a snes and i had a sega genesis when we were kids so i gamed quite a bit with the snes i played super mario world mario all stars zelda link to the past personally i think link to the past was the best zelda game out of all of theme
nba jam the only basketball game i like
ken griffey mlb a unrealistic baseball game but really fun and stupid
i also had some power rangers game when i was  or  street fighter  turbo was a pretty cool port but i wanted a snes last year but couldnt get one i got an fc system and have games such as killer instinct and alien vs predator and have a few of the old games left and love  bit games
this was the sega genesis competitor and competition is good why because  now  companies trying to give you the best product
so snes gave great memberable games
other games were donkey kong  contra iii i recently picked that up theres a lot of great games for snes get one or an fc system you will like snes games if you missed outit has been over  years since the super nintendo entertainment system snes has been released and after all this time one thing is for sure it is one of the most popular and beloved gaming systems on the planet having sold over  million units worldwide
with its simple and timeless operation the snes collected some of the greatest and most classic video games of all time such as the super mario bros franchise donkey kong country the legend of zelda a link to the past super metroid street fighter ii and many many morethis gaming console is exactly that a gaming console
it does nothing else but run bit game cartridges and is not backwards compatible with with the original nintendo entertainment system nes games
like the machine the controller is very simply designed sometimes feeling a bit small but overall working perfectly with the games it was designed for
there is no hd hookup or any kid of special audio connections what you see is what you get
its extremely easy to set up and there are no loading times
if you were a kid of my generation born s it was all about the snes
the fact that people still play these games when there are so many more options these days is a testament to its longevitythis console was in great shape and works perfectly
we had a lot of games so its nice to be able to revisit them againtrue its gameplay before good graphics came along but this console is worth it mainly for four games the legend of zelda a link to the past the lion king yoshis island and donkey kong country
also try the mario games if you are a fan of mario
this system is very durable i have had it for over  years and mine is still in perfect working condition
even though i now have a ps n gamecube gameboy and gba i still love the old school snes
every gamer needs onei normally shop at gameover video games in houston
tx so far with them i had to return  games that did not work now with that said retro games i had no issues everything was nice and clean they even hook me up with a free magnet with purchase i will always shop from them for now with every retro gamegraphics
the one thing that plagues the idiot youths of today
that is all they care about so they go out and buy an xbox which has about  semidecent games on it
the super nintendo has the greatest games anyone could ask for such as secret of mana chrono trigger mega man x and x final fantasy  and the best game of all time final fantasy  these games are really fun and you can play and replay them all the time over and over again as i have for about  or  yearsunlike the regular nes this system actually plays everytime you turn it on
no more irritation of constant turning power off blowing on the cartridge and turning the power on repeatedly
a grand repair of past flaws on consolesi really recommend you start the final fantasy legend on this great console starting with final fantasy  then work your way up to the greatest game final fantasy  then get the semirpg classic secret of mana
after beating these classics get mega man x and mega man x
legend of zelda a link to the past is a very wise choice also
even after that yes there are that many great games out there for this system get chrono trigger another classic rpg out there
other really good choices are earthbound contra  and king of dragonsi recommend you save your money and instead of buying that stupid worthless xbox you buy something worthwhile like the super nes
just dont forgetget final fantasy this system was awesome back in the day
yes sega had better graphics and the controls where basicaly the same but the snes had the better games
if you want some old school action you need this system you can buy most of the games for snes on gameboy advance now but its more fun on the snesno problems with it so far it works great and my family is enjoying it
i am very happy with this buythe super nes is an instant classicits one of the best video game systems ever madeeven todayits a very hardy system and it has no technical issueslike all old systems you still have to blow on the cartridges once or twice to get them to workthe controller is one of the bestit fits into your hand perfectlycartridges are easy to ejectit has great games for it like super metroid super mario brothers ogre battle zelda the super star wars series super conflict super rtype killer instinct dd eye of the beholderthe super nes has games for all ages and its very affordablebuy one while you still canthere is a reason why this system still sells for 
some of the best games ever made are only available on snes
this is one of the systems that stay continually connected to my tv set and i play it still
if you like gameboy advance and love the graphics you will appreciate snes
some of my fondest memories are from the bit days when games were simpler and shorter and you could play for countless hours and not be bored to tears by an underwhelming overcomplex story that spans  hours and by the time you finish you never want to play it again even though you enjoyed it because it is too long
that doesnt mean there are no lengthy games
this system rulesafter sega unleashed the bit genesis nintendo was at a crossroads because their classic bit nintendo system was dying out
so nintendo makes their own bit system but used a much better graphics and sound chip than the genesis had and remained the top system until sonys playstation came out in   what made the super nes kick so much was its outstanding library of games
the first party titles were out of this world not to mention the system also had some of the best rpgs to date on any system
all in all if you can find a super nes anywhere i highly recommend buying one its a piece of video game history and nintendo has not been able to make a better system yet
below is a list of games that are also recommended to get along with the system for the best playing experiencesuper metroidsuper mario worldyoshis islandsuper mario kartfinal fantasy legend of zelda a link to the pastcontra super mario allstarsstreet fighter  turbotetris attackdonkey kong countryearthboundchronotriggersuper mario rpgthis is the system  that got me hooked on nintendoi have a nes gamecube n and im sure the revoloution will be at my house when that system arrives the super nes had all of the best games  from the  contra series to super metroid to my personal favorites  the super star wars series  and  so much more
i even have imports for this system  grab this system if you canits easy to find  this system still holds up today rather wellquite possibly the greatest console ever made by nintendo  the super nintendo snes has the most expansive game libraries to date
the games on the snes are legendary and many today are still considered to be some of the greatest ever madefun fact nintendo and sony were once partners during the super nintendo era and planned to release a new nintendo console that would use disk based games instead of cartridges
however due to licensing disagreements with sony nintendo later announced that it had formed an alliance with sonys rival philips to produce the snescd addon
sony would eventually go on to create the playstation read belowearthboundchronotriggerfinal fantasy final fantasy super mario rpg legend of the seven starsarguably some of the best rpgs of all timedonkey kong countryall of themsuper metroidsuper mario worldmega man xsuper mario world  yoshis islandthe best side scrollers of alltime

most of these games have some of the best video game soundtracks of all time still look great  years later  and give you absolute control of the hero or heroine
these games are also incredibly fun and in the end thats all we as gamers would ever want from a systemi love this game system
its very fun and perfect for a video game newbie or someone who is bad at games
if you get this system get super mario world before you get any other gameive had a super nintendo ever since i was  years old
i still have it hooked up and i play it every once in a while
i have a lot of classic games like super mario bros and donkey kong
if you want old school fun youll love a super nintendo nes systemthe super nintendo snes is a classic game system
it is a  bit console with great graphicscolorsand of course gameplay
this system has an expansive library of games much like its  bit rival the sega genesis
if you are a collector of games  systems
or a serious gamer like myselfi imagine you already have this in your home
if not you should really get this system and enjoy it with many classic games
the snes and its predecessor nes are both true classics
the snes games i recommend to get started with aresuper mario worldfzeromortal kombat  and zombies ate my neighborsboogermanfinal fightteenage mutant ninja turtlesstreet fighter  seriesearthworm jim   mario kartlegend of zeldasuper punchoutnba jamnba jam tournament editionsamurai showdownsuper rtypewwf royal rumblestar foxxmenmaximum carnagei still have my super nintendo although i dont play it that much cause they dont make anymore new games for the system
when i bought it a lonf time ago i thought the tapes would never miss up at all when you first try to put it in but sometimes it does not as much as regular nintendo
super nintendo was the start of games with great graphics people in mortal kombat wear looking almost real it was the first game to be lable rated m cause it had blood and gore
donkey kong had great d graphics and back ground music
what i like about super nes is you stick the tapes on top of the game system that was cool the joy sticks had more buttons including two on topi just love my supernintendo console
my son gave it to me when nintendo came out
i have enjoyed playing a lot of games on this console for many years now
great productif you thought the nes was nintendos major big shot think again
the super nintendo triumphed over its previous system with bit graphics and its thennew mode  technology in which it performs glorious fake dthe game library is just as huge as the ness librarythe snes also had its fair share of peripherals most notably the snes mouse and the super scopewhile the nes lasted from  to  the snes went on from  all the way to  and yet it still remains to be a popular system
it is that awesomegotta love super nintendo still a classic i love this device works like brand new for a really old video game devicei have never played another video game console like the snes
i upgraded from the nes then upgraded to the n then downgraded back down to the snes
ive played the wii and the ds too
nothing whatsoever comes close
for those of you that remember this old system if you dont have one anymore get one
for those of you that may be too young to have gotten into the snes do it
you will not regret downgrading to the snesanyone who was around in the nes days knows how fun those games were
nearly anyone around for the super nintendo generation will without a doubt call it the greatest system of the gaming worldwhile many have updated to the ps gcn and xbox the snes is still strong even to this day
the games are classics and actually led to a lot of successful games found on the psx and ps and dont depend so heavily on eyecandy and if you can believe it psx games like chrono cross and final fantasy vii made people want an snes even more so we could play chrono trigger and final fantasy iiiviso what makes the snes so strong in not only nintendos franchise but in gaming in general
well to start off the controller is by far the most comfortable of any game system ever
the controller has lead to other controllers that have copied the design the psxps controller is almost an exact duplicatesecond is these games are incredible
the snes has some of the greatest games of any series
several ff fans call ffvi the best one several zelda fans call link to the past the best one several mario fans call super mario rpg the best one
not to mention weve had lots of gaming goodness
the donkey kong trilogy secret of mana contra iii the mega man x series debuted here as well
the super nintendo set the standard for gaming as we know it
how many of us were blown away by donkey kong country when it was released
a whole lot of us were
compare the amazement dkc gave off to what dk gave offseveral different genres the snes provides great actionadventure rpgs puzzles and more
the snes even has educational games
its the perfect family consolebut there are a few problems
the first one being the system is out of date and its actually harder to find now
but you can get it at a cheap price usually ranging from  to  bucksthe second con issome of the games that are really popular are sold for outrageous prices
go to ebay and type in chrono trigger and youll see that go for as much as  dollars
other games that are really popular have been released on the gameboy advance such as the legend of zelda a link to the past and donkey kong country
so while the games are great some youll have to be willing to pay a lot for others are rereleased and cant rekindle the magic of the originalthe goodstill strong after all these years
thanks to the gba many remember what a gem the snes wasfantastic games
super metroid legend of zelda a link to the past chrono trigger secret of mana mega man x series dkc trilogy and the list goes on and onbest controllerquite a durable systemive had mine for  years and it still looks brand neweasy to work and games are easy to play and get into
none of that hightec mumbo jumbo the games are going into todaythe badsystem is outdatedthe best classics mega man x chrono trigger secret of mana super mario rpg come at very high priceseven usedlets face it
nintendo is not the strong company that they used to be
with the awful launch of the ds not being able to get people excited about the new wiiu although i am very excited and stupid people who compare a dsi to an xbox  no lie nintendo is not doing so well
i do not know what happened
all i know is that i freak out and practically hug this console every time another game gets trashed
this machine is perfect
everything about it brings me joy
the games are magic
every time i am upset i just pop in a cartridge and forget about everything
each game is unique
i dont know how i can be playing a photorealistic game about monkeys trying to save their banana hoard and then end up changing cartridges to being in a resistence group in a darker fantasy adventure where magic and technology are colliding
after a little bit i am running through a haunted castle using a whip to hang on hooks just like spiderman
i later find myself crashing an airplane and getting yelled at by a flight instructor
all of the games are so different yet they all did one thing in common
they put the super nintendos limited hardware to its limits and creativity to a maximum
no other system has ever done that
playstation  and gamecube came close
with modern systems like the xbox  and playstation  you know that they can do pretty much anything but with the super nintendo surprises come when least expected
in the legend of zelda a link to the past link is wanted because the bad guy claimed he kidnapped the princess
so i am walking through a town and i talk to a lady
she screams for guards and they come on the screen and attack me
it shocked me because i had under estimated the super nintendo
in a modern xbox rpg we expect the people to yell for help if they see a wanted man but was that possible on a bit processor
i played final fantasy  and was blown away
the plot was dark with huge twists
of course i would expect that in an xbox  game but on a console released in the early s
some games were overlooked
ballz d who would play something titled that was a full d fighting game that never took off
the super nintendo has a lot of games to discover
i do not recommend it
i insist that you buy it
do not buy your kids another expensive console where cliche games are rushed out with almost no love in them
buy this
the games are simply pure magic
these are games that did not sell with excessive violence and explosions
the console is just a console
it does not have dvd playback or online leaderboards
without the games it is a purple hunk of plastic
it is the games you put into the console that gives it charm
a unique variety of everything imaginable
this is not nostalgia either
i am  as of  and it was my decision to get this console
the kids who have never heard of a super nes do not know what they are missing out onwidely considered the best system of all time
has hundreds of great games including super metroid the legend of zelda a link to the past final fantasy vi iii in the us crono trigger and countless others
i highly recommend this systemi am very satisfied with the console and the game
it was a game i wanted but was super excited to see it was fzero
thank youif you do not have one or you have one and it seems that games are just not that great looking then it might be your chip set
i have mine from year one bought by my father for his house then i have one from a year or so later at moms house and when i got married my wife moved hers in
now i have played all of them on my hd tv using a composite cable
my worst looking system dads plays games extremely clear while the other two do not know which is which now are blurry or the color seems a little off
the point is if you buy a used system be aware that there are different chips in different year models and the newer the model is doesnt mean it is better just look at the slot loading nes and the toaster nes screen shotsever since my grandma bought me the nes in about  i was a nintendo brand loyalist
from that nes through the wii i have played video games on all the major nintendo consoles and experienced the proscons of each of them
all things considered i have to say that the snes is probably the best in terms of overall performancefunthe snes takes the top prize because of its durability and quality of games
other systems have always had a major weakness for examplenes contains my favorite games ever but durability is a major issuen mindblowing for its time d
 but hasnt aged well at allgcn lack of gameswii too cartoony for those who like the graphicsthe snes on the other hand is not only durable i have one that still works perfectly
but also contains quite a library of great games
fzero donkey kongs marios madden  nba jam mega man x and so many more games stand the test of timethus although the nes contains the more classic games the n has more nostalgic value and the gamecube controller is the best the super nintendo is the best taking all things into consideration
it now takes a bit of investment to get one and stock it with games but it will be worth it both in quality and funfor those of you who love and cannot get enough of the addams family this is a video game that does not dissapoint for those of you who loved the gameplay of mario i highly recommend this to also
this game is fun and the fact that you choose which levels you go toand powerups are abundant in it makes this a stellar game
the level designs are awesome and the enemies certainly are unlike any other i mean that in the best way possible
some people may think this is a generic mario style game in an addams family universe
i would disagree with them because it is a solid stomp platformer and both games are amazing in their own rights
you do have the chance to get various powerups and weapons such as balls to bounce and hit enemies with and of course the rapier
all in all this is a highly enjoyable game which has not faded with timei thought this game was really fun
it was enjoyable
you get to play gomez who has to rescue his family from a uninvited guest
there are various fun levels in this game that will make your skin crwal
have funif you liked this game check out the movie soundtrack  novelthe addams family for super nintendo has always been one of my favs for the game system
its as much fun as the movie
i have a game genie so i can put in a cheat that makes me invincible
i still have this gamegomez addams comes home only to find his entire family held hostage to bosses in several different parts of the house
you  have to go through each level and defeat every monster along the way until you get to the bosses
your strategies are golfballs to throw at enemies a sword a fezicopter something else with a special super mario bros twist that temporarily makes you invicible while you pick up valuables along the way including riches and extra lives
there are also special bonus bosses that you can defeat for extra hearts
once youve saved everyone youve beaten the game
if you have an old super nintendo that still works buy this masterpiece online and enjoyjust because youve played final fantasy viiplaystation or the elder scrolls iv oblivionxbox playstation  pc that doesnt make you a true rpg gamer until you play chrono trigger
i like this game better than final fantasy ii iii and mystic quest on my snes simply because it plays better its more accessible to the rpgimpared and there arent very many random encounters
i never figured this game would end up being  on my top ten favorite games listespecially since its surrounded by shooters and loads of other genres that dont include the rpg genre but somehow won over me and i grew to love this game with a passion because its so fing amazing
i have never experienced a game this epic before in my life which is another reason why you must buy this gameeither for snes or ps
and like the fans of final fantasy vii demanding a remake of the game for ps and  chrono fans demand a remake of the series for the same platformswith maybe the possibility of releasing chrono break
come on square enix what the hell are you waiting for this is the king of all rpgs baby
it was here before ffvii viii ix or x  it came before super mario rpg legend of the seven stars
this game is amazing
as crono a young teen who lives in the year ad  you venture with your friends across time to save the future that is meant to be
after accidentally sending marle your newest friend back in time to ad  you and your best friend lucca go after her
when you return you are put on trial for treason but after you escape you find a new portal and go to the future circa ad  which has become a desolate wasteland thanks to a creature called lavos
you vow to save the planets future even if you will never live to see it
along the way you team up with robo from the future ayla from  million bc and frog from ad   there is also a wizard named magus who you fight in  but then you meet him again in  bc and are given the option to have him join you which i highly suggestthis game has tons of spells especially since you can combine turns to perform double and even triple spells
the side quests are great too and you should do them all if you want to get each characters ultimate weaponif youve never played this game before do yourself a favor and play it because this is one of the greatest rpgs everas you can see from my title yes
its the best rpg game of all timethis was actually my first rpg game though and before i ever thought about playing the game to me it looked boring just by watching how it plays and reading its balloon texts
cronos luminare is one of the main figure that caught me and dragged me out on playing this game
when i was watching my little brother battling against lavos to me the sound effects of the scene activated my low action fuel
it was armageddon characters unleashing devastating magics some may look kind of silly especially the i forgot what it was called doubleattack with crono with other characters
the story itself was intriguing and for me who gets bored pretty quick at reading this made me understood why great stories are written and published and yes i hated reading even from school ppointersgameplay  the game is easy at first of course but once you started progressing and fighting higher level enemies it gets harder
urging your characters to level is what keeps you playing this game
the menus and options are easy to adapt and friendly not like how rpgs nowadaysgraphics  character designs by akira toriyama nuff saidstory  the story combine with its gameplay is probably my most memorable rpg game of my once in a lifetime gamer
this is the rpg that made me an rpg gamer today
the story is funny especially the happy accidents where crono gets framed magus turning sides and meeting different kinds of people during time travelingthis game will add taste to those gamers who arent into rpg gamesim pretty sure most hardcore rpg gamers today started on this game toothis game is a must own and if you werent born on the day this came out i just dont know how to feel sorry for you but dont worry for those who dont own a super nes theres a new version with new additionals such as animation cutscenes for the playstation versionthis is a must own i would suggest you to buy this game now because this is a game that only exists once in a lifetimeif you want to know if this game has a replay value i would suggest beating the game first from start to finish and wait till crono awakes againsince my semiretirement from video games i feel like ive lost touch with some of the new games of today
a lot has happened in my life which is why youll find a  year gap between a couple of my reviews and have focused on school and other things
but ive been meaning to get this review up for a long time and its high time i did that
ill try not to go nerdy here but this is my personal favorite video game not only on the super nes but of all timeim probably not the only one that shares this as in a recent nintendo power magazine fans voted chrono trigger  most wanted game to be put on the wii console right behind s super mario rpg and s terragnigma
and its also coming to nintendo dschrono trigger follows the tale of time traveling adventurers
marle the princess of guardia is whisked through time accidently by luccas transporter and crono the lead character who rarely speaks decides to go and save her which leads to a series of time altering events new characters and the ultimate final battle with lavos
lavos is the main villain a parasitic life form thats been on the planet since the stone age and used the worlds resources to allow mankind to evolve thus empowering lavos for millenia until  ad when lavos nearly wipes out the human race
we are introduced to awesome playable characters frog formerly a knight named glenn from the middle ages magus a sorceror from the dark magical age that frog seeks revenge upon robo a robot from the future and turns against the evil robots and develops his own personality a la data from star trek
lucca cronos friend is a super smart inventor with a childhood regret
ayla a prehistoric babe that seeks retribution against the reptites in the prehistoric age
and marle the future ruler of guardia and is swept up in a tale of high adventure and timethe characters are very memorable and even if you were playing today youd be rooting for them during the game
magus is out to destroy lavos and is very narcissistic especially towards frog frog is a young heroic knight who carries the burden of failing to save cyrus his hero
marle wants to be free despite her royal upbringing
lucca yearns to correct her mistake of failing to save her mother from injury
robo aspires to become more human and constructive and by the end of the game hell be one of your favorite characters
aylas warriorlike personality may have you thinking impure thoughts about a super nes character and shes bisexual in the original japanese translation lol and crono is the main hero and rarely speaks but his heroic nature and adventorous spirit is the drive of the storythere are many aspects of this game to appreciate
the intricate storyline with multiple endings might seem common now but back then it was practically unheard of
theres also some dark parts in the storyline frog having to avenge cyrus because magus killed him lucca feeling responsible for her mothers injury etc
as well as downright goofy parts knights of the square table
and whats with pouring soda on tomas grave
the music mostly contributed by yasunori mitsuda is considered a classic snes gem and is actually the most covered game of all time on ocremixorg i think its got  remixes as of this writing
this soundtrack never gets old
i read in an interview that mitsuda had ulcers making the score and nobuo uematsu and norika matsueda had to finish the soundtrack only a few tracks he loved doing the score so much that he had ulcers
hardcoregameplay wise its relatively simple by todays standards
youve three of your characters in battle and depending on your combination the double tech and triple tech combinations are different
i always found this to be unique and havent seen it utilized much in later games
the graphics were outstanding for the time animated in a colorful and very toriyamaesque style its pretty smooth for a super nintendo game
the magic spells look fantastic even in  when this game first came outi didnt find this too harsh in difficulty growing up and i still find it to be relatively easy
i think this is a definite plus because if you are a young pup and want a good dosage of rpg heaven then this would be a great place to start
this is one of the rare games where the creators didnt want to make money off of it nor did they want to make a turd for a quick buck
they spent time energy and enthusiasm on chrono trigger and honestly i think it shows final fantasys hinorobu sakaguchi dragonwarriors yuji horii and dbzs dragonball z all worked on this game
the storyline combined with awesome music smooth gameplay and emotionallydriven characters makes this a rariety
this game leaves you with a happy feeling and a sense of accomplishment for beating it and if youre an old school gamer like me nostalgia as well
part of the reason i also love this game was because the friendships ive attained through this game which might seem a little silly
but hey it was  and chrono trigger was caught in the growing up scheme of thingsoverall i highly recommend this game especially to the firsttime gamer
its not too difficult and it has a lot to offer
now that its coming to ds with a revamped translation kinda like what they did with castlevania symphony of the night its easy to obtain
or you can also find it on final fantasy chronicles for playstation
either way this game is a mustbuy dont pass on the adventure of a lifetimethe title says it all
this game shows everything that an rpg should be
great plot with all the events that make the story touching without resorting to the contrived death of a character to do it ff
the characters are all good and likeable unlike cloud strife and squall leonheart i hate this quoti dont carequot attitude prevalent in squaresofts heroes lately
also some of these characters are very original namely frog robo ayla and even lucca
even magus gains your respect by the time all is said and done
there is excellent music some of the best the super nintendo has ever seen
the graphics and such are wonderful for the snes
the gameplay is fun and innovative with features never seen before or at least never executed this wella battle system focusing on teamwork between characters having them combine their techniques for awesome effectscomplete removal of all random battlesa plot that is just right linear enough to keep the story moving along nicely yet with enough side quests and variations to create many multiple endings
endings can be affected by everything from which side quests you chose to whether or not you went home and fed the catnew game  option
you dont have to start all over from scratch to try out all the different endingsthere are many things besides these entirely too many to list in a single review
this is by far the best rpg ever made second to nonethis is the best rpg the best game
good storyling incredible battles and great characters
i especially like glenn
whoops
no spoilers
this game is also incredibly rare
you are very lucky if you can find it like i did
but its worth the price
it also is not too hard
if you find this great title than the day of lavos has comenear the end of the snes cycle square released  games chrono trigger and final fantasy vi
talk about being on a roll
both are considered classics of not only rpgs but games in general as theyre usually in the top  of all time lists
what makes these  games stand out is that one was heavy on story but not so much on graphics while the other had a marginally interesting story but great graphicsfor its time
this review is for chrono triggerobviouslystory crono attends the millenial fair in leene square ad and bumps into marle
both of them have fun while cronos friend lucca is preparing her latest invention
they discover its a star trek style transporter
crono tries and so far so good until marle does and she disappears
eventually through some time hopping they find out a beast known as lavos brought destruction on the land in the year  so crono marle lucca and a number of friends have to save the world from its future destructiongraphics back in the snes days these were cool
unlike the spritey ff overhead graphics these were quite detailed
nowadays of course theyre pitiful but we still love tetris right
the world graphics look definately ugly especially the characters
also improved is the battle graphics no longer do people make just one sword move now they swipe do a double slash or do a special movesoundmusic yasunori mitsuda supplied the music and of course its just as good as any soundtrack
lively themes and great pieces are throughout the game
one thing you might find is that its not immediately catchy but you end up loving the track as youre listening then hum it latergameplay its like attackmagicitem except magic is part of a big group called tech
only  characters are not given a basic elementalcrono has lightning lucca has fire etc so someone like marle can cast ice style magic on her opponents
also theres things called tech attacks
one example is cronos cyclone where he can spin around whichll also nail any surrounding enemies
but then you can do a double tech so the same cyclone but couple it with luccas fire will create fire whirl and theres many more such as coupling  cures to create a big refresher spell
theres even triple techs highly damaging attacksunlike final fantasys muchmaligned random encounters triggers enemies appear on screen and you can even slink by and avoid some fights although sometimes theyre mandatory
one thing that helps with the game depending on how you go about it is the game never gets way too easy that you breeze through it
but then again its not frustrating as hell
usually the difference between a successful battle and being owned is a couple levels and some strategy
but the enemiesbosses are still gonna put up a fightthe only real place to play the game is to spend heavy money on ebay or a luck out on a bargain bin or to buy the chronicles release or as a last resort using roms and emulators
either way dont miss out on this awesome gameunable to really give a review
got it for my grandson and he said it was great so i assume it was okdont miss playing this game as the original or rerelease
this is one of the  essentials for the snes rpg player
not much more needs to be said if you play this game you will not be disappointedand if you see all the endings youre a lucky personchrono trigger was released in  for the snes later to be remade for the playstationgraphics   very ahead of its time
cts graphics were beautiful from the colorful d textures to the forests the graphics were topnotchmusic its that good
the music was beautiful from the great battle themes to the sad music there is not one bad tune in heresound  it sounds great for a  gamegameplay ct is an rpg
however there are things that are special about this game
for one thing the battle system is unique
you can use moves that combine different characters
its a bit hard to explainanother thing that makes this game unique is the fact that you can time travel
you can alter the past and have fun
plus more eras mean more sidequeststhe story i belive is solid
it isnt the best rpg story ever but it is easy to understand and very entertainingreplay value  most rpgs dont really have a replay value but this does
once you beat the game you can do a new game which allows you to start the game over with everything you had on the first game
plus there are many and i mean many
endings to unlockchrono trigger is a masterpiece simple as that
if you have an snes get this
if you dont get the ps versionfor a game with so many five star reviews one might think it is overrated but if you havent played it  get that thought out of your head immediatly
ill tell you why this game is one of the greatest games games ever madegraphics graphically this game is amazing
ive seen games for playstation that have worse graphics than this
the characters and backrounds are extremely detailed in lush color
some snes games have a tendency to have rather boring colored backrounds but not this game
also the techniques used during battle look great
there isnt much else to say other than amazingmusic wowthe music is nothing short of miraculous
this game has got to have some of the best music i have ever heard in any video game especially in the zeal section
the music is close to the calibur of super metroid which in my opinion has the greatest music for a video game
it is at the same calibur as final fantasy  tactics  and besides those it may be the greatest soundtrack for a rpg ever made
i might think this game has the greatest soundtrack ever made but to be honest i didnt actually play this game till  and a half or so years ago so i didnt have any memories of the game tied in with the music and games i played when i was a kid seem to touch me in a stronger way
no complaints what so ever herestoryline  the idea that things done in a different time period effects the future is not only brilliant but it is revolutionary
you will really start to feel for the characters here and the stroyline will grip you into the gameentertainmentgameplay  yep  there are so many side quests to accomplish here and every one of them is fantastic
you never know what you might unlock if you do something in a different time period
this game is pretty short only maybe  hours the first time through but if you go through and level up your characters to the max and complete all the sidequests your looking at easily  hoursoverall 
yep you read it right
 isnt enough for this gem so i upgraded it to 
like i said earlier i didnt first play this game until  and a half years ago and i still loved it prooving how great this game is
if you are into old school rpgs then you will probably already have this game but anyone else will love it too
i think it is innovative and uptodate enough to satisfy even ps fansjust get it if you can find iti first experienced chrono trigger on the wii virtual console i was like oh hey this looks cool i downloaded this along with mega man x another awesome game
and man i grew up with the snes and too young to grasp the story but its very engaging and its definitely a first and last of its kindthe music is awesome from cheery mysterious even dark at some point but its very atmospheric that the tracks are worth listening to
game play is your standard jrpg but uses the active time system to the fullest but you also have the wait system as well
personally the active system is perfected in this title and its isnt random battle either the monsters run to you or you run to them
simple yet effectiveone of the main thing this game does so well is that it sucks you into the world and you know your villain but a set time to when doomsday happens so its literally a race against time and this game is where spoilers skip this part if you dont want read what happens
you have been warned
 a main character gets killed
eat your heart out ff
chrono trigger did it first and in  megs as well
the helplessness of the event is so powerful even in multiple playthroughs and i know what happens still affects mewoo
ok i need to calm down a bit
so chrono trigger was also ported to the psone its a cheaper way of getting the game but i highly recommend against getting that piece of crap
reason being is that yeah it has the cool animated cut scenes but the load times are plagued in this cd port especially when entering combat it really kills the momentum
if youre not worried about that then power to you and go for it but to get the best experience get the snes version i dont know too much about the ds version so im assuming its a better port as i mentioned in the beginning you can get the title on your wiis virtual console as well so bam
three ways of getting the game without breaking the bank
doverall this game is a must have for any snes collector or a must play i love both this and ff ff in the snes theyre both unique and different yet they both brought something new to the time
chrono trigger is those games that you have to play and youll enjoy it because its encourages you to get it your all to save a world that youll grow to care about and the characters are so developed even the game add a gray character an antihero with the most epic battle theme music ever
what are you waiting for
get this game
nowgreat game i owned it once now buying back retro games for my kids to enjoy
brings back lots of fun memories best rpg on snesto many chrono trigger is the best rpg ever made
id say its as good as final fantasy  or  but not better
although i rate it  stars  stars is closer to it
it all has to do with the final ending bosslavosand his three forms
in my opinion lavos is right up there with kefka and sephiroth but lavos isnt human so that makes him the best nonhuman antagonist ever seen in a game
lavos first appears as a porcupinelike creature
his eerie scream is as good as kefkas laugh too
after defeating the lavos shell you go inside and fight the machine part of lavos
looks okay but not great
you beat that then fight the last version of lavosthe vegetablelooking version
he doesnt look evil nor does he look good
so its awful hard to hate him
the background effect is okay but sorta annoying and the music at that point is bland
but thats the only problem that i have with the gamethe final ending boss
everything preceding that is topnotch squaresoft
the storyline is really great on this game
my favorite parts are chronos trial as good as the opera scene in ff the future especially the bike race against that princelike guy the battle against magus in his castle is especially awesome because the music fits in so perfectly with the battle
the little movie scene showing lavos falling to earth is also a joy to see
there are ten endings to this game and many sidequests
tough luck finding a good copy of it now but you can get it on emulator which is almost as goodthis game is by far the greastest rpg ever made
this game has amazing music a wonderful plot and anime style graphics
i love all the characters and the games music just keeps making you want to come back for more
overall there are aboloutley no flaws in the gamecant really say much more than that
the combat the movement the plot the magic system the items the maps the vehicles the npcs everything just fits together perfectly and the final boss fight manages to be exciting and challenging without being impossible
still the best game everi mean that
i first played this game  yrs ago and even with all the modern graphics and technology nowadays no other game can really compete with chrono trigger
even though i played it when i was a sr in high school i never owned an snes until i bought one on ebay then it quickly became one of my all time favorite games the only one game i might like more is ocarina of time but hey thats good company
its just brilliant in so many ways
it has an incredible story a very interesting premise very unique and cool settings absolutely incredible gameplay and awesome i mean awesome characters
seriously i have never played another game where the main cast was so interesting colorful and welldeveloped ffvi comes close but not quite
you really start to care about each of them because they all have unique intriguing and emotional back stories that are played out in a perfectly natural way as you play the game
this game truly is a masterwork of writing and pacing and you will really find yourself connecting with and loving the characters which in turn makes you become invested in the story
the storyline is incredible and although you may think it is one of those a dime a dozen save the world defeat the badguy stories i assure you it is anything but
true it is a save the world game but it has just such a creative take on it that it feels like something completely unique and fresh
the villain is awesome and there are some very nice twists of sorts that keep you wondering whats going to happen next the entire time
the world is also just so brilliantly fleshed out that you feel like you know it personally
the music is some of the best ive ever heard in a game also
most importantly arguably however is that the gameplay is just simply unbelievable
this game has the most entertaining battle system i have ever played
the double techs and triple techs were such a brilliant idea and something that im surprised no other rpg since has picked up on besides chrono cross sorta but that doesnt count
the time aspect of this game is just flawlessly done i dont wanna spoil anything so im not going talk about but its nothing short of mindblowing
also it has some of the best sidequests ive ever played in the game
im sorry for this long rant i just love this game so much
im only writing this review cuz i just turned it on to play through again and i thought it might be nice to hopefully share my love of it with others
its the only game ive without fail replayed every yr since i first played itfor months i wanted to experience chrono trigger the game by square that many enthusiasts consider to be the best rpg ever created
i had missed out on chrono trigger back when it was originally released in the s and i always felt as if i was doing myself an injustice by not having played itmany fans of the game warned me that the playstation  port of chrono trigger was inferior due to load times
many advised that i would best play the version released for the nintendo ds as apparently the nintendo ds version of chrono trigger features all the cutscenes of the playstation version with none of the load timesdue to my lack of a nintendo handheld i held off for a long time from playing the game
i asked around on forums if the load times of the playstation version were really as bad as people say and most people seemed to feel like the load times were game breakingallow me to ensure you that the load times of the playstation  version of chrono trigger hardly leave a damper on what i would consider a masterpiece
if you only have a playstation console do not let your doubts stop you from experiencing chrono triggerin my own personal situation i chose to download the ps one classics version of chrono trigger from the playstation network because it plays on both the ps and the playstation vita
up until now ive been playing the game on the vita as chrono trigger is the perfect game for a handheld consolethe storywithout spoiling the game for anyone who has yet to experience chrono trigger i can tell you that square has given you what amounts to hours of enjoyment and replayability
chrono trigger features a diverse amount of characters and environments and is fully engaging throughout
never did i feel as if the game was tedious or as if the game was a grindthe presentationthe visuals of the game look immaculate on the vitas oled
the fact that the game is in d makes the visuals look hardly aged and the vitas bilinear filtering seems to enhance the jaggedness of the sprites even more sothe game sounds great and has arguably the greatest soundtrack of any video game out there
the vita however does not have a powerful external speaker  the games music is best enjoyed through your favorite pair of headphonescontrolling the game was a joy with the vita
the controls of the game are fully customizable as are all ps one classics played on the vita but chrono trigger is one game where you will want to use the incredible dpad provided by the vitaoverall chrono trigger is an excellent buy for the playstation vita
the game is not only one of the worlds greatest rpgs but it is also the perfect title for a handheld
though chrono trigger might be old it surely is one of the greats
i am eagerly awaiting the games sequel chrono cross which is also available on the playstation networkchrono trigger is a game i missed out on when it was first on the snes but i later purchased it as part of final fantasy chronicles for the playstation and i can say with certainty that this game is better than the best in every way
going through the games one by one the original final fantasy wasnt all that special the second and third ones basically rode the same path
chrono trigger has more and better plot twists and turns than final fantasy  more travel than final fantasy  and better technology than final fantasy   magus back story is more believable even than that of sephiroth from final fantasy  lavos is much scarier than any of the villains from final fantasy  and the game has more humor than final fantasy  but carries it off even better than final fantasy x without annoying and unneccesary minigames
it has about  endings and theyre all better than the ending from secret of mana a game that chrono trigger beats even in regards to the fight sequences
chrono trigger has better music than even castlevania symphony of the night more creative enemies than earthbound and more interesting characters than any rpg
characters who by the way can do things that even the gang from dragon ball z would not be able to match like visiting the future then going back in time and actually changing it
lastly the legend of zeldas link has not been as likable a person as chrono ever since he moved off the super nintendo and became a stiff
before that he was a pretty funloving guy
anyways even zelda a link to the past couldnt match this game because although link was as likable as chrono the other characters of chronotrigger are all equally likable especially lucca and magusso that about covers it
those were all the best rpgs of all time and i have gone through them one by one picked out the most outstanding trait of each one and combined them against chrono trigger
doesnt matter
this game still whips them all
i hope this little chart of mine has been of some help in convincing some people of just what a wonderful game this wasthis game is about a young boy named crono who accidently gets transported to the past by a telepod but ends up saving the world alongside his quite diverse friends lucca marle princess nadia a frog a robot a primitive woman called ayla and if you choose to a wizard called magus
on one of their trips to the bleak future of the world they discover a major catastrophe had struck the world  years earlier in 
in order to right the wrongs they have to travel through the various time periods and tackle any evils they encounter which would ultimately result in saving the future of the worldthis is a quality game by any standard
both the visuals and music are outstanding
one area where the graphics are considered lacking is the overworld map screens though it doesnt show much at all
in fact i didnt even notice it till i read it somewhere
musicwise the game has a number of catchy melodies i enjoyed the themes of frog and robo and the music of denadoro mountains
they may grow on you
the sound effects are quite fitting and the game controls are very fluidthe biggest improvement compared to other rpgs of its day is probably the battle system
unlike most rpgs you can choose either turnbased or active anywhere in the game
there are plenty of options to fiddle with too just to pass time
a new feature is the new game 
this appears after the game is completed once and it lets you keep your equipment and status from your completed game on your new adventure
this feature was probably added to make things much easier in getting the ten plus possible endings
another big improvement is the way you use magic
your characters can combine their magic either in duel tech or triple tech to cause major damage
some techs can also be accessed by getting hold of certain itemsits a nice touch
rpg fans craving for boss fights will get plenty of em in this game
unfortunately they only really provide a solid challenge till you beat the game for the first time
once you choose new game  you can virtually toy around with them except the end boss
as with all good rpgs there are immense amounts of weapon armour and headwear updates toofor those of you who still have a snes i cant think of a better rpg you could play
if you havent made a nextgeneration system commitment yet and are looking for more classic games then this must be in your collection
even if you arent into rpgs i suggest giving it a try
those with playstations can also enjoy the rerelease of this game on their system
whatever the case its a quality rpg that will manage to please even the most avid rpg criticwhile this is a rpg it had a few elements that the final fantasy series was lacking
this was one of the most inventive games i ever played and is a legend even today at least to me
chrono trigger stood out with its combo attacks its battle system and of course the timetravel along with the unique sidequests
honestly there are so many possible endings and different ways you can play this game
i also liked replaying the game after i defeated lavos thus being able to start a new game with the stats i had completed the last game with making enemies really easy to beatwhat made this game stand out most was the timetravel and how things you did in one time period would affect the rest as well as the timetravel aspects of some of the sidequests along with the main quest
its too bad that one of the final fantasy games didnt have time travel or anything like that
ive spent so many hours enjoying this lovely game  kudos to the team responsible for this gameafter u beat the place where u get robo at go to the place with the portals and knock the bucket over doing this will make u teleport straghit to the last boss lavos this is trueif youre reading this you probably already know what chrono trigger is and that it is widely considered one of the best if not the best rpg of all time
to date i have still not found anything that resembles chrono trigger in any form even its pseudosequel chrono cross for the psx
it is not my absolute favorite rpg of all time but it ranks among the absolute best
calling it a masterpiece is the only way to do this game justiceafter the success of final fantasy vi thats final fantasy iii on the snes square decided to create a new franchise and it became one of the most soughtafter games on the snes
every character you use is unique the different locations you visit are unique the story is phenomenal the soundtrack is phenomenal and the battle system is one of the best in rpg history
there is almost nothing i can say that is negative about this game
this is about as perfect a game as you can getthe game was one of the best of the snes and it still holds up very well today
it doesnt feel dated and is still every bit a blast to play as it ever was
if you have not played this game and are even remotely into rpgs to pass this game up you would be doing yourself a huge disservice
because its somewhat rare and highly soughtafter prices for snes cartridge can get pretty high
luckily its also available in several other forms as part of the final fantasy chronicles for psx as a port to the nintendo ds and its also available for the wiis virtual console
no matter which version you play its virtually identical in every one
very many people call this game a masterpiece and you would do well to listen to them
this one should not be missedgraphics while not revolutionary theyre still pretty good and even hold up pretty well today at least as far as sprite art goes
it does the job wellthen now sound no masterpiece of an rpg is complete without a phenomenal soundtrack
and chrono trigger is no exception
the soundtrack that accompanies the game is every bit a masterpiece as the game itself
very catchy memorable and very fittingthen now gameplay one of the most unique battle systems to date
its still a lot of fun to play today as it ever was
i cant believe its been  years since this game was first released because it still plays beautifullythen now story one of the best in the business
its pretty unique lots of fun and really holds your interest the entire way through
at times its even pretty haunting
a good story evokes ones emotions and this does it as well as any other topnotch rpg storythen now overall this game is a masterpiece i dont really know how else to put it
if you have not played this game and you are a fan of rpgs you must play this game and i cannot stress that enoughthen now final score ct is the single best rpg experience you will likely ever find
the battle system is fun and enjoyable no random battles you lear tech moves which allow you to perform special attacks on enemies the soundtrack rules the graphics are awesome d is best the characters are actually well rounded and memorable and the story is intricate yet easy to follow and involves time travel obviously
the character designs are done by akira toriyama from dbz famelook be honest in a game that spans  hours the likely hood of you playing it again and again is uncommon
this game can be beaten at anytime
you can go to the last boss very soon after you start the game if you feel inclined to die a horrible painfil death
but you will honestly want to play this game over and over because it is fun
there are  different endings depending on how you do certain things plus an unlockable character and new game plus opens when you beat the game
new game plus allows you to take all your equipment and levels and xp etc
into the game from the beginning minus plot weapons like the masemune sword for frog
you should be well into at least lvl  by the end of the game but the max level is  star star each of your stats also have individual maximums of 
you reach lvl  after lvl  its fun going back through the game at such high levels and using the weakest weaponsarmorfind it buy itwhat more can i say that others havent said already
this game is the greatest rpg and overall in history of console games newer games cant hold a candle to the music and story linei am going to go off topic and have a rant about some things
first and foremost back in the bit era game designers for snesgenesis were limited by space and cpu available on consoles cartridges were only a few megabytes in size so they decided to create epic storylines that gripped you and graphics to inspire your imagination
the top video games of all time were from the bit era ff ct secret of mana zelda and othersnowadays its a different ball game
everyone is more concerned with great looking game instead of a good story line
while games like mass effect are up there in terms of stories and others they arent as good as the old games
even small publishers that made very good games are purchased by bigger companies ea activision etc so its not about quality its about butchering titles to make a buck
take for example star wars knights of the old republic that was a very great game because of the storyline and complex choices you can make
the followup was developed by a different studio who rushed it out and it was an incomplete title
the storyline didnt make much sense near the end as a large chunk was removed  rushed to get it out in time for the holidaysback to the topic at hand this game is the greatest in history and will continue to capture the imagination of people when i am long deadi never heard of this game as a kid and now as im collecting vintage games i regret that i never got to play it until now
this is a fantastic rpg with an epic story and creative characters moves and plot twists
seriously you should buy it before it gets even more expensive
rare game great find
fast shipping arrived in great condition just as described
great classic game to add to my collection
highly recommended
thanks
ai finally played chrono trigger last year and it was fun
one thing i am not a fan of is if i do or dont do one thing that means i do not get the great armor weapon etc
i had the guide so i did get a sense of the multiple endings
if you enjoy rpgs and you like the look of secret of evermore my favorite or final fantasy iii then you will like this game toothere is a good size world to investigate and i did like the time factor and seeing the differences it made to the terrain and the new people to talk to
i can see why people give it a perfect score and why it would be near and dear to some people
that is why i say at the top that i think scoring has to do with when you play a game
it all melds together for a near and dear experience or a yeah that was fun kind of game
anybody who plays a roleplaying game knows to grab a pen and paper when they start the game and you will need to do some note taking for this one toothis game is already one of my favorites of all time and i only played it for the first time about two months ago
i did however rent it toward the end of my third grade year but when my dad and i went to buy it theyd stopped selling most snes games and replaced them with playstation and n all over
but i downloaded this game on an emulator and finally got to play it again as well as final fantasy iii vi a game i unfortunately never got to play
but all the final fantasies are gonna be on the gameboy advance pretty soon and i expect this game to be as well someday
heres my reviewthe graphics of this game are awesome
even snes games can have incredible graphics
in fact the graphics here almost surpass many games even today
the storyline is awesome
i wont spoil it even though some other reviewers already did
but the gameplay is the best of any rpg
three of the final fantasy games should have had this style of gameplay instead of what they did have which made them very frustrating
all the others are fine though
i found this game somewhat easy but i dont mean so much so that its a breeze but youll still find yourself getting stuck on a couple of battles for a while stop playing for a week come back and and say ahh i did itoverall id play this game over anything today
ever since video games started looking more like movies companies just seem to focus on making a game look great instead of having incredible storylines like the games of the snes era almost all did
ive played doom  quake  halo and a ton of other movie games that i only enjoyed for a short amount of time before i just sort of decided to move on to something else
ive had final fantasy iv vii viii ix and x for years and years and years and i play those more than anything else
among my favorite video games ever include the legend of zelda a link to the past super mario rpg all the mario bros games zelda ocarina of time and super mario  these are all games i grew up with and i only wish chrono trigger and final fantasy iii vi could have been a part of my life back then as wellchrono trigger remains the greatest console rpg ever made
the version on this new cd compilation is identical in play to the original but includes several animated cutscenes done by bird studios producers of dragonballdbz and ownedoperated by akira toriyama who did the character designs for chrono trigger as well which are themselves worth the price
in point of fact the price itself is interesting the compilation of chrono trigger and final fantasy  costs less than either of them did separately when first released
chrono trigger centers around the adventures of crono yes thats the correct spelling a young man whose only apparent unusual feature is skill with a sword otherwise he lives a rather ordinary life getting his allowance from his mom taking care of his pet cat and as the story begins looking forward to the millennial fair
at the fair he meets with a pretty blonde girl marle who wears an interesting pendant and who as a stranger to his town asks him if hed be nice enough to show her around a bitthings get strange when they visit the exhibit area of one of cronos friends lucca whos an eccentric inventor
her invention mysteriously reacts to the presence of marles pendant and marle vanishes leaving the glowing pendant behind
when crono decides to follow her wherever shes gone and bring her back hes catapulted into a timespanning adventure which will take him from the present to  million years in the past and thousands of years in the future and eventually to confront a worlddestroying monster which may at the same time have been responsible for the creation of cronos own civilization
along the way he will learn secrets of his worlds history gain new powers and gather allies ranging from the superstrong cavegirl ayla to the technologically advanced machineman robochrono triggers greatest claim to fame was and is that it boasts many possible endings all quite different based on what decisions you make during the game
theyre not all easily predictable either and at least one or two are rather creepy
its also interesting in that after a certain point you no longer have to keep crono in your party most games have a set viewpoint character that you have to keep around
its quite possible to finish the game with any combination of available charactersgameplay is in my opinion superior to that of any of the final fantasy games
for one thing it avoids the quoteternally wandering monsterquot phenomenon which makes overland travel in the ff series so damnably frustrating while still allowing you to wander freely across the land and visit places looking for clues new things to buy and new friends and allies
for another the combat sequences are much more active than those of other rpgs of its same era and include special techniques  both for individuals and ones combining the techniques of two or three characters at once
once you beat the game you have the option of using quotnew gamequot which allows you to start with the same power and most of the items that youd gained along the way the first time
this is useful for those trying to play through again since it allows you to zip through combats which the first time took many minutes to complete
it does however introduce a bit of cognitive dissonance especially in the early parts of the game quothow the heck are they throwing me in jail
i have enough power to level this entire castle by myselfquotthe soundtrack of chrono trigger is unbelieveably good
somehow through the miracle of midi the original game had  full cds worth of music crammed on it and the skill with which the midi was composed and produced made it sound at the time very nearly orchestral
even today the sound isnt bad and the redone fully orchestral version is amazing
each major character has its own theme and theyre all excellent
chrono triggers soundtrack still rates as one of my absolute favoritesif you like console rpgs at all this is one that you absolutely must buy and keep enshrined somewhere
now available as part of quotfinal fantasy chroniclesquot theres even more reason to own it since its cheaper now than it was when first releasedchrono trigger released in  by squaresoft for the longobsolete but never forgotten snes is one of the greatest rpgs ever to be assembled
there are a series of pros and only very few consthe prosfor  bits the soundtrack is terifficsame story with the graphics and sound effectsthe battle system is one of the best square ever came up withthe originality rate of this game is very high as wellultimately the only con is that parts of the game are a wee bit too easy for some tastes
however in spite of this fact i would highly recommend this game to anyone whoa owns an snesb
is into rpgsc
wants something that will truly mean something in the years to come its ten years old now
buy it if you are a fan of other squaresoft roleplayers such as the massive final fantasy series the somewhat more obscure mana series and also chrono cross which is somewhat of a followup to this though none of the characters from this are present its still excellent
this may be rare and expensive but it still comes highly recommendedwhat more could one possibly add
chrono trigger rocks in any epochfirst youve got a somewhat easy plottime travelers attempting to avert apocalypsebut then thrown in is the fresh and startling idea of an omnipotent stellar parasite
its amazing what imagination gets packed into these  bits
the end of time
zeal
mystics and magus
twists and turns shake out as personalities start reappearing in different guises chunks of backstory from each character
the battle system is heavenly typical rpg atb plus a new added geometric strategy
everythings streamlined from the tecs to armor shopping
graphics are beautiful and somehow simultaneously fun sound effects spice it up just rightthe soundtrack is a model of the video game score and mitsudas tunes are rightly among the mainstays of the genre
the quartal fanfare of the main theme the gentle town melodies the truly haunting overworld tune the ghastly magus dirge the trial background robos electropop track and frogs tripletty song all simply marvelousthe game remains as fun as it was when debutingthere are many who feel that chrono trigger is the greatest game ever made
certainly it is one of the greatest rpgs ever made in my own experience equaled only perhaps by final fantasy vii never did care for any other final fantasy games
its a rolickinggoodtime for fans of adventure and scifi and as rpgs go a whole lot of fun
more than that the genius of its design and brilliance of its story is not debatable
its legendary
even better it makes for a game thats funwhen i first started the game i was wondering exactly how the game would make me feel
i like the deep story of rpgs but hate dungeon crawling random battles and that very irritating feeling of having absolutely no idea where to go next to get the story moving again
i need not have feared though
chrono trigger has no random battles its castles and dungeons are brief not everylasting and thankfully you will always know where to go nextthe story starts with you in your village on the day of the millenial fair and you quickly meet a girl there and using your friends new teleportation machine find the girl gone and yourself back in time trying to rescue a queen who has been kidnapped and who your friend has been mistaken for because surprise surprise she is the crown princess and the descent of that queen
you have some adventures come back to your time get put on trial for kidnapping the princess and see one of the greatest scenes in any videogame ever as all your actions in the first hour of the game are played back as evidence against or for you
eventually you get out of that situation one way or another and find yourself again traveling through time only to find that the world was destroyed by a monster far in the future unless you can stop itthe prologue is awesome but the main story of the game is really amazing
you have all the classic trapping of a great legend from a hero turned into an animal to an ancient sword that has to be reforged to a princess and an unlikely hero out to save the world
thats enough to make a good game
what propels chrono trigger into greatness is the power the story is given by the strength of the characters and writing and absolutely fantastic presentation and gameplay
the game is loaded with humor character from the little girl accusing you of not rescuing her cat at the trial to a tiny furry creature who is the master magician and keeps popping up in different times doing everything from hiking on the mountain of monsters to playing ragtime on the piano in an inn from the goblins who wonder why you just popped out of a time portal in their closet to the frog who talks in noble shakesparian and the cute robot you find in the future
there were so many times when i played this game and felt real joy in the moments it presented
when i first discovered the robot in the future and his theme played i felt attached to him instantly hes so cuuuute and when the hero frog leapt off saying he had failed to protect the queen  i felt so bad for him he was really handy with sword and saved my bacon
thats the kind of thing that gets to you
i havent felt that way about an rpg since xenosagas cyborg said call me ziggy and final fantasy vii had girls asking a certain brooding hero whether he remembered his promise or would be their bodyguardit cannot be overstated how much the lack of random battles and the constant boss battles which you will almost always win increase the amount of fun you have with this game
the excellent battle system which highly encourages teamwork amoung your party keeps you constantly on your toes and nervous that you could lose the battle and never gets tedious or frustrating
the graphics may be oldschool but that about as good spritebased graphics get
the music is very atmospheric and catchy and the main themes are just beautiful
the story twists and turns and how you play can determine the way certain events unfold the game has more than one ending and you can even play past the end
but above all the story and characters are just impossible not to love if you like a good story
if you like rpgs and dont mind if theyre a little old you will love this gamethis was my first rpg and to this day it remains my favorite rpg
by todays standereds in new updated graphics and more open gameplay oppertunities it might be a little out of place because of its age but dont let any of that fool you
this game was a masterpeice for its time with many revolutionary ideas that to this day have not been able to have been outdone to this dayive played videogames all my life
the rpg genre is still my favorite and ive played more of these games then many people have
still i am surprized by the fact that when dealing with characters and inspiring story everything else hasnt come close to the brillence placed in chrono trigger
final fantasy  is the only other rpg that i can say came closethe summery of this game is this three farly normal teenagers living in a peaceful age of invention get thrown by sheer bad luck and a faulty machine at a fair back in time
at first the immediate goal is just to meet up and go back to their own time but after a number of hilarious and unfortunate events they find out that after another set of events that the future of their planet is doomed
being rebelious teens the three attempt to find and prevent events that lead up to the worlds eventual distruction
however the more they learn the more trouble they get into
they are aided later on by some  past and future heros with equally bad luck but just the same its mostly about an adventure through time by a small group of highly unlikely heroes who generally dont have a clue as to what they are getting intoas for gameplay being a beging step in the evolution leading to the super rpgs of today its nothing too unique
you buy stronger weapons and armor and each character has magic techsspecializing in one elemental
however the real kick is in however the characters can tag team on special techs
there are three characters in a party at a time for a good reason and if a group of characters fight together longer they can eventually pull off some really sweet and in some cases funny looking double techs or even triple techs
why the rpgs of today dont try to mimic the brillence of the triple tech idea today i dont know
it worked wonders for chrono triggerone of the best games ever created
no point in haveing a long winded review it has all been said beforei cant praise this game enough
and i even know perfectly well that i wont affect anyones buying decision more than any other reviewer all the reviews give it five stars
 i just want to babble for a few minutes about how godly this game iswe all know that the rpg is the pinnacle of video game achievement and of course chrono trigger is the epitome of everything that a brilliant rpg should be
the battle system  the very core and foundation of the roleplaying genre  is exceptional here simple yet deep a highly strategic gem of gameplay atop an ingenius motif comprised of deceptively few major elements for such involved tactics
for once the protagonists can truly interact with each other in battle
and the engine even takes coordinates and physics into account
thats all im going to say thats all that needs to be said
just trust me when i say that this system is second to none
anyone who plays chrono trigger will find its storyline to be of the highest quality and most epic depth as any of the choicest plots found throughout squaresofts entire library
never has there been a more coherent storyline presented in such a twisting intertwining path
can you say quotdeepquotdid i mention that chrono triggers soundtrack takes first place above the scores of not only all other rpgs and not only all other video games but all other products ever presented on any electronic medium whatsoever
well it does
mitsuda is that brilliant
he even tops uematsus topnotch work on ff for crying out loud
and he tops that by a lot too
of course ya gotta love cts graphics
it has some nice effects and other than that its an allaround aesthetic treat the best on the snes in my opinion
enough said on that frontthats everything i believe
what more is there to say
perfect scorebreath of fire   is the best of all bof  has multi endings  inteligent dialog    the characters are very deep   note i hate what they did to bof in the playstation  the world map just vanish  and the put that stupid dotted map arrrggg   bof  in the last of the series that has a decent world map the only thing bad was the tranlation  various references to the frist game have beem mispelled  but nothing that bad anyway breath of fire is another rpg classic series
it was capcoms experiment into the genre as squaresoft ventured on with their final fantasy series
when i first heard of breath of fire i played the first game for super nes and liked it
breath of fire  just wasnt all that great to me and while it wasnt a terrible game it didnt have the classic feel the first game had
my friend karl reviewer karl jordan kudos to him enlightened me by showing me breath of fire and boy have i been enlightened
after playing hours on end of this game breath of fire  is vastly overrated
this game has all the classic elements an rpg needsthe gooda wonderful storyline involving a fake religion and ryus misplaced childhood is one of the best written rpg stories
this same storyline has been used countless times even within the series but no other game pulled it off as well as this
the characters are awesome and i think this has the best ryu and nina out of all the breath of fire games
the graphics are reasonably good considering its an early snes game
the music
very good indeed
there are times when it sounds like final fantasy and at others mega man x
simply great music
not perfect why carp
the battle system is also good in the fact that you can do different abilities examples nina can use will to revive her mp sten uses rip to play dead etc
etc
for some odd reason this hasnt carried over into the other games in the series afterwardsthe badthe only bad things i can say about the game are these ryus dragon transformation is really lackluster here and its been improved upon in later bof entries the translation isnt all that greatoverallclassic
definitely a fine rpg if i ever saw one
im not sure why bof  is considered the best by many then again in this day and age hardly anyone ever cares for the old games
bof  in my opinion is a decent game overall but lacks the great qualities that this game possesses
its a shame that this game goes unnoticed in todays gamersbreath of fire ii is a solid game all the way
from the straightforward leveling up system to the great story this game is among my most recommended
the thing about breath of fire ii i really like is the soundtrack every piece is wellmade and fits very well with its perspective locations
the control is excellent and the menus are very simple to navigate and understand
the graphics are very sharp for its time the characters in battle are drawn to perspective and the enemies are also quite creepy and creative
very few snes rpgs get the character perspective correct like breath of fire ii does so that is a real major plus for me
the sound effects also have that memorable capcom chime to it like the snes mega man x games which is another plus since i love the mega man x games on snes
overall i highly recommend this game to any rpg or capcom fan you will not be disappointed in the slightestits hard to talk about this game without spoiling what made it so fun for me to play as a kid
this is an rpg series that was created by square back before they became squareenix
after the first breath of fire the series was passed off to capcom and they did a great job of keeping it good
in fact i think this would be my favorite of the series
the story gameplay and soundtrack deliver and if youre a fan of capcom then you probably have this gamepart one was awesome
part  is even better
everything you love in part  you love in part  a lot more to do in here
if you do the side quest
you can see the originals characters from part one into part  if you find a right side quest
you can play as one of the original characters from bof from part  great game great storythis is the best bof
the thing that sucks about this one and the fisrt bof is the dragons
not bad though
second only to zeldathis is actually one of the few games i finished to the very end and enjoyed it
even though i must confess i might not have managed as well had i not used the game genie
the game genie was no help when it came to boss fights and the end bosses however
so i guess i can give myself some credit
anyway it is a great game
bringing up treasure chests with the fishing pole is quite an ordeal
i like to start new games just to see what i can get along the way from fighting the monsters
when youre lucky a monster might drop a rare item
this to me is more fun than anything elseas with the original mega man series the x series hits its highest point with the third installment in the series
enter dr doppler creator of doppler town a seemingly benevolent scientist with also dark intentions
he resurrects vile and attempts to destroy x and zero who pose his threat to his mysterious plot and someone elses plot
the fact that this game is so damned rare ticks me off because this is truly the finest game in the series
its completely understandable if you dont own this game because of its rarety but if you dont know own the game simply out of spite you do not know what you are missing
read on for the good and the bad why dont you people stop copying me and stick to your pros and cons
about this game and if you dont want to read anyway or you face the fires of hellthe goodzero is a playable character
finally the bad is available to control
he does have his shortsights however get to that later
the graphics are good as always and unlike the previous two this game was a lot harder
not necessarily ballstothewalls hard but a pleasantly increased difficulty
there are many secrets to find like the armor pieces and the awesome armor chip that lets you have all  armor enhancements at once
theres a point in the game when you can adopt zeros lightsaber sorry no spoilers
find out how to get it yourself
while i love mega man x this one did have a more complete storyline than x
nice to know capcom decided to give it more a story to increase gaming valueive noticed several people mainly outside of amazon that diss on the music score
while some of the music like blizzard buffalos for example just seem to drone there were other tunes that struck me as ultimate such as gravity beetle and volt catfishs themes
plus vile returns and since hes the boba fett of mega man x he rulesthe badonce zero dies hes gone for good
i dont understand why capcom decided to do this the only reason i can think of would be to make the game more difficult
still making zero a wussy is a deadly sin
other than that no more gripesthe verdictthis rare gem is one of the finest games to emerge from the super nes series
at first it seems strange the ol mega man feeling that was strongly in the first x game and somewhat in x seems almost absent here nevertheless this game takes on its own feeling and its pulled off exceptionally making it the best x game in the series
dont let this rare gem escape its a fine collectors treasure and i shun all of you who want this game purely for quotcompleting the x seriesquot  this is a wellmade game that deserves to be played
those who want the game out of love should have first dibs alwaysi own the japanese version of the game and mega man x is by far the best mega man ever made
ive beaten the game hundreds of times and i really think it should come to gba
its a very rare  expensive title though because capcom stopped making the game earlier than usual
 users will have to pay a pretty penny for the game but in all reality it is worth it buy it before it becomes impossible to do somega man x is one of the best games and better than x x x
in x you can play x or zero mega man x had many many sercets like the gold armor
to get it you have to get all pf the heart tanks have all of the armor powerups full of  etanks go to the doppler stage and start at the first stage have full health beat the trex boss and be careful not to get hurt and waste one of your etanks if you do you will not get the powerup
if you have the gold armor you will have the edge to beat sigma
if you are a huge fan of mega man x buy this gameif youve played a game in this series already understand that the concept remains unchanged
and why stray from a winning formula
the price tag for this game is justified because of the advanced chips used in the cart as well as this titles status as a rarity extremely hard to find
i own every title in the series and have to say that this one barley edges out the original and heres whyx has the newfound potential to perform an upward thrusting jump once youve found the necessary component the x armors are vastly improved the upgrade capsules are well hidden and sometimes frustratingly annoying to access the game has more mini bosses than before the music is once again outstanding and you get to control zero for the first time in dramatic fashion as if to sayhe has returned
need i say more
i never got the chance to complete this game because i actually got my hands on it later in my life when i didnt have too much time to play it
the game is pretty difficult as well so if you found the previous two installments to be pretty easy as i did this one is a worthy and engrossing challengemega man x is awesome a classic the best of the best best video game ever buy this game if your a super nintendo fan you wont be sorrythis is a newer update review here are some tatics and staics for the bosses to kept this short i wil not tell how the games ends just tastic to use to make it fasters and easier at boss fight
here are static and tips for frost buffalo may very per gamethe first time you fight frost buffao trie use a fully charged megabuster as muchas possible s since rapid fire resitance is the same as in previous game  to  hitsmegabuster is stronger like in original series on nes and playstation strenght  to  hits will kill this maverick if charge up to max blast strenth
 use the same startegy for the stay puff marshmellow man sized doctor robotnik lookikg robot boss that fight before this in the epilogue stagedue tunnel rhino next his weakness is the frost shield i think megabusters is not as effective take like thrice the hits  that white buffalo took so either experiments and she if ice shield does more damage will dogging if not use megabuster until you get his super weaknessi have to go to a reaustarant with peole in my program iahave this sent know
i will resend it later redited and update with this notice cut out and strategies for the other boss fights
some times if the computer goes a slept for to long this is somewhat rare it might not be able to reactice and bypass sleep mode with out doing a reset i done want to risk lose all this textthanks for reading this you go mega manby far the golden child of the megaman games as a whole
no load times beautiful sprites and terrific gameplay make this game a super triple a titlealthough  i do recommend picking this up as part of the anniversary collection on gamecube  it includes the unreleased anime sequences they originally included in this game
they are extraordinary and the music is also slightly different orchestral i thinkotherwise
excellent gamemega man x
part three of sevenreintroducing the mm franchise on the snes turned out to be a great success for both capcom and the fans
x brought forth a new twist to mm gaming and x continued to push its greatness even further
by then the x series was well received and fans were satisfied for the time
then enter x
surprisingly this new game got very little to no attention by fans and was more often then not dismissed as just another mm game
part of the blame for this came from capcom for not releasing very many copies
so gamers settled for only the first two x games and ignored the third one
after finally playing it for myself i must say people you dont know what youre missing here
this game is the defining entry of the series and yet its extremely underrated
why
lets take a closer look at xprosgreat storyline
a reploid scientist named dr doppler builds a neurocomputer that manages to suppress any mavericklike tendencies a reploid would develop
this worked so well that the reploids decided to build the perfect utopian reploid city called dopplertown
however doppler only wanted to do this in order to build an army of reploids who would change to mavericks at his command
throughout the game and up to the end there are some very good story elements introducedthe ability to play as zero
okay so you cant control him everywhere like you can in the next few sequels but it still helps
anywhere in a level up until a boss you can call zero to replace x hes not much different from controlling x but his bigger size and zsaber charge attacks give him some distinctionloads of secrets to find
thats right
there are many more secrets to find in x than in x and theyre all hidden very well
in addition to the standard armors subtanks and heart tanks there are also armor ride chips super armor parts and zeros saber to collecta perfect assortment of robotridearmorvehicles
once you find the standard rrav you can call on different rravs when you locate the three other chips
they come in handy in a variety of situations
for instance if x needs to bash through ice the krrav can crunch through with its spinning spike clawsalterring the later bosses of the game by defeating earlier ones with certain weapons
there are only a couple of places where you can do this but it can affect key areas
for instance if you defeat bit and byte with the proper weapons im not gonna say what they are find them yourself
 you get to face a different boss during one of the doppler stagesthe stages here are the most well designed of all the x games
they are all lengthy and challenging yet complex enough to give the player secrets to find
sadly after x capcom downgraded themselves to making the stages merely easy linear warmup exercises for x gamers however capcom did bring back the complex stages in xcontrary to popular belief most of the music here is awesome and fits the x series very well unlike much of x and xs music
well not every tune is good but every bit of it still rocks
the music may not have the catchiness of other x game tunes but many of them zero intro stage crush crawfish volt catfish and viles level are very good and memorableone last pro the bosses here are the most difficult to beat
this is a very good thing and something that its sequels are seriously lacking in
one thing i will point out is that many of the bosses must be beaten with another weapon which forces you to figure out where to start
i wont say whereconszero only gets one life
why
if you die just once with zero you can never play as him again unless you start a new game
this means you cant make any stupid mistakes such as slipping onto a patch of spikes if you wish to keep him the whole game
also you cant use him to fight bosses
its a bit disappointing but im not complainingwhile most of the games music is very good a couple of tunes such as xs intro theme and blizzard buffalos theme come off as droning and annoying
still this is better than the bad music of later sequelsmost people wont be instantly attached to x as much as its prequels
just give this game time to grow on you and many fans will find this to be one of the best if not the best x gamedespite the fact that this game lurks in the towering shadows of its prequels x is the defining episode and a very strong mm and snes game in which capcom mastered the x series in the gameplay and story department
i give x five stars for being overall the best game in the x series
from here things would change a bit
x saw the series upgraded in terms of graphics and it stayed true with the action but the lack of a proper challenge factor hurt the series and it continued to be a greater problem in x and x
despite this by all means play every x game
beginners start with x x or x
then move onto the others
if you are a true fan of mm games like me get equipped with elec beam do yourself justice and hunt down this game
but dont just go by what ive said
only when you have played x for yourself will you truly understand why its one of the greatest mm games of all timether are very few games that are worth this kind of dough
when i looked this one up the price had me spinning
after purchasing this game i have officially topped of my snes collection and its impossible to be a hardcore megaman fan without this game
if your a fan of skillful fighting suicide jumps that you actually make and etc you may find a warmer welcome with the plain megamans  through  however if your passion is new bigger weapons that wreak the ultimate havoc on evil pick this one up believe the hefty price tag is nothing compared to the smiles this game will put on your facefor  this is one of the greatest rpgs ever
ya i know that was  years ago but the super nintendo is still the king of rpgs and the best rpgs will probably always be on there as d graphics were mastered during this time
nintendo is making a good choice in reproducing such games as this onto the gbalufia ii is actually before the times of lufia i and you play as the stars maxim selan guy and artea as well as others in the quest to remove the sinistrals
in the love story behind maxim and tia the unintelligent dekar the overintelligent lexis the compassionate artea the understnding selan and of course guy all venture to the fortress of doom to rid the world of the sinstralslucky for me i havent finished the game so i dunno the whole game
lufia ii is truly final fantasys competitive rpg
ff fansll love the turnbased system as well as the romance truly the golden sun of its timethis game intentionally or perhaps unintentionally takes the best parts of final fantasy  and  us and mystic quest and makes it into a product that everyone can lovethe story this is sappy and predictable but those kinds of stories go well together with turn based rpg format
the story has just enough ridges to make perk up your ears at points but is far from shakespeargraphics this game looks absolutely splendid
i feel that square could learn a thing or two here
you get this ship that gets fitted with an engine to become a submarine or something then it gets a balloon on top and becomes an airship
the whole vehicle thing felt like an inside joke to final fantasy s vehicle absurdity
the effects for the story and map where also a slice of  bit splendor
take it all in because this here is flavor countrygameplay i realy feel they borrowed from legend of zelda and mystic quest in a good way where it came to the dungeon puzzle portion
they took something from mystic quest that was actually good
the puzzles werent exactly up to par with a mensa exam but i fealt proud when i got solved a board
the rpg combat was simular to a dragon quest or final fantasy
this too is a good thing
in addition to magic items hit things with swords they had this rage meter thing that accumulated
when an item you are wearing builds up you can unleash a special attack or magic spell
this adds dimensions to what was already a competant gamemusic this music was terrific for a snes game
truth time i actualy have some of the tracks from this game on my mp player but they are hidden so dont even try to look
music is never a reason to buy or play a game but it is often an insentive to replay a game
just thinking about those tossed melodeys makes me want to break out the snes and cancel all my appointmentsbonus there are these capsule monsters that you find laying around in dungeons
they bear a striking resemblance to pokemon
how awsome would ff have been if you had a pikachu facsimile in your team
you evolve them by feeding them fruit and things
i fed mine alot of broad swords which is like the equivelant to mac n cheese for capsule monsters i guess
they arent exactly game changing contributers to your party but they add an extra level of fun to an already great game
its the little things that make a good game greatbottom line is that if you fancy yourself any kind of  bit rpg afficionado you need this tittle for your collection
hell i would even recommend it to casual gamers
the first hour is kinda long but once this game gets you there is no walking awaythis game is pretty amazing
improvements in this over the original graphics are improved but retain the cool retro style music vastly improved the addition of lots of challenges and puzzles the mystic cave is now randomized the game is more challenging and the overall pace seems betteri only hate that you kind of know what happens at the end if you played even  minutes into lufia well worth a stroll down memory lanethe lufia series is quite underrated as i stated in the review of the first one
while the first lufia was a great game the prequel deserves even more respect as it is one of the best rpgs for the snesstory if you made it past the introduction in the first lufia game then congrats the ending of lufia ii has just been spoiled
however the plot was made for those who were curious on how maxim selan arty and guy made it to doom island
the game takes place  years before the first one in a land that is seperate from the one in the original
the plot has more depth better characters more dialogue and more emotion than the originalgraphics well its an snes game that was made  years ago
ive seen much better graphics on the system but they really dont matter
theyre an improvement over the original with the same colorful sprites with staring eyessoundmusic an improvement over the original but really has nothing memorable
however its no big deal reallygameplay the gameplay leaps and bounds over the orignal
this time the many dungeons are more zeldalike with challenging puzzles and items to use
besides the world map none of the battles are random
the enemies show on screen and move when you do or when you swing your sword
the battle system is like the original but with improvements
now you can feed and raise seven monsters and let them evolve into a valuable fifth party member
also in the game are ip attacks which are kind of like limit breaks and what they do is based on what equipment you have onalso in the game is the ancient cave which consists of  random floors with a boss at the end
it doesnt matter what level you are on because once you enter you are reset to level  the dragon eggs make a comeback too along with forfeit islandremember how on my review for the orignal i described the games flaws
lufia ii vaporizes these
the target system is fixed
there is more room for items
you can save in dungeons as well
best of all all the items and magic you get has a descriptionbuy
 like i said in the first review snes games saves can currupt easily due to their aging batteries
so i reccomend you to get this game on a rom
if you are against that you should either throw caution to the wind and dowload it or just buy the game and then download the romput zelda and final fantasy in a melting pot and you got lufia ii
that alone should pressure you to check it outi liked it and all its just that this game didnt seem to have a heavy theme as lufia i did  the impending doom surrounding the gameto me lufia   was a little better beacuse the graphics were better and the game is a little bit more fun then the first one  this lufia your are maxim the person u are in lufia at the beginning at doom island  well check out this game this game is really goodthis game in my childhood was the beacon of wakefullness
i would awaken at  am to play for four hours straight until i went to school where i would think about its greatness until i came home only to play for another few hours
this perfectly describes its pull and incredible execution
the battle system was markedly improved over its limping predecessor and the storyline served compulsion to the very end
this was a prequel of sorts to lufia  and what a brilliant story it is
i wouldnt want to ruin the story for any prospective buyer so i wont divulge any details but take my humble word for itthis game is very worth your money and should be a part of anybody rpg lovers librarylufia  the prequel to the first lufia is an often overlooked masterpiece
the story is both engaging and charming and actually attempts to develop the characters in some interesting ways rather than just having them out questing against evil the whole time
where the game really shines is with all of its puzzles and secrets hidden throughout the dungeon
while becoming gradually more difficult as the game progresses the puzzles also become more creative and you will rarely see the same thing twice
a tool ring that  includes items like bombs and a hookshot add a bit of a zelda element to this rpg
i highly recommend it to any fan of snes rpgskirby as you know is the little pink guy who swallows enimies and gains powers by doing so
its a very fun game with many gamesspring breeze in this quickie you go through  levels to get back the stolen fooddyna blade this time you have to defeat a giant bird
you can return to levelsthe great cave offensive this ones fun
try to find all  hidden treasures as you try to escape the caverevenge of meta knight i like this one
you have to destroy meta knights warship halberd
you also hear the conversations between the crew
notice that the game is timedmilky way wishes now you have to stop the sun and moon from fighting wtf
to do that you have to go to other planets to gain their power
you cant gain powers by swallowing enemies this time gasp
 but you find in hidden places powers that last forever
a cool gamethe arena in this tough game you have to defeat all the bosses and mini bosses
for a challange try beating it without powersthe game also has minigamesgourmet race race dedede while collecting food in  tracksmegaton punch try to defeat your enimies in a strength competitionsamauri kirby test your reflexesa great feature in this game is that kirby can turn his power into a computercontrolled buddy
if you have a nd controller you can control the buddyits a helluva game and a must get for your snes collectionliked kirby for the gameboy or neswant to play with  peoplelike kirbylike alot of colorthen this game is for youkirby is fun and will provide about  hours of gameplayif your an amature worth great to play with friendssaves game dataabout  full gamesits difficult for my to choose
because i really love kirby   dreamland but this has to be it
my favorite kirby game
ive heard people call this a collection of mini gamesthat does not do this game justice
because each so called mini game is fully developed and finely produced
unique gameplay original soundtracks this is the perfect kirby game
really the best of all worlds
and thankfully nintendo knows what a gem they have here
of course the there is the original snes port
but its also available as kirby superstar ultra on the ds and a downloadable title for wii vc
if you missed it back in the s do yourself a favor and check it out nowof all  the games in the kirby franchise this one is probably one of my favorites
it has  different games to play each one offering a completely different experience
i would recommend this game to any fans of the kirby franchisewhen i bought this game i knew it would be awsomeeven though i beat it completly with i still play it and love iti cant wait to get nightmare in dreamlandthis game is so addicting it never ends
u start out as a boy who has a farm and you go to the town and talk to everyone and u buy some seeds and just start planting and watering them you also get a dog yay  and after they grow u pick them up and put them in a bin and get money and just repeat the process until u can get cows chickens other crops
u can chop wood and make a bigger house get a wife have kids even build a greenhouse to grow crops in the winter
u can go fishing go exploring in caves go to church go to a bar
the options are limitless
and u dont ever have to stop
the way the game is layed out it reminds me of zelda another great game
i used to spend hours playing this game i have wasted so much of my life trying to build up my farm lol
best thing to do is mute the game music put in a good cd and kick back and play away
the only bad thing about this game is the price yikes almost  dollars its worth it though
u wont be disappointed with this game
its a cult classic and with good reason
the sequels are fun as well but i like to stick with the original sometimeswhen i first found this i had absolutely no idea that this game would be so good
all i really wanted was just a little break from squaresoft rpgs but what i got was the first game in a whole new awesome seriesby now everyone knows what harvest moon is all about  you have a certain number of years to run a successful ranch by farming crops raising animals and selling various kinds of produce
you upgrade your tools into stronger and more efficient ones and you visit town to buy things or talk to peoplenow ive played the psx version harvest moon back to nature as well
although that one is excellent and from what i hear better than the n version i have to agree with the other reviewer bart  this game just has a classic quotfeelquot about it that the others cant quite match
maybe its the style or maybe its just because it was the original and the first one i played
i dont knowanyway though if you can still find this game in any capacity get it
and then after youve seen what its like grab the playstation and game boy versions
they may not be exactly the same or inspire that same feeling but you certainly wont be disappointed eitheri dont know what else i can say about this game that others havent already
this is a good wholesome game where you are a farmer trying to restore the old family homestead and start a family
there is no monsters to fight no world to save no sidescrolling adventure
you just do farm things
you would be surprised how fun managing a farm and hoeing your field realy can be
im surprised this hasnt become some kind of ipad app
i could totally see people playing this on a bus on their phones
i am simply surprised more farmi admit the resale price is steep but if you have you can stomach the  price tag and like snes games you will not be sorry for getting harvest moonharvest moon is a roleplaying game like no other
i even had my doubts when i played it but it instantly became one of my favorite games of all times
basically for anyone who hasnt played a hm harvest moon game heres basically it in a summary
you plant seeds raise cows and chickens and you get married to any girl sorry only the girls in the game
if you own an snes get this game
its worth any price even though i got mine for  but still its a rare gameconcept take a real life job and turn it into one of the most creative games to dategraphics the graphics were a little degrading why do i say this because it was one of the last games releasted on the snes
but still it doesnt mattersound the sound quality is good and it kinda affected me in a nostalgic wayplaybility i can summarize this in one word
simpleentertainment its snes goodness worth any price but its kinda shortreplay highalex i can still vividly remember buying hm snes from gamesless in hb
back in  as i recall it cost a reasonable price compared to todays prices
hm just drew me in i was tired of all those sidescrolling games and needed something fresh  original
i read an article bout hm in a videogame magazinegame pro or nintendo power remember those magazines hardcore gamers
lo and behold after arrivinghome i popped it into my snes console which i no longer haverip
this game would be best described as afarming sim and rpg
there are no clocks time passes from sun up to sun down
if youre playing you reallyhave to watch if its getting dark
you start on a farm and are given a house the rest is up to you how tomanage your farm
fortunately there are villagers who help you along the way
this game is not for everyoneif you like action games this game will bore you to death
it takes quite a bit of patience to get settled inyou reap what you sow applies to hm you get what you put into it
if you find a copy of this game the pricesare just ridiculous for hm on amazon
if you have a wii just buy it on the virtual console for  wii points
recommended only for hardcore rpgsim fanatics like me loli admit i am a harvest moon junkie
i played the first one on nes and loved it so i have gotten most of the series
if you want a non violent learning responsibility  cultivation of friendships and yes even innocent romantic  relationshipsteaching to share teaching time management game for yourself or your child this is a awesome game
each  game gets progressive more detailed with more people  and things you can do
you receive gifts  from people you befriend or sometimes they gift you outright
the later ones your spouse  yes you can get married helps you around the farm you can assign them chores
this first one does have a time limit  you have to finish it in a certain amount of game daysthe later ones do not have time limits on themlater harvest moons lets you choose to be a boy or a girl  magical melody lets you choose as well as a couple of othersone of my favorite series hands downsf was an arcade sensation
it revolutionized fighting games with its graphics sound effects and most importantly combo hits
its no wonder why sf sold millions when it was released for the snes
this version does justice to the arcade game with awesome graphics awesome sounds and awesome gameplaythe combos are in the game
this was the game by which other similar fighting games were judged by
also look for sf turbo which is the original sf with playable bosses such as balrog vega sagat and m bison and turbo modes increase the speed of the game to lightning speedthiswa the orginal street fighter   this is my personal favorite
although this game is nothing compared to the rendered d or combo air move dgmaes out now this game is still nothing short of awesome
in the late s i actually pumped my  dollar a week allowance into aracde machines to play the orignial street fighter
street fighter   although that game is nothing short of pathetic compared to street fighter 
 slectable characters  unselectable bossesgave this game more replay value than the orignal street fighter
and this game is still pretty hard to the new commer games
the reason why i way that sure there are no  hit air combo super finishers but this game is strategic nonetheless
it took a real rpoto pull off a hit combo
the specials were even hard to pull off
at arcades it took me months to learn the fireball and then learn the dragon punch
and even longer to learn  hit comboslet alone mixing weak medium and fierce moves into a special move
antoher note button mashing was utterly useless in this game
if you just amshed buttons you would fail
this game forced players to think about moves
come up with endless counters and such
bosses like vega were for the most part difficultdue to the fact specials were hard to pull off
and the game could only really be won by a true expert
this game was far better than the orginal street fighterwhich was basically primitive button mashing
another note in the orignal street fighter special moves were impossble to do
not even mashing buttons could produce a fireball
in sf special moves were possible and were only done by a pro
although in later sfs special moves were watered down
and in super street fighter ii turbo we were introduced to thje birth of super moves which were in their primitive state
this game is awsome althoughdue to the bit graphics sometimes annoying slowdown and no flash
most younger games will undoubtly despise this game
but if you were around in the early s everyone knows that sf was thee gamein  street fighter ii the sequel to the original s capcom arcade fighting hit street fighter has released in of course the arcades and multiple systemsthe sega genesis game boy and the super nintendo the most powerful bit video game console of all time 
in case some of you guys didnt know street fighter ii was the first fighting game to ever revolutionize the fighting game genre
it was so big that it created a huge audience of fans and on top of that capcom was making big bucks when this game released 
plus some sfii merchandise was made but most of them were cheesy during those times
the action figures which was originally made by the guys who gave you gi joe figures really looked corny but the figures that were made in japan looked perfectly articulated and well crafted you can see them in some stores where they sell comic books and japanese anime merchandise
plus in  they made a horrible live action street fighter movie based on it and boy it was a mistake to make the movie in the first place 
the sfii anime movie was even better according to real fans of the series
anyways let me drop the subject 
im about to give you the lowdown on the game man i love saying that 
the graphics look great for an snes game
nicely animated character sprites and backgrounds are really something to look at including those fireballs shooting straight 
but due to todays standards they seem a little bit outdated and they dont seem to surpass the animation of sfii turbo
the audio is fine
the music for each character stage sounds cool and theyre so unforgetable it always sticks to some peoples heads
and the sounds of heavy and light hitting sound pretty cool but the grunts and yells sound a little weird but it fits perfectly
the line of characters well in that year it was fine by us
but unfortunately just by looking at it today  fighters is not really enough but at least these characters are kick serious arse 
you got ryu ken chunli guile zangief dhalsim and blanka 
each of them are very simple to master once youve played the game a few times
and as for the gameplay its a kind of a good blend but some flaws are seen
you get a fairly good deal of game modes but the controls seem to be a little slow
even with that flaw it totally makes it up for the slow playability with a good variety of moves to pull out 
and it has a fairly good gameplay balance due to that kind of variety
but even with those flaws and the fact that its not really the best street fighter game of all time street fighter ii had what it takes to become one of the most unforgetable and revolutionary d fighting games of all time 
if youre going to buy an old snes along with some good olschool games like contra  castlevania vampires kiss mario kart breath of fire ii and all those hits dont forget street fighter ii 
your collection isnt complete without any game bearing the sfii nameeven if you got mortal kombat street fighter ii on the super nintendo was a fighting legend
it had great graphics wellthought characters and special moves
it has a lot of things that the arcade version has like choosing difficulty
believe it or not chunli one of the characters in street fighter ii was the first girl character to be in the fighting genre
all difficultys are hard even  since you will have trouble on m bison the final boss of the game
they released this game a lot of times on so many consoles
overall i think you should buy this game or if you have a few more extra bucks street fighter ii turbo or super street fighter iigreat game but its so hard
not a great fighting gamer though
product arrived quickly with no defects whatsoever
a cheap snes game thats an excellent addition to any collectionthis was the best fighting game on snes mk sucked compared to this game the characters where awesome this is a must have for snesthis game brings me back memories growing up as a kid i loved this game
it was worth it to find it and get it again now my son can enjoy it as wellstreet fighter ii is the biggest arcade fighter around
its no doubt the console versions were also very popularyou get to choose from  different fighters and you must battle other fighters to move ononce in a awhile there would be a bonus stage where you get to destroy either a brick wall or a cool carplayer pits you against your friend as you get to choose your difficulty setting and your characters
there are two difficulty settings so you and your friend can have a balanced fightoverall its a musthave fighting game for the classic super nesthis has always been a great game
its so much easier playing it on this platform than xbox and all its buttons street fighter  revolutionized fighting video games when it came out in the early s
in fact this was the main reason that many people including myself ran out and bought a super nintendo
because it was nearly arcadeperfect and only available for the snes it spelled the beginning of the end of segas console dominance the genesis was on top at the time
the eight fighters come from different parts of the world and have their own distinctive look and fighting style
each has their own animated background stages and reamarkably good theme music
the basic gameplay and control scheme became a fighting game standard copied by many other titles including mortal kombat
harder kicks and punches do more damage but are more difficult to land
with special attacks and the ability to block the gameplay is remarkably deep
the game provides the ability to customize the control scheme and it always annoyed me how each of my friends always had modify the settings before each bout
some say this game is somewhat slow but that was remedied in the sequels
street fighter  is one of the alltime classics right up there with pacman and space invaders
it led to many sequels each of which offered minor enhancements but no significant changes to the gameplay itself
you owe it to your self to buy this game if you have an snes youll be glad you didthe colors are really cool
its alright when you have a cocacola or something
one thumb up
b way to go karatethis game looks greatlooks like its going to be alot of funa great christmas giftmany hrs
of gaming will be enjoyedthis game was pretty fun
i never expected it to be as funas it was
most disney games are good
just like thier movies
its worth checking out or if your a disney fan you should by this gameif you liked this game then check out all of the other mickey mouse related gamesget this game if you like a platforming game
get this if you like disney
get this if you even like gaming
i promise you you will not be disappointed
its a little bit on the difficult side but once you get the hang of it it will the most fun youve had in a whilethis game is one of the best snes games ever in my opinion
for a capcom title id consider it somewhat underrated
its basically a d platformer
you could say its somewhat similar to mario world or the dkc series
knock out baddies by jumping on their heads or use special power upspass the main stages to fight bosses
yeah weve seen it a million times on the super nes
but capcom really did it  on magical quest
the gameplay is fantastic very consistent
the graphics are very cartoonish but they still look great all these years later
and music
wow a favorite snes soundtrack of mine
especially the dark forest themeclassic
and if youre worried about this being too kiddy
well let me tell you this
i swear the third zone is basically mickey mouse in hell
if youve played this you know what im talkin bout
but really i only have well   complaints
no run button
on many snes sidescrollers holding y will allow you to runthey didnt use that here
that said all these years later i still hold y wen playing this only hoping hell speed up
x
too hort
this game is very short
there are  worlds but only consisting of a couple levels each
a partially skilled player can easily beat this in less than  minutes 
this may sound like a dumb complaint based on my  too short  but there is no save feature password access or level select screen
sometimes i wanna play a specific level in this but would have to play through several levels just to reach it
minor complaintoverall and once again this is an amazing game from start to finish
i recommend any s gamer who hasnt played this to definitely check it out
like i said before if you loved super mario world and the donkey kong country series check this out
also there are  sequels
 is called the great circus mystery
number  is magical quest  starring mickey and donald however it was only released in japan initiallybut it made it to the states on the gameboy adavance
so break out your gamecube  gba adaptor for that oneas a fan of the kingdom hearts series i thought i should go back and play this game
it is still as fun as it was when i was a kid
like the partnership between square enix and disney capcom and disney made a sweet game hereawesome i used to play this as a kid watching my kids play this brings back a lot of memories and really oil playing games i played as a kidbetter deal than taco bell son
just click this up and play bro hours of fabtastical fun that is my flavoritei love top gear
its a very simple racer that involves strategic refueling and other than that your lead foot or thumb and pumping music you could never forgetsure the d graphics arent as good as todays but theyre nice and tothepoint
every place makes you feel like youre there and racing with your friend makes it the world tour youve dreamed of speeding throughyou may choose from four unique cars each with their own specs and choose your standard automatic transmission or if youre a little bit of an enthusiast you may choose the hardtouse automatic transmission
i wont stop you from any of your choiceshave fun and find out why ive revered this game like i do our lordwow
this really tops my list of quotstar trekquot games
ive already spent hours on it and love it
its rather difficult even on the easy setting
your enemies shoot back at you and it take some real effort to knock them down
although in real life its better to stun your enemies rather than kill them its better to kill in this game
stun just makes them come back more mad than beforei recommend this game for any quotstar trekquot fan or just anyone that wants to have a good time shooting up everything
get this one todaythe entire game focuses on the idea of stealth
you cant just go running with phasers firing at random
the away team is an elite away team who use lastest starfleet technology to enter into missions with the maxmium stealth
you can use phaser phaser rifles sniper rifle grenades and plenty of special tools to do a stealth operation
this is not a shotem up game its a stealth game
you cant just go into a mission and shot the enemy because in some missions that will cuz a mission failed
in one level you cant even be seen by any guards
so buy this game and think of ways not to be seen by guards and sneak around corners
there is no beginners level to this game however first  are easy enough to get your stealth up
buy the game and prepare for stealth operationsthis is a wonderful game
the gameplay is spectacular the controls are easy to learn and use and the screen layout and look are stupendous
this is one of my favorite star trek games out there
it provides hours of challenging and exciting fun
the characters are intelligent and witty
also be on the lookout for some of the crew of the enterprise nccd that isman i just finished playing dragon warrior monster for over  hours and let me tell you you dont want to miss this game periodi remember playing this game for  hours for the first time then restarted
then i played for another  hours then restarted again because ive found the complete monster breeding chart
nowwhat kind of game does make you wanting to restart again after two hours of playing huh
this is game is simply incredible
ive read some reviews and trust me this game is not a pokemon clone actually i feel sorry for the game for being compared with pokemon really
i have several other great games i wanted to play however i couldnt play them because i was cling to dragon warrior monster for over  hoursso whats so great about this gamefirst of all this game is straight from dragon warrior game creators meaning that you will be getting all the great elements from dragon warrior series such as delicately yet addictively balanced game play thats right your health points might be only  but its much better than having  health point because its delicately balanced continuing sega of awesome music seriously give it up for koichi the master composer for dragon warrior series and you will recognize lot of musics from previous dragon warrior games plus if you are dragon warrior fans you are in real treat
 and story line which leaves you for wanting more
you know about story line it is really something
it starts out with little brother and sister trying to get some sleep then sister being kidnapped by this strange creature
then another creature comes out to help terry the brother to find his sister
you know seriously this story starts out like a fairy tale
you are probably thinking what kind of exciting story line could i expect from such fairytalelike story line
i dont know what enix did to this game however everytime you are playing you just want to play more and moreok i know that didnt help much however the way the set up the story with musicmusic plays a big role here and the way the story line is being proceeded its just great
there are areas you need to explore by the way every single area changes every time you go there meaning you wont be bored by same area same terrain because its different every time you go capture monsters and beat the boss at the end and tournaments which will literally test your monsters skill to the max and lot of side quests will just pull you in
im kind of guy who doesnt really get into finishing side quest however in dragon warrior monster not only its crucial part of story but it will also enhance your gaming pleasure greatly
theres this big sort of twist at the end and trust me i almost yelled out what the
after saving the sister i finished all the remaining special areas and beat monster tamer master and you are probably thinking so whats so special about beating monster tamer master
sounds corny monster tamer master
and you will only know why im making big deal out of beating monster tamer master only if you beat himok may be its only me who thought he was so hardyou know to be honest with you there arent that much to the story
you are in there to find your sister and you conquer each areas to be the winner of the tournament which grants you one wish
however i was never bored with throughout the story and its just so fairy talelike yet content is very substantial
well if you dont play this game its your loss for sureyou know i know there are really good games out there and even good rpg for gameboy console
however if you are looking away from this game because simply its a gameboycolor game not gb advance game then you are making a big mistake
seriously ive been playing lot of rpgs from gameboy system and i would pick this game over even games like dragon warrior  and  even games like golden sun which i enjoyed tremendously thats right even games like golden sunwell i hope that you would get this game and start right away because im starting dragon warrior monster  cobys journey
i drooling because i know what to expect
just make sure you get the complete monster breeding chart because its so impossible trying to breed over  monsters with mere luck
mark my word
enjoy it like i did tremendouslyso what am i making such a big deal out of this outdated gameboy color game
well think of it this way
you got yourself another copy of dragon warrior game imagine how happy you are then on top of that you are getting this ultraaddictive monster breeding action
now you might think monster breeding
oh please been there done that  oh you have no idea what you are talking about
its just so addictive sooooo addictive
monsters are not corny ok some are corny but when you are trying to breed top of line monsters oh man you better prepare extra batteries for a long treatok i think i said much yet feel that i havent really conveyed the significant reason why you have to play this game  seriously this is a total package a total packagethis game is much too great people say its a copy of pokemon wrong
pokemon is a copy of dragon warrior
this game is much more challanging even has a better story then the repetative story of pokemon which was might i add repeated in the first  games then in fire red and leaf green versions same old story same dead game however the three realeases of dragon monster warrior are individual and unique the first most of all allthough the two releases of dragon monster  do have allmost the same story but different cobis journy has added mission and added monsters plus a different character playing though anyway back to the dragon monster warrior  this game not only allows you to catch monsters but instead of using cheap pokeballs you get to catch them with meat somthing more logical sense most animals love meat this game fetures over   monsters not only that but instead of being limited to having one monster form by breaking your back to train one to evolve you can more easily build up monsters through breeding giving you more powerfull monsters heres a breeding tip for my best monster breed a rouge knight with any monster from the zombie family to make a mad knight then breed with battle rex to make a coatol it will say a new monster will be born it will be a coatol then add another battle rex to coatol and bam you got yourself the strongest dragon in the dragon family other then draco lord which isnt really a dragon this dragon had a high hp and a pretty good mp continue breeding coatols with battle rexes to make another and breed him with your original great drak and he gets stronger and stronger every time this monster will be your main power attack but be sure to incorperate the following skills heal revive and evil slash and transform this lets your monster transform into any monster which means strong bosses like lords that you cant handle find a way to incorperate copycat that knows transform into a dragon then breed with him to get this skill your next in command will be one of the slime family base off the slime you get at the start breed him with a healer that knows heal of course then continue breeding till hes strong enough to hold him own it will take forever but make sure he learns mega magic this skill drains your power but does tremendous damage then breed him with a metaly this monster has very high defense and can take alot of hits before he goes down make sure he learns the following skills upper blaze heal vivify he will be the main healer now get a funky bird theres a boss named funky bird if you cant catch him catch a dance veggie and mix with a bird hes going to be the stats guy he has abilities like panidance confuses an opponent hustle gives  healing points to all and other such well enjoy your purchase you will love it  create the ultimate monstersthis game is by far better than pokemon despite what many people think
dont get me wrong i loved the pokemon games for the gbc and if you liked them youll love this game too
think of final fantasy meets pokemon
theres a lot more strategy to this game and a lot more depth and you can put  hours into just beating the main plot easily
i have  hours into this game am still not really bored with it and still dont have any boss monsters of my own
this is just a really great rpg that will make a fantastic addition to anyones collection
hint  when you get the offer to breed with an iceman after winning a certain arena battle against teto breed your madcat itll make one of the highest hitting beasts in the game and makes the first several levels much much easier
you dont even have to level the madcat up just use him how he ishands down one of the best of all time
the only thing i can think of to match this is the sequel to thisdwm taras adventures or pokemon firered
this game is similar to pokemon get monsters train them and fight
it can be strangely addicting and awesomely fun
i havent played this in about  years but i decided to write a review after seeing it on here
this game is great for kidsonce they get to the age where they can read
now the game is also quite rare ive havent seen it in or store since  so the prices may be high for that reasonnow go out and get the game you wont regret itif your an individual who likes rpgs you will enjoy the story to this game and find no issue with it what so ever hey even those who write the negative reviews dont complain about the story on this game thats saying something right 
the gameplay however is different i will not go into detail about it as amazons discription does a good enough job of that
all i will say is that the gameplay is just plain different i think if you are looking for the traditional style rpg lving system and set up you will be disapointed
think of this game like playing a card game for those of you who have played magic or whatever other card games are out there the trick is in your set up but your deck can only be so big
also like pokemon your team is of monsters you have captured
as for the lv  complaint everyone has this game is really not about lving up like a traditional rpg
the producers just went for a different feelstylealright so i was looking for a sega dreamcast game that would peak my interest enough to get me obsessed with it and this is one of them
the music and gameplay is amazing and the impressive graphics are seemingly flawless for the mystical fantasy rpg style this game has to do offer
throughout the game you meet characters from different games who you can switch the main charcter with to clear levels
levels are caves condemned buildings and palaces with dungeon chambers on the inside as mazes
you go from one room to the next fighting enemies and capturing ones at your leisure to train for fighting
at the end of searching the entire area you fight a final boss who you should be able to beat if youve leveled up enough
it takes good tactic skills to ensure your victory as the game progresses and knowing what armor to be equipped with
by the way this game does not have a good case for armor either because you can collect barely any items without having to drop another one in exchange then using it to acquire the next item
you try to preserve and contain your list with healing items but this in turn requires another sacrifice
this is one of the only super annoying things about this game that is the limited  bag to hold items
you will find yourself repeating some levels over and over again because well simply put you werent strong enough
see this game has a certain technique to it that you have to master
its called avoid as many enemies as you can unless you know they are weak and will level you up
otherwise youre gonna make super progress that amounts to nothing once you die
what timestalkers you never heard of checkpoints
and why is the main character so annoying
otherwise this is a must have classic
its the original disk unlike the replica put on psi only recently acquired a dreamcast console and  given my specialty in racing games  picked up several racing games shortly thereafter
metropolis street racer is by far the best of these games and i find it very difficult to imagine a better racing game for this consolefirst metropolis street racer is definitely not for the casual racing gamer those who view racing as continually standing on the accelerator until the race ends will fail miserably in this game
while speed is needed to clear the many tasks in msr the game focuses much more heavily upon racing skill and racing style with kudos points awarded or detracted based upon the players performanceyet this is not the only innovation
metropolis street racer includes numerous street circuits in tokyo london and san francisco  in some events circuits at two or all three of these cities are the norm
in the street racing mode of the game the main mode of the game realworld time is used  based upon the consoles internal clock and location settings  to determine lighting conditions which means that to truly perform well players often need to schedule when they play the game in relation to the time differentials between the players time zone and the time zones of the cities in reality to ensure optimal visibility in daylight conditions
however the game also includes numerous weather conditions ranging from clear skies to intense rain to thick fogwithin street racing mode there are numerous types of events
in hot lap a player must either beat a posted average lap time or score at least one lap time better than the posted time
timed runs force the player to complete a given number of laps within a specific amount of time
oneonone pits the player against a solo cpucontrolled competitor in a race
there are also street races in which the player competes against up to five other cars
challenges vary but can include passing a specific number of cars within a certain period of time or attaining a minimum number of kudos
in all events the player can choose to gamble upon the upcoming performances by adjusting the goals of the events according to the players racing skill racing style and confidencehaving visited both san francisco and london i find these locales in the game to be extremely realistic
i have yet to visit tokyo but from the films and pictures i have seen i find the games rendition to be quite convincing
of these locales each presents rather different challenges beyond simply racing
circuits in london often narrow considerably and there are often traffic circles streetlamps and other such obstacles in the middle of the circuits
tokyo also often alternates between wide and extremely narrow sections of raceway but is very often filled with medians which are often extremely difficult to spot even during perfectlyclear daylight conditions
san francisco circuits often make use of the citys steep inclines which can send cars airborne and thus make cornering impossibleone of the lesscrucial but still interesting aspects of the game is the music
this ranges from jazz to rock to pop to country
what makes the music so special is its presentation in the form of radio broadcasts as if the player is listening to the radio while racing
each city has its own sets of radio stations each selected at random by the cpu upon entering a race and localized for each city this also means that the radio announcers in tokyo speak in japanese
however the music itself is not truly localized in tokyo as there is no japaneselanguage music in metropolis street racer only songs in english plus a few instrumentals which is a severe defect in the planning and creation of the gameoverall metropolis street racer is a highly unique highly challenging game
players who actually complete the game will have greatly improved their racing skills along the way which will pay great dividends in other games in this genremsr is hands down the most realistic and detailed racing game out there ever
i was very impressed with it from day one
the people who rate this game bad are the ones who have no idea about true street racing
sorry but you cant make sharp turns at  mph and jump over traffic and slam cars through boulders
it isnt demolition racer or crazy taxi granted those games are a blast but are not designed to be realistic
it is however difficult and it takes a lot of getting used to master the kudos system but the selection of cars is just unreal
im still very early in the game but ive seen some of the cars i cant wait to unlock
id choose this any day over gt  or tokyo extreme racer graphically and much more and better tracks
as far as the music goes i personally like most of it but if youre unhappy with it just mute the music and pop in a cd in your own stereo which is probably right next to you plus you still have the sound effects
i also like the wide variety of views it adds to the realism id love to play this on an imax screen
this game definitely offers a challenge many different tracks awesome graphics and very smooth gameplay
get it asapits about time some company makes actual cities to explore while keeping good graphics and good control
also the cities dont just have a night and day settings it can be anytime of day
the game is addicting with lots of speed and requires some experience but not so much that slow learners cant ever win a race
also the cars werent duplicates of one another making msgs  seem like sega gts  overall its the better then anything that comes out before including ridge racer  but gt is looking to be even better then thisim from england so this game came out about  weeks ago
sorry for you american guys having to wait til january now but it is worth it and at least you dont have the bugs
anyway as im sure you all want to hear the game is amazing and yes id go so far as to say it is the best racer i have played
racer this is not full out sim it doesnt have all the customisability that ive come to love with gran turismo but the new style of playing more than makes up for it
as the game says in the intro its not how fast you drive its how you drive fast
this game is dependant on scores for particular races if you want to succeed the points called kudos
you get these points for how cooly you drive the circuit
so just doing a nice clean lap wont get you many points youll have to swerve and slide and make tight corners and race with style
trust me youll love it and the graphics are just incredible
itll tide you over till gt big time the game is hugeits been a long time coming and metropolis street racer is definitely worth the wait
it combines new ideas with the best graphics on a console racing game and manages to mix arcadestyle action and realism in a way thats not been seen previously
in msr you race through  chapters each with  races over  tracks
in any of three different cities  san francisco london or tokyo
the time of day in each city corresponds to the dreamcasts inner clock  so if youre playing the game in la at  pm its  am when you race a london track  very cool
ambient sounds arise as the day begins as well  if youre racing in the dead of night youll hear big ben chime the hours but as day breaks quite a sight to see  the sky slowly becomes lighter gray shadows appearits not suddenly daylight  and waitll you see the sun set over the golden gate bridge  breathtaking youll gradually hear traffic in the background as well as sounds of construction birds etc
put this together with the hyperrealistic graphics each city is modeled after its reallife counterpart with painstaking accuracy and theres no popup or slowdown whatsoever even in multiplayer mode and you have a racing environment unlike any other
your car is even fitted with a radio that has three unique stations for each city including news weather commercials and music
at last  not the same techno beats race after race but you could use the cars custom cd player to do that if you wanted
msr contains over  cars from mgs to mazdas to porsches and you can choose the color transmission license plate and even window tint and rooftop styletopless hard or soft and they look and sound incredible
you cant fiddle with engines or suspensions true but each car has its own kudos rating as well as top speed acceleration drive type and so on
kudos is another innovation  a unique point system that must be satisfied in order to progress through the chapters unlocking ever more tracks and cars
each of the  tracks in a chapter presents you with a challenge which varies hugely from a standard multicar race to a time challenge to a game of how many cars can you pass within a time limit
and many others
outstanding variety  its not simply a battle for first place
you are able to customize the limits in order to attain the maximum kudos as well  think you can beat the  second time limit for a lap
change it to   even   but be warned  fail to attain your own goal and you lose kudos big time
msr compels you to get better with a wonderful learning curve that you can actually adjust to your own ability
and you can rerace any race in any chapter at any time in order to get more kudos even using jokers to double the number of kudos you gainbut you can lose the same amount so be cautious when you gamble
theres definitely a rush when you beat your lowered time limit finally gaining enough kudos to open another track
msr handles great  the handbrake works to perfection enabling you to perform a kudosearning skid but watch out for the walls  hit em and you lose kudos
as the game says quotits not how fast you drive its how you drive fastquot  at the end of each race youre awarded skill and style points and penalized for each crash and then further adjustments are made based on if you beat the challenge or not
graphicswise controlwise and gameplaywise msr sets new standards for racing games
add in a fantastic multiplayer mode you can also updownload track times via the internet with several different options and its easy to see that this is the best racer to ever appear on any console
it appeals to casual and hardcore sim nuts and arcade junkies
we dc owners sure have it good  soul calibur code veronica nflk shenmue jet grind radioand now metropolis street racer an absolute classic thatll be praised and remembered fondly for a long timemsr is probably one of the best racing sims out there in all factors
with  different cities san francisco london and tokyo to race in it will keep anyone busy for a very long time
the graphics are excellent
the only flaw with the graphics is the antialiasing
in some parts of the game the jaggies are easily visible
even still racing through tokyo at night is a beautiful sight
msrs award system is quite different than a lot of other racing sims
you are awarded kudos for winning a race performing a power slide winning a championship etc
and after you earn enough kudos you will earn new cars and open new chapters
there are  chapters in the whole game with  different races in each chapterbe warned though
the kudos system was made far more difficult than it needed to be and could be very frustrating for a novice unless you dont mind the challenge if you crash into the side kudos will be deducted
worst of all you can lose kudos that you already earned if you didnt race as well as the last time
not something you want to have happenthe cars couldnt have been better
a great selection
alfa romeo  fiat nissan mazda and many otherstheres only two other drawbacks with msr
when racing on some of the tracks at night the curves are hard to see and makes the track a lot more difficult
and  i was a little surprised that you couldnt go airborne
when racing in san francisco at high speeds you go airborne very frequently
sega keeps releasing exceptional game after exceptional game
without any doubt msr is definitely worth buying and would make a great addition to anyones dc libraryi got this game for christmas and i absolutely love it
i grew up on pole position and pacman so having the home version is awesome
almost of the details are exactly the same except for on dig dug where the entire screen doesnt quite fit on your tv
but i havent found that to be a problem you can turn screen scroll on so it scrolls if youre missing something on the bottom row or above ground you can also tinker with lives and stuff and the screen scroll with the quotdipswitchesquot something you might miss if you dont read the instruction manual because you already know how to play the games hit start on the individual game screens before you start playing the game
finally if you have a controller pack you can save your high scores which is great
pole position dig dug pac man and galaga are absolutely awesome although ms pac man i feel is a tad redundant its still great to put on the game and galaxians not bad hands down this is one of the best games for n and its really addicting these games are classics for a reason
as for the control issues ive found that the joystick isnt good for pac man and dig dug but the dpad you can use it too works great so i really have no complaints whatsoever about this game except for i miss missile command which i suppose wasnt namco buy the game youll be glad you didthank you so much for my game my nieces and nephews keep playing the game i havent been able to play it yet
but i will soon
thank you once againjust like an old school arcade game except on my n
the driving game was a little hard though cause my controller is a knockoff and kept going one way or turning too sharp
all others worked good thoughrainbow six is a first person quotshoot em upquot game where you save hostages from govermentdestroying terrorists
unlike  goldeneye just one shot can end your campaigne if youre not careful
use verious accesories like heartbeat censors flashbangs grenades and nightvision goggles to save the world from a labratory grown virus
so buy this game dont kill hostages and try to keep youre cool
because the last thing this organization needs is you going awallyou can go coop or solo in the game
the weapons are great
what i remember i thought the controls were tricky at first
great missionsmy son loves this game and was very happy on how well it was taken care of and how fast they got it to himthis is probably the very first rainbow six game ever made
the graphics are quite good for the nintendo  those fo you who have played a rainbow six game before should already know what youre in for in this game
there are two ways to beat the levels in this game you either eliminate all terrorists in the level or you rescue the hostages and take them back to your starting point
you have the option of setting up your team mates to have extra ammo clips for your primary weapon and side arm
but you can also give them heartbeat sensors which i would highly recommend otherwise you wont be able to see where enemies are in the levelsthere is a level in this game called deep magic
this is one of those stealth missions so i would just use one guy on this level
it is difficult because if anyone sees you its game over
it can be a frustrating level but it can be done you just have to practice patience and study the enemies patrol patternsthis is a very good game to have  especially if youre a hardcore nintendo fan as i amthis is not your traditional d shooting gallery type game
a great deal of strategy is involved
first you review your mission
second you pick your four members for the mission
next you arrange your team pick their equipment guns and even attire
then comes the part where it can get detailed you plan out the path of the mission
you can be detailed or just skip it all together
the interesting thing about plotting out the mission is that you can plot out which way your teammates go when they split into teams of two or even split up in four ways to take separate routes to eliminate bad guys and save hostages
there are tons missions a password feature a gamepack save feature so that way you will not have to do the mission over and over again
there are three levels of difficulty different mission types save hostages eliminate a leader prevent a leader from leaving his compound and retake big benthis game is so cool
it puts you in the position of a hostage situation
it lets you kick terrorist fat ugly butt
get this no matter what
it rocksi remember having a demo of this game as a kid and i loved to play the demo
now i saw it for  and decided to get it
its better than i rememberedgameplay a fine mix of action zelda and rpg
you play as musashi the summoned hero
slaying enimies and solving tricky puzzles in the dungeons
kinda like zelda
musashi has two swords fusion which can swipe fast and turn enimies into powers like kirby and lumina which is slow powerful and when you find the scrolls can use element power
there is much more things to do but ill let you find that on your owngraphics they kind of look like ffviis graphics very pologonal characters but a bit more detailed this timemusicsound as usual very goodvoice this is the first square game to have voice acting
the voices can be kind of cheesy but are very good for a first attemptoverall a great game
if you like zelda you will like bfmfor its time and very enjoyable
i just couldnt forget when i originally played and wanted to get it againthis game was an instant classic for playstation
ive never grown tired of playing this game over and over
the story of this game keeps you interested and on your toes as you play as the sarcastic kid ninja musashi
great for kids who want a fun game to help rescue a puppy buy and play with toys or run around and just have fun
theres also fun to be had for the adults
whether you want to hunt down criminals take on zombies help rescue the people of the kingdom buy and collect figurines of the enemies you face or just plain run around and slash everything to bits
this games got something for everyone
definitely worth gettingthis is a really great gameits a bit like zelda in terms of how everything is set upthe game has a bit of humor and charm to it and is also generally very fun to play and experiencemusashi was one of the last squaresoft titles to be released before the big merger with enix software
and to this day stands as a monument to a level of game development that se is having great difficulty to return towhat may have turned many fans away even me at first about this game is that it is on the outside targeted towards children
while final fantasy always had a deep plot with strong characters this one does not
instead we get a game that is more in tune with that of a saturday morning cartoonthe story here is that an evil force is attacking the kingdom in order to take it over
the princess and her council cast a spell to retrieve the legendary brave fencer musashi
they expect this tall muscular adult warrior and instead they get a child
distraut at first they send him on a quest to retrieve his sword and release the five scrolls so that the evil can be stoppedthe gameplay is that of an action rpg
you gain experience points in fighting but also on how you do things to a certain degree
you use your swords to fight but also your short sword can be charged and then thrown at your opponents to absorb their abilities
you may find that the weakest of creatures could have the most usuful of abilities and vice versathis game is deceptivly deep and challenging
the bosses are for the most part hard yet incredible to fight
also just to tease rpg fanatics there is a toy collecting mini game of sorts
you can remove the toys from the packaging but then their value goes down if you choose to resell the toys take that fanatics
overall this is a great game to play and i am looking forward to the ps followup for sometime next year
if your not into final fantasy than give this one a shot you may be surprised at how much you enjoy itgreat game that brings me back to my childhood
love the game and it came just in time before the holidays
now i have something to do while i wait for christmas to comethis game tweaks the expectations of a fighting game in which you get hit and youre still alive
even with swordswell as opposed to the regular in this game you choose from swords or guns hidden characters have guns and you need to unlock the hiddens and if you get hit you die
at first i found this very confusing a fighting game without a life bar but soon i began to like the storyline and the story mode is very good and interesting
it has a better storyline than some other fighting games of its genre
i dont own it i dont plan to buy it but i wouldve before i got ps if i had known bushido blade  would be such a good game
the levels are also very good and the weapons and characters you can choose from are very good
tony the afroclad man in this game is one of my men
him and baggy pantswearing suminagashi who no one has been able to beat
the coincidence is tonys last name is tiger and in the tekken series tiger is the afroclad character
hmmmtony the tigeryouve got to give it time before you immerse yourself in the great game it is
this truly is a good game that is a twist on the usual
rent it and if you want buy it
a  classicwhat may turn some gamers off from this game could be its best feature its so realistic
unlike the other games out there theat deal with more  fantasy then true fighting this game is all about not getting hit and the  true art of weapons
finally a game where only one fatal blow can end it  making defense almost more important then offense
the first bushido blade  was a classic and this is not far from that
a wide range of characters  along with different styles and individual story lines gives the lucky  gamer hours days weeks etc
of great fighting fun
you master this game  then your a true masterbushido blade  is the sequel to bushido blade this game is way better and has new features like new characters weapons moves and individual plots and storys as well as over  characters and many levelswhen i first read about this game i was disapionted to find that they had  attak buttons and no more slash mode basiclly nijas keep coming at you while you bet them silly but i found that that wasnt as bad as i heard in the story mode the nijas run at you
then you fight a boss
along the way friends help you and if you mange to keep them alive they stay with you
also the  buttons make the battle progess faster
there is a major improvement in graphics and it is easir to use sub weaponsand of coarse there is the one essence of bushido blade that differs from every fighting game realisum in this game if the blade hits you in a vital area you die in the leg you go slower instead of falling on one leg in bb if the sword hit youre arm you may not throw a sub weapon because it is limpin the story you begin to notice the rilvary between to clans and learn intresting things about the character you didnt know in the first aslo the is a big surprize in  characters endings that is unexpected
its basiclly a final fight between the narakigami and the shinto
and of coarse he grim sasfaction of the cheesy pixle red dot and youre oppent falls to the groundoh yeah vs is the best i really recomend you try this game it is a great fightergreat game
love the console version
not sure if ill ever quit playing itgreat game if you have ever played diablo on pc you understand already how much fun this game was
some neat features in the psx version is it is  players not split screen but more like shared screen that you cant leave the other behind
also you can save your character or your game the neat thing with this is you can replay parts again ulike single player diablo you do lose any unique items if you join new game though also you cannot turn off friendly fire i found it to be lots of funok i kept putting off getting this game because of having the pc diablo  lord of destruction and i dont like paying  bucks for ps games
i usually try to go  bucks or less for them since graphics and gameplay are kinda off by todays standards of ps
and even though i wanted it i felt like i would play it a few minutes and be sick of the controls and graphics
it is an excellent game and its portable on my psoneif youre a fan just get it
the controls are tedious and annoying for awhile but after an hour or so it isnt so bad
it took me a little over  hours to get my warrior to level dont know if thats good or bad dont really care either but it was a fun five hoursfinally
the pc version did not allow you to advance in difficulty lvl in single player or maybe i just some got jipped the  times i have installed it over its life
but you can in the ps version
also it two player and really dark maybe its my monitor or tv card so light radius is crazy handy
controls are odd but i started this game on the pc and it seems to be more of a pc than ps game anyway so go figurei owned diablo on the pc way before this came out and admittedly looking at it now it is not ico style graphics
its not meant to be either
this is hack and slash at its best
hundreds of items weapons armor and so many more
and although this port is far from perfect it is worth the investment
note because if you think about it as the tech changes pc will not be able to play diablo but ps one and ps will
this game has many quests and deep dungeons to haul vast treasures out of and the game has a great system of rewarding you at every turn plus tons of customization options are available and supports multiplayer and thats the rub the controls in single player were annoying but multiplayer no split screen nada same screen and you are stuck together no matter how narrow it gets and it gets narrow aside from that area this game is a masterpiece and i will always be a huge diablo fan
the one game to hack  slash them allgraphics then   starsnow   starssound then great
 starsnow still very good  starsoverall single player  starmultiplayer annoying but  star you can pk
find it here
diablowhy has everyone overlooked quotehrgeizquot
ok aside from the fact that its name doesnt include the word quottekkenquot
sheeshi hated fighting games before ehrgeiz
too much immature buttonmashing  favoring speed over any kind of strategy improvisation or skill
in  ehrgeiz theres great depth in understanding and maximizing your character   each has strengths and weaknesses and the fun is from using your money  moves while knowing how to stop your opponentsa knock against the game  is a widespread allegation of unbalanced overpowered attacks
pish
most  attacks can be blocked all can be dodged countered andor  interruptedyeah the bonus games are fun but the action at the heart  of the fighting mode is solid
dont let this one get awaypros the game still fun as hellit came with manual and cover artno sarchet on the diskcons broken casethis game has almost everything a gamer would want
rpg
check
fighting
check
minigames
check
each aspect of this game is fun
the rpg is challenging and a vague story but if youre a fan of the playstation  era you should give this game a tryif you like nfs underground series upto undercover than you will hate this game if you like semiarcade game with basic forza driving than you will love this classic title this is the only root that need for speed series has had and hopefully nfs shift will bring back this gameplaythis is not
available on the playstation network store which would be a great buy if it was
get it while the used copies are in circulationneed for speed high stakes is the only game from the need for speed series that i have played so i cannot compare this particular game to the others in the series
what i can say is that nfs high stakes is a great little game even now four years later
the graphics look a little clunky compared to todays technology yet there is still enough detail to the cars and race track surroundings to keep me happy
despite the fact that i obviously am not very good at keeping my car on the track i think the controls are pretty good
the only annoying thing is that pushing the joystick up honks the horn and i end up hitting the up arrow to some degree every time i move from left to right and vice versa
one feature i really like is the ability to look behind the car during the race although this usually sends me right into a wall or tree any time i actually manage to pass another car i almost have to look back and watch it eat my dust
the game is truly blessed with many camera angles
after each race the game automatically shows you an instant replay of the entire race unless you choose to skip it shifting between ten different cameras
this means i can watch and see just how horrendous all of my crashes werein many ways the best part of the game is not the actual racing
the first thing you have to do is choose a car and there are at least nineteen cool little speed demons at your beck and call and even more later on if and when you have enough cash to move up in the world
if you cant decide which car you want you can take a trip to the car showroom and hear all sorts of details about the specifications and features of each model available
serious players can build update and customize any car to make it hisher pride and joy yet really serious players have the high stakes option of putting their money where their mouths are ie racing for pink slips  you lose the race you lose your carthe tracks are really quite diverse and require different driving styles when you have to deal with a number of hairpin turns youd better be a better driver than i am
different environments help make each race unique as you might have to battle bad weather additional passenger traffic and the darkness of night
of course you dont have to just go out there and race cold turkey you can take all the time you want running test laps and getting a feel for each track
you also have the option of racing in single events or competing in tournamentsmy favorite aspect of this game though is the hot pursuit option
here you can choose either to run from the law or climb inside a police car which can vary depending on the country in which you are driving and play smokey to some other guys bandit
you even get to bang against and all but wreck fleeing speeders in your quest to enforce the law
whichever side of the law you choose to play you are privy to all sorts of great police radio chatter
speeders will have to evade not one cop alone but a whole group of them and these cops coordinate their pursuit tactics
roadblocks spike strips and a bevy of cruisers trying to block you in can all make for quite an exciting challengeneed for speed high stakes is getting a little long in the tooth now as is the original playstation console but the game is still a lot of fun to play when you just want to goof around for a little while
serious gamers will unlock cars and tracks that more casual players may never see for themselves but any novice can pop in the cd and entertain himselfherself with a world of fun featuresthis by far one of the best driving games i have ever had the privilege to play
its just so cool that you are able to choose wich side of the law you want to uphold
you can either have a awesome sports car or be a police officer and give tickets and arrest people that speed
and if that is not enough you can also do a sort of gran turismo mode in wich you buy cars jack them up and race them and when you do this you are also unlocking more cars and tracks to cruise on
its also got the multiplayer feature so you and somebody else can chase each other or both be civilians or both be cops
highly reccomended i guarantee tons of fundefinately better than need for speed iii hot pursuit
the car control is back into the much better form of arcade racing which categorized the original need for speed which started the whole thing off
the tracks are interesting taking from many aspects of racing strategies
shortcuts are minimal but fun to use and easy to findthe development of the game requires the player to beat certain challenges in order to unlock more tracks
in addition the hot pursuit mode requires you playing the cop to pull over the speeders before your time runs out to earn faster police cars
something i enjoy is the choice of local cops
its an option under the track select
depending on where the track is set germany france great brittain etc
the cops will speak in that language
believe me electronic arts makes fun of the british here
it adds to the realism and extrasplaying as a cop you have the option of calling in for backup setting a roadblock or requesting a spike strip or stinger in british
the radio between the hq and your car is realistic and keeps you well up to date on whats going on in both modes of playthe cars are your standard array of sports cars using everything from the jaguar xk to the porsche  turbo all the way to the mclaren f racecar of the mercedes gtr whichever you like betterthe police have become smarter and the cars they drive are directly related to the track and the car you are driving
in america the cop cars are the standard caprice the corvette and of course the diablo
foreign soil has the m the porsche  and the diablo
the cops will radio in for a faster car if they have trouble catching you and will set roadblocks good ones this time or lay spike strips to catch youwhat can i say
its the next one out and its pulling strong
no complaintsi have order this game during christmas it came in very good to like new condition this is replacement of my scratched one that i had it work even on my ps now i love this one it plays great without any problem i enjoy this old school nfs games the music is great it gives me the feel when i was  yrs old in  playing on my brothers old ps have you ever wondered what would happen if resident evil and final fantasy had a baby
if so the answer is parasite eve
the story is about an nypd cop named aya brea whose life gets turned upside down during a visit to a theater
she goes to see an opera with her boyfriend and all seems to be going well the singer melissa has a beautiful voice and everything is running perfectly until people start to selfcombust catch fire by themselves
only aya miraculously survives and eve has mysteriously disappeared so you must go find her and as a dutiful police officer arrest her
then wierd things start happening in the dressing room area
a rat suddenly appears and then it begins squealing uncontrollably as it begins to mutate into a grotesque abomination remember the scene in the thing when the dog changed into the alien
yeah it was that disgusting
then it turns out melissa is a horrible monster called eve who can spawn creatures called neomitochondria
as the game explains it this particular parasite makes the mitochondria in the cells gain more energy than the cell itself causing the body to get really hot and make it catch on fire by itself or turn into a gel substance
there is a more detailed explanation in the game but i gave you the shorter version
then you begin to have strange visions from your past that youd long forgotten for good reasons
this is only the beginning of the game you face even more dangerous and freakier creatures later
this game is ultimately a quest to destroy eve save the world wipe out the neomitochondria creatures and discover the secrets of your past
this game has incredible cganimated cutscenes that are very impressive even to this day
the ingame graphics of the environments are incredible as well but the character models look ugly in realtime
the gameplay is a mix of turnbased and realtime combat what i mean is on this game you wait your turn to attack but you can move around
unfortunately this can also hamper the experience in some ways because the enemies move around too and sometimes the space youre enclosed in is too small for you to really avoid being hit
luckily this rarely dampers the experience because this game is absolutely incredible with its creepy resident evilstyle creatures and atmosphere phenomenal cganimation cool gameplay storyline cool bosses and challenging gameplay
if you like rpgs and you like resident evil this game is a musthave because its so awesome
i love this game and theres no reason any rpg fan should hate iti loved this game back when it came out
very unique rpg and aya brea is the hottest rpg character ever
the setting was awesome new york coool
and the story was good too
its sciencefiction but its not too intelectual sp
i bought this game because i lost it a long time ago and yes this game still rocks
way better than the nd one which is a resident evil ripoffparasite eve is one of the creepiest games to ever come out on a console
no its not horrifying like resident evil where zombies eat your flesh
its more of a psychological horror game or the alfred hitchcock title of the gaming world
just forget about the pseudoscientifical chatter that ensues during the game
the point is it is the best script and storyline to happen to the gaming world
who would have thought up the idea for mitochondria taking over new york city
its awesome for a game to come up with an orginal script like this
also the game operates like a movie with many plot twists and a wellwritten story
the cgs are awesome and the environments are cool even if the graphics are a little off
there is no better setting than a nearlyempty new york city
and finally eve is one of the coolest video game characters ever created by squaresoft the makers of final fantasy
overall any rpg lover or a horror game fan will enjoy parasite eve at least while the excitement lastsmy ratinggreat game
back with square soft made quality games
i would recommend this to anybody
go buy it now youll love itparasite eves best feature is probably the story
its hard to put down
you really want to play as long as possible just to see how the story will reveal itself
i like this one better than parasite eve ii
the second game has better graphics but you lose the ability to customizemodfiy your equipment
setting up your own unique equipment is a huge factor in enjoying the game
too bad the game is a little bit short
but you can got through it a second time
its actually better the second time around even though the monsters get tougher
you can allocate more bonus points and effects to your weapon to compensate somewhat
i highly recommend this game
especially to someone new to this type of game
moving aya around in this first game is a very simple task unlike in peii
the story is so involving that you would become a big fan of rpgspros game good as hell fun deep story one of my favorite games of all timedisk in great conditioncons no manualthis game is rare to find i heard that could be why its almost  but anyway the gameplay is a basicly rd person rpg shooter you go around shooting enemys and picking up new guns as you go along and learn new spells you find out the enemys are really used to be like rats etc
but what hooks you is the story line i dont want to spoil the game but the feel of the game and the story makes this game really stand out its almost like your playing a movie on a playstation almost six years ago back in  i found and picked up a copy of parasite eve
i dont recall the exact circumstances on why i picked it up but im willing to bet that seeing squaresoft on the jewel case had more than a little to do with itwith the rd birthdays us launch fast approaching i put the first parasite eve back on my list having not played it since a short time after i bought it and even then not having finished the game
thanks to a youtube users help i started playing the game again from the start and finished it one very late night a few days laterparasite eve is our first experience with new york copy aya brea who over the course of  days battles against forces unleashed upon new york before they expand to the entire world
overall a pretty solid story although bits of the quasiscience are laughable
an initial play will take from  to  hours although seasoned hands can finish the game in around  hours
i completed the game in around  hours and  minutes doing everything that i could in my first play through
once the game has been completed an ex game is unlocked which allows you to replay the game keeping some amount of your characters goods and possibly unlock an additional ending
as noted above i actually finished the game late one night early one morning since i felt compelled to see the game to the endthe game is an action rpg involving leveling of your character and her weaponsequipment with battle portions allowing you to move around while your action gauge fills
so a sort of cross between secret of mana and final fantasy vii
overall i personally found it to be rather enjoyable once i got into the hang of how the battles play out
the camera is stuck in place much like the first resident evil games but generally has little effect on battles
you will have to watch for chests
thankfully the game does not feature tank controls which i cant stand and was part of that group of playstation games that allowed analog controls but at the price of being able to use the dpad
i played the game on my  gig playstation  and experienced no issues outside of one of my controllers seemingly having the analog stick stuck up at times
swapping out another controller resolved the issue
its obvious what generation the game is from because of the cg and the normal graphics are flat but despite that the game has held up extremely well
of course that may be because i found the battle system so enjoyable and because the graphic quality fits with the darker atmosphere of the gamethe game does have a mature rating but what i assume gave it the rating is a character model later in the game that could be compared to shivas model in the final fantasy series
theres some talk about sexual themes as well but nothing that a teenager doesnt know about from school
the ex games ending may feature content that pushed this game into the m rating
overall this is an amazing game and i look forward to doing an ex game run very soon and perhaps even moving on to parasite eve 
 of  starsjust like new it said and it was a fun game not much to say but if you like rpgs this is your kind of gamea fun game with only a few down points
its short only  hours to beat and  discs
aya runs very slow and looks funny while runningbut besides that a very enjoyable rpg with a differnt attitude
the story of mitochondria eve told by sqauresoft in this game is a fasinating onepeople say it is final fantasy meet resident evil i say its true science meets stephen kinga true classic i really love the story and it kept me on my feet and wanting more
to me this is one of ps best games in a long time in the rpg sectioni love this game
i bought it when it first came out and continue to play it to this day
it is excellent in all aspects
it is based on the book parasite eve by hideaki sena
however the book and the game storyline vary quite a bit
but if youre like me and like to know all the background story id suggest reading it however i believe the games story is far betterplease remember what time this game came out pe is a very differnt game from what we all play now which is overly spawned fps games which are getting boring the game play is very unique  somewhat simular to resident evil except re doesnt have the range dome for targeting
the story is solid  another trait a lot of games have lost  and somewhat educational at the cellular level but all together fun and worth trying but its getting harder to findbig fan of square enix before it was even square enix very like the style of there other games just for an older audience
would recommend for first playthrough to have a guide of some sort as fun as it is its kind of trickyadmittedly back in the day after squaresoft had such a resounding success with final fantasy  i could not wait to see what the next squaresoft game would be
i saw this as a new release and like other games they showed impressive visuals on the back case with very little regarding the story
it seemed interesting so i bought itthis is a real interesting turn on an action rpg game
battles are in real time not atb but a hybrid of sorts and you can move all around the d area and avoid attacks if need be
you have a alot of weapons you can customize with parts to make even more powerfulheres the kicker what a cool storynever ever would i have come up with a concept like this
its so radical and far out that its what makes it so good and fun to playi highly recommend this game to anyone who likes good action rpg elements and a fantastic story
i still remember showing this game to a friend of mine back when i first got it
he was engrossed in it catch was he could never remember the title of the game lolit has immense replay value
check it outi know this game isnt popular but ive played it many times and i adore it
i love the story and the completion extrasi never owned a sega genesis so i never got to experience road rash on that system where the series was popular
i did get to watch other sega owners play the game though even though watching someone play a game is never as fun as playing it yourself
once i received a playstation and noticed that i could play road rash on that system i knew i had to grab a copy
i had a good feeling about a psx version
better graphics and soundand yup better graphics and sound and really fun
i lost my copy of this game and i really cant believe i let that happen
as i mentioned in another review normally im a very organized person
apparently i need help keeping my games in one placethis game is really freakin sick and more importantly fun
i adore hitting old ladies with my bike along with construction workers and the halfnaked girl who waves the start flag can you blame me
she stands there like she wants to get hit
its really fun hitting people with your bike
its fun kicking and punching people too along with smacking them with chains and baseball bats
the point of the game is to do whatever you have to do to come in first place of the racethis version of road rash could have had more stages instead of five but thats okay
the hard rock music that plays in each of the five stages is really awesome
the stages themselves are all pretty much the same but for some reason i like the level located next to the ocean the most
the city stage is also nice because theres a lot of open space and divided roads years since i last played this game on sega saturn and its still an absolute blast
great graphics controls humor and challenge
seriously you need lighting fast reflexes to avoid traffic once you purchase a super bike and thats what makes it soooo good
you simply pop in this game and you immediately start having fun without tedious tutorials or ingame instructions
there are newer versions of the game road rash d jailbreak and though they are great games they never quite grasped the charm of the originalthis is the real deal
road rash includes a classic roster of music mostly grunge and all the gnarly crotch rocket noises needed
you will tear this game up and love it
choose your biker win cash buy new bikes and race more
there are only five tracks here and they get a little repetitive but the racing will not
you will have a number of bikers to play and a fun time beating up biker cops and your competitors
video game technology continues to progress and video games overall look better but can you find as many games as consistently fun as this
maybe
this is a classic crank the volume pull out the ps controller and kick some assi do and always have loved this game
it was stolen while i moved a few years back and had to replace itthe best of the sereies on any platform just dont expect logical physics or gameplaygreat shipping and condition of producti love this game
i love the freaking graphics on the game the caricatures are my favorite part one of the best games of the si lost my sega a yr ago sniff and i wanted rr and i couldnt get it cause i had nothing to play it on
so i was strolling through babbages one day and i see rr
i think to myself could this be it
and i bought it without knowing what i was getting myself into
the next month i spent with my ps are days i will never forget
it was just as i had remembered it
not a sprite out of place and the game seemed to play faster on the ps
now i have another sega but anytime i want to go down memory lane with some classic rr i bust out my ps and let the good times rolland i bust some heads while im at iti chose this rating cause this video game is very fun to play for the playstation
the product came on timethis game is so cool
what could be bad about riding a motorcycle and trying to knock other people off their bikes
thats right
nothing
the story line of this game is about your friend is stuck in jail and you eventually need to free him by gaining respect by your fellow posse members
but this is road rash
does their really need to be a story line to be fun
there are a huge variety of weapons like clubs lead pipes baseball bats xspepper spray taser cattle prod chains and much more
also new to this game in the fighting aspect is there are tons of combos at least  different ones that do massive damage
this is a must have for anybody who likes fighting or racing gamesjailbreak without question rocks
poppin wheelies over cars pounding your competitors off their bikes at mph
wowjailbreak gives you several different modes to play the escaped con the cop or the dual player fun as heck sidecar feature
theyre all a blastbike to bike combat is exquisite requiring just enough skill to feel proud when you pull up beside somebody and beat them silly but not so much as to drive you insane
what you say
you want wrecks
jailbreaks got em to sparewiping out in this game is half the fun
slides flips tumbles rolls and human flight can happen at any turnive spent almost as much time laughing with friends at wrecks as ive spent winning racesalone or with other players this game is pure unadulterated funi have the old dreamcast version  this is just as fun with added enjoyment and functions like riding as the cops and customizing your bikewaay better than those rpgs that are sweeping the worldsaga frontier  is a terrific game
i can say for sure this is one of the greatest rpgs i have ever played
this game is art really artistic in almost every aspectwhy such a masterpiece is so ignored and get such low score is beyond methe artistic direction and the incredible storyline are the high pointsthe positive artistic watercolor graphics cities design are based on the real german medieval village and cities  another touch of art music is gorgeous and again artistic no electronic instruments here most tunes are piano based only the musical instruments that really existed in a germanic medieval setting great innovative battle system no standard command here every magic or ability is a single command infinite possibility of combos the storyline is easily one of the best of all console rpg genre very hard turn based game duel battle strategic battle dozen and dozen of characters so much innovative very generational game  other than dragon quest v gripping structure  you must choose the event that occur in the timelinethe negative very few sidequests use of pocket station is needed for play minigames strategic battles are a joke before the last one too little time for develop the ton of characters too little time to increase the characters ability and statistics  but really doesnt matter the game dont have a normal level system a bit too lineargraphics music story character development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght time to complete from  to  hoursdifficulty very hard  insane the last  sessionsreplay value the new game  increase the replay valueplayed saga frontier many hours
had to have saga frontier
great game
glad i had the strategy guide to go with itsim city  on ps as i remembered it
greatness
also with my ps   backwards compatibility i can play this on those systems with slightly improved imagery
however if you want the true sim city experience check out the multiple versions for the pc if you can
much betteri love sim city games
this one has a lot of features that the older ones dont
im so glad i have itthe seller sent the game in a very timely manner and it was in excellent conditionwe first saw this simcity  for playstation at my sisters house when our  year old son played it he just couldnt get off of it as he was having so much fun
well i played it a late s year old woman and i loved it too it was very interesting and i found that i just could not walk away
so i ordered it from amazon for our son for christmas to surprise him he really loves it as this is the only game hed play so i cant wait to see his face on christmas morning
i can tell you now our son me and my husband will all want to play it at the same time that is how good this game is
i highly recommend it to anyone the price is excellent from amazon  so thank you amazon for helping make our son have a special surprising christmas
really do spend the money on this game you will be glad you didwhen i first heard of this game i didnt think it was appealing or that it would be any good
well when my cousin bought it and i played it i was hooked and had to have it
it kept me glued to my seat right up until i finished the game
with all the side items to find and minigames to play xenogears has a very high replay value
i recommend it to all hardcore gamers especially rpg fansi played this game  years ago
i can still say that this is one of most memorable experiences of my teens
lol yeah i was geek
i think the greatest feature of the game was story which was always interesting
i will warn you though that the story is really heavy and questions our very existencemy reviews title is no joke im serious with this one
xenogears and final fantasy vii are two of the greatest stories ever told and do not laugh when i say i rank them along with many other classic stories of epic proportions
tolkiens mythical middle earth homers odyssey and iliad dantes comedy herberts dune chronicles and many othersopening with an enigmatic quote straight from the bible i believe and a mysterious prologue the game tales the story of fei a young artist and martial arts expert who seems to remember nothing of his life except for a blurred memory of his arrival to the village where he now lives
he is often praised by the villagers as a good honest and hard working man with a humble and warm heart a trait that has earned him the love of almost everyone in the villagebut one day when enemy forces the village is located on a war torn continent accidentally fall under the village feis life is transformed forever an event that will change the fate of the planet foreverthis game is one of the three games the other two are final fantasy vii and ff viii that are very dear to me not only because of the storyline but because it has sentimental value for me as well
i played this game when i was passing through a very difficult time in my life existential problems
i still have them but now i have a lovely girlfriend who cares about me and found much comfort on this game and was surprised of just how much i could relate to
do not be fooled this game deals with many important issues such as depression happiness friendship hate vengance corruption and the nature of the universe
but most importantly the search of ones raison dtreas an atheist i found this game magnificent it just agrees with my naturalistic philosophy
christians do not be fooled even though this game deals with the corruption of the church and the whole god business as well it still has a wonderful message
some of my christian and catholic friends say that if viewed from a certain angle it is in fact a progod game
i still believe it isnt in any case that is not the important message of the gamenow that the ps is out another xenogears game is coming out
is it gong to be a sequel or a prequel
you need to play xenogears to find outon november   i wrote a review of xenogears and it went like thisout of all the rpg fansites and magazines and such youll find many rpg fans adoring this particular game
xenogears is a decent game and its a shame that it wasnt released under a greatest hits collection like the horrible chrono cross has
still i find myself finding this game to be far from great
being somewhat of an rpg fan i use somewhat very loosely i find myself disappointed but also intrigued
read on or face the fires of hellthe goodthis game has a really good storyline and we get a main character thats unique in the sense that he doesnt want to fight but he knows that he must
the storyline has often been touted as the best plot an rpg ever had and while that can be debated i always thought chrono trigger had the best storyline its still awesome
a futuristic tale of social class warfare with various different symbolisms very complex
i was a bit disturbed at the games athiest point of view but oh well
ill let that slide
the battle system is also quite good featuring several different combos your characters and gears can perform
the music is top notch and since its the same composer of chrono trigger yasunori mitsuda you can expect a gold musical score here
the multiplayer feature is quite good too and i shun all those people who have beaten me by using xenogears the ultimer cheating gear cough cough someone i know cough coughthe badthe unfortunate downside of this game happens to be in the presentation
this game is virtually  dialogue and story and  gameplay
im not kidding
i came here to play a game not watch it
i guess the rpg fans just want to sit there in awe but when a battle is going on i expect to participate in it
i was vastly disappointed when it cut to one of the characters in a chair talking about the battle with the pendant in the background swaying back and forth
this happened a lot on the second disc and its a shame
i also felt the love story albeit far from bad didnt quite get the boost that it needed it just seemed to happen
oh welloveralldie hard rpg fans no doubt love this game and while its far from terrible i do think its overrated
a great story with interesting characters but not nearly enough gameplay involvement
if i wanted to watch something ill watch a dvd
nevertheless i do recommend this game to any rpg fan but only to those with a lot of patience
i might get negatives for this but thats just because the people that give negative votes are usually very shallow
seven years later i decided to return to xenogears
i dont play video games that often these days but this was a game that haunted me
i gave it an averagenearly subaveragereview and as you can tell from my earlier review here i already had bias going into it
i felt it was overrated and was really let down by the second disc in particular
also being a christian at the time i didnt like its atheistic storyline and despite letting it slide i think it seeped its way into the review nonethelessso as a bit of an addendum i am changing my review
also some of you complained that my reviews have spoilers
well this is an rpg that im reviewing so therefore consider yourself warnedthe story years before the games story takes place a ship called the eldridge was flying through space
the humans onboard had dismantled deus a powerful biomechanical invasion computer that was deemed too powerful
deus had become selfaware a la the terminators skynet and started to take over the ship
it crashlands with only a handful of survivors one of them was abel a boy who came into contact with the wave existence some sort of supernatural godlike junctionits a bit confusing there
 and thus many descendants and reincarnated versions of him appear at several different points of the game in order to relentlessly stop deus
for all intents and purposes of this review the last incarnation is the games main character fei fong wongwhat starts off as a gundamlike game shifts into a very deep very philosophical storyline
we have awesome characters like the doc citan we have bart the prince and heir to the throne of aveh theres rico a physically strong prisoner originally in nortune also theres billy black my favorite character actually a former priest who specializes in guns and elly a former gebler soldier who crosses paths with fei not only within the current time frame of the game but as different incarnations in the past as well and his love interest in all incarnations
there are villains in the game two of them having a connection with fei the only two ill spoil are krelian who was a friend of one of feis past incarnations and of course deuswhat is so controversial about this story is that it takes on an atheist or humanist approach
deus is worshiped as a god by the humans throughout the centuries and it is only revealed much later that it had malevolent intentions
square has a lot of cajones for getting this game released fei essentially has to kill god
the scene that really stuck out to me was near the end of the gamefei chases after the departing defeated deus to rescue elly and confronts krelian whoby this pointbecomes a part of deus
krelian kept whining about how he thought mankind needed to return to the beginning when human frailties didnt exist and all there was was god
fei followed that with talking about the inherently good qualities of mankind and that we dont need a god to understand and embrace concepts like love
this sensitive subject almost caused the game to not be released here and probably turned away a lot of potential gamers because of its stance
i turned away for a while partially because of that reason but im glad i returnedthe character fei is also not your typical hero
i will not spoil his backstory but you will learn that hes a very freudian type of hero and not your typical righteous youngin like cecil or crono
i also liked citan whose real intentions were very behind the scenes most of the game and i identified with billys upbringing in the priest hood and then learning that it was all a cover up
bart is your typical smartass whipwielding hero who despite his rambunctious nature wants to bring a democracy to the kingdom of aveh
there are other characters to flesh out but i will leave it to youthe gamerto explore the rest on your owngameplaythere are two different kinds of battles well three if you count the oneonone arena battles
one is with your regular people up to only three this game and you can perform combos
the second is your gear battles
when youre fighting in gears its a bit more complicated
you use fuel so you have to learn to play smart and conserve sometimes later in the game you can find different accessories that allow you to charge up to  fuel at a time so it gets easier then
you also perform combos but the combos can lead to higher attack levels and even into infinity mode
its actually not as complicated as it may sound but if youre expecting a button mashing rpg youve come to the wrong placeanime cut scenesthere are several anime cut scenes located throughout the game especially on the second disc
they are nice although for someone like me that just wants a good story and awesome gameplay theyre not all that necessary
more on that latermusicthe music is composed by none other than chrono triggers yasunori mitsuda
the soundtrack is amazing
it was the one thing that kept me going through some of the games rough spots and i especially liked the vocal tracks stars of tears did not make it into the game except as the instrumental emotions world map theme but the ending theme is still there
his themes for grahf thames and the love relationship between fei and elly the treasure which cannot be stolen and shattering egg of dreams among others
were very well composed
some tracks remind me of chrono trigger like barts theme bonds of sea and fire and leftovers of the dreams of the strong which sounds ironically similar to the theme of guardia in chrono trigger
the one who is torn apart played most during the id encounters and feis revelatory scenes reminds me of zeal palace and magus castle from chrono trigger respectively ambiance and everything
my favorite track is probably flight which plays during some momentous fight scenes one of them with a giant chuchuerm k
the score as a whole is wellrounded and while the game couldve used a couple more tracks to break up some of the monotony of the second disc i have no complaints
yasunori mitsuda is the mannow onto some of the negativesdespite my newfound love for the game it does have its drawbacks
like many reviewers have already said it has a lot of dialogue
for one thinggoing back to the anime cut scenesthey didnt sync up the english voice acting with the scenes at all which may throw a lot of you off i didnt find it to be a huge hindrance but it was a minor distraction
another thing with the dialogue was that once you reach the second disc the first freaking half of it is basically a couple battles and a lot of chair scenes in which a particular characterfor instance fei elly or citanwill sit in it with feis pendant in the background swinging all the while said character explains whats going on
theres a particular point when you discover solaris using dead people as medicine and food even going so far as to reference the soylent green movie and reading about the further explanation of that was pointless
during this time also is when you discover deus is the reason some of the population starts mutating into zombies to recollect them as part of its biomechanical beingyeah
 and that part i found particularly annoying i also found it odd that fei talks about killing the zombies off to save their souls but when a ginormous zombie monster bursts out of nowhere to eat them feis like oh no
we have to save them from the monster
werent you just discussing putting them out of their misery
am i just a coldhearted youknowwhat from playing too much resident evil
but fair reader once you get to the point on disc  where feis personality is explored then it gets awesome again
so do be patientone other complaint before moving on is that some of the characters are pretty much useless towards the end im not going to say who because maybe someone reading this will find or have found different strategies with which to beat the final hour of the game but there were a couple that i started using at the start of their entry into the storyline but quickly found that the later battles did not suit their fighting styles
i would like feedback on this particular part of the gameoverallsoafter my rediscovery do i highly recommend this game
well it is still a difficult game to rate
the pacing is a bit sluggish which is the main drawback of this game
it throws a lot at you at once in terms of story and believe me the spoilers i gave you arent even half of the game
i dont know if square lost money during production or they just ran out of time and couldnt smooth it over but either way the pacing will frustrate you for a time
also i couldve done without the anime cut scenes despite how beautifully theyre doneand like i said before the minimal voice acting present is offsync with the anime cutscenes and switches to japanese during the fighting parts which can be a bit distracting at firstthat being said the game is infinitely better than i have painted it out to be before the musics awesome and diverse the gameplays addicting when its not sluggish and the storyline is not only immersive but very deep on both an emotional level and a philosophical one its challenging of religious authority and support of the human condition deserves some commendation
i also liked the love story which plays out well despite some unnecessary angst right when disc  begins
the characters for the most part are very memorable any time you actually make me care for the characters is a good thing
if you can get past its flaws the game will sweep you into its narrativeso to put it simply if you are a novice rpg goer you might be turned off by it initially
but if youve played a few rpgs especially some classics like final fantasy  and chrono trigger then by all means get a copy of this game and enjoy itif youre a gamer like me that was turned off by initial impression i hope youve at least given the game a second chance
its a musthave for any fan of rpgs and i hereby take back my statement that it was a mixed bag
im glad to finally see why xenogears gets the status it so richly deservesmy recommendations beforealongside this one aresuper mario rpgchrono triggerfinal fantasy iv ii on snesfinal fantasy vi iii on snes or viithis game is amazingly good and well worth the money if you have a system capable of playing it
the combat system is really neat you create combos in a turn based battle system the gears have a fun albeit very simple equipment system the anime cutscenes are cool and if youre an old school rpg nerd there are some fun cameos lucca from chrono trigger for onewhile xenogears is not my favorite rpg of all time i cannot deny its glory therefore while the title of quotmy favorite rpgquot lies with star ocean  i cannot deny that this game is the best rpg ever fathomed on the course of mankind after playing this game i found myself asking quotoh my goodness 
well looks like i may have to stop playing rpgs 
because no other will ever be this good so whats the pointquotand i put rpgs in quotes because its a joke to call someofthese games by that name
xenogears is most likely the mostthoughtprovoking and deep rpg to ever hit a console
good luckfinding itstory and insight no spoilers created by the samemasterminds that created chrono trigger and chrono cross this gamewill have you question life and existance itself
it masterfullyblends fantasy and reality to create startingly realistic settings ina fictional world
the game is outofprint however so manyhardcore gamers searching for this rare gem are at the mercy of theauctioneers at ebay
so why would such a game be outofprint
myguess would most likely be pressure from all sorts of religiouscommunities especially christianity
the core of the game ispresented around organized religion in general and presents manyglaring corruptions that most likely exist in many organized religionstoday
while the fictional religion presented in xenogears does bearsome striking resemblance to christianity there are also the samenumber of factors that set it apart such as there is no christ init and the preachers go around hunting evil creatures calledquotreapersquot however some similarities cannot be denied but iwill not touch upon them as they could be consideredspoilersgraphics and gameplay enough about that now about thegameplay
the controls are simple as in any rpg and its easy tonavigate due to the fully d environments
the battle system whilenot the deepest is probably the most fun ive had with an rpg sofar
for fighting by hand you create fighting combos with thetriangle x and square buttons
kinda like street fighter meets finalfantasy
theres also a second combat system involving robots namedquotgearsquot this one is a little more strategy involved as themore powerful attacks you use the more fuel you use
you dont evenget the necessary parts to heal your gear until youre about  hoursinto it thus adding more challengeoverall its is a greatgame however the story moves extremely slow at times
trust mewhen i say that this only lasts for a few hours
usually when thishappens a major plot point will occur shortly after
give it love andpatience and you will find yourself with the greatest rpg for theplaystationthis is a very long video game
for me it took about  hours to finish
but let me emphasize that those  hours were some of the most engrossing that i have ever experienced with a video game
i highly recommend this game to anyone who does not mind the somewhat belowaverage graphics
the games soundtrack more than compensates for any graphical shortcomingsthe battles are random and perhaps too numerous in quantity for this gamers preference
however most can be quite entertaining
some battles are fought while the characters are controlling giant machines called gears
most battles are fought in handtohand combat with each character having the option to unleash powerful attack combinationsif there is a shortcoming to this game it has to be the fact that the story was too complicated and too deep to communicate in the manner that they chose
by the second disk some of the main characters had to basically sit in a chair and narrate the story to get it moving in the right direction
perhaps the older playstation console just did not have the power for the inclusion of cutscenesthis game had what i wanted it made me think it had plot the characters are deep if you actually you know read the words that appear onscreen the gameplay didnt get old music was great and it provided a challenge
oh and its longim not a real graphics kind of guy if a game has great visuals more power to them but i wont deny a game greatness because the graphics are a tad outdated
besides this game has excellent anime artwork throughoutas far as talking is concerned the grammar was subpar but i forgive them grammar doesnt make or break my gamethe real area causing anger would probably be the letdown of disc two not to spoil but the majority of it are the main characters telling you the story
a great part of this is that you have time to absorb the story
a horrid drawback is thatwell you cant move
youre just waiting waiting for the time when you get to go back to exploring and playing in the rather enjoyable battle systemat the end you regain control for an indefinite amount of time to do as you wish so i forgave square and monolith for what they did to the rest of the disk
its a shame that funding was cut because that second disk could have been phenomenal
all in all it was still excellentand then the deepness
it makes you question your perception of religion if you read enough into it
it truly poses great questions which to the ordinary person seem contrived and impossible but actually when thought about make much more sense than it seemsanyhow i loved this game and i wish i owned a copy
if you can borrow it do so if  you can buy it do so if you can steal ituhget back to me on that one
its worth getting definitely worth playingthis game is incredible
the storyline is one of the best ieve ever seen
a good storyline makes for a great game
the gear battle graphics are excellent although the map graphics and character battles are not very good
but its the complex and intriguing characters trapped in an incredible saga that makes this game so great
fei is a young man with no recollection of his past
help him find his true identity and discover who this mysterious quotidquot is
battle with the young etonr billy  as he seeks revenge for his mothers death at the hands of the wels as he tries to take care of his darling little sister primera
stop the dark forces from taking over this stunning world and battle in enormous robotic machines called quotgearsquot
this game is a musthave for any rpgamerbetter than final fantasy vi vii amp viii
better than crono trigger and chrono cross
better than lunar  amp 
no xenogears is better than all those combined
whats that you say ready to rip my head off
goodbecause i have yet to get started
when square released xenogears in the land of the rising sun thats japan for you d students it was met with applause and praise but when us gamers first heard about the game it was met with shock and disappointment
square offices in japan released a press statement saying that xenogears would most likely never make it the states due to its serious religous themes
guess what
xenogears arrived after all
the religous themes to the game are constant and is an integral part of xenogears completely original and breathtaking story
dont think the religous themes are preachy though as it isnt
god lies in the ocean onewinged angels existed cities float in the sky and gears are all the rage
despite everything about xenogears though the story is centered around one young man fei fong wong
his mysterious past is unraveled to the gamer little by little and is utterly shocking
fei was dropped off to a stranger as a child bloody and unconscious by a mysterious man
what unfolds through feis tale is nothing short of pure genius
what you learn about fei is engrossing
characters arent what they seem secrets and backstabbing goes on everywhere you turn and youre not sure who to trust half the timechances are youre gonna walk away from this game paranoid too
while im trying not to spoil anything theres one particular moment when fei learns about what really happened to his motherits hands down the most disturbing scene in video game history
the cut scene that shows this moment is ten times more powerful than the death of a certain character in final fantasy vii and its proof that cut scenes are important in games
its as i said disturbing shocking and you feel feis pain like you were in his shoes
its one of the greatest moments in video game history
and xenogears is filled with lots of these moments throughout its incredibly long tale
id give more away but really you should just play this yourself
the music isnt half bad either
ive never really been a video game music fan i listen to the real stuff but i did enjoy it nonetheless
its a dreamy mix of ambient and electronic music
the control is your standard rpg stuff nothing new but at least it isnt horrible
the combat sequences are original and for once fun
while its still turn based you can chainlink attacks and you even have super combos that are called deathblows
very innovative and very fun
you can also fight in your gear too
this changes the mechanics of the battle and adds a new scope to it all
its even more innovative and its even more fun
the disks that make up this game are filled with lots of text
lots and lots of text
the length of xenogears makes final fantasy vii look like a stroll around the block and it only takes up two disks
thats what will seperate the boys from the menwill you have the skill and the patience to beat xenogears
or will you be going back to yet another game of final fantasy vii
simply putif you call yourself an rpg fan and dont own this youre not a real rpg fan if you call yourself a gamer and dont own this youre not a real gamer
this is one of the greatest tales in video game history
its epic its brilliant its shocking and its a mustown
if games were human xenogears would be a god among men
good luck on finding a copy nowadays thoughwith the popularity of anime on the rise this title will do nothing but help
xenogears is an amazing rpg
its dual battle system with or without gears is great
the point system used to gain powerful attacks is  very interesting too if a little complicatedthe game covers a large  world with a lot of characters
the storyline is great
its one of the  best that ive seen comparable to final fantasy vii and much better than  viiithe only complaint i have is with the save and repair systems
saving only occurs on the world map or at save points like most squaresoft  rpgs that are spread much too far apart
repairing gears can only occur  in gear shops same with refueling
combining this with the save system  can make the game very difficult especially the very endother than  that this game is great
i highly recommend it to any rpg fan
its has  a new twist to the rpg theme and has a great story driving it throughoutxenogears is another one of squares epic masterpieces to come out of their golden age around the time they were making final fantasy vii through final fantasy x
sadly square seems to have jumped the shark after merging with enix
after making so many masterpieces they start pumping out the absolutely dreadful final fantasy x and the lackluster final fantasy xii
i really dont know what happened to them  anyway back on topic
this game is awesome
lets find out whygraphics score  the graphics could be better
these are not the best ive seen on the ps
i cant quite remember whether or not these were outstanding for their time but they certaintly arent on the highest level of what the ps can achieve
the cutscenes are done in a d anime style which just feels timeless and classic
thus ill give the graphics an overall average score of music score  the music is very good
everything feels like it belongs and nothing particularly grates on your ears
the battle music is upbeat and enjoyable
some of the music is quite memorable
in fact its good enough you might buy the soundtrack
so no complaints at allcharacters score  this is what characterization is all about
the main characters are all extremely well developed and interesting
everyone has a distinctive personality and backstory
this is what makes an rpg good aside from the story of course
fei your main character is particularly welldeveloped
he seems to be suffering from a fictionalized form of dissociative identity disorder
i love it when my video game characters are mentally ill
even characters that you might think are just comic relief later prove themselves to be multifaceted and complex
this section gets a perfect score from mestory score  is there even a word for how awesome the story is
among of sea of standard save the world from generic evil bad guys plots this game really stands out as unique
i mean the storyline deals with some surprisingly mature topics for an rpg including themes of religion the nature of memory prejudice reincarnation and even cannibalism
the story might be even better than the much touted storyline of final fantasy vii and i love that game immensely so im really giving xenogears high praisebattle system score  combat is turnbased but unique compared to the more traditional turnbased games like final fantasy or grandia
basically you have ap which are points that you can use to perform strong moderate or weak hits these are mapped to various buttons like the triangle button and the o button
you use up your ap for the turn and then perform a string of attacks
certain combinations are deathblows which are much stronger attacks
theres also more traditional magic attacks to choose from and such
this system although similar to more traditional rpgs feels somehow fresh and different
its a bit more complex than just choosing the attack option
the only downside is that it can feel a bit tedious having to input all those commands sometimesgameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
the menus are fine
this game was a bit unusual at the time because it features a rotating camera
in other words the camera isnt fixed  you can rotate a full  degrees
for the most part this works fine and navigation isnt too confusing
i must complain a bit about dungeon design which can be a bit confusing
a whole lot of the dungeons are rather mazelike and easy to get lost in
whether or not this bothers you will probably depend on your sensibilities as a gamer but i found just a little nervewracking and i opted to use a guide  dont shoot me
anywho the only other issue i can think of has to do with a bit of a glitch
my copy of the game would tend to freeze up in this one area over and over again
i eventually got past it and never had that problem again on subsequent playthroughs
i dont know if it was just my copy of the game or if the games programming may be prone to glitchiness or what but i just thought id warn youoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
well this game has certainly earned its place among the classic rpgs
if you are a serious rpg fan and somehow havent played this game yet i strongly suggest you pick it up
its rather expensive right now unfortunately but its well worth having in your collection
go get itwhen this game first came out i was maybe only  years old and simply could not understand its indepth concepts that the story was focused on
it was maybe only after  years when i was  and in my college years that i could finally start grasping what the story was about
it was impressive nonetheless and i dont feel bad at all for not understanding such complexstory telling and themes when i was youngerdespite being a playstation game it has features that several modern games today lack
gameplay
being constrained by technology at its time i believe the developers did a topnotch job of designing this game and its game mechanics to the fullcapabilities of the playstation
i have been playing videogames for more than  years now and would much rather play this game than perhaps any other modern game out there todayif there was one thing that i would wish the developers had included in this game it would be the diabolos scene
they tried to present the event with such a dominant theme that i thought that it was going to be included in the story
it turns out that it wasnt and i was rather lenient with that but still left curious
thats because i felt that it was rushed in order to keep the pace with the later half of the story
even though they didnt include the diabolos scene it still didnt make the game any less fantastici think one of the reasons why this franchisegame was so successful was because the developers really put their heart and soul into making this game with vivid storytelling and characterdepth analysis and you really dont see that much in todays moderngaming society
what you will get instead is the stunninggraphics akin to a beautiful woman who has no personality
no offense it was a metaphoroverall this game is biblical
not literally according to the stories in a typical cathedral but with concepts surrounding several biblical namesthis game obviously isnt intended for narrowminded people so dont play it unless youre willing to accept a lot of terminology and concepts and beliefsxenogears has to be one of the best games ever
the plot is absolutely mind blowing and the character development is one of the best i have ever seen in an rpgi dont want to get too involved with the plot since i dont want to ruin itbut ill explain it the best i can
you play the role of fei an orphan who was found outside of the small town of lahan
three years later his best friends are getting married but the night beforea group of gears crash land in lahan
fei trying to save everyone climbs into an unmanned gear but upon getting in the gear malfunctions and kills almost everyone in the town
everyone is quick to blame fei for it so he embarks on a journey to find out about his past and what really caused the malfunction of the gearthe game really takes off from there it gets better and better as it goes along
the character development is fantastic each and every character has a story behind them and keeps making you want to find out more and more about themmy only complaint is the dungeons are extremely annoying
if you miss one thing you have to do it over from the beginning
it gets more frustrating than challengingthe battle system is turnbased and it might take a little while to get used tofor handtohand and gearbut once you do get used it its one of the bestthe music score is very nice the anime scenes are fantastic and the game will keep you on the edge of your seat
it is definitely one of my favorites only behind chrono trigger and final fantasy 
i cant recommend a better game get it asapdespite this games ageunlike fine wine it totally kicks
its very addictive and has seemingly limitless hours of gameplay
a one of a kind fighting system that has a large number of combos that can be learned and performed
your characters cycle between fighting in large hand to to hand combat and ether using mech like robots and reg character battle
this is the kind of game serious gamers lose sleep meals girlfriends jobs etc on
the storyline is original and flows very well however its very difficult to navigate at times bc of viewpoint and details that are easily overlooked that being my only gripe
the landscapesfmvsmostly anime style which are beautiful for its timeand especially thesub world map areas are designed richly and beatifully
this to me is the kind of fantasy game that captures the whole of your imagination
i think its a shame that no rpg released since this onethat ive played has managed to reach such a level of enjoyment and im speaking mostly of the battle system alone
it rivals games such as chrono trigger and the first suikoden
i recommend this game to any serious gamer who is looking to start on a long and very enjoyable gaming experienceand its true too
this is one of the best if not the best rpgrpgs ever createdluckily for me i bought this game right when it hit the shelfs  
i think the only way you can get one is by buying it from someone or getting it off an auctionanyway the story is amazing
its preety confusing at first but if you really pay attention you should understand it
but this game is for people  years old because younger kids would never get this story
but like i said it is amazing and it is written perfectleythe gameplay is very fun
the battles unlike the final fantasy series are very fun to play
you get to use combos magic etc
etc
etc
you press triangle for weak attack square for medium attack and x for strong attack
its great
most rpgs just have an attack command an stuffthe graphics is where this game lacks
they arent bad but it just isnt good either
the people look very blurry when the camera gets really close but  of the time the camera is in its normal anglebuy this game if possible  its greati absolutely loved the soundtrack to this game
yasunori mitsuda is one heck of a composer
this is to replace the broken one
needless to say i love the game enough to get another copy to keep its place in my shelfthis game is definitely for those who like a story on the thoughtprovoking and serious side
mindless hack and slashers need not apply
though there is quite a lot of fighting in this game it also requires a lot of reading and a good deal of patients
there are times when this game can be a bit hard or frustrating but the deep storyline and the glorious anime cut scenes will keep serious rpg gamers coming back for more
in a time when games seem to be more about good graphics and sex appeal then trying to immerse a player into the time and plot of the games situation it might be a little refreshing dip to visit a game that puts an emphasis on good graphics for its time and a wonderful idea filled storyxenogears is a classic rpg that i rank  alltime only behind final fantasy vi
the game is a thoughtprovoking tale and is one of the greatest rpgs stories ever told
the characters deal with a variety of issues which include class struggles war religion romance and moral dilemmasthe gameplay is unique also as it involves human handtohand combat as well as mech gear combat
combat switches between the two seamlessly
additionally many upgrades are available for the gears which facilitates deep customization
in my opinion the game was way ahead of its time and is far superior to the xenosaga sequels that followed on the psat the time the fusion of d sprite and d graphics pushed the psones limits and to this day the game still looks great
my only complaint with the game is that the gear battles tend to be on the easy side while the human battles were typically more difficult
there could have been better balance between the tworegardless xenogears is a mustown if you consider yourself an rpg fanthis is what games should be modeled after at least in terms of plot
its engaging imaginative and considering the scififantasy setting it takes place in believible
add to it remarkable gameplay and stunning music from one of the masters and what is created is perhaps the best rpg of all time its easily on par with chrono trigger and final fantasy vithe plot while too complex and confusing to put here is the focus of the game
while the game borrows from many rpg cliches it does so with a deft touch
the changes in all the characters happen slowly and naturally
nothing is forced
fei is by far one of the more interesting protagonists in rpg history
but the villains are by far the most interesting charactersunlike many villains in most video games the ones in xenogears do not represent a monolithic structure
thankfully there are several different factions at play here some under the guise of other enemies others working for themselves
they all have their own personalities and motivations creating an interesting tapestry of obstacles to overcome all the while asking the player if they actually are the enemies of the game
they represent the multifaceted goodness that is xenogearsphilosophically this game is incredible
it asks questions about pretty much everything but leaves it up to the player to come up with the answers for the most part
the questions it raises about religion are particularly interesting today given world and national newsthats not to say the game is boring
while its long    hours of play the first time through theres plenty of action
its a good thing then that the combat system is the most engaging ive ever played
its simple yet powerful and above all elegantthe only things wrong in the game are some errors in translation dated graphics and the fact that the plot can be muddlesome the first time through
its like a good novel
play it once to get the general idea then play it again and again to get the details
you wont be disappointeda good story depends on a plot that keeps the viewerreader interested characters that one can understand and sympathize with and subtle meanings and undertones which are not evident at first glance
by these standards xenogears is an excellent story
the plot while complex remains intriguing as it twists and turns
the characters remain sympathetic
more than most rpgs one can relate to the characters including the villians such as the idealistic krelian and the neurotic ramsus who walks the line between arrogant military man and self loathing trash
even the secondary characters from an old butler to a crusty sea captain to a philosophical queen remain interesting
unlike many games xenogears does not hesitate from embracing a view on modern cultural instiutions though be warned some of them will offend especially the rather nietzchian view of god and christianityin terms of gameplay remembering that this was in fact a game from  xenogears seems a little dated
the battle system while acceptable is fairly simple nowhere near as complex as some current games
while the graphics are limited they are not that offensive on the idea
the animated clips while often short seem a bit out of place
the music is excellent and some of it remains hauntingxenogears remains one of the more interesting rpgers ever made and is worth the time and attention of any rpg fanxenogears has great graphics and great sound
it boasts very likeable characters a phenomenal plot and many hours of game play that will leave you simultaneously feeling both fulfilled and wanting more
xenogears is an instant classic for any rpg fan from the moment it is picked upxenogears is one kicking game if you liked ff youll love xg 
but the drawback is once you beat it twice or so you probably wont want to play it again its a very long game
but after a long while youll crave some more xenogears once againevery now and again a videogame comes along that attempts to do something too few strive for
rpgs are known for their heavy reliance on story and character relationships but few ever really do anything about it
xenogears is the rpg that does not follow the curve but instead breaks it and reshapes itive only played one other series that compares in theme and storytelling metal gear solid
the thing that sets them both apart is the value the developers placed in creating a rich history and backbone to support the gaming world built on top of it
the story in this game touches on everything from philosophy and the meaning of life to racism and the ongoing desire of humanity to view the world as group of seperate nations instead of seeing as what it really is the same planet we all live on and try to survive on
the psychological figure that is the main hero fei fong wong is something that only ffvii has tried to do with a chracter
the story is mostly about his torn identity
it is played out over the stage of the world and has more to do with the rest of humanity than he seems to realize
does that mean hes the only character with real human prodblems
absolutelly not
his love interest is just as mentally fragile as are all of the characters that take this amazing journey with him
this story is set against the backdrop of religion and the effect our actions will and do have on the planet we live on which in turn effects all of our famalies for generations to come
does this sound like an impossible task to take trying to sum up all of these themes and stories in a piece of software that will only last about  hours
in most cases it is but not in the case of xenogearsthe gameplay does not take a backseat to any of this however
the battle system was and still is unique and invigorating
it is a unique blend of turnbased combat and combodriven mechanics that always keep you on your toes
the graphics and music were about as high quality as you could get at the time
there is enough gameplay to keep you playing this game for upwards of  hours on your first playthru
there are cutscenes that show the war of nations played out through the use of giant robots and battleships that stir the senses
i cant overplay how much qaulity was put into this games gameplay and never at the expense of the bigger pictureif you never play this game youre only hurting yourself by not having had one of the most incredibly rich gaming experiences of all time
this game should be emulated by all but its pretty damn hard to follow such a class actthis game is a rpg that some will love with all thier hearts and others will despise
its not final fantasy vii
final fantasy vii is known as the game that made rpgs cool
with flashy graphics an epic world saving plot and at that time unparalled graphics it hooked people that had originally never previously touched the genere
but for old school rpgs those that played and finished the ffiv hard type those that finished the first phantasy star those that had been playing these kind of games since mario cleaned his first pipe it was a shallow experience
characters had nowhere near the amount of depth of final fantasy vi the combat was very much simplified so was much of the gameplay
xenogears was the answer too the oldschoolers complaints
and prayerswith a sprawling twisting multityred storyline that just added twist after twist revealing layer after layer of imaginitive well thought out well developed characters
it had a simplistic yet involving combat system that revealed more depth as the game progressed
yasunori mitsuda composed what is considered too be his best work for the musical score
the graphics eh were up and down
but always always got the emotion accrossbut back too what old school rpg gamers loved about this game
a deep deep deep storyline that just would not quit surprising shocking and entertaining you
characters in this game had unparalled depth the story was a work of pure beauty that deserved to be on a bestseller list
never before had i gotten so attatched too video game characters
it was something i personally had started playing rpgs for from feis seemingly good guy nature yet monstorously troubled past too barts brash nature conflicting with his responsibilities too his people
too dans thirst for vengence against fei there is a sense of drama and emotional pull that cannot be denied
and there was a pretty cool game underneath it all too bootbut i feel i must warn some people
this game was nearly banned from western shores due too its religious tones
religion in this game does draw many paralells too christianity
and it is not really represented favorably
faye we find out early in the game is the one destined too kill god
and he does do so by the games end i wont spoil things but if you are offended by religious and perhaps unfavorable religious themes in fiction
do yourself a favor and stay away from this gamethose that prefer a simpler yet dazzing experience swear by ffvii those that desire complexity in gameplay worship final fantasy tactics and those that want too experience great fiction know that the king of storylines walks tall and shakes the heavens in one very cool mech
your enjoyment of this video game will depend on why you play rpgs
i personally play too read cool works of fiction while plaing fun games
so this game ranks as my favorite rpg of all time
towering even above ffix suikoden and final fantasy tactics
if however you just want glitzy graphics at the cost of some story and gameplay depth go for ffx or even seven
both are great games but do have thier drawbacks in my bookbut thats just my opinion i could be wrongafter playing xenosaga i was quite eager to pick this game up in some way
unfortunately somehow crash bandicoot made the greatest hits collection and great games like xenogears are forgotten but i was fortunate enough to drop the name near a kid who had a cousin who had a copy which i was glad to purchase since the cousin didnt like iti must admit i was somewhat disappointed with the battle system
although it can be fun at times it lacked the luster that the materia and sphere grid systems had in the world of final fantasy simply making battles mediocre button pushing
the slightly dull combat system wouldnt have been so bad if battles had taken any strategy but for the most part and with a few exceptions near the very end battles are mostly just using your strongest combo and healing yourself when necessary
once you get billy in your party you become practically invincible since he is able to heal the entire party for more than  hp for a paltry  ep
the best aspect of the games combat system however would be the gear system
although not used as well as in xenosaga xenogears makes gear combat fun by separating it from the status of the characters but also giving the gears abilities based on the abilities of the character riding them
fighting in gears however is always done in a way that you cant win without them or you cant use them
the only times youll have access to your gears is on the world map and in places with large enemies that would crush a party on foot
this is once again a place where squaresoft could have added strategic elements benefits of battling in gear vs on foot an element used brilliantly in xenosaga yet decided to opt for simpler battles for a more complex story linethe music in xenogears composed by the brilliant yasunori mitsuda of chrono trigger and chrono cross fame was terrific for its time but with the quality sound that the ps is able to put out xenogears music will just get dull especially to the ear of one who has played xenosaga
also like in many other rpgs xenogears music is extremely repetitive especially during the second disc
the theme song for this game was done by joanne hogg and is verysimilar to the theme songs from xenosaga using the exact same instrumentation and style yet hoggs voice just has that enchanting quality which i havent yet tired ofxenogears story is where it shines and earns its entire five stars
xenogears takes elements of religion fantasy and scifi and mixes them to create the uplifting suspenseful story of youngfeis search for the truth and escape from it in a world of lies
enter the character of elhaym the beautiful soldier who happens to stand at odds with fei due to her birth and origin who changes fei forever by showing him the joy of love
each character has his or her individual motive from the villains to the heroes each trying to find what they most desire
some wish for power others for love and others simply answers to lifes most difficult questions
from the beginning of the first disc you are propelled from feis quiet existence in a small village in the woods toward the flying cities of shevat and solaris to the paradise mahanon
the second disc unfortunately falters as the action is greatly reduced and the game becomes almost a series of monologues telling us what happened and how
for a good example imagine if the scene whereluke and han rescue princes leia in star wars were replaced with luke andor han sitting in a chair saying we then traveled to the death star to save the princes
we found out that she was being held in a certain cell and saved her but on the way out we encountered some guards picture in background of the heroes and storm troopers engaged in fighting we only survived by jumping down a hole into a trash compactor etc
this gets somewhat obnoxious but im sure that this was only done to save space and avoid the obvious irritation of having a third disc for the end movies
if youre completely into the games story you wont mind the dialogue bits too much since they allow you to skip over some annoying bits that would keep you from getting to the incredible conclusionfor those xenosaga fans out there this game will make a great hold over until feb  when episode  comes out
i know im going to be at walmart at opening to get my copyi loved this game
i loved the idea of gears and everything else
a must buy
although they do seem to talk a lot and it may be boring to some people if you just have some patience youll get right into it and wanna actually hear more
its a shorter rpg but that doesnt mean its worse than the rest
like i said it may be lacking in length but the gameplay graphics storyline and the music which i loved to death
could listen to them all day
will surely make up for it
the characters are once again amazing
at certain points the game can turn confusing but everything turns up good
this is a game that you dont want to miss out onxenogears is the best rpg to have ever been made
the flawless combination of love military deceit genetics extraterrestialist thinking flashbacks  and religion make the story the driving factor in this game
this is the  best story i have ever read or experienced
the story is better than every  book and movie i have ever seen by farif you like things like the xfiles  and end of times thrillers you will eat this up
i wouldnt recommend  getting this for  year old the story is too complex for little children  and i wouldnt want them seeing all the antichristian beliefs in this  game
i dont recommend the game to those who are deeply christian or in  the clergy but if you enjoy science fiction and final fantasy you will love  this
final fantasy vii and viii were just save the world from evil with  love element thrown in although those two games were enticing neither one  still matches xenogearsthe music was done by yasunori mitsuda off the  chrono trigger music team and it is the best music i have ever heard in a  video game
the music even beats final fantasy tactics
the music does get  repitive but you really dont even notice it because you are so involved in  the storyboth gear and player battle systems were great but there  should have been some way to revive downed gears in this game
the game  takes  hours to beat anyway and reviving gears could have easily  shortened the game by  hours
thats  hours you would have spent  backtracking through the game due to that one gear that died
the ap combos  are a nice addition from the deathblows of the previous final  fantasiesif you like science fiction and religious stories you will  love this
this is good for people who are even mildly interested in who we  are and where we came from
this game will give you some sort of an  explanation and will leave you thinking about it for a long time to come  after you finish it
peace out daggerthis is by far the greatest game ever made
i have it on display in my housewas a game i always wanted to play when the play station came out an now i have that opportunitygame work with out error the case and book close if not perfect conditionthank youokay this game is one of those gems to keep forever
has a great set of characters great battle system great number of hours to keep playing and so on
the story can throw you off a little because it does get a little confusing
if you ever find a copy of this game get it
youll be happy you did
hint if you did beat the game already and want to see the ending again use that cinema trick used in lunar silver star story i think its this one because it worksxenogears is the first game that comes to my mind when i think of an involved rpgbattle system the battle system is pure joy
though not quotactivequot the enemies wait for you to choose your attack before attacking it allows you to every turn use your given bp to choose what to do
you can always use an item ether or whatever the characters magic abilities are called they vary by character or defend etc
take all of your current bp
your bp increases with level
your starting bp is  at the beginning
your triangle attack always takes  bp square attack takes  bp and x attack takes  bp
you can combine the bp in any way but you cannot use over your total bp
you aquire skills by using the bp in ways that relate to or are a skill combo ex
you want to learn a skill thats combo is square square
to learn it you need to use square square in battle or for a greater effect something that is close but not exact like triangle triangle square
as you work towards the skill a bar appears in the menu under character choose a character and then enter skills
the bar tells the percent completed learned it is
if you dont have bars for some skills dont worry because bars only show up when the percent reaches at least  if the bar reaches  and you dont have the skill you are not at the required level yet but dont worry it just means that youre ahead
if you only use  bp and press circle to back off you gain ap which is basically stored bp
you gain the amount of bp that was not used in ap
ap can only be used to perform combo attacksin this review i call them big attacks just because its a habit
big attacks are where you have enough ap to use two or more of your skills
you enter the combo menu and choose two or more skills to use
then just select them sit back and watch your skill attacks be used in a lightning fast and more powerful manner hence big attacks
battles can be tough and the gear mech battles are interesting though somewhat easier
in gears you use fuel for everything
instead of using bp you use fuel
items magic type attackssupport escaping etc
does not use fuel
the main difference in battle with gears is that you only use one of the  attack buttons per turn
triangle attacks take  fuel square attacks take  fuel and x attacks take  fuel
the more fuel the more powerful
every time you attack you gain a type of level
if you are at level  you can press triangle and then follow it up with another button like a skill providing you have the corresponding skill for the person outside of the gear
if you have  levels you can perform a square skill etc
as you can see battle is gloriousstory wow this ones a mindblow
it is very confusing but rewarding
the anime cutscenes arent my style though
the story is somewhat controvercial since it revolves around people using gears to try and destroy god
the protaganist fei uses a mech that was prophesized as the destroyer of god
as usual in rpgs the main character has a dark past and he suffered from amnesia which comes straight from rpg  the plot is very good and consumes much of the incredibley long game time
i must warn you though the slowwitted need not applygraphics good for its time
your friends will probably think that youre crazy if you are impressed versus nextgen games but hey its squaresofts only completely d game it is the sole game from squaresoft with a moveable camera which swings left and right with the r and l buttons even if it can be wonky and some angles are downright terrible in certain areassound this is one of the rare games with a likeable soundtrack
i embarrassingly found myself humming a tune from it before
the use of instruments is great and the composer is right up there with the final fantasy composer im not even going to try to spell their names
i could do without the vocals in some songs though but thats ok the battle music is awesome it makes you want to fight battles
wowlength what
i spent over  days on this game
whoa
 hours is what i call length
need i say morecontrol it fits and it fits well
besides the wonky and inprecise camera swivel it works for meoverall buy immediately
rent it borrow it whatever it takes
i suppose if you were offended by the story concept or arent into  hour games it might be a nono but otherwise just buy itthis is one of the most entertaining yet serious rpgs i have ever laid my hands on
this story starts off with our hero in the midst of a gear battle in his village which is destroyed and many of his friends killed
he seeks answers in the empty gear that remains at the scene and the vast game unfolds as he uncovers the secrets of his past and future
as i said this is one serious game of biblical porportions
the music is among the best and if you like martial arts and robots this is the game for you
get it while it is still out thereim not sure what a lot of these haters are saying ive had this game for many years way before the greatest hits came out and to this day i still go and play it
this is my top  of favorite rpgs its so good great story and you can jump on a old rpg its amazingthis game brought some controversy even before its release
some fundamentalist found its storyline absurd atheistic and therefore must be condemned
i believe this is due to misunderstandingif you love anime excluding pokemon this game should sound very natural
bit of violence some mecha some religion and some scifi elements are blended perfectly into one gamegraphic  anime scenes are generally well done
afterwhile you will see the influence of production ig
with character design etc
however general graphic looks unrefined at best
characters are very blocky and stiff
you will find this tolerable with ps option onsound  amazing simply amazing
chrono cross moved me to buy the soundtrack but this is even better
every note perfectly captures the emotion of the game itself
once you finish this game try to listen quotjune mermaidquot
it will ache your heartstory  this is where people are divided into
some hated it while some loved it
if you are fan of neon genesis evangelion chrono trigger grandia you will love it
while some denounces this as atheistic i think they misunderstood it altogether
this game is about timeless love brought by fate plain and simple
other elements are played to make this story complete but not the primary pointit is unknown at this point whether xenosaga episode i will be true prequel or not
but if you love this game you will be anxious to get it just like me
if you own playstation and have yet to play this game do yourself a favor and get a copy
you will be rewarded with hrs
of goodnessxenogears  is a fantastic oldschool rpg about a young guy fei wong fong whos unintentionally trust into the middle of a conflict he may already be a part of
if that sounds opaque thats because it is
the story is very deep and complex and requires quite a bit of reading and perseverance
this is one of the more textheavy rpgs ive played but that shouldnt deter you
combat is turnbased has random encounters and is split between handtohand martial arts and mech or gear battles
visually the game is gorgeous
the character models in particular have a certain anime look to them that adds a lot of charm
the environments are d and you can rotate the camera  degrees to better view your surroundings
its said that the second disc is almost all text due to budget or time constraints
while that may be true it doesnt lessen the  hours of the first disc
rpgs of this ilk have a habit of standing the test of time better than most because a good story told well is always worth experiencing and because the nature of turnbased combat means it doesnt depend on the latest tech to remain successful
xenogears is now a somewhat old game thats only getting older but it doesnt feel it and deserves to be sought out by all rpg fans  stars a game i never knew existed until recently it plays well and is very unique
i reccomend this title and sequels to the xeno series
it has references to other great classics such as chrono trigger
check it outnintendo  is the best system out right now
it has great graphics and better games
nintendo makes the best games because they have the most contracts with companies
also nintendo systems retain their value more than sony or sega
nintendo is a great investment and you kids will love it
buy this systemi remember the first day i got an nintendo   i was all excited with the console all wrapped up with controllers and everything
the first game i played and had beaten on this wonderful and entertaining system was super mario and although it was an incredibly easy game it was fun and i was satisfied with it right until the end
i had nothing on n except that game so i must of beat it a million timesthen i got podracingthen i got gauntlet legendsthen i got mario golf mario racing podracing and zelda
all of those games that i have just listed above are indeed worth the money especially gauntlet legends and zeldai have enjoyed this system for years
i know that with all the other new and so called advanced systems such as xbox ps and plus gamecube you might be thinking that why buy an outdated system
well it really isnt outdated
i think that nintendo is still making new games for it and plus its an awesome system if you have a hundred bucks cash with youanyways get it
you wont be dissapointed
if youre thinking about buying a playstation one think again
nintendo  has  bit graphics on it
playstation one only has  bits
anyways i still view my  as clean and as polished as the first day i got one
i hope that you will buy one too because most of the games are addictive and plus they are still graphicly advanced
believe me this is an awesome systemnintendo  is the best system to date
so what if it doesnt have as many games as the playstation who cares
so long as the games that it does have are really awesome ie
zelda is the greatest game ever mario  perfect  dark dk slugfest and fzero xitll do fine
another thing loading  time is a non factor here playstation takes to darn long and cartrages  are far more durable than cds so you can slam your cartrages around and  they dont get bustedin conclusion n is the best system for games  fun and multiplayer because of its four controller ports
i suppose  thats why they call it quotthe fun machinequotyou have got to buy a nintendo 
dont bother buying a game cube
its not as good
trust me
stay with the nintendo  whyi love nintendo s
its got great games
the best ones are super mario  which was one of the first ones created but its a great d adventure where you have to get all  stars all of the international superstar soccer series legend of zelda ocarana of time and majoras mask donkey kong  paper mario mario party   and  tony hawk pro skater  and  and mario tennis with many more great games that i havent played
the next thing is the price
how much did it cost when it came outits great value for price
i think that everyone should buy this
i personally dont think the new game cube is as good however a reason not to buy it is that they will stop making as many games
they will concentrate on the game cube
i would still buy this because it is still the best console in the worldthis is a fun system
the controllers seem a bit odd at first but youll get used to them
the system itself is light but durable and so are the controllers
there are so many games for this system and a lot of them are really cheap now
ive played on all the nintendo systems and so far this one is my favoritethis game system works great
i have hooked it up and put it through the kid and animal test already
it still worksamazing graphics are good but gameplay is what really attracts me
this is something the n is really big on
the two zelda games perfect dark and the new conkers bad fur day
i would buy a used n just for conker
that game is totally awesome
since the system is getting somewhat old though you should buy a used one and save moneyi cant wait for game cube
nintendo has alway provided the best in entertainment
i hope it continues with gamecube
i saw some pictures for the new zelda and it is awesome
as for  it is way better than the super
great graphics
especailly with dk  and majoras mask
forget playstation and sega
go with nintendo
anyway its the end of the line for sega they announced a deal that they are talking with nintendo to  send sonic to nintendo
that will be great sonic is segas only good game
but until then we have the  and i love iton the n you can play almost anything and do almost anything on including pokemon and mario games
i recogmend you buy this nowits just is a great deal
the system is great
its cheap and fun
buy this and not a nhere are what i think about other systems compared to the n
playstationgraphics too poor
dreamcastid dump it st day
game boy colorgood idea but doesnt work for long time gamers
playstation heard bad things about it
if you get this system get tony hawks pro skater dk or pokemon stadium
all  are great games especially pokemon stadium and dk
get if you want awesome gameswhen the n was released it wiped genesissnesthe first playstation and the saturn off the map with its superior sound and graphicsnot only that current systems like x boxplaystation  and game cube dont have nearly enough good games to compare to the ni mean come on the cube might have better graphics but n  had better games
games are the most important thing for a systemthere is doomquakemario donkey kong majoras maskrogue squadronocarina of timedr
mario super smash bros and many more
plus it has cartridges that are fool proof so you dont have to worry about your idiot cousin breaking themwell enough saidreleased in  the nintendo  is the oldster of the current generation of game systems
it is extremely impressive therefore that it has held up as well as it has
while the other games have had to come out with new consoles requiring more money and new game purchases in most cases the n has remained quite playable and currentmario  one of the first games available is still one of the best games available
other games such as the zelda series pod racer and mario cart are equally as fun and give days if not months of gaming fun
the library of games available for the n is simply hugethe nintendo  recently released an expansion pack which upgrades the graphics and speed of the machine allowing games such as pod racer to show off even higher class graphics than the base system
newer games like majoras mask require the expansion pack to playweve owned a n for years and find that no matter who comes over to visit or what the age group of the visitors there is always a game that is vastly fun to play
there are singleplayer games party games competition games cooperative games thinking games shooting games and everything in betweenfor a household looking for a fun way to spend time together or to relax and have fun the n is definitely worth looking into
it holds up well compared to the other consoles on the market has a huge library of games available and offers something for everyonefirst and foremost one of the reviewers said that the n was beaten dovn crippled by the psx really bad
this however is an untrue and in fact an outdated rumor
i have read many reviews on cnn and other trustworthy sites and the ture fact was that n sales was only beten by psx sales by only a little
sure psx sold a little more units but the legend of zelda oot sold more than any psx titles available
another thing is the ns power
for its time it was the only d system around
some may argue that psx is d but actually it is not considered d because most of its games run in d and all the rpgs are overhead view
the only d part are the fmvs but those are recorded and not true graphics
even today n is very powerful
if there is a list of the top  systems in the world n would make it and psx will not
also nintendo is smart moving onto gamecube and sony is stupid because they are still trying to support the cheap and outdated low pologonal psx
n and gamecube is the way to go
psx ps and xbox can just go in the trash cannintendo will never be outdone just outpricednintendo started off making small hand held electroic games before creating the  bit system in the s
and when they released the super nes they had the  greatest home video game systems of the day
sega never stood a chance because they rushed things just to compete with nintendo where as nintendo took there time when releasing systems to make sure they where the best they could be
only the people whose mothers bought them a sega instead of a nes or snes where the ones who would defend the sega systems
but the segas where slow graphics wernt as good and the sound was as bad as the game play handlingnintendo had completly beaton sega in the market of games
but sega brought out an attachment for the genisesmega drive that allowed you to hook on a cd rom drive to the machine
and nintendo decided to make an even better one to attach to the snes
if you look on the bottom of a snes console you will see where it would attach
the cd rom for snes was being developed by nintendo and sony
but arguments arose between sony and nintendo and sony seperated themselves from nintendo and went solo on the project that eventualy became the playstationthe playstation was only twice as powerfull as the snes
the snes was  bit the ps was  bit
so ninetendo developed a  bit system twice as powerfull as the playstaion better graphics better controll and better potentiolbut when the  was released it did not get the fair attention it should have
why
because of the cds sony used
not because they where better not because they where slower not because they where more funno it was because people where buying them ripped  copied  burnt  bootlegged for a small price
and this still goes on today
that was the biggest reason why sony was having more succsess then nintendo
because those cd rom games where able to be copied and the cartridge of the nintendo was notthe ps games only surpassed with slightly better sound the  could play high quality sound but it was up the games developer on wether or not to use up space on the game with sound or not
that is about the only advantage the ps had sound particuly just music
some people say the controllers of the ps where better then the n but i preffer the  it did take some time to adjust to it but that is personaly taste rather then anythingthe nintendo  suffered a blow when more game developers wouldnt make games for the  anymore because it was easier to put them on a cd and develop them that way then to program them for cartridges
so that is not nintendos fault that is the game developers fault for being lazy and just wanting to make quick games instead of decent and good gamesnintendos team called rare where the ones who always pushed the boundry on games
just like they did with donkey kong country on the snes they broke new ground by not just using the full potintiol of the system but by finding ways to go beyond its full capabilty
they released one of the best games on the  called golden eye
the james bond game was the st to use the full potentioal of the s capability
the game is amazing and still hard to beat by todays standards
the game did not even need the expansion pack the  soon offeredthe best games where coming from the game developers who put the effort into making the great games and the playstaion never had anything as fun to play as the  offered
the graphics where so much smoother the game play was so much more responsive and the fun was there
one of the first games i compared was wwf attitude
and pretty much like i said the ps version took longer to load wasnt as responsive the graphics where horriblly blocky and the only thing that was better was it had more sounds from the commentators
and maybe some of the entrance themes where longer
but apart from that nothing maybe video footage but that was never apart of what you where playing which is what counted and the ps was the thumbs down but because of people able to buy copied games the ps became popular that new comers to the sytem thought it was the better system
it isntthese days the battle goes on between nintendo sony  microsoft
but i know for sure nintendo will always supply quality games games worth playing games using full potentiol of the systems capability and most importantrespectas soon as this came out many people got it and bought the first game that came out for it that is also a hit game super mario  to this day people talk about this system more than any other old nintindo
this is the first nintindo that many series came out on like super smash bros and it is the first system that they used computers to make nintindo games
u can tell it is because just look at the graphics difference from the snes to this one which just stoped being made a couple of years before the n came out
this was one of my favorite nintindos that have ever came outif you are trying to decide which video game system you want to buy nintendo  is the way to go
ns library has something for everyone
psx and dreamcast tend to focus more on action shooter amp fighting games whereas nintendo is a more familyfriendly systemn is about quality not quantity it has far more quality games than any other system super mario  donkey kong  banjokazooie mario kart snowboarding  tony hawk mario party  amp  diddy kong racing goldeneye  perfect dark zelda ocarina of time wave race  star wars and starfox  are a fewns accesories include rumble pak expansion pak for better graphics controller pak for saving data and a variety of colorful controllersi have had n for  years and it has never let me down
the qualities to look for in a gaming system are the quality of the games and all the other platforms are lacking
and for a console amp  controllers you cant go wrongnow ever since the release of the original nintendo nes i have been a gamer
through the years ive owned nes nintendo entertainment system sega genesis super nintendo sega saturn sony playstation and sega dreamcast
most of these systems have had some great games but they always seem to lack something whether it being graphics speed or number of controller ports
but when i recieved nintendo  for my birthday in  i remember feeling absolute joy due to the fact they were sold out all over north america at the time
the first game i popped in my system was super mario  and ever since then i have been hooked
never have i owned a system with so many playable titles games that you could play over and over and even let  other friends join in on the action in fun and creative multiplayer modes
true the graphics are not playstation  quality but they suit me just fine and if given the choice i would take a nintendo  over playstation  any day
currently i own around  games and almost all of them see rotation from time to time and my n
well its sitting right here in my room still going strong after  years of hard and fun gamingthe n had some of the best games on the planet and eventhough n was a great system it ended too quickly cause of the gamecube
the n launched in some were in  and it launched some great titles and some incredible games
the n is one of the best systems ever but it also had a short lived history
i mean they could have come up with wayyyyyy more games nothe n was one of nintendos finest and is probably better then the gamecube
the gamecube didnt have much launch games but n did
it had some amazing graphics and some really amazing gamesthe n was at one point better then playstation and it could have but in the end the ps beat it
but make no mistake about
the n launched some pretty amazing games
hell some of the best games ever created
sure n is old and cheap but it still has some really awesome games likesuper mario legend of zelda the ocarina of timegreatest game everperfect darkconkers bad fur daystarfox paper mariofzero xdidy kong racingdonkey kongand some moreyou will get your  bucks worth of this system and i think it should cost more then that eventhough its out datedit has amazing games an amazing console and some really impressive graphics and that is why this is one of the best systems everbut it aint no dreamcast i can tellz ya thatthis systems earns a  out of  starslet alone getting ocarina of time is worth this system
get it
it ruleslatesfacts n features bit color and features real time gameplay
controllers are suitable and they are good for even  year oldsadults are welcome too
offers a huge library of games such as mario party majoras mask golden eye and more
never ever bored of the games or the system
system has beautiful designs and light enough to carry around
an official website nintendocom is now available for everything you need for the n sequence
dusts out sega and those other copycats of nintendo
company makes great nintendo consoles such as game boy and gamecube
no battery needed
some games have save game compatability to save games wo memory packs
beats out memory cards on sony
oldest company as far as i know
i personally beats ps but ps beats n
but who caresoverall i wish there would be like a  star review but only  so just to tell you that  stars  stars
this game must not be missed outim glad i waited until someone sold me the n  for  dollars instead of buying it when it came out for  dollarsthe reason i gave it  stars is because it has  stone cold classicssuper mario ocarina of timemajoras mask and banjo kazooie but im glad i waited until someone sold it to me for  bucksill tell you whythere arent enough excellent games for itwhen it first came out i was discouraged by the unusual controller and mario  was obviously something that is great but no other games to back the system up as far as i could seeplus i was happy with the genesis cause i was still on my toe jam and earl  and sonic the hedgehog thing
then the dreamcast came out it had an amazing gamesonic adventure but for some reason it got a bug or something and stopped workingthen in  i was looking for a new systemi thought to myself what company has characters that are equals to sonic and tjewhy nintendo of coursei remember the original nes had great games like the mario seriesmetroidthe legend of zelda and double dragonand game cube was clearly new generation the graphics and sound are magnificent and gloriousplus sonic is on the nintendo list nowas well as namcoand super mario sunshine is a fine sequel to mario  and super smash bros melee is obviously one of the best games of all time and the system has enough power so classics like the sonic series can be emulated onto one disc although when i first bought the system those games were never gonna be rereleased and put onto the systemhopefully nintendo itself will follow in sonic teams footsteps and emulate classics like the mario seriesthe legend of zeldametroid and f  zero onto a disc or twoi think maybe sonic team and nintendo actually do read what people put on amazoncom so they get new ideas to please their fansits a possibilityanyways ocarina of timeperfect darksuper mario  and majoras mask plus banjo kazooie are all classics even though i cant stand pokemon at allpokemon suckshow pokemon got so famous is beyond meits way too crass and commercial and easy and boringi cant stand pokemon in the leastbut the other games like mario  more than make up for a miserable waste like pokemongreat buy
have games will play
need this to play zeldas majoras mask
have all other systems couldnt see not having this one toothis is one of the best systems ive ever purchased
it has nintendo series that have been around since the nes was newincluding dokey kongmariostar foxthe legend of zeldaand metroid
plus new games such as sanfrinsisco rush and battle tanks
this is definitely a great system
although it only has  games which nes and snes had just under it makes up for it buy having them be more complex
although playstation and dreamcast may have better graphicsthe quality of nintendo games is unmatched anywhere
even though it will soon be outdated do to nintendo gamecubes releaseit will always be a great system
the controllers are also great
the only two complaints i have is the games are expensive do to the cartridge format and there arent as many games do to the system being antideveloper freindlyas nintendocom said
howevergamecube will problably has more games since nintendo is trying to make its games cheaper and more developer friendly by replacing cartridges with cds
but even if you do have enough money to skip ahead to gamecubeyoud miss a great intro to new nintendo games and this system has nearly as good of graphics and a small yet good selection of gamesthe nintendo  had a small yet a great library of games including the bestselling the legend of zelda ocarina of timethis console had the bestlooking kiosk in retail storesbut when the gamecube came out in  that unfortunately marked the end of the nintendo  nintendo published very few games for this system after the gamecube came outthe last game that was published for this system was tony hawks pro skater  which if youre lucky you can still find that game new today at retailersi hate it when video game companies discontinue consoles because they released a new one
look at computer manufacturers like dell
sure they make new computers but you can still buy older models from them not too old like a  computer though d
unfortunately video game companies even today have failed to recognize thisthe nintendo  is a old but still fun system to play
it does not have as many games as the playstation but it does have alot more  player games
the graphics are fairly good on most of its games but it still takes cartriges
ive had one for a while and it is still fun to play
the n has awsome titles like super smash bros kirby crystal shards zelda  goldeneye and more
the controllers are a little on the chunky side but after a while you get used to them
if you are looking for a system with good graphics great titles and not a huge price to pay then go for a nintendo oh geez how do i even begin writing a review for a lost playstation game called apocalypse
first of all lets get a few things straight this is a rd person shooter game and ignoring the control setup the game looks and feels exactly like mdk another actionpacked rd person shooter for the playstation
i mean the two games feel so much alike with the identical graphics and the same kind of occasional slowdown problems its almost hard to believe nobody has mentioned the comparison beforethe one difference between the two games is that in apocalypse you have to actually use four different buttons on the playstation controller to fire your weapon by the way your main gun has unlimited bullets which is very convenient
each buttons fires your weapon in a different direction
for example to shoot enemies that are located to the left of you you have to hit the square button
enemies to the right of you circle button
enemies behind you the x button
finally the button i personally use the most the triangle button to take out the bad guys located in front of you
from a shootingforward view the game is exactly like mdki read all the reviews i could find for apocalypse on the internet before buying the game but i had no idea just how many enemies each of the  stages would have
were talking about a lot of enemies such as giant tanks and laser beam shooting robots that are simply covered in each of the  stages to the point where many times the levels are too crowded to even walk past them
luckily the slowdown isnt too bad though it happens sometimes
its completely forgivable though
honestly when seven or eight robots are running in your direction at the same time youll probably be begging for a bit of slowdowni really love the soundtrack
were talkin hard rock tracks since action games need energetic music after all that normally fit in with the background setting of each stage quite well
when in a cave level the music doesnt rock very hard and instead sets a necessary dreary mood
on a street level the rock turns into heavy metal becomes faster and definitely rocks the house down
speaking of the street level my favorite part is when youre walking either down the street or along a building rooftop and you come across a giant tv screen which shows a band playing music
the stage music then changes to whatever kind of music you happen to be hearing on the tv screen
one tv screen showed a music video of a band playing a punk rockgrunge rock song
i really liked this idea
it gave me the impression that i was in a shopping mall or a carnival places where activity changes suddenly when walking only a few feet away
really cool ideathe thing that makes apocalypse such a challenging game are all the platform jumps you have to do
sometimes the character you control gets really small when the camera pans out and sometimes this happens at the exact moment when an important jump to a platform is needed
in these situations theres always a chance you wont be able to see what youre doing and your character wont make the jump and die
fortunately i havent come across anything as annoying as the jumping in the bridge level of the original crash bandicoot for instance
if youve never played that game boy was that level a total nightmare
you were required to land safely on top of these little pieces of wood barely holding a bridge together
yikesthe challenge in apocalypse definitely goes up once you arrive to level   this is when some very careful platform jumps are required in order to access an upper section of the stage and progress forward
no doubt you will fall off a few times before getting it right
luckily in this level you dont die if you fall off well for the first set of platforms and you land on some solid ground thats directly below youhowever once you reach level  you really need to pay attention to what youre doing or else you wont land safely on any of the many platforms and instead youll go straight into the lava
by the way theres moving platforms and revolving platforms
once you reach level  theres actually enemies standing on the moving platforms and shooting in your direction making the difficulty go through the roofi think the thing that really gets to me about the occasional frustration factor of the game is how sometimes it appears that youre lined up exactly right to jump to the next platform only for you to apparently be way off and then fall down into nowhere and die
this happens frequently in a few places and its really not fair
it makes you think what the how did that happen
luckily you can save your progress after each level you complete thanks to a memory card and i believe you always go back to  lives after a game over screenthe fact that health packs and weapons are located everywhere makes the game feel less frustrating
oh and if i havent mentioned it yet the weapons in this game rule
they are really coollooking
the flamethrower totally rules
everything in front of you burns immediately when firing that weapon
theres another weapon thats a giant purple lightning strike thing
it fires across the room zapping all the bad guys
those are just a few
awesome weapons overalli really love the sound effects in the game
your main character says a lot of funny things and i really think hes saying the sh word in one instance
i dont think a game company would normally allow that kind of language in a video game but apparently they got away with it here
the enemies also have their fair share of exciting lines and often times funny to make the whole experience more interesting
unfortunately the zombie level isnt anywhere as cool as the zombies found in the resident evil series
theyre just small little creatures that break apart into green balls once you kill them
aw mani should also note that using a regular playstation controller is probably the best idea
an analog stick may make certain platform jumps much harder than they need to be compared to a regular controller
thats just my preference thoughi love the level designs
i wasnt expecting so much creativity
besides the street and cave levels you have a graveyard and a lavafacility kind of place
nice varietyyet another forgotten little action game for the playstation gaming console
i love it and the challenge doesnt prevent me from giving the game a perfect score
for the great price its totally worth owningif you like stage games with cool weapon this game is for you
also you have brucs willus as the voice and that is always fun
i also enjoy hearing the sayings that he says while playing the game
its old school and the graphics are very basic however the game play is great and very simple to playthis game was one of the best carcombat games of the psonen and early dreamcast erahilarious characters good graphics the ability to play your own cds during gameplay and a halfdecent storyfantasticrocks on every level
if you have a ps or a ps then you should buy this game
if you enjoy any of the twisted metal games than you cant go wrong with this gamegraphicsgreat for the datesoundclear as a bellmusic out of game play out of i got hooked on vigilante  while in college
we used to play this game over and over at a friends apartment
i think the best thing about this game is the twoplayer mode
you can go oneonone against someone in versus or team up and pick your scene and your challengers
the one person mode also has a quest
theres a wide range of vehicles to choose from and each vehicle has its own set of advantages and disadvantages
if you select this option you can unlock five other chracters and two different scenes
once you beat a level a short clip is shown
some of them tie together and some of them dont and some of them are just fun to watch
when youre a part of the vigilantes the good guys the missions are a little harder
however when youre a coyote the bad guys the missions are much easier because instead of protecting property your bent on destroying it
overall vigilante  is a really fun game to play especially with a friendthis is without a doubt one of my favorite games over the fact it has tons of destruction crazy levels crazy cars and characters and odd weapons
some attacks include disco ball attacks bee attacks rocket launching gatling gun laser beams and more galore
playing with a friend so you can play coop or destroy each other is a memorable experience as well
the missions are basically to get yourself to the top and rule over everyone else and be the king of destruction
i cant say how much you should play this game because its full of fun and destructionokay maybe its not exactly interstate  but its obviously a spinoff from the game
the game features the same s soundtrack almost the same characters with some huge introductions and the same style of car combat
however they replaced the huge story with more of a traditional carcombat system which is really funthis game is arenaaction based so dont expect to look for hidden blue keys or anything like that
most of the time you travel through map after map annihilating each opponent until youre declared winner
each character has a different ending so its fun to go through all of the characterstheres a good variety of maps in the selection but the kicker is the maps are all pretty good
maybe one or two wont be to your preference but theres not one that youre going to want to skip like most maps in todays games
the character selection is pretty good too
every vehicle has its own strenth and weakness just like every other game but the specials on this game are just incredible
for instance one of my favorite vehicles is the camper truck with its bee attack
its completely silly to think bees could harm a metal ton rolling machine but hey its a video gamethe graphics in this game are pretty good given theyre nintendo  graphics
the one thing that stands out over the psone is the extra map which is sometimes tagged nintendo land although it has nothing to do with nintendo rather than its a reason to buy it on their system other than the playstationthe controls are really easy to use
its one of the good games that makes the n toothcontroller great to use
it really feels like youre driving with one hand on the wheel and one hand on a weapon selectorid say if you love car combat youre going to love this game
its really fun and will keep you busy for a good while
you can also pick this up on xbox live arcade as a  ms point download
its fun but i still think the original is a bit better mainly because it has more featureshalf life isnt a game its a way of life
the most involving and enjoyable game ever produced for the pc it pulls you into the world of gordon freeman and his escape from the black mesa research  facilityessential a first person shooter with style half life has  incredible graphics and attention to detail the helicopters being a fine  examplebe warned this game is huge it goes on for ages and never gets  boring
the slight downside is that theres a section at the end on xen  the alien planet which changes tack too much and can be frustrating to  completethe expansion pack opposing force is a worthy sequel to the  original game taking the action from a different angle
this time you play  a marine whos out to get gordon freeman and the good thing is that there  are fellow soliders with pretty good ai who are there to help  yousimply put this game is the business from the introduction  sequence the alien ai the graphics and the smooth gameplay there is  nothing better
buy iti think that this is probably the best pack out of all of them
who care about counter strike
if you buy a pack that includes cs you are paying extra money for a game that you can download for free on the internetany way
half life has a great story
you are gordon freeman a scientist for the black mesa research facility
then
it all goes wrong
aliens are everywhere
if thats not enough there are government grunt troopers coming in also
you think they are here to save you
they are notnow for opposing force
you are the grunt
you have crash landed at the black mesa facility after you chopper was shot down by an unknown craft
what the hell is going on
you must find your way past alien life forms so you can get out of this hell hole
at the same time your mission is to find gordon freemanthere are so many mods for this game its unbeleivable
this game is a must buy
if you dont own it welli dont know what to say
multiplayer rocks single player rocks everything rocksid heard about halflifethis supposedly incredible game from sierra
but im not a fan of the first person shooter so i thought quotwhy  botherquot but because i was curious about all the hype i decided to go  ahead and download the demo
thats all it took and i was hookedi  immediately went out and bought the adrenaline pack and have loved it
maybe it the intensity of the gameplay
maybe its the beautiful graphics
maybe its the realism music and sound
maybe its the sheer fun
but in  any event its the st firstperson shooter ive really really had fun  with since the initial doom days and worth every pennyyes team  fortess which you play with against others over the internet is a free  download you can get with the halflife game which is cheaper but youll  want oppossing forces as well so get it
to give you a lowdown on the  difference between the other two games in halflife youre alone for the  most part and fighting your way out of the black mesa facility
in  opposing force your the opposing force to the guy you played in halflife  but youre not alone
many times youll find yourself leading a squad of  rough and tough soldiers with different special abilities and its intense  and realisticcool features turn onoff blood
it matters where you  shoot creatures andor people to determine how injured they become unlike  quake and can outright die with one shot if well placed
aim for the  head
the sniper rifle is very sweet
and finally as your team members  get injured its visible in how they talk and walk
they limp if you can  believe it so you have to wait for them as they lag behind
overall  very cool game very cool gameplay very realistic and very fun
a must for  the diehard gamer or for someone whos not like myself
i never buy  games when they first come out
just too expensive
but this one i made an  exception for and havent regretted it one bitthis is the best game i have ever played
it is hard to explain and words hardly do it justicehalflife is a mostly scripted first person shooter
it is the scripting that truly makes it great
i still remember  the first time i saw  marines jumping out of their helicopter and sliding  down the rope towards me
that was about the time i realized they were  shooting me
its times like this when you forget youre playing a game and  begin to think you really are therei can guarantee that this game  will change the way you look at computer games
it is in a word  quotperfectquot
if you dont already own this game i strongly suggest  that you get it because if you dont like it you probably arent from this  planet i guess you wouldnt like because the game has some antialien  undertoneswarcraft was a hit in its day
although its pretty outdated war i still play it now and then because its still a playable rts game
this package contains warcraft   and expansion all of which are great
this is a  great addition to anyone classic game collection although i would suggest  buying warcraft  battlenet edition nowwarcraft  is an older game but has withstood the test of time better than most
it has the same policies as a modern day tibearn sun
mine gold cut tree and build farms
this game is a classic and withle other games  may now surpass it this is still worth getting
i can still play it an  have a good timewarcraft ii is a worshipful sequel to one of the first real time strategies ever warcraft
although it does not belong to the newest games of this genre it deserves a preferment in the game world gallery because it started the whole rts madness and brought many original features never seen beforethe game plot is simple  two races humans and orcs fight against each other to exterminate the enemy
a player selects one of the races and then he must command his soldiers and lead them to the final victory
is that everything
of course not
the strategy requies lots of different actions  send peasant to mine gold and chop trees to get resources for buildings train swordsmen bowmen knights and wizards construct siege machines build boats and ships fight on ground water and air
all of this is perfectly dramatized by amazing graphics music and sound effects
the game promises hours days and weeks of great funi am really looking forward to warcraft iii which should look even better in d environmentwarcraft ii isnt exactly the freshest realtime strategy game on the market but that doesnt mean its any less fun than it used to be
for those of you who missed it the first time around warcraft ii is set in a fantasy realm where knights hack at trolls with swords deadly spells crisscross the battlefield and powerful fortresses dot the landscape
the game pits the evil orcs against the humans letting players choose whichever side they want in a series of battles over the world
with the warcraft ii battle chest players can experience the magic of the original game along with the added enhancements of the beyond the dark portal expansion pack
rounding out the battle chest is a complete strategy guide that will walk beginners through the basics and provide more experienced players with advanced tactics so they can master the game
thats good because players will need all the help they can get challenging other warcraft ii fans online
its possible to challenge one to eight other players on the developers free battlenet servers while more solitary gamers can immerse themselves in one of the fun singleplayer campaigns or standalone missions
warcraft iis finely balanced gameplay has lost none of its charm even if the graphics are aging
in most missions you start with a small force and must gather enough resources to build a strong base of operations that can field a formidable armyjust as i remember it as a kid
it runs just as well on windows  with a few tweaks to the games compatibility screenthis game is still goodeven that its very oldstill lots of fun to play
thanks so much have a good oneoriginally released in  anachronox was the third and final of the flagship launch titles produced by ion storm following on from the appalling daikatana and the sublime deus ex
a computer rpg the game used the quake ii engine then already dated due to the release of quake iii and was critically lauded upon release
commercially it was a failure due to poor marketing but the game became a cult hit and attracted a small but devoted fanbase who remain active to this dayits hard to sum up anachronox easily
its a game with plenty of humour but its not a comedy
its set in an sf milieu but also features superpowers and magic
it was developed by an american studio but features a japanesestyle turnbased battle system both chrono trigger and the final fantasy series are cited by the developers as major influences and several minigames
this mixing and blending of genres makes it a unique game not quite like anything else out there but also contributed to its poor marketing and lack of strong salesmost of anachronox is played as more of an adventure game than anything else
you initially control sly boots and his ai assistant fatima
the game demonstrates its inventiveness and humour almost immediately fatima is an associate of boots who has died but her consciousness has been preserved as an ai system and placed inside a robot which floats around the environment and is a shaped like a large metal arrow
yes in anachronox your mouse pointer is a character
this is an awesome idea and leads to some humourous moments as characters in the city of anachronox start getting annoyed if you hover your mouse pointer over them since this results in fatimas robot body buzzing around themin traditional rpg style you soon accumulate a large number of companions two of whom can accompany sly at any one time
you can switch between these companion characters at will to take advantage of their special powers in combat or their knowledge in conversations with npcs
at several moments in the storyline the game splits the team up and proceeds down several parallel paths simultaneously with the game moving back and forth between the different characters and subteams to tell the story in full
in terms of format this style of playing will be familiar from the two knights of the old republic rpgs from bioware and obsidian but anachronox predates them by several yearsone of the highlights of the games design is that the characters special powers and abilities in combat are based on their characterisation
for example grumpos the grumpy old man character who reacts to any dialogue options with sarcasm or caustic remarks about how great things used to be has a special attack that allows him to waffle on at extreme length about various tedious subjects to bore an enemy into a stupor
combat is played out on a grid which allows characters to position themselves attack or carry out healing or buffing in a manner familiar from japanese rpgs
combat is not a strong focus of the game however and a surprisingly small amount of gametime is spent fighting
battles are also usually avoidable with lurking enemies visible in the distance allowing players to choose alternate routes
combat is enjoyable especially as its relative infrequency means it never becomes repetitive or tiresomesomething that anachronox manages very well is tonal variation
the game has a lot of humour in it but it also has some extremely dramatic scenes and elements of political satire and commentary as well
it moves between scenes of comedy drama tragedy pathos and satire and handles these transitions well thanks to some great writing a fine ear for dialogue and the games constant streak of inventivenessits impossible to talk about anachronox without mentioning its most barmy story element
in one lengthy subquest sly and his team arrive on the planet democratus where the ideal of democracy and collective leadership is worshipped but in practice is rather unsatisfying reduced to a tiny selfsustaining elite being voted for by a mostlysheeplike populace who vote on pointless subjects for the most spurious of reasons
the satire here is obvious but also rather amusing
at the end of the quest after sly and his friends have saved the planet from being devoured by a swarm of spaceinsects the rulers of democratus decide to hold a planetary referendum to vote for a suitable reward
sly and company flee rather than endure the planets longwinded voting process
later on in the game whilst in a bar the crew are rather bemused when the door opens and the entire planet floats into the room
the populace of democratus voted to miniaturise the entire planet and join slys team
from this point on the planet democratus is a member of the players party and can participate in battles using a fearsome planetary defense network and its own gravitational field as weapons as well as conversations
sly can also seriously confuse and distract npcs by just talking to them with a footwide planet floating over his shoulderlater on after a confrontation with the supervillain rictus catchphrase i shall kill youwith death
 our heroes are about to die inside rictus exploding ship so democratus reinflates itself to its full size scattering the party about the planets surface and tearing the ship apart and dumping its exploding engine core in a remote area
the party has to reconvene through a series of subquests including a quantum leapinspired quest set in a mountain village and another one where a downonhisluck alcoholic superhero regains his mojo by saving a young girl from death
this latter quest has no dialogue and plays out through music and the characters exchanging facial expressions
it is brilliantcriticisms of anachronox are mainly related to its age
its an older game now so players may find it fiddly to get it working on modern systems this post may be helpful
the graphics have dated though this means even people with bottomoftheline laptops should be able to play it with no problems
from a game design issue the opening couple of hours on anachronox feature a lot of fetchquests and running back and forth through a rearranging landscape which can be occasionally frustrating
more seriously the game ends on a neverresolved cliffhanger anachronox wasnt the first game in a planned series but actually the first half of a storyline that was broken in half due to length
surprisingly the games creators have not ruled out pursuing a sequel so have never explained how the cliffhangers was going to be resolved but have promised to do so if they cant get the sequel made by  at the latestbut that should be no reason not to check out this barmy inventive hilarious nicelywritten and finelycharacterised gamei love this game
i just finished it and i think that this one is going to be a classic
i like it about as much as deus ex another ion storm title
it starts off a bit slow but it picks up intensely about a third of the way through and it has an ending that knocks you out of your chair like the movie quotthe sixth sensequotthis is a unique blend of questfulfilling roleplaying and puzzlesolving
instead of controlling one character you control up to  characters and combat is turnbased like in a dampd game
when youre in combat you are exploring the universe solving puzzles and fulfilling little game quests yes you know that routine
each character has special abilities and combat moves which are gradually developed throughout the gamethe story and the animation in this game are wonderfully engrossing
the plot is filled with great cutscenes that will have you laughing out loud
the combat in this game is a lot of fun too
the game has a special animation effect for every combat move for every character and every creature
this animation is rich with great sound and eye candy like an episode of quotthe superfriendsquot
playing this game gives you the feel that you are in the middle of a saturday morning superhero cartoon
actually its a cross between a saturday morning superhero cartoon and an episode of the simpsonsone drawback to this game are that a lot of the puzzles are too darn easy to solve  the answers are basically spoonfed to you and all that you have to do is talk to everyone in the area and click on each object until you complete the quest
another drawback is that there is no flexibility in advancing your characters levels
this is unlike most other rpgs where you earn skill points in some way and then assign them to develop your character as you like
plus a lot of the dialog exchange in this game is done by text only the cinematic scenes are voiceactedthe game can be buggy but when you get it running  its worth itfor the merely curious anachronox is a wonderful game much more like deus ex than the disaster daikatana
in fact anachronox is shaping up to be one of my favorite rpgs ever
it plays like a traditional console rpg  explore a large world fight lots of monsters in simple turnbased combat and a wonderful story
the characters are pretty much pregenerated meaning you will have less control over creating their skills and strengths like in balders gate but instead you are rewarded with a wonderful tight story with each new party member adding something very interesting to the gameanachronox is an awesome rpg where it counts  awesome story strong characters a huge and fascinating world and irrisistable charm
there is so much personality in every inch of this game even humor
like wackmaster jacks where the elite meet to beat
i can tell already that this is a game which would be fun to play a nd or rd time because much of the story is told through the environment and there is simply too much to see the first time throughgranted anachronox uses an outdated graphics engine and you can tell
there are blocky characters and lowres textures everywhere
however the sheer size of the levels quickly made me ignore these faults
no other d rpg has cities this big with skyscrapers towering in all directions each of them available for exploration
each alien world is distinct imaginative and instantly recognizablethis is one game i hope and pray they make a sequel forthis is a very unique game with hilarious dialogue memorable characters and just a fun time overallthe combat system is standard rpg turnbased fare but what makes this really worth it are the story and characters
youll never quite find another group like the one that gets put together here and there are a lot of laughts to be found here
give this game a shot  its going to play on almost any modernday computer and itll be wellworth the timei waited several months after its release before purchasing and boy was i glad i did
ive never played a video game quite like this onethe quotdatedquot quake ii engine is pushed to the max and actually is very impressive
the cities and space cutscenes are some of the best ive ever seen the areas are very detailed and your party characters look great
the atmospheric music is perfect for this game and adds to the wonderful ambience and suspenseone thing i truly enjoyed about anachronox is the cinematography the camera angles and techniques are straight out of a film classic
i couldnt be more pleased with the overall polish style and presentation of anachronox truly a testament to the talented development teamyouve read about the plot main character names and general gameplay functions in other reviews so i wont repeat them and bore you if possible
but i will say if you enjoy adventure games in particular like myst the longest journey or the monkey island series youll love anachronox
it has more of an adventure game feel than it does an rpg feel
there are lots of little games and puzzles to complete that are mixed in with the combat conversation plot development and exploration of this vast part of the universe
that said the game is huge long and highly entertaininganachronox will take you by the seat of your pants and wont let go until you are finished
a great story pulls it all togetherthere are some minor flaws in the game but nothing nearly bad enough to come close to ruining the experience
anachronox is a surefire classic and probably the most underrated game released in tom hall and his team at ion storm austin have been developing anachronox for several years now
many in the gaming world feared that anachronox would be another daikatana
john romero and his team at ion storm dallas worked on daikatana for several years as well and was released in  to critical disdain showing up on the quotworst ofquot list for several gaming web sitesgamers can breathe a sigh of relief anachronox is most definitely not another daikatana
its intriguing and different
comparisons will be made to the final fantasy series but the pc platform hasnt seen anything quite like this in some timealthough built on the aging quake ii engine the programmers have done an excellent job with tweaking that engine to render it almost unrecognizable
the most noticeable flaws of the quake ii engine are in the character textures although the animation for the characters is fluid and lifelikethe dialog is frequently hilarious as well which brings a much needed sense of humor to pc gaming
most action titles seem to have forgotten how important a sense of humor isin the game you put on the trenchcoat of downonhisluck detective sly boots
there are many quests and miniquests to discover in the world of anachronox and along the way others will join your partythe combat system is where the comparisons to the final fantasy series come to mind
at each encounter the camera zooms overhead to show the combatants with a turnbased control system very similar to final fantasy
you can choose to take a defensive or offensive stance use inventory items special abilities and the likenot since deus ex another excellent ion storm title have i found a game to be so interesting and enjoyablethere are two pc games that stand out as having shaped and influenced the gaming world
one is halflife  and the first is deus exkeep in mind this game is old  the graphics wont be wowing or burning your retinas anytime soon
but the gameplay is fantastic and tells a really great story
the gameplay is a perfect hybrid between a fps and a character driven rpg
for the pennies this game sells for now it is worth a lookthe basic story is set in the future where people can augment their abilities
not everyone thinks this is a good idea and conspiracies abound
this game set the standard for open world pick your path gameplay where you choose how to tackle objectives
even now people still play this game to try different approaches with different abilities
check out this piece of gaming history and see what all the fuss was aboutthis is one of the best games ever made
very few games especially in the first person shooter genre manage to combine such an intelligent and broad plot with great action and detail for example at one point i went into the ladies room at your base and later on my boss yelled at me for doing that
you can play any style you want you can go in everywhere guns blazing or go through the whole game killing almost nobody
its all up to youeveryone should stop buying quotsoldier of forturequot and quotdeer hunter quot and buy this game instead
its simply one of the greatest games ever madewhat a fantastic game this was
i was never a firstperson shooter fan at all until i picked up this game off the rack on a whim one day
i have never played anything quite like this and i doubt that i will anytime soon
it is one of the best that i have ever played
this game is a great shooter with a heavy dose of stealth and a lot of good character development roleplayingdeus ex has a d fully explorable virtual world in each mission that is so detailed its breathtaking
if you can stack crates up high enough or jump far enough or find a crawlspace then you can get anywhere on the screen
you can run into a room with machine gunsrocket launcher blazing or you can quietly sneak to the rooftops and pick off the bad guys with your sniper rifle the coolest weapon in any video game
the sound is excellent
its not just fancy but it is very precise
you have to pay close attention to the sounds that you make so that you will not alert your enemies to your presence
the closest game that i have ever seen in this respect is thief
but deus ex is not thief
in thief your character never develops throughout the game and he is very weak in direct combat
in deus ex you use skill points and augmentations to increase your abilities throughout the game and you can survive a good fighteverything in deus ex is precise
the entire map for each mission runs simultaneously in realtime
let me give you an example
suppose that you set a booby trap in room a run into room b hack the security computer and then take control of the security cameras in room a  you can watch the room on the cameras and wait for a bad guy to walk into your trap and get taken out by it it will be just where you left itthere are a lot of other features that i loved about deus ex
one is that it is not a pure fantasy game
it is set in a possible futuristic world at real locations like the statue of liberty paris and hong kong
almost all of the opponents are humans robots or technologically augmented humans somewhat of a nice change from the usual assortment of demons zombies and monsters that you find in most gamesand finally the soundtrack for this game is fantastic
each mission has its own regular music and then action music that kicks in when combat begins
some of the action music is cheesy but the rest of the music is great
it is just what you would want for an actionpacked futuristic gamedoes deus ex have any drawbacks
i believe so
one is that the storyline is pretty uncreative and it drags on a bit too long
the plot twists are your basic conspiracy bent on world domination cliches
another disadvantage is that the ai in the game leaves a lot to be desired
enemies become alerted to your presence but if you disappear then they soon become unalert and patrol around again like you were never there even if one of their buddies has been killed
you can get past a lot of heavily guarded rooms by abusing the aithat said deus ex makes my top five games of all time
i recommend it for anyonedeus ex has an excellent d enginethe unreal enginewhich gives beautifully d rendered images that will win your heart
though its d renderuring is not what i really like about the gameone thing that i found most interesting was that there is a story in the game
most d shooters are just running around with a gun blowing things to bits who knows where the enemy came from who cares as long as you can kill it and see blood
with deus ex its different there is an excellent story of government conspiracies and revenge
by the end of the game when you think about the first mission youll wonder how it all happenedthe soundtrack for the game is excellent at amplifying the emotion in the storyif youre used to d shooters such as quake i ii or iii and unreal tournament you probably really  at this game at first
dont expect to run into a room full of soldiers and blow them all to bits
but dont let failure discourage you from this great game youll eventually learn tacticsthis game some how combined the best elements of an rpg fps and strategy game into a very deep very involving gamethe levels and the objectives therin make sense for a society going down the tubesthe level of npc interaction is amazing
jc can talk to and question almost any character in the gamethis level of interaction comes at a cost though
a full install of this game takes mb i dont know where the mb on the box came from
which a lot for a laptop user like methat leads me to my second point
this game will run reasonably well on a mb video cardmy ati ragemobility  to be specific but i would reccomend a mb or better and lots of ramyou really aught to grab a copy before goty edition is all thats leftin my opinion the most successful atempt at a first person rpg
this game will keep you playing with all the hidden secrets and the wonderful enemies that you will face in this game
the thing that makes this game shine is the fact that you may have to use a brain cell or two to figure things out unlike a lot of the games out where you just have to shoot things 
you start the game out at liberty island and you must stop a terrorist group that has taken over the statue of liberty
the plot continues and thickens but that is for you to find out
pick this game up at your local game store for surei think of this game as a true classic that every videogamer should at least try
i wouldnt say that about a lot of games that came out so long ago but i will definitely say it for this one
its just that good of a gameim sure when it came out it was a revolution
an almost perfect hybrid of the first person shooter and rpg genressure the visuals havent aged too well over the years but the gameplay and ideas in the game sure have
i can still go back and play this in a different way
thats one of the reasons i love this game variety and replay valuein this game you can choose how you want to tackle a mission
you also need to choose how you will be playing the game because you upgrade your character according to your play style
if you are going to be a stealthy assassin then do it
if you want to go in call of duty style blowing up everything then have at it
its not just those choices either
there are bunches of little details too like upgrading your jumping or swimming or hacking to help you through the missions
this game has a ton of varietythe story in the game has to be mentioned as well
its awesome
its very fun to make a decision and see how the story plays outi definitely recommend this game to anyone
at least give it a shotat first i didnt like the game because of how much i thought it was unrealistic but when i gave it another shot not only was it realistic it was actually a very addicting game
although this game uses the dated unreal engine the graphics are still topnotch the only downside is of the poor directd coding leaving you to use opengl as the api
besides the graphics the gameplay is the most important aspect
the game is nonlinear meaning it doesnt always go one way no matter what you do
in this game what you do actually does outcome the ending of the game
an example i walked into the ladies bathroom
usually if i would do this in any other game nothing would happen but afterwards the boss told me that it is embarrasing to the companythroughout the game you have many choices to pick from
whether it is during a conversation or entering a building with high security they all have their advantages and disadvantages
if you have a character that is more of a sneaker rather than a killer it would be best to stay out of the front entrance and climb through the air ducts
if you are a killer but dont want too much trouble you might as well take the back door
the game is all built on you own decisions something that attracts many gaming audiences
every hardcore gamer has to play this it is truely a milestone in the gaming communityan immersive scifi roleplaying game from eidos and warren spector deus ex is one of my alltime favorites
combining roleplaying elements with fps action and a great story to follow of which you can influence the outcome of deus ex has few rivals to datepolitical conspiracies familiar turf moral choices to make gun battles to win far away locales to visitdeus ex grabbed me and didnt let go until i finished itthe game now has a multiplayer mode as well now and may be of interest to somei have been playing computer games for more than  years and this is one of the best games that i have played
many other reviewers have described the plot and the basics of gameplay so i would like to highlight a couple of aspects that make this a standout gamefirst and most importantly there is almost never a single right way to accomplish a mission
it is usually possible to use brute force stealth hightech skills or some combination to accomplish your goals
the levels are very detailed with lots of different characters objects alternate routes and secret passages
in many cases characters will respond to you differently and even provide you with different tools or information depending on the means that you use to accomplish a task
even after replaying this game from start to finish at least  times i still stumble on new ways to accomplish missions new character dialogues and new areas or features that i had never discovered beforesecond you have an remarkable degree of flexibility in the way that you customize your character as the game progresses
there are about a dozen different skills including different weapons skills pistols rifles explosives heavy weapons technical skills lockpicking electronics computers and miscellaneous skills swimming medicine
as the game progresses you accumulate skill points which you use to increase your proficiencies in whichever skills you want
the different skills give you different ways to accomplish missions and they have a profound effect on the way you play the game
this is a game that requires some thinking many of the missions require some initial reconaissance and the development of a good tactical plan rather than simply rushing in with guns blazing
this is especially true on the games higher difficulty levels
often the first or most obvious solution is not necesarily the bestthere are naturally a couple of problems
first i have tried this game out on several computers including a brand new computer that is well beyond the recommended specs and it is often somewhat choppy even with the graphic details turned all the way down
there are quite a few online guides on ways to optimize the games performance you will probably need to consult these and do some finetuning to get it running at its bestsecond although a minor point the voice acting is so bad that it is actually funny and some of the foreign accents in hong kong and paris for example are really a hootoverall this game goes so far beyond most of what is out there that you might find that it raises the bar for what you expect from games in the future
for example i could never play halflife again after playing deus ex because it just seemed so twodimensionaldeus ex in my book is the game of the year
the replay value is tremendous
the different ways you can build your character allow a curiosity to replay the game in a different fashion than you may have started with
the game is very flexible in how you approach the goals given to you in each stagethe ability to upgrade different skills allows you to explore more areas
exploring more areas gives you bonus points to further upgrade and so on
the better you play the better your character becomesthe various weapons are quite useful and upgradeable with mods and skill upgrades thus becoming very acuarate and powerful
the gep gun and sniper rifle are a couple of my favoritesthe game has a nice layout for the toolbelt and augments
the augments are found throughout the game and allow you to upgrade your body
vision cloak speed etc
depending on how you pick these out you will have certain advantagesdisadvantages in certain scenarios
this was very well thought out
replay value deus ex takes notes for you
what a time saver
press f and check out what you learnedi have no major quarrels with this game except that i wish the sniper rifle had a tripod mod
 the game does seem to take quite a few resources
im runnning a   mhz bus with mb and i cant push the graphics too hard
even with the geforce mb
i make sure to kill other tasks before launch
the only other con ive noticed is the dialect in close up talk with other characters seems a litte quotgodzillaishquot but its no big dealdeu ex gets major thumbs up from me
great visual quality
multiple ending options none of which ive selected yet
im right at the decision point
great sound save the affore mentioned quotgodzillaishquot thing
many ways to complete tasks
easy game play
lastly good replay value which is now more enhanced due to a multiplayer patch available from the deus ex websiteif you like fps games and you do not have deus ex yet shame on you
get a move onthis is the best pc game i have ever played
the level of interactivity and the quotgo anywhere do anythingquot design make it extremely fun you will find yourself just messing around with the game just to see what it can doget this game and enjoy it
you will play it at least twicedeus ex is the best game i have ever played
it is a combination rpg and first person actionadventure game with true freeform gameplay scripting that changes depending on your actions and multiple endingshighly recommendedmark my words deus ex will go down as one of the best video games in history
whoever owns the rights to this game should update it for   it would sell millions
i have played this game at least a dozen times and every time there is a surprise
on the right system its sequel is  and half stars
this game should be used as a model for any company making games  the games of today are an insult to anyone who is a serious gamerafter reading pc gamers quotgame of the yearquot edition in which quotdeus exquot received top honors i went ahead and purchased a copy
and all i can say is quotwowquotfollowing the triedandtrue format of government conspiracies and viruses gone awry deus ex places you in the futuristic role of jc denton an agent for a united nations antiterrorist group unatco who has been augmented w superhuman abilities
immediately you are taken through a training mission and from there its off rescuing liberty island your brother and eventually the entire human race
the game is slickly placed starting slow and then moving into an elusive quotwhodoitrustquot mode
although the game progresses in linear format how you get to the next mission is entirely up to you
for example if you need to find a way into a warehouse but dont have the computer key code you can simply blow up the door
or find a secret entrance through the basement
with deus ex youre never stuck trying to figure out where to go next or how to do it
a log is kept of all conversations and any other important information you may need so youll never be in a scramble looking for that crumpled postit note that had the lock code scrawled on it
graphics are topnotch and voice acting is superb
weapons are a little generic but the enemy ai and story is so engrossing youll have a hard time powering down and getting some sleep
if youre looking for an rpg that gets away from the generic dungeon crawl then pick up deus ex
you will not regret itdeus ex is a great story above all else
lots of shooters promise a story and deliver some silly tale about some scientist quotnow go shoot thingsquot
but deus ex stands above that crowd and really delivers a great game
the pacing is just right never revealing too much information with the action closely coupled
the story can really suck you in and encourages you to try out different things to accomplish a goal another great feature of this game you can solve most problems in way that suits your style
additionally the online gameplay is just as exciting and offers some really unique twists upgrades and skills
if you havent played deus ex then you are missing outan awesome blend of action and story
the graphics are well done but i am playing on a mhz with a geforce
i liked it better than system shock  and maybe even half life
weapon selection is not that wide but running and gunning is not such a large part that this was an issue for me
the individual map areas are not large but it pays to explore every inchthis game is staring to age but it is very very good still
it is very immersive and the experience is rewarding
this game is worth getting and its sequel is very anticipateddeus ex is one of the best games ever made
a very long and excellent single player gameplay with a great replay value
it has a great and lenghty story
set in the future with the world in bad shape there is poverty famine with martial law in almost all cities and a plague called grey death has broken out
you play jcdenton who works in the unatco an anti terrorist agency along with his brother paul and a few missions later you will find out what the agency really is
besides a great story the script changes the way you play the game like in one mission you will be called to save a girl hostage if you save her you will be rewarded if you failed the game will continue it does not say mission failure  restart level ect like in other games
deus exs level design is fantastic you can go anywhere and do anything you want
all the objectives have more than three paths to complete
the graphics are not very good and the charecter animations are very ugly but they are more than enough for the fantastic single player gameplay
i played deus ex on the directd video mode and the game runs very smooth the first version may be optimised only for dfx glide but the latest version has a very good directd support
i played it on directd xx with all detail set to high and without any trouble and the load times are very good
the bad things are the save games take large disk space and the ai is bad besides that it is the best game ever made and deserves the game of the year award
get deus ex it is the game of the futuredeus ex won game of the year so many times its not even funny anymore
this game is several years old and is still groundbreaking in many ways
in fact deus ex is by far better than many of the more modern first person shooter games that are being released or have been released after deus ex
i say this because although the graphics are dated they still look good but the gameplay is incredible
the story is engrossing
the game is long and will occupy plenty of game hours more so than some of the new games that are being churned out
there are multiple endings coupled with some great nonlinear gameplay
there are role playing elements involved in which you can basically grow and gain higher skills
there are often mulitple ways to accomplish any given goal which gives the game added replay valueproslengthy gmae offers many game hours to playmultiple endings and non linear play adds replay valuestory is engossingmusic puts you in the characters bootsmultiplayer was aadded by a great developer team for freegame is super fun to play overallconsvoice acting can get cheesy at timeslooks wierd in directd and opengl mode is substandardai is not as smart as newer games and the enemies are easily fooled into thinking that you no longer existyou will often think about this game when not even playing ityou may feel obligated to wear black glasses and a trenchcoatwhen you first hear icarus say quoti now have full control of all of your systemsquot you may lose bladder controlif you are a big fan of bladerunner and halflife this game will be an absolute joy for you to play
the kicker is even if you didnt like those games what this game offers is one of the most interactive involving and intuitive environment of any game i have ever playedperhaps the games most redeeming feature is the ability to tailor your character the way you want to play
if you want to be a hellbent angel out to exact a measure of revenge for whatever reason go ahead get your weapons and start firing
if you want to be a slueth you can sneaking around undetected
or you could be a champion of the people always being mr boy scout a la jack ryan from tom clancy fame
or you can make up your own combining these elements or inventing your own
since your character is bionic and will receive augmentations there really is no limit on the type of player you create and if you cheat you can make a superbionic man who can do anythingthe story line is pretty compelling and will keep you addicted
while gamers of this genre will probably be able to guess what happens next or those who watch a lot of movies it will keep you guessing in certain areasa couple of complaints the ai is not good
not very good at all
the enemies in the game operate strictly on los thats line of sight to all you youngins out there most of the time
regardless of what the training operations tell you the bad guys do not come unless they see you
they can hear you but if they cant see you you can hear them talk to themselves saying things like quotmust have been the windquot or something like that
you can throw things to avert their attention and theyll rush to the sound but again if you stay behind them youll be okim looking forward to the game of the year addition because with it you can create your own single player and multiplayer scenarios
that will make the game virtually limitless and will make the replay value skyrocketmaby they will do a  remake  of the game  but meanwhile theres  new vision   this amazing download   get it on the internet will re newel the graphics to this game  i had played it a lot  through the off and ons and  after  getting this new vision the game looked so good  i was taken away 
very fun game even if it doesnt have  todays  capabilities in deus ex  human revolution it has  high tech all over the place and a lot of fun play  using the weapons  as you want and discard what you dont want i enjoyed seeing shadows or dark areas to hide in there wernt any in the new  game  and the feel of both games isnt the samequite simply if you adored half life thief and system shock  then you  will love this as it is a mix of all  go and buy one of the greatest  games ever written nowevery first person shooter fan should be with  this game and it does more for its genre with nice touches like being able  to complete levels in different ways and having targeting on your gun
i  like these new ideas and its good to see
the game feels fresh and has  lasting appealit is tough going but has similar traits to the  aforemetioned gamesss  it has a similar character building theme  taking a hacker stealth or heavy approach
you look at items using the  same interface method and inventory is similarhalf life  you get to  shoot a lot of excellant ai computer characters  maybe the best ai yet
the story and plot is also deep and riviting
nice to have both the  shooting and stategystealth element to a gamethief  obviously theres  the stealth mode and you can carry bodies so enemies wont see them
silent  killing with crossbowthis game takes  of the best fps games of its  genre and mixes them together with its own original ideas
finally there  may be a game to beat all  and in my opinion this is the bench mark in fps  adventure gameswhat are you waiting for   go buy deus ex
pronounced  due sexduring this ongoing dark age for pc gaming when corporate greed has coupled with pseudodrm schemes to stifle any original idea or creative process i found myself again and again reaching for the classics
and deus ex is definitely a classic masterpieceset in the near future infused with equal doses of cyberpunk mentality and noir atmosphere playing like an fps with strong rpg elements inventory character development modifiable equipment secondary quests  and yet one is better off avoiding shooting more often than not
whoever played deus ex can attest that this game will stay with you
forever
and rightly sothis is a game infused with life
the characters act natural
the script is brilliantly paranoid
and the whole setting will immerse you into this twisted world of technological possibilities and powerin a perfect world david lynch would have realized william gibsonsneuromancer
short of that we have been offered deus exsure the graphics may look dated
but i promise you that you will find no lipsynced modern game more appealing than deus ex
even  years old pcs will be able to render its full potential although the games strengths are hardly limited to its appearance  and it is drmfreehighly recommendedi just got this game yesterday and have to say it is the best game i have  played in a long time
it is a futuristic first person shooter crossed with  a role playing game and it is awesome
just make sure you have a top end  system and a good video cardshaken or stirred is entirely up to you
this game mixes action rpg and elements of adventure gaming to the perfect mix
i hate action games but this actionnrpg scores in everyway possible
the very beauty of this game lies in the xfiles type plot and the amazing playability
you can finish the game the first time as a stealthy assassin
you can finish the game the second time as a terminator all guns blazing
the only low of this game is that it is based on the really old unreal engine
the unreal engine seems to jagg a lot at rare i mean rare occasionsthe story is about deciet lies govemerment plots viruses amp your charactar jc denton
this is definitely the best game in years
there are better action games out there
there are better adventure games out there
there are better rpgs out there
but there is not one game out there which blends all three genres to a masterpiece such as this
warren spector who made this game must feel like a michelangelo admiring what he made and being admired for itthis game is just fun to play
if youve played system shock  then you have a good idea what deus ex is
this game is hard core rpg with fps  thrown in
lets start the reviewgraphics graphics uses the unreal  engine therefore it doesnt have good dd support
the game will run on dd  but expect some slow fps when polygons start accumulating
a beta patch to  fix dd performance did help a bit
if youre using a geforce card dload  this beta patch
voodoo owners shouldnt have any problemsinterface  theres a lot of control keys to memorize but with a little practice  youll be able to memorize each function
prepare to use a lot of the use  item key since theres a ton of items you can pick up in this game
like  system shock  and thief deus ex gives you the action to lean left and  right however i didnt find any option to lean forward very helpful though  when sniping from an elevated positiongameplay this is where the game  shines
the story is based on several conspiracy theories eg
secret  governments roswell etc
your mission is to investigate the relationship  of each conspiracy and discover that all of these conspiracies are part of  a worldwide organization to control and subjugate people
game runs via  mission objectives
you are given primary and secondary goals and you can  accomplish them in any order you want
there are some primary goals that  you can skip too as long as youve accomplished the most important goal
lots of skills building is involved its rpg
you get skill points for  every goal you accomplish goals from as simple as talking to someone in  your hq to arresting a terrorist
most missions involve stealth  infiltration
you dont have to go into a mission with guns blazing
you can  move in as quietly as possible and still achieve successai very  inconsistent
in a way this is a good thing because it makes the game very  unpredictable
ai here are smart
they can hear you if you make too much  noise or expose yourself too much
they run away if critically wounded and  theyll gang up on you when youre cornered
also the ai remembers things  youve done whether they were good or bad
for example i tried to hack the  atm machine in the game
when i spoke to my boss he warned not to try  hacking into any facilities in the area
and i did my hacking almost like   minutes ago
that scene made me smile
inconsistent ai can be a bad  thing too
sometimes they wont react when they see their dead buddy in  front of them and sometimes theyll sound the alarm
must suggestion  dispose of the bodies properlystory and overall the game has a lot to  offer
the story is multivaried because it runs on several conspiracy  theories
and we know how much we love to listen to conspiracies
this game  involves a lot of mind thinking and not senseless shooting
it requires  resource management analysis of tons of information and a lot of stealth  moves
this game is a must buy
pick it upwhy i hadnt heard of this game before i slipped the disc into my computer  is beyond me
dont get me wrong i can understand why a lot of perfectly  good games wouldnt ring a bell in my headi dont read a lot of pc game  reviewsbut this is something else
this game kept me up at night just  trying to figure out one more clue trying to get by that one really hard  jump from the ledge to the decaying platform or trying to up my guys  modifications just one more notch
the strongest feature about the game is  the nonlinear story line
depending on what decisions you make dont  worry its not like those choose your own adventure books when we were  kids the storyline evolves in different ways
kill someone itll come  back to you later
leave someone alive same deal
character development  is awesomeyou can tweak your character so many ways its rediculousbut  you cant make a superman youve got to pick and choose what strengths you  want your guy to have
the only drawback i can see with the game is the  graphics
theyre good its true but theyre not greati think the  games based on the unreal engine but im not sure
never fear i never  had any problem dealing with only semiperfect visuals while being  enthralled by this title
enjoy it i didthis is simply one of the best game ever
stillfrom its amazing insights on politics and social aspects to its amazing themes its plot and its amazing game play deus ex is simply one of the all time greats
install it and play it
even to this day i reach for the classics
deus ex is one of those games
aside from its voice acting which i agree is really bad and boring art direction this game is still as amazing as it was when first releasedthis game has everything
it is unlike any first person shooter game that has ever been created
in this game you can train in what you want to do
you can train in sniping and shoot people from far away you can train in rifling and shoot crowds of people with assault rifles or fully automatic shotguns you can blow stuff up with demolitions training you can get training in hacking and take down security systems and break into atm machines you can learn electronics and break doorcodes or turn off autoguns
in this game anything is possible you do what you want to do you beat the missions the way you want to do it
and another thing i like about this game is the augmentations you can get
you can get things that enhance your sight accuracy strength stealth and you can even cloak yourself
so please dont hesitate to get this game
you will definetly not regret itdeus ex set the stand for games like mass effect and fallout  or any other fpsrpg
enough said it rocks but not sure it will run on win  or vista for that matterdeus ex takes the best from some games and put all of it together in a single game it isnt just another shooter where you are the allpowefull super man who kill everyone with his super weapon here you are a man ok a man with nano technologies and augmentations but you can die with a few hits in your head or you could lose some speed if you get hit in your legs
deusex is a game where you can finish each mision in your own way maybe you can get what someone want and trade it for what you want or maybe you can just shot him and get that in the easy way every desicion you take will make the game to go in a diferent way while you play and complete objectives you will get skill which you use to give your player skill in computers electronics rifles lock picking etc
if you like a rpg kind of game where you can explore  decide and shot some bad guys this is the game for you
and if you enter in eidos website you can download the patch for multiplayer and a lever editor for you to create your own leves for a multiplayer gameif you are not sure yet to get the game dont think it too much go get it it is greatthats right ion storm has managed to do the impossible make a game i  like more than halflife
deus ex is a work of art to every sensefor starters deus ex has the best story out of all the games ive played  its better than most movies too
the settings change in almost every  mission you go from new york to hong kong to paris and many other  incredibly detailed areas
the plot is deeply woven and contains many  shocking twists and turns
then for the frightening part look up some of  these orginizations on a search engine
yes mj really does exist and hey  so does unatco
but perhaps the coolest part about this story is that no  matter how far fetched its based on reality and could really happenthe graphics are nothing short of spectacular except for some of the  extreme close ups on the characters but hey they werent any better in any  other game released within the past year and from the previews ive seen  they arent going to within the next year
on another note yes i know  there has been a fuss raised about dxs video card support but people are  just nitpicking if you download the beta dd patch youll be just  finethe sound effects are mostly execellent with the exception of  voice acting
in some places namely hong kong the voice acting was just  awful and yet other times in was perfect
i tend to disagree with other  reviewers in my beleif that jc your character sounded just right cold  and calculating
besides voice acting the sounds were perfect the ambiance  of a hong kong market was just right while hearing nothing but the wind  and distant footsteps on empty new york streets was nothing short of  spookydxs gameplay was also very good although the ai
artifical  intelligence could have used some work
fights are usually fast paced and  exciting where as puzzles are brain teasing but not to the point of  detracting from the gameplay
of course dxs big difference from halflife  and what makes it an rpg is the ability to customize your character
this  is handled in two ways skill points awarded through completing mission  objectives and progressing through out the game and augmentations
augs are  things that can be added to your players body its kinda hard to explain  simply but its sorta like adding robotic parts to a human bodyall  in all this is quite possibly the best game ever
the game drew me into  its world and i almost didnt wanna leave when it was over
cant wait  until dxi actually purchased this game in  and still play it at least once a year
why
like others have said here i believe this is the greatest game of all time
you can read several  reviews here telling you why
thats not my objective here
im hopping to raise this food for thought  what if drm like securom and limited activations were in place when deus ex was publishedsince  i have gone through  new computers numerous upgrades and windows reinstallations on each
my legally puchased copy of deus ex the all time best game ever would no longer be playable if drm had been used back then
i would be stuck with a coaster
worse a lot of these older games are becomming ridiculously difficult to find
just try to find a copy of system shock  impossible unless you are willing to spend  times what it originally cost for a used one
oh sorry there wouldnt be any used copies of this  year old classic
your and everyone elses drm rental would have expired long ago
it would have become just a memorydeus ex the single greatest argument against drmdeus ex has a nasty habit of pulling you into its world when you least expect it to leaving your concerns of the real world behind such as your job eating your spouse as you slip on the trenchcoat of unatco operative jc dentonthe game plays out like some crazy episode of the xfiles with conspiracies flying at the player from all directions
the very basic premise of deus ex has agent jc denton investigating a mysterious plague that has engulfed the world in the near future
denton is augmented with nanotechnology which allows for the development of specific abilities such as regeneration of health or increased strength
through the course of the game the player can decide how to grow the character
he can be a ruthless killing machine an expert in all weapons or he can operate via stealth breaking into computer systems or installations silently to accomplish his goalsthe conspiracies unfold via conversations with other characters such as dentons fellow unatco agent and brother paul emails and other electronic communications
in the world of deus ex all is not what it seems as jc denton soon learnsone of the best aspects of the game is that it can be played as the player sees fit
with each situation jc encounters there are many different ways to solve the problem
this also results in high replayability as you can start the game over and try it with different tacticswith many places selling deus ex at a discount now is the perfect time to engulf yourself in the world of deus exthere are really only two things that need to be said about dues ex at this point in gaming history by todays standards the graphics effects and ai are pretty terrible
it is still an awesome game to playtheres a joke about how every time someone mentions dues ex someone else goes and reinstalls in order to play it again
trust me people will still be playing this one long after the shiny new releases have been forgottenhighly recommendedgreat game awesome plot lots of fun not too dated
compares well to the rd version which i just finishedafter years of production and hype deus ex is finally here
is it good
oh yes
the gameplay is out of this world
never before have i been so engrossed in a gaming world that seems to change all around me
at the  start of the game you get to chose an area to focus on
this could be a  firearms expert computer whiz a sneak etc
each way can help you and get  you through the game
example your breaking into a lab to find the drug  you need to prove that aliens exist
its guarded by  men
do you a shoot  the guards and run in
b sneak through the ventilation shafts to get in
or c crack into the system tell the guards to get off duty and open the  door
these are all options for every mission except there are over   each
the game is extremely long not done yet and has a story of  espionage and conspiracies
the graphics look nice and the other options  will keep you playing for a long time
all in all front runner with the  sims for game of the yeari can safely say that the  hours i spent with this game were some of the most enjoyable ive ever had in front of a computer screenthe thing that made me love it so much was how immersive it was
you feel as if you are jc denton
you feel as if everyone is against you and during the game you will feel betrayed angry confused and happy
however you dont feel this because you dont understand what you are supposed to do next or because you solved a confusing puzzle that you thought youd never figure out
you feel this way because thats what the character would feel
the game world is huge and believeable and although some of the conspiracies are a little hard to believe you will just because the game presents them so convincinglythere are no complaints here with the games graphics
sure the unreal engine is old and runs like a hog unless you have a dfx card which most people dont but as long as you have a decent pc and d card youll be fine
the game ran well at x with most details on my p and a geforce mx
the character models are kind of blocky but the lighting and textures are well donethe game is hard but not because its full of abstract puzzles or huge unwinnable battles
whenever there is a difficult situation ahead of you there is always a variety of logical ways to get past it
for instance  in the first level a comrade of yours is locked in a room protected by laser tripwires and a locked door
if you go through the tripwires the alarm will sound and guards will swarm around you however if youve invested time and money in building up your weapon skills and arsenal you can take out the guards then waltz in and bust your man out
if combats not your thing then you can hack into the laser controls with a multitool deactivating the lasers
then you can sneak up behind the enemy and use a riot prod or baton on them knocking them out and pick the lock on the door
yet another way to get around this situation is to bypass the lasers entirely find a ventilation shaft sneak into the room where your friend is being held hack into the computer turn the sentry gun against the guards and unlock the door from the security console
im sure there are other ways to get him out too
heck you can just leave him there too if thats what you want but he may hold a grudge
everything affects everything else in this game and you feel like you really are at the center of a huge web of lies trying to make sense of the crazy world around youthe music is great the voice acting decent and the controls intuitive
this was definitly the game of the year last year and i doubt itll be surpassed in my book until deus ex  comes out
get it nowdeus ex is considered by many to be one of the best if not the best pc game of all time
having recently completed it i can tell you that the hype is justified
this is truly an amazing game and may indeed be the best video game ive ever played
this is such a fantastic game on so many levels that its difficult to write a good review that isnt ridiculously long but im going to try
but you should probably just go ahead and order it now and then finish reading the reviewdeus ex is basically a hybrid an fps  rpg hybrid and it combines the two genres brilliantly
the game play is similar to most shooters except that there are stealth hacking you can hack into computers turn off security systems even have turrets shoot the bad guys
 and lock picking elements you dont normally see in generic shooters
its an rpg in that you gain experience points and new abilities you find modules you can install into your nanotech enhanced body to give you special abilities as the game goes on allowing you to build the kind of character you want
the game gives a lot of choice hereyou can make a walking tank who specializes in heavy weapons or be a super stealthy guy who can cloak himself uses a dart gun and tries to stay unseen
the game is so well designed that both approaches will give you a great experienceneither one feels like its the one you are supposed to pick
and theres plenty of middle ground as wellone thing i like in my rpgs is when you start pretty weak and get a lot stronger over the course of the game and thats the case here
you can barely aim your gun at the start of the game but by the end you are a bad bad manso what makes it so great
if there is one thing i think its the combination of lots of choices with a really really great story
usually games with lots of choices have a weak or minimal story but thats not at all the case here
there are always  or  or ways to reach your objectives in the game
you can walk in the front door blasting away though it will be a lot harder to do than in your basic shooter especially early on or you can crawl through an air duct and hack into the security system
or if you explore enough you might find someone with a key to the backdoor
maybe if youve leveled your swimming skill theres an underwater tunnel you can swim through to get where you need to go
the levels are big and incredibly well designed you never feel that there is one right way to handle a problem in the game
seriously there is so much in each level that there is pretty much no way you will find it all in one play throughthere is a ton of exploration herewhat else
well the game designers hit every other game element out of the park as well
music is awesome and totally immersive
did i mention the story
i know i did but its incredible as well involves a vast global conspiracy so i want to mention it again
the game is very well paced
ammo and inventory space are limited so you get a little thrill every time you find somei have very few criticisms of this game but here are a few that many people have mentioned
some people criticize the graphics but i think they still look fineabout what youd expect from an  year old game and i never felt the graphics detracted from the game
its mainly the character models that look iffy
interiors in particular still look great
some of the voice acting in hong kong is a little iffy as well
also the ai is not super sophisticated about looking for you but its smart enough
last thing i want to say is that the start of the first level is probably the weakest part of the entire game so if you start off and feel a little underwhelmed after all the hype like i did just keep playing and the game will get very awesome very fastnonobvious gameplay tips talk to people multiple times they may have more to say hard difficulty is actually harder than realisticnows the time to
this is a very revolutionary game that allows you to play it how you wish
many games have a very linear path to follow not deus ex you can play the game without killing anyone if you want or you can outright kill everyone you come across
the game also has  endings depending on the choices you make
this is a classic and should be played by any gamer that has any interest in rpgs first person shooterssneakers or just someone in the mood for a good storydespite the fact ive grown out of the pokemon card game rush the video games get old for really for anyone unless youre playing the recently released garbage instead of the retro classics
it never gets old to collect badges and being a stupid kid with a baseball cap assembling your destructive force of pokemon fighting the numerous trainers in numerous stadiums getting into the hall of fame and playing the wildly fun minigames
the only problem with the game is the fact your attacks can miss your opponents and you can get paralyzed
if you love retro classics you have to like the oldtime pokemon games or there is something deeply wrong with youmaking their first d battle apperence on the  its pokemon stadium
import your pokemon from red blue or yellow and duke em out against the computers or other friends pokemon
battle gym leaders to see if your one of the best
but if battling isnt your gig go to the mini game section
even if you dont like pokemon this is fun to play regardless
one of the best features is gameboy tower were you can load up your red blue or yellow and play your gameboy right on your tv
but the sad thing is because of pokemon stadium  this one is pretty much quotoldquot to standerds
but if youre looking to save a few bucks then buy this onethe only game ive ever purchased on n but later on theres another title coming
you can even see those pokemon in d   insanely hilarious battles await you
have your cartridges ready because the battles are tough without the included transfer pak
otherwise its a blast to play
hohastill to this day one of the best nintendo  games that were ever made
needs a remake for wii upokemon stadium is a great game for all ages
there really is no vicious violence and the game is very easy to play and any kid can get used to this game and get good at it
for the rest of you parents out there if there was any game that you could chose for your kid the pokemon series is a good startpokemon stadium plays just like the gameboy version except with no adventuring
basically this is where you bring the pokemon that you have raised on your gameboy and put them to the test in several pokemon challenges from tournament style challenges on  levels of competition easy to hard and become a master at the gamei know i said there was no adventuring but there is one and thats the gym leaders challenge when you take on all of the gym leaders from the red and blue series like borkc misty and many more until you reach the masters gym where you take on the final four and i assure you on this one they dont roll over for anyonethe one thing that i really didnt like about the game was that the rental pokemon are for the most part really weak
seriously i could do without having  defensive moves or  really good move and  kind of in between ones
but then again thats why you raise your pokemon on the gameboy red and blue
that way you know what youre fighting withthe other thing that i thought was pretty cool was all of the kiddie games and stuff
it was nice to see another set of games inside of an already good gameagain if you havent gotten into pokemon its a good start for any parents who are unsure on what to get their kids and its very good for kids because us parents dont have to worry about any of our kids testing new moves they saw on a game on each other
again excellent gamebest game made for the  this game is great for all ages and never gets old
if you love pokemon you need this game
the gameboy has nothing on this gamevery good game
there are bonus pokemon and upgrades for gb towerthis is one of my favorite games from my childhood
pokemon stadium is a very fun and creative adventure game that i still love to play even to this dayso cool items thanks you  i going play it the games soon i can when i can get my pokemon redpokemon stadium is a pokemon fighting game for the nintendo not an adventure game like redblueyellow or anything like that
in this game you fight through different tournaments with your pokemon and once you beat everything you unlock a round modewhich i unfortunately dont know much about since i have yet to unlock ityou can either use rental pokemon in the tournaments or you can upload them from your game boy games utilizing a device called the transfer pakyou can only upload pokemon from the red blue and yellow versions however because this game predates gold silver crystal ruby sapphire and anything from then on
also with a cartridge in the transfer pak you can do different things like trade pokemon if theres a second controller transfer pak and game boy cartridge plugged in check out their stats at professor oaks laboratory and play the game on the television using a thing called gb game boy towerwarning warning warning i personally do not recommend using game boy tower because it erased my pokemon yellow game when i tried it
something went kerflooey when i tried to save my progressalso if you upload pikachu from a yellow cartridge and you use him without registering him hell say his name
this i found to be a nice touch and i wondered why all the pokemon didnt do this to begin withwhere pokemon stadium is concerned the pros vastly outnumber the cons but it might be prudent of me to list them anyway so here they arethe game can be very frustrating specifically where the pika cup tournament is concerned
i still cant beat the darn thingthere is an announcer who comments on the battling
although its an interesting touch some may find him annoying i dont really but i felt it shouldve been listed
fortunately if he gets on your nerves you can turn him off in the options menuto conclude i will say that pokemon stadium is a really nice game and i recommend it
however if you are rather young or sensitive you may find it a tad disturbing even though the characters just faint they dont ever diethis game is so cool
you can play pokemon redblue and yellow on it
i bought it used but i erased it over
it can be kinda challenging to beat the gym leaders but its really fun
if you beat them all and the elite  you get a pokemon as a prizei got a charmanderi bought this because i remembered it being a fun game
there were no problems
very fun game and great productthis game is really good
has a excellent storyline which has made the final fantasy series so famous
over all i give the game four stars the fifth star i gave because it comes with a seperate window program called quotchocobo worldquot
they have ff for the american playstation but they do not have chocobo world it is however sold for playstation in japan
that is why in this case it is better to buy the pc
version
if youre wondering what chocobo world is chocobo world is a quotgigapetquot type game in which is in a small window so you can play it even when your onlinea bonus you get from chocobo world is you can find items in it that you cant get in ff
but the downside is that it could take a while
well i hoped this review helped you
and go ahead and buy it its worth every pennythis is the best game i have ever played in my life
it has a splendid story thatll amaze you
great characters and a incredible battle system with the gfs and limit breaks that are awesome
also the animations cinematic and music are grand
its extremely fun to playi have played it for years and it hasnt bored me yetso far this is the best ff squaresoft has ever launched it beats even ff and ffyoull be amazed how good it is when you buy it
dont believe those people that say this is a bad gametruly deserves the  starsin a world of turmoil and war six friends rise up to destroy a sorceress bent on world domination
the nation of galbadia is a dictatorship with a leader who wants to enslave the whole world
balamb is a peaceloving nation but enlists an army of seeds to fight the galbadians
seeds are soldiers specially trained at gardens to fight sorceresses of the world and to act as mercenaries for the highest bidders
squall is a teenager who has just become a seed along with his two friends zell and selphie
they team up with quistis and irvine and rinoa a mysterious girl with links to squalls past
these six must defeat galbadia seifer squalls rival and ultamecia a sorceress from the future
but along the way they must solve the mystery of laguna kiros and ward soldiers in a dreamlike world that the heroes fall into from time to time
this game has endless side quests and a cool battle engine where you can customize just about every detail of your characters by junctioning magic to their stats
this is a game of epic proportions that will have you hookedpsa game of epic proportions deserves a battle of epic proportions and this game has two
one is with ultima weapon who is hard but not impossible
the other is with omega weapon who if taken lightly will crush you in the first minutebefore writing i wanted to see how other reviewers liked this game
most of the complaints are on hardware issues the others are comparisons between the pc version and psx uh why
anyways i run this on a p  with a voodoo ii just finebasically i spent most of this past weekend  stuck in front of the computer thanks to this extremely addictive and  involving game
i finally finished the first cd and am already giving this  game a big thumbs up
best part is i have three more cds to gothe  game is very beautiful
the cutscenes are incredible and you jump in and  out of movie scenes so much its almost like its part of the game
in  fact the last time i died was because i thought i was watching a cutscene  when in fact it was part of the gamethe cons  music ughhh a very  important requirement for me personally
lame midi music just like the pc  version of ff
almost bad enough for me to drop it to  stars
also the  guardian force spells are beautiful to watch but become tiring after the  thousandth time
the problem is you have to summon these creatures over  and over to defeat particularly difficult monsters
gets tedious
lastly  the help files and instruction manuals give you the basics but dont get  into the more advanced functions of the game
im still unsure what many  of the spells and commands dohowever these negatives dont take away  from the fact that this game is as fun to watch as it is to play
squaresoft really has developed a flagship title that is unique in many  ways and has yet to be duplicated by any other maker
the game is actually  very linear think of rebel assault yet for some reason it leaves the  player feeling much more involved and satisfied at the results
think of  being part of an epic movieone cd down   to go cant waitderekthis game has always been a highlight for rpgs since it was released
although it isnt classic like the super nintendo rpgs it really takes it to a new level
the story really stands out in this game indeed much more than many other rpgs
it truly has a much more emotional and melodramatic storyline not that suprising for a squaresoft rpg but even soit really stands out
the way the characters interact and vastly change throughout the game also makes it interesting
this isnt just your average game
the battle system while very different is indeed good
the juntion system is a good change although easy to master and further make the game a bit easier
i also like the gf system
the idea of using gfs to earn spells and abilities is just great
this game is critisized occasionally but dont let that keep you from trying it
again the story in this game is just so emotional and sometimes very sad
if you care about storyline im sure youll really find something here but if you like rpgs with little kiddies running around laughing this game isnt for you this is really more aimed toward the mature gamers or people who just like emotional and sometimes sad stories and i sure do
if the story doesnt do it for you im sure theres other aspects of this game that will satisfy you although you shouldnt bother with this game if you are an idiot you know who you are
if you are into games like final fantasy quot quotshadow heartsquot quotfinal fantasy quot or even quotfinal fantasy tacticsquot and quotcastlevania symphony of the nightquot  im sure you will highly enjoy this
but if you are into stuff like quothaloquot quotkingdome heartsquot or quothalf lifequot and even quotmariosunshinequot you will not like thisthis is a milestone in rpgs for its timeenough saidfolks either love or hate this game me i love it
i dont own a  playstation so this was my only chance at playing this game which id been  champing at the bit for since its release onto the psx
then it finally  came outevery final fantasy game is different
they all take place in  practically different worlds with different characters except for a few  recurring minor ones but thet all have the same themes  love hope  destiny and destruction
ffviii follows the path of squall a young  trainee trying to join seed an elite mercenary fighting forcethe magic  system is a bit difficult to master at first but they help you as much as  possible along the way and if it ever gets confusing you can always let the  computer manage it for you
spells no longer cost mana and instead you  simply draw a limited supply of them from points on the map or from  monsters
new weapons are no longer purchased but instead existing ones  are upgrated with items you earn after battles or by stealing them from  monstersmy first impressions were that the polygon models looked a bit  odd and the characters were all very stereotyped
squall was the grumpy  quiet type zell was a hothead rinoa was the vunerable chick quistis was  the bookworm irvine was the sentementalist and selphie was the ditz
but  as i played through i found that the game only made me think that on the  outside
these characters had desires they had dreams loves and hidden  secrets that made them what they werethe game drew me in like a moth to  a bulb
i wanted to find out what was going to happen next
i wanted my  heros to win
i scrabbled along the numerous subquests and attacked every  new plot thread that showed upfourty hours or so later i finally  emerged viceorious and i wanted to play it againif you want an excellent and realistic rpg game this is the game
my ratings   rules stinks graphics  difficulty  ease of installation  characters and attacks  story  hours of gameplay  play control  sound  this game is well worth the money
i recommend the black logitech wingman gamepad with the transparent blue buttons
the many buttons come in handy
they sell it here in electronics or somethingff  is the best out of all the ff games
best story very good graphics not as good as  though best mini games and the fightingoutstanding and very good game to start with if you are just getting into ff however i would start with ff
well worth your time and money for this gamewhen i first saw the opening sequence i was mindboggled
i never thought that the psone could deliver such anthropomorphism but i was proved wrong
i would defintely give the graphics a huge scorenow the storyline
the games plot is pretty much straight forward with directions to your next mission or destination
as with all final fantasies there will be occasional times where you have no clue what to do next forcing you to backtrack about  minutes but i can only remember two times when this happens
those of you who cant focus on two stories at the same time might have trouble with the sidestory of laguna and his gang which ultimately collides into the main story revealing any questions youve been crapping your pants over trying to figure outfor all you musiciansinsert sound byte here the sound
ill admit that the sound effects could use some reconditioning but the music is phenomenol
nobuo uematsu has done it again with yet another awardworthy score
i especially like the garden vs garden theme on disc two
along with songs like the extreme and the stage is set you cant help but pause the game and just listenthe battle outline for ffviii is pretty much like recent ffs with the exception of one major difference no mp
thats right instead of using magic power to use magic you instead stock up on magic
basically if you only have three curas if you use all three theyre history
no more cura until you hunt down some more
of course you can always refine items into magic with gf abilities
abilities that let you do things like refine  mezmerize blade into  megapotions
very useful indeed
also instead of getting money from battles you get paid about every  steps you take with an income depending on your ranking as a seedthis game is loads of fun has over  sidequests plenty of challenges and a great theme that envelopes you into a world that is truly a fantasythis game is a original and will always be a great game its the first step to a whole world of sims games so thanksthis is a great game to have because i enjoy this and their expansions making this kind of game more fun to enjoy
it sure beats the ps xbox and nintendo game cube versioni bought this game for the nostalgic value as i used to play it almost constantly as a kid
it did not disappoint
arrived early and works greatthis is a very fun game but at this point i see no point in buying it because sims  is infinitely better
i can honestly say i was addicted to the sims and then to the sims  for a long time
i am no longer addicted but the sims  is coming out in a few months this game is one that you would think to be just another fun game to play whenever
wrong this game is way addictive
you tell yourself you want to play for  minutes and you end up playing for  hours
anyways here are the pros and the consprosthe most addicting game you will ever playits a life simulator you do everything you do in your life just sped up by like xsits rated e unless you try really hard to make it t it takes skillconsyou will have no social lifeyour family will get mad at you for being on the computer too longoverall i give this a  there are a few very minor glitches but seriously get this gamei can honestly say that this game is better than mario party  because the sequels just dont have the same level fun as the second iteration
playing with a friend with this game never ever gets oldthats why i like retro nintendo games
the minigames are still great to play and are very entertaining and hilarious at times the graphics look nice still the characters are still awesome the environments are still cool the challenges are still fun and its still satisfying to win the cup
im very sad to see the current state of the franchise and how its not settling with critics its very shameful that nintendo seems to be doing nothing to help save this franchise and seem more focused on selling wiis than having quality gamesthis is the same idea as the first mario party game you play on a virtual game board to earn stars and come across action such as gaining coins  playing battle or item minigames visiting the bank or crazy characters  giving you a hard time
and at the end of each turn you play a mini game
not into playing the loong games
then play in the minigame stadium where  you play on a board game with no stars and only minigames
or solo play  or play individual gamessome cool new features are the costumes the  characters wear battle mini games and the new board games
choose from  pirateland westernland spacelane mysteryland horrorland or the extra  worldthankfully the blister giving rotating games are gone where  you have to thrust the controller stick around and around in a circle to  win and are replaced with new fun games
best new minigames cake  factory speed hockey rakin em in bowsers big blast and magnet carta
worst new minigames torpedo targets honeycomb havoc and day at the  racesthis game is great and if you liked the first one youll like this  one
however some minigames are missed and the first game had some great  board games and stuffso here is the deal you liked the first mario  party then get this one
if you wanna try this one over the first one then  i reccommend you rent both of them or buy both
ive got both and i love  emim kind of a big gamer
but i love the classics
i have the original nes with the original super mario bros which is arguably one of the greatest games of all time
even today its a great game
now for this i went a little more modern but its still a classic
i kept my n through all these years and i used to have the mario party games until my mom sold them all
so i decided id get them back and made my first mario party purchase for my favorite mario party game of the series mp
great game
i love the mini games i love the maps i love how for every map your characters dress differently this is really just an amazing gamegrandson said it was good so i assume it was oki havent reviewed in awhile but there is time for me before i get busy again so ill try to finish where i left off and that brings us to mario party  the second mario party game in the numerical franchise not counting the spin offs on hand heldthe plot for mario party is actually a play
all the characters are acting and it shows when you beat all the stages
the play goes as mario and friends are trying to figure out a name for their land
because mario is the leader he chooses his name but wario isnt pleased by this and calls it wario land
eventually a fight breaks out and even though peach thinks solving the issue means changing it to her name the fighting actually gets pretty chaotic and as a kid its hilarious given the obvious anime falling down style and toads near face palm moment if his hands could reach his head
bowser on the other hand is terrozing the citizens of the land and toad have to step in to stop the fighting
toad tells the cast that the person who defeats bowser will be named the superstar and get to choose the title of the land thus mario and the group rush off to defeat bowserthe six stages in the game are all part of the play
you have pirate land pirates western land cowboys space land space police mystery land archeologists horror land witchessorcererswizards and bowser land
the goal is the same as in the first game to have the most stars to win
however because this is a play the groups goal is stated at the beginning of each map defeat bowser who is terrorizing the citizens of the land and bowser has a different outfit and occupation depending on the board
on the game board you cannot stop bowser from causing harm but only the winner gets to face off against bowser and winmario party  is the most progressive of all the mario party games with all that has been added
battle mini games are introduced where the players but give a set amount of coins to goomba and battle it out
st and nd place tend to get all the coins leaving rd with  coin if lucky and th place with nothing unless your peach then the game pities her to give that  coin to her instead
items are introduced in this game where you can buy them at item shops or win a mini game which changes depending on the map to obtain an item
these range from mushrooms to move around the board faster with two or three dice to the warp block that trades places with someone at random
duel mini games were also introduced here where during the last five turns or if you have the dueling glove you duel another player for a set amount of coins and its different based on the game boardmany of the mini games were recycled from the first game but with changes to make the game less punishing to players such as losing coins if you were picked up in the crane game or modified to make the game more exciting like bumper balls
most of the fan favorite mini games come from mario party  and is where the luigi wins by doing nothing is introduced by ai stupidity
also if you want to play the mini games the coins you win on the game board converted by the amount of stars and coins the player have you must buy them and you cant do anything else in mini game mode without buying a set amount of gamesthe board maps are also very creative and themed as mentioned above
the most memorable one is horror land as it is the only board with a day and night setting that ramps the difficulty of the board
horror lands day and night mechanic would go on to being the main selling point of mario party and unlike mario party  mario party  is on the wii virtual console for  points or was it  points
so if you want the game its available at a cheap price
this is honestly the most memorable game of the mario party series for me because of how much was added compared to later games that seem to be a hit or miss depending on what the new features arethe second core entry in the mario party franchise was for the n and introduced much of the more popular elements of the whole franchise mainly items battleminigames and turnrelatedevents exclusive to boards as well as slightly better graphics that are customized to each board in other words the characters who go to certain boards get themed costumes that match the board
the music is a not as memorable as the first mario party though i havent played it as much
on the upside though each board has a classicgoodversusevil plot that will involve you and the characters playing on the board going up against the king of the koopas bowser in his various formsmost of the minigames are new but there are a considerable amount from mario party one that have been redesigned and improved upon with new graphics and designsall in all this is probably the definitive mario party for the nintendo the best party game ever is mario party  it is my nd favorite next to  pokeacutemon stadium
if there is a mario party  i will buy it asapone of the best mario partys of all timeits really fun to play by yourself but even better playing with friends the picture is a little faded and worn but besides that the game works like a charm
no blowing or multiple tries necessaryi love this game and it is great to own it again
it still is just as fun as it wasmario party  is a multiplayer game with a story but the game is awesome for nintendo story play as either mario luigi yoshi peach dk and wario in this multiplayer game to win stars and defeat bowserthere are  landswestern pirate mystery horror space and bowsereach land has a descriptionhorror land explore a spooky and magical land that alternates between day and night full of ghosts tombstones magic eyeballs and disembodied laughtermystery land play archaeologists to explore ancient ruinspirate land play as pirates as they search for treasure facing sharks and the sword blades of their opponentsspace land blast off to outer spacewestern land journey to the old west where they face cactus quicksand and gunslinging duels at high noonbowser land face off against bowser on his own turfthe games music is alright for each landstory gameplay music overal the game gets an  aimprovements needs to have a better story but otherwise the game is a great multiplayerfirst of all forget about the first mario party
lets go straight to the sequel
now mario party  is considered to be the best of all the games in the series and for great reason there are lots of memorable minigames catchy tunes and fun virtual game boards
there are six boards and there are about  minigames i thinkthis game capitalized the board gameminigame hybrid
now you find other board games with the word party because of this gamebasically you must go get stars but you need coins to pay for the stars
whoever has the most stars wins
every turn there would be a minigame
whoever wins the minigame gets  coinsthe minigames have their own rules that separate from each other
you can read them ingamethere are also some more minigames that you can buy with a mushroom piggy bank which collects the coins you earned during the main gamethere are some other game modes that have you fight to the finish by playing the minigamessome of the minigames may be boring but the huge majority of them are just plain fun
and also who could forget the cannonballs that shoot you off the bridges at pirate land
or how about the bowser parade in bowser land unlockable boardoverall if you are looking for a really awesome board game as well as a good minigame collection you need this in your game librarythe game is great
if you liked mario party one this is pretty much the same thing but with new maps mini gamesif you have played mario party you know pretty much of where i come from when i say that the game was an instant classic
not only does mario party   deliver the goods of the original it adds to it
they put many new  minigames in the follow up game and renewed many games from the old mario  party with better graphics and new twists
many boards are available for  you to bash your friends with and many new ways to totally ruin your  friends given you have any perfect game
a huge flaw with the old game  was that everything was left up to chance while in this one there is still  that element but less of an bother in this one
instead of boo takning a  random amount of coins from you you must push the a button to get him  away
this is many of much needed improvments to the game
graphics are  still the same with better a better look to the minigames and the boards  are now animated but not much
music is definatly better the second time  around with a new soundtrack and some classic mario party  tunes
but i  do encourage a rent before buying you never know what your going to likegreat game to play such a good classic
is always fun and really a challenge to play
not many know the joy of the trading card gamethis version of the pokemon trading card game you can take anywhereplay anytime and it doesnt even make a mess
all pokemon fans should buy this right nowfirst of all you dont do nothing in this game what you do is collect cards and if you had a friend you can play against him with those cards the buildings are gym and in those gym you have to battle gym leaders beat them to collect cards and medals get all  and go for the chance to get legengary cards the  legengary birds and dragonite my problem with the game is i got no one to play against and when i beat the game the game erased itself besides that there are  cards and  card pop cards you get by battle other people the game is simple uses the rules of the card game you play and set cards useing buttons all games have there rules and button pressingpicked this up to round off my gb pokemon collection
came in good quality but i never played it more of a display itemworks great with pokemon stadium havent had any other use for it but no complaintsit is pretty selfexplanitory why this thing was made to go with pokemon stadium but many of those people dont now that it also goes with many other game boy games now such as perfect dark
if you like to interact your game boy and n get this because it it pretty coolif youre playing pokemon stadium youll need thisaccessory to transfer pokemon from your pokemon redblue or yellow game boy game pak to the nintendo cartridge
there are more compatiblegames for the transfer pak
markwith the transfer pack you can trade your pokemon on pokemon stadium and play your game on itit works for mario golftooout of red blue and yellow version yellow has the best storyline
there really isnt anything any difference from the others except this time you have a little electric buddy along for the journey
watch how pikachu interacts with with you and other characters as you make your way around the continent collecting raising and battling pokemon to become the ultimate pokemon trainer in the world
i know what your thinking quotwhat happens when you do everything there is to doquot
well your never actually done
if you get a game link cable you can even battle with friends
grab your pokeballs and get ready to catch some poke palsokay let me admit something i am  a senior in high school edit  and a freshman in college and i still play pokemon
why
the games are horribly addicting and this one is no exceptionyou start out with pikachu and go throughout the same world as the previous games catching all the pokemon still funthe pikachus beach minigame is coolone other thing pikachus voice acting gets repetitive after the first time you hear it so turn the volume downpokemon is an awesome series and i will continue to be a loyal fan no matter how old i am
this game is my personal favorite for the game boy system
a high recommendationps its anime in case you havent figured it out yetwell im  right now and when i was  till i was about  i loved watching the show and collecting the cards but i never got around to playing any of the games
like i didnt know the show was based on the games i thought it was the other way around lol
well with my  birthday money i bought this game for the original gameboy i snagged at a yard sale for 
the game it self cost about  at mega media exchangegive or take idk and its awesome i beat it then went out and bought heartgold for my ds
id recommend this to anyone who owns a gameboy a gameboy color a gameboy advance a snes with a super gameboy or a gamecube with a gameboy player
for my first ever pokemon game its awesome and im probably gonna end up going bankrupt buying more games loli choose to rate this because it has good value to old gamesi like this item cause its the first old pokemon game to have all three kanto startersgame came in perfect condition no mark or scratches game works perfectly cover is great can see the title and the pikachubought it for my grandson and it works great and he is happy and that is what is all aboutmy kids and i all love the pokemon gameboys the three of us each have our own gameboy
the blue pokemon game is very similar to the red with the yellow having some slight differencesthe foremost of these is the fact  that pikachu just wont stay in his pokeball
he follows you around in the  game and you have to keep him happy or you lose points and various  opportunities
i also like the addition of jesse and james characters from  the cartoon and the additional battles they provide
if i had to pick  just one of the three this is the one id picki like the way the  pokemon game challenges kids
i suggest also buying one of the books which  shows the various routes and places
this allows kids to work at the tasks  without getting frustratedthe idea is to start at prof oaks house  get your first pokemon from him and then journey all around the land of  pokemon collecting various wild pokemon which you catch by battling them  until they faint and doing battle with other trainers along the wayin  the process kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity  which is why the manuals are a help to gather and use items and to  develop strategies for fighting various types of pokemon
my five yearold  even started to read while using her gameboy from needing to know which  items she had with her in her item listall in all these are great  games which can be played over and over although only one game at a time  can be saved and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of  funyou cant beat the classics and it shows with pokemon
you just know youre going to be having a ton of fun with this gamegood game i thought some of the graphics were a little tacky for my taste although the funny part is they say this game is for the original game boy but when you play the game the background like houses and the ocean and people the graphics really suck major but when you get into a pokemon battle with another trainer and you see both pokemon their both in crystal clear color which is really weird because this game is suppose to be for the gb not gbc so go figure i just thought that was pretty interesting that only the pokemon would come in color who knows maybe thats why they said on the front special pikachu edition on the game boy cartridge but i will admit this game with out a dout in my mind is extremely to long but a very interesting game good for very long road trips defently oh and remember if your going on a long road trip and you take your gba sp remember to take the car charger with you for that sort of thing or the easy way take the original gba and just buy double aa batteries when you need them i wouldnt really recommend taking the gba sp on long road trip just because when you plug in the car charger you cant listen to the radio while the car charger is in i found that out the hard way  time i plugged in the car charger but then it some how wouldnt let me listen to the radio
so buy this game if you have a roadtrip coming up and you get bored in the car very easily or if you just need something to do or just get bored any where
if you have an extremely short attention span do not get this game you will get bored with it really quickly and then want to trade it in and it is a little bit of a frustrating game at times so if you cant take frustration dont get this game either
i would recommend this game for anyone  years of age or olderi remember playing this video game when i was a kid like there was no tomorrow
it was fun and addictive
i enjoy everything about it
in my opinion the previous games for pokemon were simply the best
the only thing i didnt like about it is that you couldnt fight any pokemon trainer twice only one time and that was it unless you restart the game all over againi do believe nintendo and pokefreak should release a remake on this particular version pokemonyellow versionpicachu edition for ds
i would definilety buy it right away just to remember those good old childish daysin  the pokemon craze hit the ground running
millions had invested in gameboys soley because of pokemon red and blue
kids were going to school trading pokemon and battling one another
they were getting into arguments over who the best starter was and talking about how to raise the best team
and of course we had to catch them all
during this time the television show was also surging with popularity
it got many gamers wondering why the games didnt follow the show
at the time it hadnt occured to gamers that the red and blue versions had been out in japan long before the show was even established
a year after red and blue had shattered sales records and become one of the biggest selling games of all time nintendo decided to release pokemon yellow
riding off the success of red and blue as well as the television show pokemon yellow was a big success
it sticks closer to the television series although after a while you pretty much have to settle on the fact that its still pokemonpokemon yellow may be closer to the television series but it doesnt do anything to separate itself from red and blue
by that i mean it starts off in a very similar manner
you name your character and your rival
the differences start early on when instead of picking a starter you set outside of town only to be attacked by a pikachu
professor oak quickly catches the little guy and gives him to you
your rival will always get an eevee
in red and blue you picked a starter and your rival always picked one as well
here you both have a predetermined pokemon
the good news is that because yellow version follows the show youll eventually get charmander bulbasaur and squirtle anywaywhat was perhaps the strangest thing about pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat
it was your traditional turnbased combat
simple yet it was so complex
for one the game has a rockpaperscissors method to it
every pokemon has a type and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses
for example water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs grass
grass is weak vs fire etc
etc
no pokemon is invincible
they all have a weakness to some type
though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type theyre weak against bug is almost nonexistent and there are hardly any bug type attacksin the battle menu youre given a list of commands
fight item pkmn or run
you can switch pokemon youve caught in and out of battle on the fly but itll usually cost you a turn
its the strategic portion of pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive
as you go through the game youll be challenged by trainers and you never know what theyll throw at you
its completely unpredictable and some of them are tough
its also interesting because with  different pokemon the amount of teams you can make are endless and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster
because most of the pokemon types are weak vs more than just one type
its also important that you give them a variety of moves as the moves are also typed
on paper it doesnt seem like much but when you actually play the game youll find a clog in your drain you didnt even know you had because you thought your team was perfect but then that one pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flawthere are other little goodies that are thrown in from the television series for good measure
for instance youll fight jessie and james who each use their respective pokemon
youll also battle meowth
most of what you end up seeing in pokemon yellow becomes more of a giant easter egg more than anything
the route in which you travel through pokemon yellow doesnt change at all
youll go to the same locations as red and blue and in the same order as well
the difference is that in some places where youd normally fight individual members of team rocket a set piece battle that is youll fight jessie and james instead
it doesnt change things up
there are at least little changes also scattered around
certain pokemon will learn moves at different levels some of them notably earlier than in red and blue
they might also learn moves they previously couldnt learn at all
some stats are also more balanced
for some its not a big deal but for certain pokemon it changes the dynamic of them
pikachu for instance will actually learn more attacks than he could in red and bluethere are a couple of other things that have changed
most notably is that pikachu actually follows you around and has a mood that helps to decide whether or not pikachu likes you
the more he likes you the more likely some denizens will be to give you items
in the long run theres only one moment where its crucial for your pikachu to be happy with you that being if you want to acquire a bulbasaur
aside from that how pikachu views you has no lasting merit
likewise pikachu refuses to evolve
just like in the show
this means that for the beginning stages of the game pikachu is a good pokemon to have but in the later half of the game theres no real reason to use pikachu
hell eventually lag in all the areas where your other pokemon will succeed
his inability to evolve eventually harms him in the sense that when youre using a charizard or a dragonite theyre generally more helpful than your pikachu in a pinch
youll also never actually see a pikachu in the wild in pokemon yellow
its strange to say but the part about pokemon yellow that doesnt really stand out is well pikachu
the novelty of him following you around wears off quickly
likewise so will his moods
before long you just start treating him like another pokemonthats not to say that pokemon yellow is less than red and blue
its only to suggest that youd have to really love pikachu in order to find him to be a unique pokemon
pikachu will also talk and make sounds
the game was released at the height of the television shows popularity and thus at the height of pikachus popularity
it has caused some to dismiss pokemon yellow as a giant marketing gimmick
this is especially true if youve got pokemon red and blue
pokemon yellow like red and blue has certain pokemon that dont appear at all in the version
the difference is that if yellow is the only version you have then you must find someone with red and you must find someone with blue in order to get all  pokemon
pokemon yellow owners have to do a bit more to capture all of the pokemon where as red and blue owners only need to find someone with the opposite colorthe famous glitches that were found in pokemon red and blue were fixed and thus theyre not in this game
there is no way to catch missing no
there is no easy way to catch safari zone pokemon and there is no way to duplicate rare candies etc
on one hand that glitch was pretty cool to uncover
on the other hand they were clearly glitches that werent meant to pop up in the games in the first place
so its no big dealperhaps the most amusing is how some of the presentation looks
there isnt much in terms of color for this game
it certainly has a palette that matches what your red and blue versions look like on the super gameboy but never takes full advantage of the color palette like gold and silver do later
on the other hand it is rather nice to see from time to time
the biggest difference is what some of the pokemon actually look like
certain pokemon have a different snapshot than they did before
some of them looking closer to what you saw in the television series
so while pokemon yellow looks better it certainly doesnt change the fact that certain things arent so great
like red and blue your pokemon only flinch to attack
we can forgive some of the animations and even the lack of detail in the battles and environments though
it is after all an bit gameboy gamepokemon yellow is still a good game
its hard to say if it has aged as well as red and blue however
the television series is way past where yellow was upon its release and those who pick up red or blue or both arent really going to see any reason to get yellow when those two versions are all you need to catch them allperfect condition minus being a little wobbly 
the game works fine other than the obvious blowing the dust out at times pokemon yellow version  special pikachu edition was my introduction to the series as a little girl
being a huge fan of the anime having a game where pikachu could follow me around was amazing
while many pokemon fans refer to the st generation games being weaker than the rest i have to disagree
this is by far the most compelling and enertaining game of the series i have played
i lost interest after generation 
many people claim the love for these st generstion games comes from nostalgia alone
while that might add to some the charm i disagree
in the rest of my review i will cover the cons and pros of this game and explain what makes it superior to the restcons i found the backpack feature to be too small and hard to look through
a lot of unnecessary and boring time was wasted going through all of the items in random order you do not get to see the experience points a pokemon earns in battle like in later games
to see this you must individually click one of the  pokemon you are holding outside of battle mode younger audiences might not be used to the older graphics
character sprites before entering battle mode and the bushes in the cities are especially out of date psychic pokemon are much too powerful
if you catch an abra early on you can easily beat almost any gym leader and team rocket gameplay basically stops once you defeat the elite  and capture mewtwo after team rocket is defeated the grunts never disappear from places like mount moon daycare does not offer breeding has outdated concepts such as trading with a cord and printing out pictures of pokemon
while this was all exciting in  i am not so sure about pros completely fresh storyline
it is nice to see the original where the world and ideas had not yet gone stale compelling plot with team rocket and the addition of jessy and james
i found the villain aspect of this game to be memorable and as a child even frightening i enjoyed all of the gym leaders and found them all to be a challenge at one point of my life
you get a feeling of accomplishment after the defeat of one  is a great amount of pokemon to have
not too many and not too little
while some are silly they do not reach nearly the ridiculous heights of today because of their simplistic design
i think the pokemon in this game are much more attractive than in future memorable and perfect amount of legendaries
i enjoyed the bird trio and mew  mewtwo
further in to the game you begin to learn of their creepy and mysterious back story
they actually feel special and not tacked on being able to own all  starters in this game was a great addition
not to mention they are the best beginning pokemon this series has ever seen in my opinion fun towns to explore and eventually easy navigation as you complete the game
while it seems huge in the beginning the world slowly begins to all connect and flow together has a technology and futuristic theme going on
i actually found it to be rather creepy and disturbing at times other dark themes pokemon is more afraid to touch on nowadays
such as war ghosts death of pokemon gambling alcoholism and war
this game always had a dreary and freaky feel to it at least for me loved the town themes especially lavender town
something about that little tune stays with you as a child and finally pikachu
i love how the little guy can follow you around and develop a relationship with you
he will forever be my most favorite starter pokemonin conclusion this is my reasoning for pokemon yellow version being the best of them all
while nostalgia might help me love this game a little more and forgive the mistakes it made i honestly just think this an intelligent and dark game
i always got a more mature vibe from it than the rest and possibly other children picked up on that too
if you own a gameboy color i would highly recommend purchasing thisit came in the original as if i havent said that enough times
im such a fan of original art
so this game feels like it came straight out of japan
the story is fun and game play is cool
this one is definitely best on multiplayeri really enjoyed this game alot and its a spin off game from the house of the dead series and its a really challenging beat em upshooter because this game is best played with a friend if you want to see the ending unless if you are really good at this game
the enemies are real cheap because if you throw them on the ground the zombies end up biting you hence you get poisoned and your life bar goes down quicker unless if you kill a zombie get a antidote
but by the time that happens the zombies pals have already killed you so its a really challenging game by yourself and i highly recommend it unless if you hate cheesy english voice acting  dialogue which i am a huge fan of because its really funny to me
also i will give you heads up that the controls on this game take time to master and getting used to
also each character has their own set of movesthe kids love this gamethis game is entertaining for anyone because you are a taxi driver roaming in san francisco
you have to pick up passengers and take them to wherever they want to go
but there is a time limitthis game has neat grapics and does look like san francisco with the cable cars and everything
plus there are some pretty good sound and great graphicsevery once in a while one of those games come along that is an instant classic thers sonic  theres donkey kong country theres  nfl bitz thers super mario bros dx theres donkey kong  and theres crazy taxi
crazy taxi is the most fun ive had since i started gaming in  it is also the best game since sonic  if you have a dreamcast and do not have crazy taxi i worry about you get this game
if you think it is bad then you are stupidi liked the game it was really good i was fun to play
it is a awesome game to get on sega dreamcastthis game is the best game for a party after the drinks have started to flowthere are racing games and there are simulation games and then there is crazy taxi
its like burnout except cooler
with the speed boost feature of letting go of the gas tapping a tapping b and putting back on the gas at the same time mixed with infinite charges and a totally invulnerable taxi
you end up with an awesome adrenaline rush and a truly crazy game that has you rushing from destination to destination trying to figure out just how fast you can really gothe mini games in this really fill it out giving lots of extra things you can do after youve started to wear out running pedesterians all over the cityreally there just isnt anything like speed boosting through overcrowded traffic bouncing off cars and things you turned into ramps while a guy in the back of your car screams whooohooooim a fan of bd
joe myselfi have been playing this game off and on
it is still great after fourteen years
it is simple in concept
you pick up customers and get them to their destination quicklyif you like to drive really fast crash into other cars jump over trollies with people in the back seat then this game is for you
the graphics are really great and the gameplay is a blast
buy this game it is a must have for the dc
youll go nuts driving people around the city with them screaming in the back seat
serious fun for everyone a definite must getas one of the big ticket titles for the fledgling dreamcast segas final venture into the home console market this game needed to replicate and improve upon the quality established by its arcade counterpart
naturally diehard fans of the arcade machine would flock to a home release regardless of quality to save themselves a bundle on quarters but the real trick was capturing the hearts and minds of the home market
crazy taxis arcade release came near the very end of the outofhome markets lifespan
like it or not gamers just werent leaving home with as many tokens in their pockets as they had in the decades beforehand
sega had captured the arcade market with this imaginative gem but theyd only reached a dwindling fraction of the gaming market
to really consider taxi and the early quarter of the dreamcasts life a success they needed a grand slam hereas with any good arcade title theres no lengthy thoughtprovoking back story to the world of crazy taxi
its instantly accessible mindless fun
after ten minute of gameplay you feel like an old pro
you could take a wild guess about the premise just by looking at the cd jacket and get  of it correct
ok get this youre a taxi driver who is rewarded for driving all crazylike and your only purpose in life is to earn more money
end of storyas seems to be the case with any arcade game the physics of ct have been mussed with just a teensy bit aiding in the transformation of a taxi drivers day from monotonous mundane errands to wild exciting rides
your car will never sustain any damage nor will those of the games various citizens
instead vehicles bounce off of one another roll over and sail through the air like so many cartoony bumper cars
the lack of any real visible consequences for your actions aside from the obvious loss of game time really help to set a players mind at ease and let the relaxation set in
sure youre rushing around the city like a madman but at least youre at ease in doing soa new addition to the home release of the taxi is the refreshing quotcrazy boxquot mode which takes the tweaked physics engine of the regular game and applies it to other varied driving games
youll drive down a bowling alley complete with oversized pins
youll cruise down a skiers long jump ramp and sail off the edge
youll navigate a teeny stretch of road complete with sharp turns instant death on either side and a relentless time limit
its a great way to introduce new players to some of the more advanced methods of game play while giving experienced players a set of new challenges and a chance to brush up on their abilities
its exactly what the home release needed to set it apart from its arcade cousin and to intrigue the more demanding home marketin addition to an easily established and notably improved premise the control scheme on my familiar white dreamcast controller is damned close to perfection
the number of commands necessary to play a game of taxi are relatively small you just need to steer accelerate brake and shift
the dreamcast pad however functions as though it were sculpted with this very game in mind
the left and right triggers are your brake and gas respectively and are pressure sensitive which means you have much more control over your pedals
the analog stick is a flawless de facto steering wheel to the point that i cant imagine controlling the game with a regular wheel any more
likewise the quotaquot button switches you to reverse and the quotbquot button guns it back into drive both buttons placed logically in the exact spot where your thumb should be while holding down the right trigger
this placement makes shifting accelerating and the various advanced play mechanics introduced in quotcrazy boxquot much more natural and easy to accomplishvisually theres no distinguishing the game from its arcade counterpart
theyre honestly identical which was really a big feather in the dreamcasts cap at the time of the games release
in todays world alongside graphical masterpieces such as gran turismo  and project gotham racing  it doesnt stand a chance but at the time it was really inspiring to see
each of the four selectable drivers are well crafted and easily recognizable even in the heat of a tight deadline
they each cruise around in their own original cab styled to match their personality and come fully equipped with their own custom license plate
theres a good selection of different models out on the roads  but id be lying if i said youll never see a duplicate out on the road
theyre all pretty abundant but theres enough variety that you wont be distracted by the same car lined up bumper to bumper all the way down the roadfinally the audio which is just completely over the top
seriously the amount of effort that went into acquiring licensing writing recording mastering and implementing the various audio aspects of crazy taxi is just mindblowing
everything from the musical score provided by the offspring and bad religion respectively to the driver  passenger voices and interactions which vary depending on the individual to the sound of oncoming traffic rubber on asphalt and screaming civilians is spot on
the speedy racing mainstream punk rock soundtrack perfectly accompanies the rushed frantic pace of the game itself
absolutely flawlessin short crazy taxi was everything sega needed to reestablish themselves in the home market
its a superb experience whether youre playing alone at home on a friday night or taking turns with a large group of friends
where its lacking in depth it makes up with replayability and a tight control scheme
if youve got a dreamcast sitting around at home and you havent picked this game up yet now is most certainly the timeback in  i was a n kid who didt really care about sega games  consoles this game made me wish i wasits a reasonable priced game with some pretty good graphics and very good controls and it makes me want to keep playing itmusic  graphics 
smooth  fps awesome licensed soundtrack smooth character design with their talk that is still cool  comically charmingcontrols  the turning is always in your favor but the hit detection  collision impact can get laughable  awkward sometimes like i hit a bus  bounce  ft away thats niceim not a die hard dreamcast fan the saturn takes that place but this is a addicting arcade game that youll get hours of fun of
one of the several aaa titles the dreamcast has to offerlong before the rise and downfall of the sega dreamcast crazy taxi was a game found in the average arcade of the s
the spot on perfect port of crazy taxi from the arcade game to the sega dreamcast console is what made crazy taxi a must have for all dreamcast owners and among the top sold video games of its timethe object of the game is to operate a taxi cab and earn as much money in fares as possible within a set time limit
you select from  of  characters and then proceed to one of two cities based on whether you select to play the arcade mode or an alternate mode designed for the home console the major difference between the modes is the city you are driving through
you then drive as fast and as sporadic as possible to pick up and drop off customers
you are awarded with a higher fare based on how fast you get the customer to the destination
the object of crazy taxi is to not be a perfect driver in fact the craziness of your driving is often awarded with additional cash
at the end of each game you are given a grade based on how much money you managed to earna few interesting things about crazy taxi are its use of realworld advertisements in the game which in the late s was a first for video games
your customer often times will request to be driven to kfc pizza hut the fila shoe store or the levi  store
the soundtrack of the game is filled with music from bands the offspring and bad religion fitting the game and its release date wellthe only minor downfalls of this title are that it can seem repetitive after a while but you must keep in mind that this is because crazy taxi is an arcade game and its lack of simultaneous multiplayerthough ports of crazy taxi eventually came out for ps and gamecube the dreamcast port is the only one that is a perfect replication of the arcade game
it is also the best selling version of the gamecrazy taxis addictive game play excellent graphics especially for the time great soundtrack and arcade fun are what make this game such an excellent title
most dreamcast owners will rave about this game because of how it showcases the dreamcasts abilities it even has functions available with the use of thevisual memory unit  blue
crazy taxi is a game that all dreamcast owners need to own and enjoy if you are skeptical please take my word for itcrazy taxi was one of those games in the arcade that was so fun youd spend up to five bucks playing it
now with the dreamcast on its way out this is one of the games it will be remembered for
the breakneck speed superb graphics adrenaline pumping music from the offspring and bad religion combined with the fact this game doesnt get old and rarely do you get bored
you can find it now on ps and gamecube but this was the game that showcased what a great system the dreamcast was
also recommended with this is jet grind radio and  wheelercrazy taxi is a highly entertaining and addictive game which definitely qualifies as one of the dcs bestthe graphics are stunning
gameplay is fun and keeps you coming back for more
sure the car physics and other aspects of gameplay arent realistic but thats what video games are for fulfilling fantasies
and while the arcade course is easier and somewhat funner the new and exclusive course offers a fresh challenge that will take some time and effort to masterbottom line this is a game every dc owner should havecrazy taxi has got to be one of the most original games that i have ever played
the graphics are superb  the gameplay is excellent  and the longetivity on this game is overwhelming
the plot is easy you have go around picking up passengers and dropping them off at their destination in the fastest time possible to earn extra tips
you can also earn extra tips by doing crazy stunts to scare the customers and earning multibonus tips
no dreamcast should be without this gamefun to play in bursts
great for when you only have a few minutes to playits not deep but its funthis game is a great game i play it all the time u got to buy it i love this gamethis is the weirdest game in my collection
the game is very short about eight hours long but it is worth the twenty dollars spent
experiencing d felt like waking up from a weird dreami love this game
sure it was a little hard trying to find out what to do but all in all the story is amazing with really good cut scenes
the  controls arent bad and the first person shooter mode is cool too
starting in the middle of nowhere in the winter means you do a lot of running in the snow and you may run out of patience but if you can just give the game a chance it worth it
also if you analyze the game closely it really feels more like resident evil
i think this game was created before those and the creators of resident evil were inspired
i feel really satisfied and accomplished playing this game even if i only got the first disc
all in all theres a total of  of them and it will leave you wanting more
it didnt come in the original package but for the price it was worth iti got into survival horror when i played silent hill
i always loved the sh series and admit that this game looked like it would not wow me like silent hill
i was wrong
d is a fantastic  game
i was so scared playing tonight i barricaded my door
im twenty years  old and an emt and this game had me more terrified than any bloody emergency ive ever seen
the fact that the vmu acts as a perfect
in game compass is icing on the cake
if you love horror pick up dthis is a great game overall
the originallity to the game just makes it even better
i was skeptical at first like most people i thought the game would be stupid untill i played the game at a friends house
that is when i realised how great this game is not only is it like another human to talk to some of the things he says are amazing
he remembers everything you say to him and can piece them together
like i told him i was a forensic scientist then when i told him my favorite movie was the silence of the lambs like  days later
he told me that he was scared that a scientists likes a movie on serial killers
then he said hey keep thoose needles away from me
overall the game though takes a lot of patience and daily care
i dont mind though because its a lot of fun to raise something and then be able to talk to it
i mean how many people can talk to their pets and have them talk back
there is one general rule to remember though is that what you put into the game is what your going to get back
the game has a tremendous replay value considering that one seaman will always be different then another one
a must buy for dreamcast owners
just to get the microphone is worth the price trust me its a great gamethis game is an even better deal now that it is only  dollars
buy this game just for the unique sake of playing it
its a very good game and worth a play by everyone
its hard not to get hooked no pun intended by seamanthis game is great
its rated teen because some parts are not suitable for kids and some very little bad language i like to talk a lot but seaman doesnt
it only talks for  min
i hope they will make a sequel where it reads data from the other game and you talk to your frogman more
cause one they are frogmen they only say a few things and never talk again
when i want to talk to my frogmen they always say that theyll talk again tomorrow but they dont
i got left with two frogmen
i dont knew why because i herd you only should have one left
at st when i started my game seaman died because there wasnt enough food
if you are planning to get the game here are some tips
too make your baby mushroomers grow faster tap the glass till the weird squid thing eats them all
wait a little while and youll have seaman that are kids now
dont feed the seaman kids cause they feed on each other
when you only have two seaman left thats when you need to feed them
but only if they say they are hungry
when you get the other tank with bugs keep the moisture level up to  by using the spray
dont feed seaman the bugs till all the food is gone
dont feed seaman spiders it will kill him well i hope this review helpsseaman is a strange adventure that rewards the patient
if youre looking for buttonmashing then move on because you will be sorely disappointed  in this game
what seaman provides is a totally emersive experience in  which you raise your quotbabiesquot to eventually become a fullfledged  seaman
as he grows you converse with him using the included microphone  pack and learn about each other
while he can be moody and acerbic seaman  seems to be truly wellintentioned
ive been raising mine for about   weeks and look forward to my daily visit
i cant wait to find out what he  will say next or what the next step in his evolution can be like
a hint  for the impatient folks you can advance seaman by adjusting the clock of  your dreamcast and restarting the game
this is especially helpful if you  get occupied and cant get to the tank on a given day to check in
i  wouldnt recommend using this trick to accelerate play however because  part of the overall experience is to have the daily interaction that allows  your seaman bond to grow deeper over timei bought this game almost a week ago and i havent touched any of my other dreamcast games since
i dont really know why either
all i know is  im fascinated by seaman
first off let me just say that you need two  things to enjoy seaman patience and an understanding of what you are about  to undertakewhen you turn on seaman you are greeted by the great  leonard nimoy
he updates you on your progress each time you begin the  game
its a beautiful touch which always makes smile
you are given a  virtual aquarium at the beginning of your adventure some food and a  seaman egg
you have control over the lights in the tank the air quality  and the tanks heater
these all create a nice simple interactive  environment right away although it would be nice if you could turn the  heat down as well as up
as it is if your water gets too hot all you can  do is wait for it to slowly drop
so with all this ready you drop your  seaman egg in the water and begin your seamans lifeim going to skip  ahead some
there are steps to raising your seaman which i wont go into  here
learning for yourself how to raise your seaman is most of the fun of  this game
in fact if i could go back i would even start the game without  having read the instruction booklet
anyway the real fun begins when your  seaman has grown up and starts talking to you
its almost eerie when he  starts asking you personal questions and responds accurately to your  answers
youll be calling all your relatives to share the experience with  them
youll even get a chance to name your seamanim having so much  fun with seaman and i havent even had it a week
the only problem i have  seen is with the voice recognition system
a lot of times your seaman  wont understand you and will either stay quiet or just look at you and  say quotwhatquot but it hardly takes away the fun of the game
all  you need is patience
now im going to go check on my seaman
buy this  game right nowand thats fine with me
i love this game
its an experience
and youll never forget it if you see it through to the endive owned this game since it first came out and its been on every single hard drive of every computer ive owned since then
okay the graphics are abysmal by todays standards they werent that great in  either and the game moves at a slow pace but ive never known a game with so much atmosphere and suspensethe last express manages to pull off a combination of historical adventure game and whodunnit while educating the player at the same time
other games have tried to inform players about history but none has succeeded in the way that the last express doesthe game takes place in the summer of  with europe on the brink of war the orient express leaves paris bound for constantinople
what takes place on the train will determine the fate of europe for the next century
as robert cath a young american doctor you have to choose sides as you find that the people aboard the train are not the innocent travelers they seem to be
powerful forces are in play and you must chart your course to constantinople as intrigue greed corruption mystical forces and conspiracy surround you threatening your life and promising to change europe foreverthis game will certainly not be to the taste of players brought up on todays high definition action fests but for those of us who like to sit down with a good book or who dont mind a game experience that can be savored at leisure like a good cigar this game has a great deal to offerpros  everything in the last express is topnotch the graphics and the voice acting the varied fascinating characters and the absorbing story
its an atmospheric mysterythriller like quotthe maltese falconquot plunked into a colorful stylish art deco set
as robert  cath a young american doctor you hop a ride on the orient express where  you encounter a sumptuous world sliding inexorably toward violence and  war
nearly all the action takes place on the train which heightens  the intimacy and drama
in this it is reminiscent of hitchcocks  quotthe lady vanishesquot  last express takes place in quotreal  timequot which means that events and conversations continue on at their  own pace
a rewind feature permits you to go back in time to redo things  you missed
if you have played quottitanic an adventure out of  timequot in which the end game takes place in much more frenetic real  time you will have a sense of what last express is like
there are  several endings but the one in which you quotwinquot is a classic
imho the ending alone is worth the price of the gamecons  the  characters in last express were filmed and then animated the end result  is rather jerky
i found that i noticed this for about the first fifteen  minutes then i adjusted and forgot all about it
the game includes a  handful of fight scenes although there is an easy cheat to get past these  i used it
there are also more subtle adult themes
they might go right  over the head of a child playing the game with you
on the other hand  they might not
the savegame mechanism which doesnt allow you to  easily identify your gamebottom line  wit beauty romance elegance  intrigue action suspensejordan mechners riveting the last express was unusual for a number of reasons the game allowed the player to explore the legendary orient express with details recovered from vintage orient cars and photos and there were several countries involved in political intrigue on board russian serbs persians germans etc
most striking are the games visuals artists used realtime video capture then translated the images to d penandink outlines much like those blackandwhite books of art nouveau clipart
this is not always successful characters are more like expressive oversimplified cartoons and motions are jerky but combined with topnotch voicework this is easily overlooked
also the characters dialogue is recorded in the various languages of each nationality as american robert cath you will eavesdrop on conversations in various languages which will appear translated in subtitles but only for languages that robert speaks
your fellow passengers may not be what they seem there are hidden deals and dark secrets afoot
the inventorybased puzzles are generally straightforward and intuitive and the games small environment eliminates tedious backtracking
the several arcadestyle action sequences are not as successful and suffer from slow jerky controls meaning that if you die youll have to play again and again before you can move onoverall the combination of detailed backstory attention to period detail the many languages and nationalities the cinematic score and rich visuals make this a game to treasurein majesty you take the part of the king of a fantasy kingdom
although you have ordinary minions they are no match for the ferocious and magical enemies that will attack your kingdom and so you must also recruit mighty  heroes
but the problem with heroes is that theyre heroic they tend to go  their own way rather than strictly obey orders
and thats the fun of  majesty
you can support your heroes with money spells and enhanced  weapons but then you must sit back and watch them go about their highly  entertaining business
you can let them know what you want them to do by  placing bounties on things but your heroes will not necessarily pursue  your bounties
sometimes theyll attack monsters and sometimes theyll go  carousing at the inn when theres work to be done
sometimes theyll  undertake quests and sometimes theyll turn around and run when they see a  monster
whatever they do its fun to watch and fun to listen to as well  because theyve all been given amusing things to say
this is a simple game  to play but not a dull one because there is quite a bit of strategy  involved in growing your kingdom and combining complimentary classes of  heroes
majesty is that rarest of computer games something that you can  just sit down and toy with and have a great deal of funmajesty the fantasy kingdom sim is one of my favorite pc games
in this game you take the role as king of the mythical land of ardania
you have the responsibility of building a kingdom and recruiting heroes to protect your kingdom from enemies who may be trying to destroy youthere are  epic quests for you to play
the quests vary in difficulty and can range from making money to pay off a debt to killing off the ultimate enemy
some of the quests are locked and you have to unlock them by completing other quests
or you can create your own freestyle game and build the kingdom of your dreamsmajesty includes over  building types  different classes of heroes and  types of enemies
majesty features richly detailed graphics a great musical score and hilarious voiceovers
although you wont have direct control over what happens in the game you will have lots of fun building your kingdom and discovering new secretsmajesty fits into the same category as simcity pharoh cleopatra and caesar iii
but this game is a lot more fun to play
if you like both citybuilding and fantasy games majesty is the game for youor so says the blurb on the inside cover of the box but in this case i believe it to be an apt description of this game
first off this isnt a very deep game nor a very micromanageable one
you wont be examining a pageworth of stats for your heroes and you wont be able to tell your various heroes where to go and what to do
think of the games title if you ever get confused as to what sort of game this is quotmajestyquotyou can build quotguildsquot which supply heroes who fight monsters and collect gold which comes back to you in the form of taxes
that is the game in a nutshell
rogue guilds allow you to recruit rogues who steal money from other places this might seem odd considering that they pay a lower rate of tax than others but since they are highly devoted to their craft it actually makes sense to use them
rangers guilds produce frontiertypes who like to roam around discovering black portions of the map
gnomes will help build structures faster
the tax collector actually journeys around to gather up tax money from the various places and peasants help to construct those buildings
guardhouses are used for protection while marketplaces are good sources of revenue and trade from trading posts and their caravansupper levels introduce various other guilds chock full of clannish warriors who dont play well with others
build one type of guild and that means another three will refuse because of the firsts existance
so in that way the game becomes a game of knowing what to build when and in a few cases where
the gameplay itself is pleasantly easy to grasp yet never so shallow that you wonder why you are playing it
the graphics and sound are very well done and support the various characters and locales commendably
majesty is not too frenzied to the point of frustration and not too sedate so you arent constantly waiting around for things to happen heroes of might amp magic
the realtime environment most closely resembles warcraft but on a more detailed levelthough the dampd style sword amp sorcery shtick is as old as the hills majesty is actually an innovative sort of game
not incredibly simulationoriented no stats to keep track of or epic sweeping storylines but not as wardriven as most realtime strategy games
it is somehow very peaceful yet ever expanding
never boring  ad but not rapidfire to the point of pointlessness political tycoon
a very happy medium seems to have been struck here
expectantly there are those hardcore sim fans that will whine that it isnt age of empires  and there are those rts fans that will groan whenever they cant send hoards of attackers towards an enemy hq
but majesty succeeds admirably in its own little niche and really does have something for everyonethis is a great game to buy the price is excellent also you goto a computer store and it costs  plus tax besides this is a great rpg game to get
the object is to destory the dark castle before it destorys you thats it besides there are a couple of dozen buildings that you can make  and alot of allies if i could i would give this  stars hope you do tono doubt about it this is the best helicopter sim on the market today
if anyone can find one better let me know
i have longbow  and team apacheand all the rest of them and they do not come close to the reality of gunship thank you
you have a spotter in front of you and your wingmen giving you updated grid coordinates simply because some targets are always moving
this will help you perhaps
fly close to the ground as you canwhen you need to update the grid to make the waypoints for your wingmen
your copilotgunner cannot lock a target too well when it is raining and visibility isnt good
i hope this information help those that think this is a bad game
one more thing the apache does have wheels on it like a jetso one would tend to believe that you could probably strafe the ground while doing over   mphthink about this the next time you play or rate this game
thank you now i dont mean hit the ground in a solid manner peacecampc ts is a fantastic game
firestorm just adds to the excitement
with new units such as juggernaut gdi finally as longrange power cyborg reaper my fav limpit drones jump jet infantry mobile emp cannon and  mobile stealth generator firestorm really gets fans on fire with its  interesting new units
the story revolves around nods computer ai cabaal  but im not spilling any details
the really huge robot at the end of both  sides is pretty cool the game has a good story and plot twist and centers  around the gamer  not some actor as in ts
overall this game extends the  ongoing life of the campc universewhen i got it i quotpluggedquot it in and watched the magic
it is a vast improvement for gdi because now they have artillery unitsjuggernauts making it a bit more equal on both sidesgdigood and nodbadthe missions are by far better than tiberian sun making this a most enjoyable game
if you feel lucky you might want to try the world domination tour
i tried it and boy is the cpu hardgdi has awesome new units like a mobile emp mobile war factory and drop pod control plug for on the upgrade centernod has new units too but not as exciting as gdis
they include a mobile stealth generator fist of nodmwf and my favorite the cyborg reaperthis is the best computer game i have played for at least three years
the battlefields are beautifully rendered and the cut scenes while brief are some of the smoothest and best cgi animation yet produced for a game
but  eye candy is the least of this games virtues
in addition to being a  challenging strategy game the developers made the dangerous marketing  decision to produce a realistic historical simulation rather than just  another hackandslash
they went for the quality product rather than the  quick buck and their gamble has paid off richly for gamers
shoguns  strategic game is much like chess in that the system is simple but its  ramifications make for a complex thoughtprovoking challenge
the tactical  game is a marvel and the player must make the best use of troop types  troop quality ammunition fatigue states weapon and armor quality  weather effects leadership factors and the hilly terrain of japan
and  while every ai has a bad habit or two shoguns is the best i have yet  seen
it knows when it has an advantage and capitalizes upon it
while the  strategic map could be more informative it is adequate so if shogun has a  flaw it is that the manuals coverage of the strategic side of the game  leaves much to be desired
however these are minor flaws in an otherwise  superb product
mastering shogun will keep you highly entertained for a  long long timelets start out with me a freckled american that likes rock in roll
but i am one of those guys that wishes he was japanese because of being so into feudal japan
the idea of samurais ronin and the actual concept of keeping your familys honor has always infactuated me and will always till the day i die
once i heard that ea was releasing a game that would feed my unhealthy habits of wishing i was asian i almost pooped my pants
this game delivers not only feudal japan as the base of the story but is based on a very fun board game entitled shogun which is now called samurai swordswhich is like risk or axis and allies
in this game you have the choice from i believe  or  clans which each have their own advantages and disadvantages so you much choose wisely
in this game you try to keep the population within your provinces happy while trying to earn the currency in the game kokukoku means year supply of riceex  koku is  years worth of rice
this game will keep you at the monitor for hours on end of the battles are beautiful
buy this gamei am a big fan of kurosawa seven samurai ran
i have also read shogun by clavell as well as musashi and taiko by yoshikawa
i even play the board game by avalon hill  samurai sword previously known as shogun check it out on this site
of course this is the period that the pc game shogun total war is dealing with  th century japan
i have been playing it for several nights now and i can honestly say that my wife is getting just a bit ticked off with me because this is all i want to do when i get home  play this game
its highly addictice if you get around all the game controls but not in a diabo ii mindless rpg sort of way
it is addictive because it really sets up the atmosphere of th century japan beautifully  from the basic military units the special units emissary ninja geisha priest to the music  kodo drums and all
one beef i had with the package was that the user manual was totally useless something that somebody else mentioned in the reviews and which i couldnt agree with more
but you can easily get around this by picking up the official strategy guide by prima trust me youll need it
put it this way you will be playing this game for hoursmonths  and with its level of complexity and depth perhaps even years so if you invest that kind of time in the game why not invest a few more koku japanese currency on a strategy guide that is well written and highly helpful
all i can say is i love this gamei love feudal japan
ive been editor for a magazine on feudal japan for over ten years have made kimono and love watching japanese movies for hours and hours
i have the shogun board game and play that quite a bit
since i review strategy games for bellaonlinecom it was a natural for me  to buy shogun total war as soon as it was outwhile the box makes it  seem that the game is much like the board game where you move groups of  units from province to province a la risk the computer game is actually  far more comprehensive and intense
to start with there are actual  graphics for each member of a unit  its more like having a set of forces  in age of empires ii than blockunits
while you dont direct the  individuals they still fight on a onebyone basis which leads to  stunning combat sequences when youre in full attackback to the  basics though
the games graphics are awesome
if this game doesnt  incite you to go buy that p with a top end sound and graphic card  nothing will
the rolling hills wisps of fog floating over the individual  trees clouds reflected in the smooth stream before you each unit with his  own armor and banners and colors  its stunning
the music is gorgeous  as well
the narrator  well he sounds like a russian citizen trying to  wander around tokyo
you cant have everythingthe tutorials are great
they do them in standard tutorial fashion too give the objectives youll  learn step through those lessons and then recap what youve learned
they  are very helpful and get you used to unit movements and formationsyou  can choose the formation within a unit and of all your units in your attack  force
there are of course different kinds of units  ground troops with  swords archers horsemen with spears and many other combinations
as you  build your fortress you can create buildings for new and interesting troops  as welleach unit has its own strengths and its own morale
they work  well on different terrain and in different weather
yes weather affects  troops too
rain dampens the musketeers while snow hinders other troops
going up or downhill affects troops and you can hide in the trees
this is  about as close as you can get to some of the historical battles of the  sspeaking of which in addition to the fully customizable battle  systems you can fight historical battles as well
interested in how you  would have fared against some of the great shogun of japan
load up the  battle and find out
want to kill off a few close friends
you have that  option as welleven if i werent a huge fan of japanese warfare id  recommend this game highly to any strategy fan
the combination of stellar  graphics great sound and quality gaming experience add up to a fun time  for anyoneshogun is an amazingly addictive and fun game to play
although there isnt a whole lot of backstory in the manual on the cd are pages of japanese background in html format
the unusual controls may seem weird at  first but in no time youll be used to the turn based strategic map
think star wars rebellion except about  times better
you can send  people on missions send troops into provinces to take over send out  spies ninja and emmisaries and whenever anything cool happens there is  an extremely high quality cool video waiting there to illustrate it for  you
you can make and break treaties fight wars with enemies on three  different fronts while dealing with uprisings on recently conquered land  and dealing with dutch traders at the same timewhile on easy mode this  game is easy on harder modes it gets darn near impossible
but its also  appreciable because its fair
you watch the computers tactics and  realize that while its a tough system with good ai it doesnt cheat and  it is possible to beat
and believe me this is one of those games where  you really get a feeling of satisfaction once youve beaten itbut its  on the battlefield that this game really shines
you have thousands of  troops
all of them are influenced by their skill and that of the general  by weather conditions fatigue morale whether theyre defending or  attacking
choke points like bridges literally make it possible to hold  off  enemies with  archers and  samurai
but when the archers run  out of arrows youre screwed
the graphics are great and you can try all  kinds of tactics like flanking the enemy or rushing down a hill at them  or all those cool things youve wanted to try since seeing gettysburg or  braveheart
and it worksthis game is addictive fun informative  and slick
i definitely very highly recommend this game to everyonedisclaimer i am a japanbuff and games based on the sengoku period of the shogunate wars have to be really bad for me not to enjoy themnow imagine how much i enjoyed one of the best strategy games ever
shogun total war is admittedly such a great game in every aspect it has become a rts game benchmark
not to mention it has fathered the total war seriesalternating between a tactical map in which units get moved and improvements built and the battlefield map in which realtime unit movements and battles are fought shoguntw has struck the perfect harmony between turnbased and realtime strategy gamingthe graphics are by now only a bit dated  and on the other hand they can truly shine even on midrange systems today
the units are easily distinguished during battle controlling them is done via a userfriendly interface and the issued orders are followed fast and effectively something not true for much latter games such as supreme commanderthe sounds manage to be both majestic and realistic even after so many years i am using them as my main winxp soundtheme
both japanese and english is availablebirth of an heir earthquakes and assassination attempts by ninjas all add to the unpredictability of the gameplay
the particulars of the terrain and the weather the troops deployment and the placement and survival of the general all make the realtime battles such a unique experiencealliances are made and broken rebels conquered and their shock troops assimilated christian traders allowed or shunted
every decision has consequencesdo not miss on ithighly recommendedwhat can i say  the game is simple but with nueances
historical battles that took hours to fight you can resolve in  minutes
i think parts of it are overly mechanical  for example the fighting monks are always the  toughest units  but in real life they were crushed by the samurai
yes  some fighting monks had great skill  however the bulk of their troops were  not as well trained or disciplined
also the fact that you can just trade  rice and get samurai works as a game mechanic but it isnt really very  historical
what makes me overlook those issues and a few others is that  the end results feel right for the period
i read many books many  available here at amazon on japanese history and this game gives a good  feel
also the linear tactics in this game could easily be transfered over  to seven years war and other similar games
excellent game
i should note  i played all the way through on easy and i am going to do it again with the  next level
i feel the game has great replay valuethis is probably the best game i have ever played
the graphics are amazing and the cars are very realistic
there are only two things that i can see wrong with this game first you cant adjust the replay and second your headlights only work at night
very hard if your driving in tunnels
but this game is still the bestporsche has always been a simbol of the sports car
founded by ferdinand porsche the designer of the perhaps worlds most famous car  vw beetledr
porsche was a great inventor and still the cars bearing his name are sign of efficiency and perfection
and this game doesnt throw a single shadow on his perfect reputationthe cars are well modeled with lot of details
the change in speed handling and braking abilities is very realistic you certainly wont beat a  turbo with lovely designed 
there are also a lot of missions but test driver is certainly most interestingthis happens to be a great game either for racing fan who will annihilate lap records all the time through someone who wants to relax by driving some matches you wont take just one over to anyone who is interested in porsche history
it will tell you a lot about those wonderful cars
thats what i liked most  something besides an excellent driving gamealthough this game doesnt have any other brand of car in it i dont care
i like porsches
i also liked the fact that this game allows you to drive some of the older cars because previous nfs titles and most racing games in general are fixated on the brand new something horsepower rockets that are on the market todaythe tracks are generally well laid out even devious
the designers stuck hard objects such as trees walls stuatues etc in places that skidouts and fishtailing cars are likely to hitthe graphics are amazing
the design team so i have heard worked with porsche to get this game rightearly on i ran into the control problems
quotice racingquot is the term ive read most oftenthis can be solved through several waysexperience race the car more often so you can predict what it will doupgrades a lot of the problems with spinout have to with with the standard parts your car comes with
upgrading to better ones solves this problemdownforceweight distrobutionbrake distrobution when set correctly they allow your car to stick to the road like glue or go flying head long around corners whichever you preferall in all this is an excellent racing game
the physics modeling is superb the graphics will amaze and the competitor ai will impressat first i was a bit iffy about purchasing it
i said to myself quotits all porschequot  i was not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing as i have been used to more than one breed of car
but these horses are built for speed and thats a good thing
a very enjoyable gamei recently purchased a logitech driving force gt wheel with pedals  my first ever in many many years of gaming  and then set about to finad some good racing games to use it withi first got dirt   not bad but it didnt have any porsches
in my youth i drove a   super cabriolet and then a   sc coupe for many years and i wanted to drive those cars again in simulation
after looking at a lot of reviews i chose this game even though it was released in  and am i glad i did
to begin with it has many and nothing but porschesof course the graphics now  years old are a little sketchy especially of the surrounding terrain as your racing over the landscape of europe but guess what
when your in the heat of a race against  competitors you only care that you can see where the road and the other cars are  eye candy is definitely low on your list of needsthe most outstanding feature of the game is the simulation of the physics of car handling  it is excellent
i chose to play the evolution mode wherein you start off in the s with an intial wad of cash to buy one of the early cars and race it against ai drivers in order to win prize money
this enables you to enhance your car or move on to more modern cars as you advance through the evolution of the porsche brand over the years
needless to say as i moved through the s and s i purchased two cars that represented the ones i owned and was thrilled to find they handled just as i remembered them  basically scary if you went into a corner too hot
when i advanced to the  a car my boss owned i found it handled just as he said it did  very stable if a little underpowered
when i reached the  i was astonished at how well it handled
i didnt know anything about this car until i then looked it up and discovered it had been hailed by car  driver as the best handling car in the usa at the time
hopefully this gives you a sense that the  point physics model they used is very realistic unlike a number of other driving gamesas a further bonus you can improve your cars handling by adjusting tire pressure spring and shocks settings and if youve got the cash add equipment that really soups it up including carbs engines swaybars tires etc
these matter and i found myself going online to look up advice on tuning the cars
the ai competitors you race against are no slouches particularly the top two who are pros and have the best well tuned cars
i have lost a lot of sweat literally trying to get at least an average of third place in the various tournaments in order to advance to the next time period  it aint easy and practice and tuning are absolutely necessarylet me add here that the vibration and steering feedback through the logitech wheel is excellent and definitely heightens the sense of realism
i could swear i can feel the g forces as i fly into a corner and hang on for dear life but its really only the  visuals audio and the wheel feedback
wowfinally let me say that i bought this as a used game but it came in near pristine condition complete with its manual
since i have a windows  machine i had to fool around a little to get it to work but the xp emulation mode was the answer to that
all in all i highly recommend this game to racing enthusiasta but especailly to porsche loversout of all the quotneed for speedquot games i consider porsche unleashed the best ahead of hot pursuit  and underground
instead of racing different cars from different manufacturers like other racing games this game is entirely devoted to the porsche lineup
there are porsches from the old s to the modern gt series race cars to drive
the trademark quirky handling of the porsches are so evident in this game
the more modern cars are less likely to quotfish tailquot around but the  rs is an annoying fishtailer
but once you successfully manage to control that beast it becomes so fun powersliding aroundgraphically this game is stunning from nighttime driving to driving in the alpine snow you got everything
the graphic doesnt need a very robust cpu but try to get the best d graphic card you can afford anything better than a voodoo 
i was able to run this game with a  mhz cpu with voodoo  and it was fine
sound quality is also superb and i especially like the sound of the older   very raw and throatyi would like to address some issues that others have pointed out either here or in discussion sites
one is that porsche unleashed works horribly with xp and windows   easports technical support doesnt have much to say about this
if you search the web you should be able to find some answers to fit this problem with a patch or some figetting around
the second problem is that porsche unleashed doesnt seem to like some newer version of directx and the nvidia denotator drivers
for example my mouse would freeze hard crash at the startup screen
i was using directx b with the latest nvidia drivers
to quotfixquot this i eventually had to rollback the directx version to  and use an older version of detonator version  for winse and everything seems to work okay
so hopefully this could help those who have problems
this is a great game and i think it is worth the trouble i listed to play itthe physics engine is terrific
cars perform very realistically and the tracks are well designed
there is a definite learning curve but it is more than worth the effort
this game can teach you more about real world car dynamics than you would think possible
just dont lift off the throttle in the cornersthis game has limited appeal to those who want nonstop arcade action
but if you like to spend hours on end in front of your computer immersed in an alternate universe then i cannot recommend this enough
this games universe is huge and beautiful and requires dedication on the part of the player
it is obviously inspired by the old classics elite frontier elite  and frontier first encounters which are some my alltime favorite games
the only problem with x btf is that you cannot actually land on the many planets like you could in those older games
i imagine this has to do with the limitations of the games engine but i was disappointed since i figured if you could have a game that allowed seamless transfers from planet into space back in  when frontier elite  came out why couldnt such a feature have been put into this game
but aside from that quibble i have none with this game
a firstrate effort by a fine company
get it while you can
these sims are a dying breed
i also recommend the sequel xtension which is not available in the usa but can be ordered directly from egosoft in germany at egosoftcom
the sequel updates the graphics even more and fixes many problems and adds many featuresas a die hard space sim fan xbtf has been on my list of games i must experience for a long time
i finally dug out my disk to activate on steam and oh wow
it did not disappoint
let me preface my comments by being straight about what xbtf is not
it is not an adrenaline fueled rapidfire shmup
if you require pulse pounding action you wont find it in this game
there no gore
instead you start in the middle of unknown space surrounded by aliens youve never heard of
you have a ship  no weapons  and little else
an alien teladi appears offering assistance for a price
stng fans might think of ferengi as teladi are motivated by profit above all elsewhen you accept their help youll end up in the hole for  credits
youll need to trade in order to pay them back and earn your ticket out of teladi space
xbtf is a game of space commerce
in fact you are eventually able to set up an outpost of your choice in teladi space to earn revenue whilst away doing other things
youll use your earnings to upgrade your equipmentbe prepared to spend time travelling from one trading post or factory to the other
thats exactly what this game is about mostly
i highly recommend that you install the expansion xtension which adds many features to the game
xbtf is a game of beauty
the graphics years after release are still breathtaking
xbtf will teach you about the beauty of the universe
youll trade explore negotiate and yes deal with bad guys
but mostly youll explore
and thats what this is all about the freedom to explore the unknownground control was released in  and is a relatively rare breed a realtime tactics game rather than a realtime strategy
the difference between the two is that in an rts the player has control of resources and unit production or reinforcements whilst in an rtt the player has to make deal with what they have and cannot construct new units intheatre
some games such as the total war series appeal to both by having a turnbased campaign map mode where units are constructed and assembled into armies and then a realtime battle mode where the battle is fought with the units that have been brought to the field with no prospect of reinforcements arriving midbattle with some exceptions if there are other armies nearby when the battle startsground control doesnt have that although you do have some larger choices about the mission before it starts
you can customise your attack force and decide which units to take into the battle before dropping into the fray
the game is pretty hardcore though as monolith productions were unhappy with players simply quicksaving their way through battles in other games instead of deploying proper tactics so they simply dropped the ability to save midmission from the game
and considering some of the later maps can take up to an hour to finish thats a pretty ballsy decision
to be honest it works
playing ground control is much like playing a total war game with intelligent decisions and tactical planning but retaining flexibility to deal with changing circumstances on the battlefield required rather than simply sending your army off willynilly and reloading if they happen to get wiped outthe biggest surprise on playing this nineyearold game is that visually it still looks pretty smart
its d units are lowtextured compared to modern games sure but are detailed enough to remain impressive down to the individual soldiers guns ejecting shell casings as they fire and the tracked vehicles leaving churnedup trails across the battlefield
the game looked astonishing in  and remains more than attractive enough to get the job done today
and as with many of the older games ive recently reviewed on the blog its so old that even the more humble modern laptops should be able to run it with everything turned up to the maximum without breaking a sweat
in addition i encountered zero problems on running it with xp on modern graphics cards but i cannot speak to its compatibility with vistaas mentioned previously the game is pretty hardcore and unforgiving of mistakes
the more powerful units particularly the heavy artillery are fully capable of wiping out your entire attack force in a few minutes if you blunder into an enemy position chokepoint or crossfire area
as a result careful deployment of recon or stealth units to map out your path is required
later in the game the addition of aerial forces and highspeed scout aircraft makes this a lot easier although additional precautions have to be taken aircraft are highly vulnerable to ground aa fire and unlike ground vehicles cannot be repaired
positioning and deployment of your forces is also critical and in fact it is interesting to realise that youre putting your heavy armour at the front lighter faster forces on the flanks and heavy artillery and the command vehicle in the middle almost as if this was a hightech version of the napoleonic wars albeit one with bombers capable of dropping small nuclear bombs roaring overheadthe missions are challenging although the learning curve is decent enough and keep forcing you to reevaluate tactics
for example once you get artillery it initially appears that the game is essentially over as you can sit a mile outside the enemy base and pound it to rubble
however the deployment of enemy counterbattery units fast intercept aircraft which can bomb your defenceless artillery unless you have aa units and so on keep you on your toes
enemy ai is excellent and does a good job of keeping you busy especially on the harder difficulty settingsthe storyline although unlikely to win awards is welltold and enjoyable to watch unfold
the music is excellent and the graphics engine is fantastic
ground control wasnt the first realtime combat game to use a fullyd engine but it was certainly the first one where you didnt spend half your time battling the camera controls as well as the enemy
in fact ground control and its successor engines the ones used in ground control ii and world in conflict remain the finest d battlefield engines yet seen in the genre and certainly put the much newer ones in the likes of company of heroes dawn of war command and conquer iii and so forth to shameon the minus side of things the primary problem is the lack of inmission saving although the game naturally does save after and before every mission
whilst it does make you play the game in a much more logical manner it isnt very forgiving if you suddenly realise youre about to miss a dentists appointment  minutes into a long mission forcing you to restart later from scratch
however that hardcore element is part of the games lasting appeal and with the ingame saving it would be a far easier and more simplistic game
another slight criticism is that aircraft are of dubious value since you cant use them until your ground units have destroyed all aa forces in an area and by that time youve pretty much won anyway and that the two sides are pretty much just reskins of one another with only a couple of unique unitsground control also comes packaged with its expansion dark conspiracy
dark conspiracy furthers the story of the war and its characters in an consistently interesting and entertaining manner
the expansion also takes the war off krigb to other worlds and introduces a new faction the phoenix mercenaries who have very different vehicles weapons and tactics to the existing two sides
there are also some interesting and original new maps such as airless moons and other planetary environments
however the expansion isnt quite as well paced as the original game and its later levels are astonishingly rock hard to the point of frustration which the original game just about avoidsstill ground control  is an excellent tactical game that rewards careful consideration of the battlefield and due attention to military tactics and unit capabilities
it is perhaps not as tolerant of casual players as some other realtime strategytactics games but making the battles more challenging is part of its appeali only recently managed to acquire a computer capable of running this game and finally went out to get it after much anticipation
i have not been disappointed
it has a story that if a little unimaginitive i found to be quite enjoyable
as for the gameplay the focus on tactics and effective use of your limited units against almost always numerically and technologically superior foes rather than constructing a hoard of disposable units was quite refreshing
the games ai is generally great occasionally it does some stupid things but i have encountered this in every game ive played
the normal difficulty can be quite punishing as the ai is very unforgiving but this is a refreshing challenge
also i have found that in many levels the most obvious path is not always the best often there is an alternate route to an objective that is less heavily defended
the use of terrain is quite important and the enemy knows this as well
one occasional annoyance is that sometimes you will get on the high ground and attempt to fire on a target below only find yourself unable to however i usually encounter this when i try to fire at something directly below a cliff face that i am sitting atop
thus i chalk this up to added realism my tanks being unable to depress their guns sufficiently to assault the target
the solution to this problem is simple just use artillery or other mortar style weapons
another excellent feature is you are required to use combinations of units going with all one type of unit can be a recipe for disaster
for example one mission i deployed nothing but heavy tanks incapable of defending against air attacks the ai then was able to slaughter my force with its ground attack aircraft and i could do nothing to defend my poor tanks
if i have any qualms it is that the tanks are somewhat ineffective against infantry which is highly unrealistic but i see the reason they did this as it helps keep the game from degenerating into a tank rush infantry bombs or artillery in order of effectiveness are generally the best defense against other infantry
a very enjoyable feature i found was that midway through the game you switch sides this is refreshing as some rts games make you play as simply one side throughout
though the side you switch to has overall better technology it is at a point when the other side which you were previously on has the upper hand thus you still have a challenge
the graphics are also top notch and the totally free roaming camera are both nice features that simply serve to enhance an already great experienceforget earth  this is the game to buy
dont let people scare you into thinking you need a major system to run this game
i bought ground control and it ran quotout of the boxquot
now when i bought the game i didnt have a great graphics card and only m ram but the game ran ran well and looked decent enough to be very playable
i recently upgraded to a midlevel graphics card added m ram and now this game is unbelievable
the detail in graphics is incredible the playability is superb and the storyline is secondtonone
get it play it enjoy itthere arent very many real time strategy games that dont use resource management and of the few there are most of them redefined the term bomb
this is one of the few that did notlet me point out the merits of not having resources for all you starcraft maniacs out there
instead of sitting in your base like a coward building your defenses so youll survive that next rush the enemy is sending at you its just one big fight straight to the death
this gets great when you have more than two people playing as you can have engagements that make omaha beach look like a oneonone pistol duel
oh and by the way rushes dont workthe gameplay is much like one of the older similarly excellent games out there myth  the camera works in similar fashion and you have a fixed amount of units at the start of each mission
in multiplay you can either have a onetime drop or periodical reinforcements
the difference between the games other than the obvious change of setting is that you have finer control over your units
you can select equipment and special weapons all of which are quite tempting and will make a big difference in battlethe game includes  single play missions and a tutorial that will get any seasoned strategy gamer familiar with the interface in under ten minutes
for the first  crayven missions you play as major sarah parker whose voice might be a bit familiar think planescape torment
for the second  new dawn missions you lead as deacon jared stone
surviving squads in each half of the game carry over to subsequent missions accruing experience along the way and becoming more effective depending on how many enemies they kill
the plot really is quite interesting and the missions should be challenging for even hard core strategy gamers
for the starcraft players who cant live without the security blanket of their base theres always the easy difficulty settingthe graphics and engine are topnotch and definitely one of the reasons this game deserves high marks
even now the models and effects are very impressive and especially when compared to the other rts games
stability is not an issue i have yet to see a single crash after about  hrs of gameplay which is better than i can say for most of the games ive playedeven at a higher price than this ground control is a steal
if you havent played it yet and are even remotely interested in real time strategy get it while you canthis is about one guy wandering around a postnuke war california
you can  pick up an npc or two but its not really a partytype adventurei  dont really like postapocalyptic stuff im more into dragons and magic  and stuff but this game just plain rules
plus its funny and i love  little bits of humor in an rpg its not sillyfunny all the time but it  has enough cute little parts like a red ryder bb gun to put eyes out and an  xfiles reference to be enjoyable
it has quite a few references to  various movies which is cutethe odd thing about this game is that ive  played it through to completion several times and intend to play it again
i tried first with an average guy then i made new characters  a sharp  shooter a talker a brute with a  intelligence a bad guy etc
the  games different each time for humor try talking to npcs when your  intelligence is 
i just really like this gamei think the late s were a golden age for the computer gamer
i remember i could walk into the local computercity or bestbuy and browse rows and rows full of video games
compare that now to maybe one row or less
sigh the good ole daysone of the great relics of this golden age is fallout
fallout is a roleplaying game that takes place  years or so after a nuclear war engulfed the earth
the adventurers mission starts off trying to save a group of humans that survived the devastation by taking refuge in a vault
their water purification system has failed and a replacement chip must be found
so you wander the wastes in search of this chip and find what is left of humanitythe gameplay itself is spectacular
there are many ways to solve the quests in the game and violence is not a prerequisite
a lot of how you play the game is determined by how you build your character at the beginning
you could gear your character towards a warrior a thief a negotiator or even a scientist based on about  or so skills and traits
as the game progresses your character improves on those skills and gets perks along the way
because every quest and encounter is dependent on your skills outcomes can differ and so the replay value is extraordinaryone of the things i love about this game is that it is geared toward adults
it can be as violent and bloody as you want depending on what preferences you set when you begin the game
some of the language is also coarse and that too can be controled by the preferences you set
that said it should be noted that even though in its day it was considered edgey it does not come close to the graphic nature of say gta so things should be kept in perspectiveone last thing if you can still get hold of it the manual is absolutely awesome
it is spiral bound beautifully illustrated and actually tells you what you need to know
this was another feature of the games that came out in the golden age the manuals were complete and they would tell you most if not everything you need to know to play the game
nowadayswell dont get me startedif you still have this game lucky you
if you do not have this game and are a big fan of crpg games i highly recommend this classic treasure from interplaypsmy only regret is i did not keep the beautiful box it came inone of the best rpgs out there it doesnt play like adampd games but has it own original gameplay
its incrediably fun with a wonderfully realized setting and world
fallout  is more fun but this game is still greateighty years after ww the landscape is still recovering from the nuclear blasts that rocked the world
few people survived among them those of your home vault  one of a series of underground sanctuaries that were built in preparation for the nuclear devastation
but theres a problem
your vaults water chip is dying and with its demise the people of the vault cannot survive
your task is to head to the postapocalyptic surface and find another water chipthats fallout in a nutshell
your task is to essentially rescue your vaults populace from dying
theres a particular kind of gratification that comes from exploring california in such a setting like visiting someplace you know but dont know at the same time
theres vagrants raiders innocent farmers and a slew of mutated baddies waiting for you to just stumble across them
from the word quotgoquot you can supercustomize your character to reflect your own ideology from being a super sharpshooting badboy to a sweet talker able to work your way around and through problems just by conversing
you can have a super powerful character who has the iq of a cinderblock or an agile character that can deftly pickpocket potential opponents while at the same time unable to take too many hits in combat
the flexibility is unlike anything ive ever seen in an rpg including baldurs gatea good plot and rock solid design are good enough but interplay didnt stop there
the style of the game itself is a triumph of game design and ideas using s paraphenalia as a major source of inspiration case in point the ingame illustrations and graphics are heavily drawn from s america at its peak
the only thing missing is eisenhowerdepending on what quottraitsquot you pick up at the beginning these are initial characteristics for your character that usually give something really good with a major tradeoff like quotfast shotquot which will let you shoot weapons faster at the loss of aiming ability
quotgiftedquot gives you a bunch of extra stats at the loss of skill abilities etc every  levels you get a perk a permanent asset to your character
with choices ranging from quotsharpshooterquot which makes it easier to hit stuff at a distance to quotnight visionquot making it much easier to kill things at night to quotmutatequot which lets you transform ala the incredible hulk into a powerful beast in the thick of combatwell the possibilities for customizing your character are almost endlessthe plot progresses over the course of the game from simply finding a water chip to saving mankind as you know it
something wants to take over the wastes and ultimately its up to you to stop it
you can pick up npcs along the way using dialogue or techniques to lure them into your group which helps in the long run but sometimes feels like a hindrance
quotdangit tycho get out of the wayquotthe first time you hold a turbocharged plasma rifle in your hands is a memorable event considering you started out at level  with a knife
likewise the first time you don brotherhood of steel power armor you think back to the humble origins of your simple vault suit
and after customizing your character to death with the perks and skill enhancements of your choice it really dawns on you what a true rpg this game is and how well it really does work on the average personthe most unbelievable thing of all is that they followed this game up with an even better sequel
interplay definately had thier act together with this game the perfect representation of its genre
and nary an elf or dragon awaits you
an amazing game with even more amazing replayability and unequalled depth and storytelling and a healthy dose of addictiona perfect gamelucky me i happened to stumble into some little sofware store when i did  and trip on fallout more than likely one of the best platformrpg games  ever madefollowing closely in the footsteps of an ancient game by  electronic arts known as wasteland this postapocalyptic earth rpg unveils  a gritty and all too possible future for mankind
you play a young manor  woman if you so choose which by the way is a nice change when you consider  that the game does not play the same with the different sexes who is sent  on a quest to save his vault fallout shelter from deathcharacter  creation is not only detailed and involving but just plain hilarious with  the vault tech mascot illustrating each and every aspect of your character  sheet
youll soon get caughtup in forming the character you invision and  horde or spend those points to shape your destinycombat is clean and  turnbased
using action points that are in direct reflection of your  character design
not only that but the inclusion of a specific targeting  system adds to the complexity of your tacticsthe bad news is you can  meet and enlist the help of npcs in the game but other that what weapons  you pass them you have no control over their defense or technique
other  than this flaw though the game is greata rich and detailed story  great voice acting outstanding sense of humor with fun and graphic combat  scenes makes this a winner
black isle is at it againwoahthis game is crazy fun
i dont know how to explain it but once you get the power amour and minigun it gets pretty awesome
ok now lets talk about the gameafter you make your guy the first thing youll notice is that your caracter walks really slow
you can go to the preferences menu and make your caracter go faster as well as cencor voilence and language and change the diffuilty of the game
attacking is simple
you pick how you want to attack then click on a guy to attack
but you have action points and each command uses a number of action points
along with killing things you can go on quests get party members whitch suck dont get them
save people and join the brotherhood
its pretty awesomerpgs were never really my thing
sure i had played a few of the medeival games but i never had anything beyond a mild interest in them
thenfallout
fallout is the first to give me the rpg fever
even if you are a fan of shooters give this one a tryid seen fallout on the shelves ages ago but at that time i was still pretty entrenched in the swordwielding dragonslaying quasimedieval fantasies that abound in this genre and the postapocalyptic concept didnt  intrigue me
i only play rpgs and refuse to pay megabucks for brand new  titles so years later my search for something to fill the gap left by  solving baldurs gatetsc finally led me the bargain table at my local  games store where in desperation i picked up the nicely priced fallout   boxed as a quotgamers collectionquot
knowing that sequels also  usually stand alone and fascinated by the blurb on the box i handed over  my bucks
on navigating through the double layer of shrink wrap i found  quotgamers collectionquot meant i had also purchased the original  fallout
so now fallout  is waiting patiently for my character to find  the water chip im addictedwhen world war iii broke out  years  previously your family sought refuge in the the nuclear fallout shelter  known as vault  eventually the chip used to produce fresh water fails  leaving only  days supply
your character draws the short straw and  with extremely limited resources and experience is sent out into the  radiationsoaked mutant infested world to find a replacementalthough  fallout is far from perfect most flaws are compensated for by the great  gameplay
however the game looses a star from me in that you have very  little control over npcs in your party
why give us party members if we  cant control them
ian and tycho are great for carrying things they seem  to have endless capacities  great for trading and in the early part ian  saves your butt since hes more skilled than your character but in battle  they seem to do nothing but get in your way
you spend far too many aps  just getting out of their way or positioning yourself so that your  submachine guns burst doesnt take them and dogmeat out too
save  often so you can restore after youve accidently killed your party
you  cannot get them to wear better armour and their idea of their quotbest  weaponquot may not match yours
i understand this has been changed in  fallout 
half a star is gained back for the excellent spiral bound  quotvault dwellers survival guidequot
ive broken the backs of other  manuals because the damned things wont stay open but the spiral binding  solves that problem
i havent tried any of the survival recipes  thoughthe other half star is gained back for the excellent s  quotreds under the bedquot style of the interface and the manual the  wonderful introduction movie and the voice cast
this is the first rpg  where i have actually heard of some of the actors credited in the voice  cast richard dean anderson tony shalub ron perlman richard moll ken  mars
its quite strange hearing mcgyvers voice in junktownanyway  stop reading this right now buy fallout and start playing immediatelyit is one of the few old games that i still play
story line is incredibly good the setting of the post nuclear war of drugs radiation adrenaline and max
pessimism of the postnuclear world is incredible
you will be a vault dweller while playing the game unifying with the character you created
i like fallouts graphic engine still today isometric and nice graphics
the only problem is the saving times but it wont cause that much trouble
if they release a fallout  with the same sounds and graphics but with a better story line i still buy it and rate it   one of the few rpgs of the past that we literally felt free to do anything
play it finish it and buy the fallout  alsothis is the best of the best
the story in this crpg is so good that youll be glued to the screen for months to come
youll the role as the  wanderer the sets out to save the vault you have grown up in
the rd world  war has just ended and nothing is like it was before
looking for the  water chip takes you to a lot of different places and you meet a lot a  peoplethis is a good as a post apolalyptic cprg getswhile the ps version is a little easier to play and english subtitles can be annoying to read all the time when youre dealing with an original classic who cares
you can easily get used to the controls the graphics lag in no way whatsoever it came in the original case
did i mention the game is original
its a greta beginners item to the franschise and truly showboats how impressive the sega dreamcast isa lot of people say soul caliber is the game to have for the dreamcast
there is some truth to that but if were talking best fighting game this would easily draw soul caliber any day
the amazing graphics speed of the gameplay gorgeous backgrounds and scenery soul cal has a tough time outperforming this onefor one thing i really dont like comparing these two games because they are very different so lets not mix up our apples and oranges
the fighting system is much more complex but you can pick it up with some practice
also instead of having a huge series of special moves you mostly use combos through out the game
there are also a multitude of martial arts that are displayed and they are real fighting styles
i also love how crisp the animation is and there is very little lag time
what also gives this game a huge bonus besides the hot boobs and fine booties of the female characters there are a lot of different modes to select
there is your usual story vs mode team battle and survival soul caliber has both very similar modes too there is time attack which is like story just without the movie clips which by the way are one of the high points of the game in graphic design
there are a few short comings but they are very minorthe game could be a bit longer in story mode and it would be awesome if you could use the last boss after you defeated him he was an awesome creature
also survival mode is tough maybe if they just made it a tad bit easier maybe
also a couple more characters would be cool too
honestly though this game doesnt have any real huge shortcomings its an excellent game overrall and i would recommend it to anybody
its a great game to have during a house party when your passing around the beer and just having a good time
i also like the huge selection of fine lookin video vixens
way better than some other video hoes cough cough tomb cough raider
if you got a dreamcast you gotta give this one a runthis is my favorite game on the dreamcast
it has the best graphics that i have seen from any fighting game
the control is excellent
the characters moves are spectacular and easy to learn
the stages are interactive and amazing especially when you can knock somebody of a cliff on one stage and wind up at another
tag battle is unique something that you do not see in most other fighting games
if this game was as sophisticated as soul calibur then it would have been the best game by far that i have ever played
this includes arcade and home gamesokay ill admit it
i bought this game primarily because i heard it has jubbling breasts the term used by the developer during promotion and i love unique games
but after having played it i gotta say this is one fantastic fighting game
it even has countermoves something i have not seen before
fluid movement awesome sound effects and multitiered levels dont hurt either
the women in the game are barnone the most beautiful i have ever seen in any game
so yes the sex appeal is a big part of this but even if that part was removed the game would stand on its own with no problem
also the jubbling can be turned up if you so desire
but even then it is not overdone
they did use some taste when designing this
a fine colorful easy to learn but hard to master game that is destined to be a classic
get it while you cani loved the original dead or alive for playstation and the first time i laid my eyes on dead or alive  for the dreamcast i was drooling
the game is that damn good
the graphics are fantastic the characters look so real and they are rendered beautifully by the dcs awesome graphic processing power even the bouncing breasts look more impressive
the game itself is one in a million the moves are easy to execute and there are a lot of extras that will keep you busy for a long time
this is the second best fighting game on dc the best is soul calibur i recommend getting both of them theyre worth buying a dreamcast on their owni have played this game to death and i am still finding new counter moves throws and attacks and im still having a blast
i completely disagree with anyone who says this gets old after hours of game play
wrong
this game is only toped by soul caliber amazing there are no extras to doa but that shouldnt stop you from enjoying this awesome game
the countering system of the game is so cool although sometimes frustrating if your on the receiving end
it takes practice and sheer skill to truly master any of the characters and by doing so youll get even more enjoyment by kicking your friends 
this is an essential game for the sega dreamcast that no owner should be withouti wont go into all the great stuff in this game i think all the other reviews touch on various parts of the game that make it unique and superb
however if you are playing solo there is only so much you can do story mode lasts  minutes thats if you have a bad day and you can go through with every character in an hour or two
the sparring area gets really old really fast once you know most of the moves and virtually the only part of the game that is of any difficulty solo is the survivor mode which i have yet to complete
everything else is basically simple quick run through and your donebut buy this game if you have friends
smile  remember its the best multiplayer fighter on the marketdoa is simply the greatest fighting game on the dreamcast
i was bought it for christmas and i thought that it would just be like all of the other fighting games about at the moment but it rises above the rest
the graphics are amazing there is a good selection of characters the arenas are well designed and the vs mode adds loads of life to the game
this is an essential purchasei not much of a reviewer so i am only going to say is that this is a worthy follow up to the first one
i have to say i liked the first one because of the appeal by the women and in this one its even more unbelivableill leave it to your own imagination
the graphics will blow you away and every character has a cool story that follow up your gameplay
loads of fun
if they could only use weapons in the next one
cool thing is that this sequel is more fairer than the original
in the orignal  quick blows could seal the fate of your opponent in this one at least  counters is needed to put you away
just take my advice and get this gamethis is a good way to get into ninja gaidenninja gaiden sigma  just came out
its brilliantnow we are waiting eagerly for ng ive owned this game since it came out i had freespace but i just havent reviewed it until now
shame on me
this is quite possibly the best game ive ever played and i dont even like space shooters that much
this game is graphically amazing its challenging the ai is great there are lots of cool weapons and enemies there is a good plot i can play it well with my crappy joystick the controls are incredibly simple like something out of a freespace  for dummies book and there are lots of cool dogfights and explosions
if you dont have this game buy it
i urge you
if you would consider this game enough to look at this page buy the game
you wont be sorrynothing out there comes close to what freespace  did
this game was and still is the best sci fi space sim
its a shame that there was not a part   this game was and still is epicwhat else can you do for a game that has garnered as many awards as freespace  has
why add new missions of course
the result is freespace  scifi sim of the year edition a product which includes  extra  missions as well as some highres artwork and wallpaper not included on the  original cds
the missions have been crafted by users and are approved by  volition and interplayfirst the specs freespace  requires at least a  pentium mhz processor and mb of ram with a mb d video card
ideally youll want to run the game on a pentium ii mhz or faster  processor with an mb or higher video card and  or more megs of memory
because the game has a x screen resolution option the maximum  install is about gb of hard drive space
but its worth it all of it
freespace  is the ultimate representation of what any computer game should  be
from the opening cutscene which chronicles the battle of deneb from  the previous game to the first battle in which a cruiser destroys another  with an iridiscent energy beam  the game unfolds in magnificent fashion
the plot is set  years after the first game and casts you as a pilot  flying sorties and missions against a rogue faction of terrans called the  new terran front ntf
the implacable shivans make a return from the  previous game with new ships and weapons of mass destruction
battles  range from the cold void of space to the miasmic shadows of ubiquitous  nebulaegraphics are handled by a game engine that requires a d  accelerator card supported chipsets include the dfx voodoo family  nvidias tnt and geforce offerings atis rage pro and matroxs g and  g
directd and glide are also supported as are eax for creative labs  soundblaster live
sound cards and ad for aureals vortex audio chipsets
force feedback deepens the level of immersion with wristrattling effects  that will make you swear your den or whichever room your pcs in is a  cosmic battlegroundfreespace  scifi sim of the year edition is the  culmination of excellent gaming
the music graphics and missions will  have you in awe for hours on end
get this game and experience it todaythe first freespace is one of the best spaceflight sims ever created freespace  is better
the awards are well deserved
the graphics are beyond topnotch and the gameplay is spectacular
buy this gamefreespace  is an amazing game  but take note it was released into the public domain on april   when volition released the source code to the public as a noncommercial license
the engine is now the basis for the also free battlestar galactica based game beyond the red line
if you are a collector youre gonna pay a stiff price for that box
if you are a player the game is available for gratisfreespace  is in a nutshell a freespace  with all its faults fixed
if you dont like flight sims you wont like freespace
but if youve ever enjoyed xwing ace combat wing commander or anything to do with fighter planes this is for youfreespace  starts off several years after descent freespace
over the years technology has improved and volition accurately shows that
the gtva fleet is made up of new fighters though the best of the last gen fighters are still being used
though they too are being phased outvolition does a great job of showing the traits of the different factions
the ntf uses older fighter designs and generally does massed attacks
ntf pilots seem to be more aggressive than gtva counterparts
terran fighters continue to be more allpurpose and their mission styles reflect that
the vasudans however have more single purpose ships normally having lighter armor and increased speed over terran shipsone other enhancement is the beam canons and flack guns on capital ships
no longer are they just gunboats with a tendency to miss
the huge lucifer like beam canons look and feel powerful and great
its fun to just sit and watch a duel of destroyers flack canons are also a welcome addition
theyre pretty much anti fighter canons and theyre deadly in this aspect
they can take down flights of bombers with ease and they also shoot down incoming bombs
these make destroyers rightfully feared of and the huge battles look majestic overall
it reminds of star wars battles and it never disappointsthe campaign itself is wonderful with branching missions and a great plot which leaves you wondering about the end of the conflict until the conclusion
there are now some new optional missions too and these grant you elite materials for use later in the game
there is also a more difficult extra campaign called templar which shows the destruction of the hammer of lightwhats also included is an enhanced fred editor so you now truly have a great mission editor
the instructions are fairly easy to understand so its possible to make great single player or multi player missions or even campaignsthis is my favorite flight sims of all time and it rightfully deserves its flight sim of the yearthis is one of the best games to come out in the last couple of years
im  not sure that i would say that the extra missions included in the sf sim  of the year edition make it worth paying the ten extra bucks so you might  want to point yourself in the direction of the standard edition if youre  pinching pennies this weekthis is a space sim duh so you want to  have a joystick or a gamepad unless youre into punishing yourself
im of  the understanding that a lot of people avoid or are disappointed in games  that are built around a joystick which is too bad
this game deserves  wider sales than it has had because its the spaceflight equivalent of  halflife or starcraftsystem requirements are also fairly heavy
it can  be played in x or x older voodoo owners take note no  x at bit color and at  in  there still is no game to date  that looks better
but youve got to be prepared to throw some hardware at  it
i get fairly decent framerates on my celeron  with tnt ultra but  its the kind of game that makes you want to buy a whole new system just  for better play
if you want consistent fps and beyond think bigger  cpuenough with the technical details
this is a work of art
as gamers  we live for those jawdropping moments when you see something that youve  never seen before that astonishes you with sheer visual impact and wonder  followed by a rush of adrenaline as you try to survive whats being thrown  at you
the first time you see a huge beam of alien energy scream by your  puny fighter and start carving up an allied capital ship like a roast  youll have one of those moments
this is as people have noted the  closest thing so far to having a movielike experience in front of your  computer and then somethis is a great game the storyline is great  the voice acting is tops the graphics are eyepopping the gameplay is  whiteknucked the interface is fantastic
its the new standard for the  genre
the only thing i can think of thats a crying shame is that not  enough people brought it to a cash register for there to be a true  expansion pack
if theres a freespace  it wont be for a couple of  yearsbut im sure that when it does arrive youll be sorry you werent  following alongi just got this game from a friend who just happened to not want it anymore and let me tell youi am having fun
pretty good story and acting is not bad graphics are still on par
i remember the wing comander games and by far this blows those away
if you cant afford the  dollars like who canget it if you can this is a great gamereview system  p m ram riva tntsweet mother of god
just thinking about this game gives me goosebumps bringing me back to long sleepless nights spent in the eerie confines of a nebula told that something is out there but silently knowing you wont see it until its too late then something appears out of the shadowsfreespace  is without a doubt the best space combat sim i have ever played  blowing away its contemporaries xwing alliance independence war starlancer and tachyon the fringe
graphics wise unmatched
its like playing a  million movie
huge explosions screen filling shockwaves and incredibly detailed and bump mapped ships
sound  excellent
atmospheric music good voice acting and perfect sounds for weapons engines and more
value  great
a long campaign and good multiplayer options will keep you playing for a long timebut you say starlancer had great graphics
tachyon had great sound
xwing had great valuewhere freespace  really excels is atmosphere
i remember the first time i went up against a capital ship
all other space sims had taught me to believe cap ships were big sluggish tugs useless in a fight and just waiting for me to light em up with a few well placed torpedoes
heck even the first freespace didnt do much to shake this beliefso towards the ship i went in my bomber thinking this would be a cakewalk
i saw the normal ineffective and poorly aimed lasers flash towards my squadron
smirking i armed my torpedoes and fired a volley
as they streaked towards the bridge of the enemy corvette i saw strange looking flashes surround the torpedoes then they exploded  feet away from the target
hmm i thought
better get closer inmy ship began rocking as flak from the corvette filled the space around me
this isnt right at all
i thought
this shouldnt be happening
i fired two more torpedoes and they exploded a second later flipping my ship around from the force of the blast
then i heard a noise
a kind of poweringup noise
i faced the corvette and i saw a ball of energy growing on its nose
what the
and then my ship was cleaved in half by a huge pulsating beam of death
i replayed that mission with a new respect for my advisaryif things like that dont shake you up i guarantee you the nebula missions willespecially one when you go on a scouting mission with the gvd psamtik near the middle of the game
ill leave it up to you to discover whyin short buy this gamebuy it nowi had to get this game because i loved it when i was little i was so happy and surprised to find it on amazonits a great action gamethat needs to be playedshogomobile armor division was an fps game in a long time coming
i was surprised that with all the science fiction themed shooters on the market at the time that no one had done it before
i personally wanted to create a japanese themed mech modification mod for one of the existing games on the market at the time but a variety of factors prevented me from doing itthen my issue of pcgamer comes in the mail and i install the latest demos on my old pii may it rest in pieces under my staircase
im not really sure what to expect but i figure its got to be something relatively decent
i mean id played all the sprite raycaster fps games all their addons done quake and quake could or would shogo offer something differenti was hopeful
and my hopes were not dashed by the demo
the demo only made me want to play the game even more as all good demos do for their mothergames
as soon as the games release date hit i flew over to the games store to buy a copy
no luck
they hadnt stocked it yet
all the local computer and video game stores hadnt shelved the product
but one store did
one store that released dark forces ii jedi knight a day or two before it was scheduled for release had shogo on its shelves
sadly the virgin megastore off market street is no more but my copy of shogo that i purchased from them still remains in my ownershipfor a game that relied on d models it was way ahead of its time
the sound and graphics were remarkable
far superior to anything else on the market
sadly shogo didnt have the product name loyalty that the mechwarrior franchise did originally battleoids of scifi wargaming fame
having played mechwarrior and understanding their more realistic approach to a genre stemming from japanese cinema i cant say i was too pleased with the robot trucklike nature of the gameplayshogo on the other hand made the mech feel like an extension of your body like all good weapons and didnt pretend to be a simulation of what a mech would do in a real fight but gave us the hollywood version of the japanese kaijumech genre
you could jump run shoot and all kinds of other things in mech modeon foot its another story and youre more or less a quake marine only youve got a bit more story holding the interest of the playerif i had a complaint and i dont have many its that the single player game was exceedingly short
i loved this game more than either quakes and played it about as much as i played the thief games or dark forces ii jedi knightshogo puts you into an anime epic complete with complicated plot twists characters action and of course psuedosciencefictiony mechs
i mean wow
you fight other mechs you fight dudes on foot trying to bring you down you fight tanks apcs and a couple other baddies
and the graphics are again for the time superb
some of the models and textures still hold up to todays standards
note the clouds traversing the sky
truly stunning stuff for the time and though mildly dated still impressiveregrettably there was never a sequel as was promised at the end credits
how and why remains a bit of a mystery though perhaps high expectations for game sales shelves a shogo project indefinitely
i really dont knowsome short comings of the game the ai was respectable but not always the smartest
on the madness setting the ai was just trigger happy and you were zappedkilled almost instantly
the models for nearly everything but the people were extremely good and the textures for the time were fantastic
but it seemed like more effort went into some of those things than went into designing intriguing missions
and thats really my only complaint that the mission maps were on the small and basic side though thinking about it it may have been due to consumer hardware requirements at the timesome of the story is incomplete or not thoroughly explained and some of the adult humor misses a mark but should bring a smirk to the knowing face
the final boss at the mech side of the story is tough and the mech on the foot side of the story seems a bit one dimensional ie
hes either impossible to defeat or too easy to killotherwise its a first class game
turn off the gore setting for the young ones load up the patch and have a blasticewind dale is a phenomenal game if you leave your expectations at the doorit is not like baldurs gate or neverwinter nights which also arent very similar to one another either
ive seen this so many times between the three games  people expect them to be similar so when they play a new one they are extremely disappointed because they were expecting it to be like the previous game they playedbaldurs gate is character and dialogue driven
it is extremely nonlinear and allows you to wander around and do things at your own pace in whatever order you choose reasonablyneverwinter nights is focused on creating and managing only one main character and is a mix between linear and nonlinear
it has limitless custom content and roleplaying potentialicewind dale is very linear and is combat and strategy based
the battles here are far superior to the ones in bg or nwn
they are wellbalanced and always challenging
they require planning thinking strategizing and ample use of the pause button
its not an easy game but that is what makes it so much fun
of course its not friendly to newcomers which is one reason many people dislike it so quickly ie
they suck at itthe music in iwd is phenomenal and one of the best video game soundtracks
the sound effects and superb and the game is full of brilliant art level design and atmosphere
this is a game i keep coming back to over and over again because it has such high replay value and exciting combat
its very different each time based on difficulty and party compositionin iwd you can create your entire party not just the leader
you can create however you want it
one thing i cant stand about most dd players is thier constant insistance that one play a certain type of party
not so says i
i play in terms of the most interesting party rather than the one that will be most powerful
dont let others tell ya how to play
thats the fun of it
my paladin leads but in my next game a ranger will leadlow chr and all and there will be no paladin
despite creating my whole party i like to have my alterego lead
rangers and paladins are my favorite characters
paladins are better characters in bg but in iwd have no fighting advantages other than specilisation
rangers get double attacks
 at level  i have one evil mage in my paladin party just for some friction heh
bg is better with friction reviewing icewind dale is pointless as it is odviously the best game ive ever playedi first started playing dampd about  years ago as a  yearold in grade school
when i became quottoo coolquot to play i had forgotten about it for a while
recently a friend of mine and i were talking about  how great it would be to play again of course we have lives and jobs and  no time to get together  much less play dampd until  am
this  game brings all the great things about table and dice dampd together in  one really fun to play package
theres not a lot of puzzle solving or  errand running that has become the norm in pc dampd games
when we used  to play it was go into the dungeon grow your character find some goodies  kill a whole lot of baddies then go home
this is it
tons of cool  dungeons to explore lots of great effects and all of your characters are  needed to win  no one man parties herethe only thing missing is a  dragon to slay  but hey you cant have everything maybe iwdto  sum it up this is a lot of fun to play
it brings back all the great  elements of dampd you may remember without the need to get  guys  together a lot of coffee and a table in the basement so you wouldnt wake  mom amp dad
if you are a dampd fan who hasnt picked up a monster  manual in a long time like me you will love this game
prepare to go to  work with bags under your eyesive always been a gamer but i was never an avid gamer until icewind dale came along
the game sucked me in and wouldnt spit me out until i had finished it
the game brilliantly allows you to create not just one hero but a party of heroic companions from scratch
there arent any generic diablo characters here either  you dont just pick a premade warrior sorcerer or rogue and begin hacking away mindlessly at your foes
you get to fine tune so many aspects of your characters that just creating a party can take hours and its bloody good fun
despite the battleoriented gameplay which requires considerably more strategy and brainpower than anything in diablo this game is a pure rpg all the way
my only complaint aside from the game actually ending eventually is that the game design is somewhat linear
all the same the game is masterful at hiding this fact and indeed this element keeps the story strong
icewind dale is a brilliant game
periodi actually purchased icewind dale after i bought bg and in my opinion bg was not that much better
icewind dale definetly has the best sound out of any game ever made
the graphics are a little sketchy but still beautiful to watch and admire
the gameplay is a lot more linear than bg but i actually like the linear parts of bg more than the wide open areas so that was definetly one of the aspects i loved about this game that some people hated
because this game is based on the nd addition adampd rules the gameplay is fast and gracefully complex
im sorry if i compared icewind dale to bg to much in this review but there is just so many similarities between the two
overall icewind dale is an amazing game that supplies many hours of fast and furious rpg actionhello i just wanted to say that i havent found a computer like the one in years  one that i make time in my busy to schedule to play that i play all the time that i think about when im not playing its wonderful
its the kind of adampd i really love  not having to bother with some authors notion of a good plot its as minsc would say quotswords not wordsquot this game is an excellent choice if youre favorite place to strategize is on the battlefield
youll fight so many satisfying battles and have many chances to test out next tactics  its an adampd generals dream
dont miss it its like eye of the beholder with soupedup graphics and so much more depthicewind dale has to be one of the best computer rpg games of all time
it has everything one looks for in such a game from an incredible setting to a highly original plot to excellent multiple roleplaying options to outstanding graphics to extraordinary accuracy in relation to dungeons  dragons and much much morethere is something here for everyone as the variety of challenges is large indeed including battles puzzle solving and dialogue among othersthe game is set on toril and specifically in faerun
it deals with a great evil that has arisen and descended upon the region bringing the people misery and despairthe story as a whole is excellent
the plot is so incredibly well written and presented that the gamer feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters seeing what they see feeling what they feel sensing what they sense
moreover the game does a great job of presenting the distinct cultures and civilizations of the inhabitantspeoples of fearun and icewind dale in particular
this has without a doubt been achieved as a result of a great deal of research that has gone into learning and understanding the numerous and often complex characteristics of the forgotten realms worldstrongly recommended along with the baldurs gate series and planescape tormenttrust me you will not regret itwhat a great serieslove them all i am hooked an i never play gamesso grab these up maybe old but great intrigue an graphicsblack isle first made planescape torment which was a plot driven game without any focus on combat
now they made icewind dale which is the exact oppositethe plot in this game is thin just an excuse to go through massive dungeons killing hordes of monsters and findings tons of goodies
whereas in pst combat was just there to drive the plotthis game is one of the best in character creation fun second only to baldurs gate  but in this game you can create six characters of your own without losing out on npc interaction
in bg  you had the option of getting prefabricated npcs to join you who had personality and charm
there was guilt if you made your own six characters
in iwd no such dilemma exists so one is free to make whatever sort of party that suits ones playing styleanother bonus is the nice atmosphere
jeremy soules music is beautiful and the artwork from black isle is greatall in all excellent infinity engine game
buy it nowtheres no other way to describe this rpg
it is excellent in nearly every  way
the graphics are breathtaking the music is inspiring and the plot is  great
as for the length of the game it will take you at least as long to  finish as baldurs gate but instead of wandering about endless wilderness  youll be seeing things that are a lot more interesting
you get far more  experience than in bg as well which means faster leveling up which you  will need
the monsters are detailed and include some of the biggest and  toughest adampd entities
spells have been expanded to the th level  with a few findable scrolls of th and th level spells
all of the spells  have been redone from bgs rather repetitive graphics making spellcasting  a great deal of fun even though most of it is similar
the thing that  surprised me most of all was the multiplay
baldurs gate was notorious for  crashing and massive lag problems when played on a slow connection but  this game runs as if youre playing by yourself when youre using a k  modem
load times ever a pain in bg have been reduced drastically
im  rather astonished that they managed to fit all this onto only  cds
on  that note you only need one cd to play so no more swapping either
my  only complaint is that the game resolution is stuck at the old x  supposedly because x is reserved for bg
at any rate get this game
you will not regret itsome games are just unlucky enough to slip under the radar for no plausible reason
irrespective of quality originality creativity and enjoyability sadly not all things get their just recognition
there is no rhyme or logic as to why mdk went by so unnoticed
if quality and recognition were measured it would have sold by the truckloads but it didnt and today it remains one of the most obscure stellar games out therewhat is mdk but the sequel to the eccentric thirdperson actionadventure game mdk where you took control of reluctant hero kurt hectic in his coil suit and battled humorously incompetent aliens
mdk starts a mere moments after the first game concluded
many have wondered what exactly mdk stands for
murder death kill is the most popular one but i think a more plausible answer is max doctor and kurt the three protagonists of mdk living onboard the spaceship jim dandy orbiting earth
a new alien threat is rearing its head and kurt sets out to stop it in his characteristic coil suit created by doctor fluke hawkins
hawkinss creation the android sixlegged dog max finds himself also dealing with the threat of the aliens as hawkins sends him to disable their ship
if it sounds crazy and hilarious its because it is and the game reminds you all the time
this is as funny a game as it is exciting and involvingeven today  years on mdk is one beautifullycrafted game and is crafted in such a way that framerate usually isnt a problem
the environments that our heroes battle through are frankly out of this world
the alien world with its ships and even cities are vast brilliantly eccentric and just outright beautiful
the creativity and vision that went into this title is superapparent everywhere you look from the spaceships to the alien world swizzle firma
the character animations are beautiful as well fitting the excellent characters that kirk max and doctor hawkins are
then we have the charismatic alien schwang schwing
there is atmosphere everywhere with occasional vast and open areas with not many enemy threats
one particular room sees max jumping from platform to platform while the enemy aliens actually cheer him on from hovering bleachers
the aliens are both despicable and hysterically funny dancing whenever they can get away with it to name just one hilarious example
they respawn from melting pots that our characters often must find in order to stop them from comingmdk doesnt have a plethora of levels but it ensures that it stays fresh by dividing the game between our three heroes
each character has about three levels to himself and the play style for each character is completely different
kurts levels are fast and fluent relying more on puzzles and manouvering than firepower
he does have firepower though and lots of it with an unlimited useful rapid fire gun as well as super guns he can pick up but which deplete as well as bouncing bombs which often play a hand in solving puzzles
a new addition that will encompass the majority of kurts challenges is the sniper rifle
there are glowing spheres of energy at strategic points all over kurts adventure and they can only be activated or deactivated depending on the case by firing them with the sniper rifle
the catch is that these spheres show up in consistently trickier situations
they might be moving around
they might be encompassed by a barrier that cannot be blown away
sometimes you have to activate another sphere first
this is a very clever concept that will often leave you scratching your head because the game designers have gone to every length to make kurts puzzles obscure if not downright dangerous
the sniper rifle has another use as some enemies can only be killed with the firstperson weapon as well
i scarcely need to say that its quite nerveracking having to switch to first person and aim when an enemy is running toward you yelling blue murder
kurt moves very slickly though and his coil parachute is often instrumental in getting from place to place
experimenting with how far he can float through the air with it will be vitalif kurts levels are a more of a continuation of the first game then maxs levels are a whole new jolt of fresh energy
max is a gunloving cigar chomping robotic canine
if kurt chooses skill and stealth max chooses crashing into problems deadon with guns ablazin
maxs levels are decidedly more full of action than kurts are
having four arms means that max is enable to activate four weapons at one time
he has an unlimited pistol thats pretty weak and that youll probably not use that much
there are loads and i do mean loads of other weapons for max to pick up though from uzis to gattling guns and even the odd rocket launcher
the uzis and gattling guns are decidedly the most useful and fun
max can have four weapons activated at a time but he can carry up to ten
you thus have to be conscious of activating and deactivating your weapons of choice
of all the levels in the game maxs levels are my favourites
blasting his way through hordes of daft aliens is indescribably fun
max does more than just fire guns though he often encounters some devious challenges
a couple of instances include the strategic use of a jetpack
there are two kinds of jetpacks one has to be recharged at strategic points while another fills up while max isnt airborne
both these properties of the jetpack have to be taken into account
the atomic jetpack challenges constitute some of my favourite moments in this game
there are even some puzzles worthy of kurtcompleting the trifecta of gameplay styles are the levels of dr fluke hawkins
his adventures are a stark departure from the atmospheres of the other two heroes
if they were more action oriented hawkins is all about puzzles
he can hold up to eight items four in each hand meaning that he has two inventories but he can only have activated per hand
using all sorts of ordinary items that he comes across he can combine items into extremely useful tools like a ladder i wont tell you which two items he uses to create it its just too crazy
hawkins also has to deal with enemies though albeit not in the same reign as kurt and max
his weapon of choice is hilarious
hawkins has to be careful because his hit points are quite fewer than kurt or max who can take double the damage that kurt can
on the other hand hes the only one out of the three who can store energy supplies in his inventory
hawkinss puzzle challenges are devious and often quite intense
one particular level sees hawkins basically do nothing but defuse bombs by stepping on glowing buttons in a particular order all within strict time limits
i have to berate one insufferable puzzle though which sees you controlling a fish swimming through a maze looking for a particular switch to press all the while trying to avoid bigger fish
i mostly find the button by complete random and its probably the games one dud momentas you might gather from the aforementioned mdk very cleverly and delicately balances puzzle with action
to this end the control system is excellent and is completely the same for every character asides from the odd inventory buttons
you use the mouse to turn in your desired direction as well as to fire and to jump
with the keyboard you run and select andor use the items you find
you can adjust the mouse sensitivity in the options menu
mdk thus feels as slick to play as to look at it
there are  save slots for you to save your progress calling them anything you wish as well as a quick save you can activate at any time but it overrwrites itself every time you press the quick save button
and if you like me like having access to the ingame movies youve reached the menu screen gives you access to all movies you have reached on your current play
there are even five difficulty levels to choose from from easy right up to jinkiespart of what helps mdk feels so atmospheric and exciting is the whole audio aspect of it
the sound effects are excellent
the aliens have funny nonsensical grunts
max barks as he jumps and growls when he gets hit
the voice acting is excellent and the characters work wonderfully together
the whole soundtrack is then phenomenal
all three characters have different music painting their adventures with kurts more orchestrated and maxs more technodriven hawkinss eccentric and understated
maxs music composed by jesper kyd is exciting and beautiful beyond words
kurts music is brisk and often quite ominous the full orchestra helping it feel epic
the boss battle tune shared by kurt and max is then amazing and makes every boss battle feel like everything is at stake
there are even the odd atmospheric pieces that reflect the environment itself no music but eerie and howling sounds that help flesh out the vastness and weirdness of spaceabout the only dark spot i can give the game apart from the aforementioned atrocious fishmaze is the fact that the game ends on a rather dull note
the final boss battle actually feels really impossible to beat but the ending is rather disappointingly brief apart from the comic book layout of each characters actions after the adventure this is the way the game starts as well
pretty feeble spots reallymdk is one tough game
one particularly harrowing challenge sees kurt forced to snipe at glowing spheres that are out of reach for anything other than bouncing sniper bullets
then every level culminates in a boss fight well apart from hawkinss last level and these will keep you on your toes
not only that but each and every one involves a different strategy
kurts first boss is all about the sniper rifle but then his next boss fight includes no glowing spheres at all
one of my favourite boss fights involves max fighting another robotic dog
this robotic dog is clever as he can steal maxs energy supplies which respawn endlessly in a certain location
thus unless you stop him from getting to them hes unbeatable
quite nerverackingverdict all in all mdk is one brilliant game overflowing with creativity atmosphere character and challenge
i still cant work out why it wasnt the big hit that it deserved to be
it seems like of the thirdperson genre only the tomb raider series managed to build a real following
its a real shame but mdk is still out there for you to play should you be fortunate enough to get your hands on it
it is one of the proudest achievements of one of gamings most underexplored genresthe first mdk introduced three innovations the sniper view the thirdperson shooter and shinys gorgeous and imaginative alien cathederallike spaces
today the first two are relatively common but the  last still stands out as a memorable style in a crowded genre
now mdks  back and this unique world is taken to even more breathtaking levelsthe  gameplay for the main character kurt is much as in the first shooting  jumping sniping and sneaking
but two more characters from the first  mdka robot dog and a scientistare back as playable roles with very  different gameplay characteristics
the main job of the scientist is to try  combinations of weapons that may be even more powerful while the dogs  four arms dont ask make it virtual tank on legsas usual its fun  and sometimes even silly a great change from shooters such as quake that  take themselves unbearably seriously
but for me the best part is that it  just looks so fantastic
sometimes after killing all the baddies i just  romp around the massive spaces feasting my eyes on the arching alien  curves luminescint textures and lighting and layers of smokey  transparencies
if youre sick of corridors and dungeons the lofty heights  and wideopen spaces of mdk are welcome relief
my only gripe the weapons  are pretty much unchanged from the original and theres no rocket  launcherthis is a very good game
it is not like comand and conquer
it takes a bit more skill than that
you cant just get some dough and mobizle nothing against the command and conquer seirse i love the games  you must  keep you people happy trade and mine
this is a hard game and it takes  time to play though does not have the addicting touch of the civilization  seirse witch is a good thing because i tired of finding out it is three  hours later than i thought it wasthis is a good game and highly  recommendi love this game
if you played this back in the day you know what im talking about
ive spent countless hours playing this game and have built remarkable cities on the game itself
i highly recommend this gameim giving this game such a good rating because i have played  ad this game is sooo much better
my favorite thing in the game was the map and mission creator
dont buy  ad but buy  adunreal gold is a packaged version of both the original unreal and its expansion
for its price it is a great value
and its even better if you do not play multiplayer games cause the other released version totally unreal features unreal gold and unreal tournament which is a wonderful multiplayer game
if you do not play multiplayer games then buy this gold edition
if you do spend the extra money and get totally unreal
or even better yet get unreal tournament  unreal  and totally unreal for the most unreal experience everunreal was originally released to be a doom killer back in dooms prime time but the entire project was screwed up so it ended up getting released in   the graphics of unreal were unsurpassed at the time
no one could match it
although today it can be matched  was the time of starcraft so from there you can get a view on how much superior it was than back ago
graphics the sound in the beginning of the game is pretty good
although it is a bit scary at first when you hear bloodcurdling screams while you try to escape from a prison ship and when you are about to get off you see a heart fly out of a door way it is all covered by excellent sound
the music is also pretty good
not excellent but still good enough
sound in unreal you have to read a lot of text
you get a translator in the beginning and from then you read a lot of text to reveal that you are on na pali and the skaarj empire has taken over
story unreal is fun kinda gory but overall a grat experience if you have not played it before
be sure to get unreal tournament  and unreal  for the pc and unreal championship for the xbox for an unreal experience
enjoyi picked up unreal gold recently for  dollars at a local computer store
upon loading the game and firing it up i was totally devastated by its graphics and gameplay
in short this game is phat
unreal gold is the retail package that contains the full version of unreal and its mission pack
for a mere  dollars you get one of the best gaming experiences to ever grace the pc
the latest version is patched to b so stability is not an issue
the game is coded to run accelerated on glide or directd
im running the game on a pentium iii mhz processor with mb of ram and a mb geforce ultra video card with antialiasing enabled
naturally the game runs smoothly even with bit color selected and a screen resolution of xwhich brings me to the system requirements youll want to have at least a pentium ii class processor and mb of ram available
the game will run lesser machines  but i recommend a d graphics card in those cases to handle the video choresbasically unreal puts you in the roll of a prisoner whose crash landed on a world run by reptilian creatures called the skaarj
your goal is survival you run around in one of the most beautiful game engines on the planet and take out the enemyunreal has to be seen to be believed
the graphics and gameplay are excellent and anyone whose interested in firstperson shooters needs to have this in their collection
believe me your collection is not complete without itwondrous is the word that best describes unreal
showcasing the best stperson engine of its kind and graphics that totally blew away anything of its timeunreal stands as a monoment to what the pc can donever before have i played a game with such an immersing storyline without a single word being spoken to me
thats it
there are no npcs
there is no interaction
yet you totally become your character
it is amazing how much detail from the glorious outdoor scenes like the paradise waterfall to the minute detail of prisoners in their cellwith each hallway corridor ravine and door you are pulled onto the edge of your seat and not released as you fight your way through the planet filled with legitimately scary alien races who take utter glee out of torturing and destroying other races
it is very intensethis is a must for people who like games
if you like st person shooters this will top your list
if you dont like stperson shooters you will like this onea total success
bravowhen i got this pack for christmas i had heard about unreal before but never really saw it or played it so i didnt know what to expect
let me tell you if the graphics dont blow you away the sound music and gameplay will
once again  is a hell of a good deal where should i begin praising the perfect gamegraphically it may seem dated today yet it was cutting edge at its time
i remember getting the original game almost  years ago bundled with an nvidia graphixcard  and could not believe my eyes
beautifully rendered surfaces exceptional environments and an unbelievable skythe original unreal could easily double as a lecture on game design sound
majestic background music mood setting themes and effective environmental additions make this the perfect game in that aspect toothe weapons are well designed there are ingame upgrades for them and all have two different modes of firing
walk and there is adjustable bobbing
jump and you better had measured the distance or land in water  otherwise you get torn to piecesthe game is pretty much linear yet shortcuts or backdoors are available at numerous points  so exploring is encouraged
simple puzzles add to the games appeal push a lever to drop the ladder here or turn the power on to activate the elevator there  and usually reward with a weapon powerupsomething lacking in many shooters even today is unreals balance and fairness you could take an enemy down with a single sniper headshot  but so could they
unreal was the first game that where you landed your shot started to count on the damage it did
epic had done a monumental jobwhat separated this game from the rest though were mainly two things its unsurpassed atmosphere and its immersive storyfrom the very first moment you wake up on the prison ship that was carrying you but crashed on an alien planet you are gripped by fear and apprehension
you get only fleeing glimpses of the aliens  yet find ample evidence of their cruel handiwork on the ships crewthe first weapon you get is quite weak so you actually believe to be wandering out of the ship an into a world unknown with a puny phase gun
as the game progresses you are rewarded with both confidence and very impressive and innovative weapons
who can forget the spinning bladegun blades bouncing around and shooting around corners but also yourself if not carefulon top of everything else the game is huge
the content of the original unreal alone would have been released in at least  installments today not to mention its included for free
multiplayer that spawned the unreal tournament seriesthey just dont make them like this anymorewith the highest recommendations a decade ago in  unreal was released and became a major gaming hit that revolutionized fps along with practically reinventing the game engine the unreal engine is a very important core gaming tool behind many modern fps today
the concept is a reality thanks to tim sweeney spending  years in his garage
at the time this was the reason to buy a graphics cards like a voodoo or a tnt and run it on your windows  system
for those of you who could barely run it well now is the time to give it a go again because modern cards can run this game with ease and the game is worth iti finished playing this again on a high end system and am very happy that i did
it really is a deep game lots of levels lots of running around lots of shooting mindless blasting pressing levers going through levels that have some maze qualities running across the same bad guys with some variations the textures ai and level design is surprisingly still able to deliver on a satisfactory game play
i would even go as far to say that this beats a lot of fps games that have since been released
it is an alltime great so for those of you gamers out there who remember the end of the s and remember what it was like to play fps games that people would line up around the block to buy then get it play it and cherish itas a note you can get this as part of a pack so do shop around you may be surprised what sort of collectors editions you can getthis game is very old but the game it self still stands as an inovation in the d fps world
its levels and total modability stand next to none at the time and its ability to handle out door areas with viers height where amazingi really was fond of this game and when i saw i could get another copy to replace the one that i lost i had to jump on it
but its an old game with dated graphicsi love this game
i love it to the point i once actually stopped playing it because i was depressed about the poor nalis getting slaughteredthis game is a classic that most new first person shooters will be compared to now and in the future
the only problem i really have is that there isnt much variation in enemies its brutes then skaarj then terrans then titans rinse and repeat
oops
i forgot the serpent people
thats five compared to over  in turok that and the fact that all the weapons have an aged worn down look to them for example the flak cannon looks all rusted whereas in ut its all polished and shiny
of course i suppose it makes sense considering it sat there for god knows how long hypothetically of courseno matter what though i still love the game even after a couple years of intense play
and until unreal  ill have to settle for this even if i didnt like iti love unrealill say it again i love iteverything about itthe gorgeous graphics that i think are better than halflifesthe realistic enviormentsthe digital incredible music fitted for the game itselfthe very very intelligent aithe incredible gameplaythe story linemultiplayersingleplayerall of it is incrediblethe weapons actually have rust on it and are dirty now thats what i call realsticunlike in unreal tournamentthe weapons in that game are clean and polishedi just love this gamehave the expansion to it and unreal tournamentthe entire seriesi cant wait till unreal comes outive looked at some screen shotslook just as incredible as unreal did  years agoive been playing unreal for  years nowdecided to pick up gold i love it sooo muchcant wait till unreal championship comes out eitheri even got my self and xbox for itwhat its fori reccomend this game for fps gamersi reccomend at least a shiny new pentium   mhrz mb d video card directx directx compatible sound card at least mb free of harddrive spacemb of pcisdram mhrz at leastanything below that unreal wont run at all or will run like garbagei reccomend unreal gold or even totally unrealjust buy it and enjoy ityour welcomelara croft on the tiny screen does some amazing things in a mighty small arena  in the first half dozen panels of this sidescroller she walks runs somersaults jumps grabs pulls levers and shoots with her magic hollywood special pistol that never runs out of ammo scorpions bats and snakes and saves game at the first silver crystal to come along with another crystal tantalizingly visible just beyond reach
it truly is amazing
the effect is like reading the classic comics version of tomb raider   lots of temples and jungles action and every plot point and traditional tomb raider gimmick represented or at least suggested in the frame
dont get me wrong its not a movie even the movies are comicstyle panels with dialog between still frames and the graphics are primitive  but ms croft is rendered with character and flexibility intact
we get sucked into the game almost immediately putting the gbc tomb raider aka the nightmare stone but the color printed paper label on this dark green transparent gamepak just says tomb raider in the same company as links awakening
i was delighted to collect this and even more delighted with the unexpected level of playi thought that this tomb raider game was much easier than the rest of them but still equally fun
its all in d and you have to go through puzzles mazes caves etc
its a great game to buy for any tomb raider or action adventure fanstomb raider is a great game
it is different from other platformers in a few noticable ways
the biggest difference is that lara is bigger than  other platformers like mario and rayman
this is a welcome change to the  eyes
there are multiple different ways to run and roll and jump and grab  and so on but the controls are simpler than other tomb raider games
it  is easier to see what can be held or grabbed than what cant be
and the  only really easy way to die is to fall on spikes
anyways this is a good  game to buy with an easy formatmy son is an avid metal gear fan up to and including mgs for ps
while a bit primitive this game was no exceptionmetal gear solid is one of konamis most popular franchises throughout the world
back in  it used to be a dormant series until they released it for the playstation and was an instant success
it was a continuation from the nes games where it began and set the gaming world on fire
three years later konami released metal gear solid and it proved to be a must own title for the game boy color
blending elements of the previous  nes games and the ps hit game plus a brand new story that takes place before the events of the ps game mgs was an exciting game to have seen and playedin this game metal gear has been kidnapped by terrorists and they are intent on using it to vaporize the world
the us government called upon solid snake the character you control to infiltrate the terrorists headquarters and stop them before they use the nuclear weapon
navigate through over  different appears while avoiding enemy soldiers solving puzzles and figuring out where to go in numerous mazes while running into an occasional boss character
the story had its own twists and turns and you interact with characters who are there to help you out over the radio aka codec
you can pick up ammo and weapons along with rations health power ups and other items
its a long game so prepare to save often by calling one of the characters through the codec and your progress will be saved up until that pointthe pros metal gear solid was very very impressive for a game boy color game
the game plays like the previous nes games right down to the detailed graphics sound effects music and animation
the story moves along with smooth cut scenes and text while elements of the ps game are sprinkled throughout so for anyone who has played it before will recognize some of the characters weapons and game play
on top of the main story mode konami included over  virtual reality training missions just like in the ps game
also included is a  player vs mode where you connect with another player via a cable link and play through hide and seek matches
this game packed a lot of contentthe cons this game is a breeze on easy mode but normal hard and very hard modes are no joke
like i said before its a long game and if you remember to save youll repeat the same mission objectives again and again as the game starts you from the last time you save
also since this game is on a cartridge dont expect to hear any voice samples or acting
you must read via the scrolling text to see what happens and some cut scenes last longer than othersthis game pleased metal gear solid fans at the time and konami wanted to capitalize on the franchises renewed popularity at the time
they didnt take any shortcuts with this game and it shows
it was very impressive for a gam boy color game and its still worth taking out and playing through it againthis and resident evil gaiden are most likely my favorite games in my gbc collectionand its a big one
i would like to inform you that if you dont buy this game right now you are missing out on one of the best game experiances you will ever have
so here you go my review on mtal gear solidstory the game puts you in the boots of action hero and well known sabatour solid snake
snake is sent to galuade which is actually outer heaven
while there snake is instructed to work with delta force to rescue reseachers who were working on none other than metal gear
of course if metal gear is there it must be destroyed
all of the plans go wrong when a group of mercenaries called balck chamber wipe out delta force and all but one of the reseachers is killed
snake is now in a fight for survival to face his past and destroy a nuclear weapons that could end the world as we know itgraphics they are like metal gear on the playstation shrunk to fit the screen in other words the game looks absoloutly amazingsound the music is a gentle harmony at times and intense mix of rock and classic compositions
great sound is the signature of any mgs game and this is no differentgameplay its intense and very smooth in the way that you can go from a shadow to a one man army with no choppy movement whatsoever
the game almost grabs you by the neck and forces you to play
the boss fights are present and in full motion as wellmy conclusion is that this is a wonderful game and should be experiance by all
oh and as a warning this game has a lot of language that is not appropriate for kids
other wise go get this right nowhonestly this was the only gameboy color gme to keep my interest
you could pretty much say its the nes metal gear with the moves enabled in the playstation metal gear game the name is the same but its a completely different game from playstation version
i recommend the game if you can find itwas hard to get even when it was newwith the blockbuster success of metal gear solid for the ps konami decided to make the game portable for nintendos bit gameboy color and while many specualtions over the quality of the game were not very good at all every gbc owner on the planet was shocked when this was released
for being an bit system the graphics and sound are simply astounding and the controls are exact and dead on
stealth is still the name of the game and youll have to dodge guards and security cameras to complete your mission plus vr missions and cut scenes are here as well making this game play so unbelieveably close to its ps counterpart that many a gamer will be left in awe when they see it in action
the storyline is a prequel to the ps game that would set up the events that take place in that game and while it may start out as a run of the mill story it quickly picks up and by the time you finish the game youll be catching your breathe
all in all metal gear solid is essential to action fans and gbc owners everywhereholy crap
how did konami and company pull this one offwhat we basically have here is a game that takes almost everything we loved about metal gear solid on the playstation and crammed it onto a gameboy color cartridge with a new story
it sounds impossible and doomed to fail
but you must believe me  this is one of the greatest metal gear games and fans only familiar with the solid titles on the  playstations are missing outthe gameplay is surprising sharp
as solid snake you can brush up on your skills with the vr training levels
believe me these will come in handy if you want to master the gme
snake basically has all of the skills he had in the original mgs
he can flatten against walls to hide from the enemy
he can acquire weapons on the battlefield from handguns to rocket launchers
he is given a radar to scope out the area
in short this is the solid snake fans have loved since  or  for you original loyal fansthe story has nothing to do with the sony mgs games but it doesnt have to
it begins pretty similar to how metal gear did with terrorists taking over an african fortress and its up to snake to stop them
although this gameboy story doesnt really get into philosphy as much as the sony console games this is still a tight espionage thriller
the story is wellpresented through codec conversations that dont run on for too long and animated cutscenes that are better than anything the nes gave usone difference between this gameboy adventure is that this metal gear solid is broken into  levels
this is actually a great thing because it offers you a chance to replay your favorite chapters
plus it helps guide the player to the right path rather than risk endless backtracking
but make no mistake  this is still a metal gear game to its core from the stealth tactics to the overthetop bosses
and like every other metal gear game in this beloved franchise it has a few moments that seem to go beyond the core elements of the game
im referring to the sequence where you must use the conveyor belts and your cardboard box to smuggle your way through the base
how did they come up with thatif there is one thing to fault with this version of metal gear solid besides the unavoidable lack of voice acting its way you can dispose of your enemies without getting caught
granted this wasnt a big deal until s mgs  but nowadays its a tad silly that you can take out your enemies with little risk of getting caught
but if you choose to challenge yourself and remain stealthy youre in for a delightful challengeone last thing  the music is handheld perfection
i hum some of these tunes to this day and i hadnt played this game for many yearsthe gameboy color release of metal gear solid is among the greatest games in handheld history with a high quality of innovation and entertainment
if you dont own a gameboy color or original gameboy advance this game is worth the purchase alone
id even call it a superior game to the playstation original
yes you read that rightmetal gear solid on the gameboy color or metal gear ghost babel outside of america is an astounding game that manages to combine elements from the popular d playstation game with the classic d metal gear gameplay
the games story is noncannon in the larger metal gear universe and is set after the events of the first metal gear game from  solid snakes back to take down some crazy super powered mercenaries out to launch a nuclear warhead at the us
although this is standard fare for a metal gear game it still manages to tell an engrossing story with long cinematic cutscenes and dramatic codec conversations
the in game sprites though small are clearly detailed
even though an action like guards turning their heads is a matter of a couple of pixels moving they still clearly convey what the figure is doing
the game looks great
it takes full use the gameboy colors palate to make all the environments unique and striking
where this game really shines though is the gameplay
the games control greatly resembles the second metal gear game
you can crouch to crawl through and under cover you can knock on walls to distract guards and the handy soliton radar makes an appearance to help identify enemy placement
new to the d games though is the ability to flatten snake against a wall to see farther down a hall or slide through area you formerly wouldnt have been able to get through
on top of this the boss fights are challenging and creative making you utilise your arsenal of gadgets and weapons to find their weaknessesthis game is a little pricey and hard to find but it is a must have to gbc owners and metal gear fans everywheresuch a detailed game with vr missions  levels and  boses to fight metal gear solid is the action game of the year
i cant think of  thing  wrong with it awsome graphics sense stimulating sound heaps of different  wweopons including missiles and grenades precison control and perfect  gameplay
get it todaythis game is in a genre of its own as far as im concerned
whilst it may be in the same vein of some other actionhorror titles it is by far superior in every aspect imaginable
this game provokes a constant atmosphere of brooding terror
this game is dark suspenseful and twisted
play this game alone with the blinds closed with the tv volume cranked and within minutes youll be scolding the child in you that is getting up to turn the lights back on
im not kidding this game will scare you
this is an actionhorror game with plenty of action and enough horror for two games with some left over
puzzles that will have you scratching your chin and nightmares made flesh that will have you buying batteries for your nightlight
this game takes you to the fogclad streets of an ominously deserted suburbia through the twisted paralell worlds of a town gone straight to hell
here lies an oppurtunity nightmarish as it is profound for you to explore the depths of darkness and maybe however unlikely survive
if youre not trembling too badly already and you think youre up for a test of both wits and guts i strongly suggest you click add to cartmy first experience with the silent hill series was with sh
mind you this is right after i played resident evil code veronica x in which case i was very very disappointed
that game left me scared beyond all reason
it was the scariest videogame ive ever played
so after doing about ten more playthroughs including getting a star ranking i decided to buy the original because ive heard it was even scarier than the second one
this i found hard to believe but i bought it nonetheless just because i loved the series already
because i was accustomed to shs type of fearinducing style i thought i would be prepared for the first game and that i may not be as terrified as a newcomer to the series
i just have to say that nothing in silent hill  could prepare me for the horrors that awaited in sh
that same old fear of the dark came back in full forcewhile the monsters are nowhere near as twisted and sexually disturbingsuggestive as the ones in sh which are some of the most terrifying creatures ever devised and pyramid head was impossible to top by any game the monsters in sh did provide ample scares that fit the mood especially the zombie children shudder
but the real fright came from the nightmare environments
the nightmare places in sh were bad enough but these were so extreme in their nightmarish appearance that you felt as if you were in one
five minutes into the game i was scared out of my mind because of this
playing this game was truly an experience like none other
even though the voice acting was hard to take seriously it was lightyears ahead of the original resident evil though the plot was still very intriguing and kept my attention until the very end
while sh i think had a bit more of a surreal edge to it this one was almost as good
and it didnt have an ultradepressing mood about it like its successor and didnt have ultradepressing music either so i didnt feel like crying during some of the sad scenes there arent that many which is kind of a downer
but make no mistake keeping true to its form there is close to no happiness whatsoever in this game
thats why i like this series its so dark and so grim that no mater what ending you get you will never feel like its a and they lived happily ever after type of conclusion
and thats just the despairing attitude i like in videogamesas for the graphics i have said this again and again and i will say it again i dont give a crap about graphics
so long as i enjoy a game whether it be for the gameplay storyline or fun overall then graphics mean nothing to me
and besides the visuals are just enough to create a claustrophobic atmosphere with dense fog during the day outside to obscure your vision and pitch black interiors with only your flashlight to give you illuminosity
thats what this game series has that puts it ahead of the resident evil series a true sense of dread and terror that builds and builds from the atmosphere not occasional cheap scare tactics
also the serious lack of music is a blessing as well
theres nothing more creepy than absolute silence with strange noises happening in the distance
in a back alley you come across a big bloody corpse that you cant even identify with blood spattered on the wall next to it
rather than having the camera center on it and have a surge of cheesy bmovie horror music you can just pass by it and be disturbed on your own
another alleyway you go down you find a basketball hoop and a severed dogs head on the ground with its blood plastered on the hoop
you go into a seemingly abandoned building where it is pitch black inside and you turn on your flashlight to see
in the darkness beyond the shine of your flashlight you hear a child sobbing and as you proceed slowly to find the source of it there is nothing at all
not even monsters
just nothing
then things just go wrong and the hallways you used to know are twisted into a sort of hellish parallel of the world you just left
you go down a corridor made of steel grating and there is a black abyss beyond and in the distance you can barely make out corpses hangind from their necks the crimsonstained chains stretching up to the unseen cieling above
that is the type of terror that made me so creeped out
and thats only the tip of the iceberg
play this game and find the true extent of the horror
i highly recommend this game to anybody looking for a good fright but i discourage anyone who is faint of heart from playing this as you will probably have nightmares for a long time
dont be afraid to get into the game and be fully entrapped in it thats what makes the experience satisfying
are you afraid of the dark
no
you will bewhen resident evil came out on the psx dozens of clones like parasite eve came out
but until like  when silent hill came out and so did resident evil  came out
and silent hill is scarier and more fun to play because you control the camera angles
and the thing i like about this game is that if you press the l button the camera will go right behind harry
and you got a nice arsenal of weapons like chainsaws rock drills guns knives axes hammers and more
plus it has twilight zone endings
i wont tell you them
overall if youre a resident evil or a survival horror fan you owe it to check out the silent hill seriesbeing a huge horror fan i of course went right to horrorsurvival games with the onset of resident evil
similar to those is silent hill
very dark and very creepy
the game is superb and i couldnt put it down
the background and music are haunting and all the corpses laying around will end up making you jumpy if you play it alone at night
on the downside the character runsmoves very slow so it is hard to counter attacks and the camera goes crazy with stupid angles when you are moving through various layouts
of course with a bit of play you get used to it and it becomes a minor issueback in  i had never really played any kind of survival horror game ever in my life
a friend of mine came over to my house and brought silent hill and the playstation
i was just watching and i really liked how it had snow falling out in the town in the summer nonetheless it looked like a really scary game
then months later i borrowed this game from my friend and played from the beginning and didnt get really far because i really didnt know what to do
finally one night when my friend was back over at my house i was playing and he was sitting there watching and we were playing with surround sound the lights off and no one else was in the house
from the very beginning alley i was very scared
so i get to the school midwich elementary school and everything looks normal
my friend who was watching kept telling me that once i go through the clock tower i will be back at midwich elementary and that it will be the same school but at the same time it wouldnt be the same school and at that point i was really starting to freak out
i had no idea what horrors were waiting for mei go through the clock tower and i hear these really creepy sirens im to the point where i want to turn the game off but my friend was with me and kept telling me to move on
so i start to go into the school and once im in im freaking out
all the floors were replaced by metal grates with nothing below them the walls were like chained fences everything covered in blood pure horror and terror
i was really scared by the visuals and the music
something really creepy in the alternate school is when you go into one of the bathrooms on the first floor you end up on the second floor creepy
just everything that i saw and heard in every room and corridor scared me to death
i turned the game off after i was done in the school and couldnt sleep with the light off
i did eventually play through the whole game and beat it but i have never been so scared playing a video game in my entire life
the really scary music and sound effects play a big part
but whats really scary isnt just the atmosphere the music or visuals
it freaks me out thinking about why the town of silent hill is deserted and how samael came along
if i think about this stuff before i go to sleep a lot of times i cant sleep
the alternate hospital alchemilla hospital is another really scary place in the game that really scared me too but not as bad as the school
to be honest when i first was going through the alternate school the way it looked thats what i thought hell would look like it was so scary
to this day it scares me
sometimes even with the light on its scary
even though the graphics arent the best this silent hill game scares me more than silent hills   or  and they have better graphics
i would not recommend this game to anyone who scares easilysmackdown is truly the peoples game
choose from many wwf superstars and go on story mode
or make your own character and make a name for themself in the world wrestling federation
see if you have what it takes to get the world heavy weight title the intercontinental title or even team up with one of your buddies and go after the tag team titles
so if you got what it takes buy this game and show those jabronis whose the peoples champi love wwf smackdown and ive got the calluses on my thumbs to prove it
i hear that wwe smackdown
 know your role is even better but this first smackdown
title puts every other wrestling game i have ever played to shame
there is room for improvement but theres little not to love about the wrestling action unleashed from this playstation cd
you have to start off with the wrestlers you get all of the big names from wwf now wwe at the time and most of them look great
chynas animated character looks atrocious with a tiny head set atop a mountain of muscles but i have few other complaints in this department
i am a fan of the rock and this game has really captured the style and look of my favorite wrestler all the way down to the peoples eyebrow
the moves also look fantastic and true to form and the peoples elbow is a triumph of showmanship and fun
every wrestler has hisher big finishing move recreated in impressive detail but even the little moves are impressive
from the simple eye gouge to the dropkick or stomp or leg lock or bodyslam the little details are all there to enjoy
when you irish whip your opponent into the turnbuckle he goes bouncing off staggers and falls just like the guys do in real life
knock a guy to his rear end in the turnbuckle and you can stand on his throat using the ropes for leverage its the little things like this that make this game so fantastic
the controls are a little strange at first but they quickly become second nature and the best part about this aspect of the game is the diversity of moves you are able to execute
when your opponent is lying in the ring you can choose to try and cripple the guys leg or get him in a semichokehold with your action depending to some degree upon the angle in which you approach
then when youve beaten your opponent to a pulp and the timing is right you need only press one button as opposed to an awkward combination of buttons and joystick moves in order to execute your patented finishing move of course youll want to do a little taunting first just to rub it in
there are no pauses or hiccups at all in the action i should notethe variety of matches is outstanding
you can choose between normal matches tag team matches handicap matches pitting one against two battle royals royal rumbles king of the ring matches hardcore matches where chairs belts and microphones are in easy rich and are encouraged for use in the ring anywhere fall matches cage matches survival matches and i quit matches which are especially fun
not only that you can have or even control special referees for any match
i love being a ref because you get to beat the heck out of either or both of the actual wrestlers and you can control the outcome of the match by choosing the speed at which your threecount is made
if all this isnt enough there are a number of backstage fighting areas you can access although the fact that you have to irish whip your opponent into the backstage area makes this a little clumsier to pull off than it need bebut wait theres more
not only does each wrestler have his own special introduction as he makes hisher way to the ring the game features clips from backstage between some matches this sounds pretty cool but these clips soon become boring and frivolous
you can choose to wrestle in season mode taking your wrestler through each month on hisher own quest for the belt while watching or skipping over matches you dont actually participate in
you also have the ability to create your very own wrestler and let him wreak some havoc in the big leagues which is an option a lot of players should love
perhaps the best option of all though is the ability to set up the matches of your choice in payperview events
the only real complaint i have about this game is the fact that there is no option for match commentary
i know that commentary can quickly become tiresome and repetitive but it does make for a more realistic wrestling environment
other than this one missing option though wwf smackdown
pretty much has it all and i will be laying the smacketh down for some time to come i can assure youthis game is great
it is exciting to see all the old wrestlers and the match types you can play
the season mode is good although sometimes it can get kind of boring if you play long enough
although this game is getting pretty old it is still fun to go back to the good old daysi enjoyed smack down and raw
this one is a rare one to find
this also is a great one to get if you like wwfi loved this game
brought back memories
played this on my playstation and also on the emulator
i still have love for the playstation  gamesthis game went to the max with what playstation has to offer
the controls are easy to use and the create a player is the best ive ever seen in a  wrestling video game
the only con this game has is that it doesnt have  the most recent superstars such as rikishi or too cool
so if you want them  on your game i would wait for the next wrestling game to come out
the  entrance movies have an amazing quality and the sound is great
so overall  this game is one youll want to play again and againthis is a great game its impossible to say enough good things about it
this is far better than the old civilization games although sometimes i go back to civ  for the more reallife setting
with this game sid meier proved that hes the reason civilization was a hit if you havent played the nonmeier civilization games dont
its kept all the good things and added far more
one of the unique things about this game and that caught my eye right away is the ability to customdesign your units
theres probably millions of different units once you figure all the possible combinations
theres also a really cool social engineering setup that basically equates to a designagovernment system
the benefits of this can be superfast growth production lots of money or a lot of other effects
all things considered this game is spectacular if youre into turnbased strategies and great even if youre not
it does take a little bit to get a feel for what you can do if youre not familiar with the civilization line but once you do youll love it
one warning though if you only want a realtime strategy or want to see lots of blood and guts flying dont get this game
otherwise try it outthis game is the only turnbased strategy game one would ever needit has everything one would want out of a strategy game and so much morethe story is epic
the world is fully realised
the gameplay is deep
the literary referencesnot only scifi but philosophical and ethical and social are many and profound
the factions are compelling
the possibilities are endlessthe including of multiplayer as well as  extra factions in the expansion pack only sweetens the dealthe only minor flaws here which only present themselves to the diehard gamer is the apparent lack of challenge from the ai as well as the seemingly lacklustre graphicsbut given the budget of firaxis at the time the art direction is still amazingget this game
its one of those classics which you will keeping coming back for more
even having owned this masterpiece for more than  years i still play alpha centauri every  months or so and it still retains its freshness and playability
this one is a  definite keeperalso as a parting word i want to make it clear that despite the sid meier name on the package designer brian reynoldswho has since left firaxis i believe was the man behind alpha centauri and as such deserves the kudoesit is this game which deserves the title of true sequel to civilization ii and not civ iii which has none of the depth that this game has in spadesbuy itwhy compare this game to mozart
they are the same  genius in simplicityi loved this game
i am actually surprised that even more people have not played it
it has the highest rating ever from pc gamer 
think about that  alpha centauri is  away from being considered the perfect gamewhy
strategy that is detailed but intuitive
diplomacy that is believable and matters
game balance
a fun storyline
an intelligent ai that does not have to cheat to winbut by far my favorite part of the game is the technology aspect of the game
each new future technology some truly vague is introduced with a sound byte from a faction leader but more important is what these leaders say
philosophy religion literature hard science emmanuel kant aristotle even military cadences are used to provide atmosphere to the game
this is a game that respects the gameplayers intelligence
additionally the future technology tree has been well researched
just go to the back of the wellproduced alpha centuari manual to see the vast bibliography of science textbooks hard science fiction think stanley kubriks  and soft science fiction think star wars or star trek that the game draws influence from
i have a phd in molecular biology and i must endorse the technology tree as an excellent model for speculating how humanitys future knowledgebase may be represented
particularly interesting is how different civilizations are based on faction instead of nationality
however nationalistic stereotypes are represented
the communistsocialist faction is represented by chairman yang chinese
the gaia mentality is represetned by lady dierdre skye celticirish
the university faction is represented by a russian scientist academician prokhor zakharov and the un peacekeeping faction by a ghandilike figure in commissioner pravin lal
there are others to be sure but these are the most egregiousregardless the game is an outstanding mix of fun a stytle of gameplay that does not require excessive detail to be considered intelligent great presentation values and an overall attention to polish even in the smallest details
there is precious little that could be changed in this game
to quote salieri describing mozarts music quotdisplace one note and there would be diminishment
displace one phrase and the structure would fallquotthis game is the best
if you like stratagy games then youhave to get it
if you played and liked civilizaton i or ii then youwill love this
it comes with a fold out tech chart a statagy guied and of course the cd
the diplomacy options are the best much better then anything else that i have played
however it has not so good graphics
all in all it is a very good game and i suggest that you buy itim not sure why they wont do an update of this gameits one of the most fun most addicting games ever
basically civilization in space although its even more fun than civilization in my opinion
very hard to find the planetary pack now but if you can get it its well worth the rarity price
just cant go wrongif your a parent or a kid get this if youve got a wide variety of tastes in games
two classic building games sim city and sim tower are addictive while sim isle and sim safari and just fun to watch and play around with
streets of sim city and sim copter id reccommend for guys or girls who  like action games
if youve got a boy and a girl in the house i really  reccomend this set of fab gamesthis is a really cool product
in sim city classic you can make youre own city by building a power plantcoal or nuclear and laying power linesmaking residentailcommercailand industrial zoneslaying out roads and railroadsand keeping sims happy by building parksstadiumspolice and fire stationsand portsseaports and airports
i highly recommend sim city classic to windows  users who cant afford to upgrade their computers
and in sim safari you can make youre own safari camp and park and higher workers from a nearby village to work in youre camp
the other games are pretty fun to but can get quite frusterating since ive never gotten a surplus in sim tower or sim isle and ive only made it past one level in sim copter and the streets of sim city
however if youre really good at simulation games i would definitly reccomend them all to youif your child has played beginning level software and is ready to move on to more advanced gameplay humongous entertainments pajama sam series and freddi fish and puttputt as well are an excellent choice
these titles take the cognitive tasks up a notch as children must accumulate specific items navigate a number of locations and use their problemsolving skills to help new friends and achieve larger goals
along the way funny and lovable pajama sam will meet a number of nice characters visit a variety of interesting locations and play minigames as he completes the larger task of getting a representative of each food group out of a pickle so they can get to an important meeting
along the way he will solve a lot of smaller puzzles and click on many objects that dance or act out funny events
specifics change if you start a new game and you will want to play with your child a few times before theyll be able to enjoy it on their own so each game is good for hours of funthis is a fine game in a great series
we have all the pajama sam titles and enjoy them allthis game as are all of the pajama sam games is great
it is humorous educational and entertaining
the puzzels are a little harder than the  first two games but not beyond the suggested age range for the game
both  of my kids  and  loved itin this game pajama sam has to help the  peace delegates of the food pyramid get to the peace summit
the healthy  foods and sweet foods cant seem to get along together
some of the  delegates are stuck in various predicaments and sam has to rescue them
sams offthewall humor is as snappy as everi have to admit i also  enjoyed this game and often wonder why adult games arent this fun
i  highly recommend itthis is a great game and i recommend to any parents child
it has a great story and theme
there is actually a food pyramid buildingmy children and i were so excited when we knew that a new pajama sam game had come out
my children have played it every day since we bought it and they still ravein this new game the food guide pyramid needs pajama  sams help
the evil fat and sugars are making trouble for the good ole  natural foods
so pajama sam takes a cool ride into the human body for an  adventurous quest between good and evilpajama sam and your children  will learn about the difference between good food fruits and vegetables  and junk food cakes cookies and chipsas with all humongous games  this one is filled with vibrant colors and cool sounds
there are many fun  and friendly characters all throughout this enchanting game
there are  different objectives each time the game is played
you can also save the  game each time you play iti recommend this game to anyone with  children
it does not matter their age they will want to play it anywaythis is the most addictive game ever
the graphics are wonderful there are so many things do do and places to go in this game
my friends and i have lost so much sleep while playing this game because you cant stop
however you need to pay a  monthy fee with your credit card if you want to play
but nonetheless this game is a must buythis game is the best
graphically stunning visually beautiful and immerse
never before has any game ive played been the compelling
thopusands of quests over  users online and never do i have problems moving around or slowing up
sometimes there are problems but it has to go with the territory
a game this incredible with so much going on at one time has to have some bugs and the sony team is constantly patching and making sure all is well
id really suggest this to anyone who love fantasy roleplay and online games
my only suggestion ishave a machine which is very high specwise or you will run into problems
i played on a  mhz and had many issues and when i switched to my  mhz it runs so well that ive become an addictafter trying the first mission in thief the metal age i was dazzled
the developers at ion storm have truly lived up to the promise of a better sequel for we slobbering thief fans
the original thief was thought not to  do well because of its twist on the firstperson shooter
but when it hit  the shelves it sold like hot cakes
to those of you runandgun fans this  might not be the game for you
thief  consists heavily on keeping out of  sight and sticking to the shadows
you are not a war hero that can take  some few thousand bullet wounds you are no more than a common thief trying  to hold your own
the game has changed a significantly since the original  game
the characters in thief  are much smoother and less blocky looking
the physics have also had a dramatic change with new fog effects and etc
the ais intelligence has been increased as well
this game is fun to play  and if you buy it it will take some time to complete
it can be dificult  at times so i suggest buying a strategy guide
i cant tell you how much  fun it is when a nobleman offends you and then you loot him for all hes  worth
this is definetly one to getalas poor looking glass i knew ye games wellnot only were looking glass studios just terrific programmers and designers but they were one of the few companies very few that created sequels that outdid the originalstherefore thief  tma is a near flawless game in almost every aspectgood ol garrett is back and stealthier than ever
the best qualities that made the original so well original were the concepts
sneaking stealing pickpocketing lockpicking puzzleproblem solving great cast weaponary makes their glorious returns here and are improved and fixed here and there toonow what makes the metal age no not s hair metal bands better than the dark project
well aside from the improved weaponry and gadgets the story is more streamlined to adhere to the gameplay better
tma was a tad overboard in the hammerities theology deterring from the pacing of the game at times
here the mechanists are a theology as well but dont slow down the pace
not to say that its thin on plot it surely isnt it has a great story as all lgs games dothe graphics are great for the time it was released today they look kind of primitive and the foley is terrific as always
it carries some of the sfx from tdp and adds more sounds and removes some of the annoying sounds from tdp tooif i have to mention and i do any negatives i would say that there are a few glitches even for the final version of  that ruin the game
i tended to get to get stuck in corners and had to restart
at times when youre moving at the slowest pace you are still heard from half across a room
i found that ridiculous
lastly there is no bit resolution availabilty
bummeroverall this is another jewel in the small but flawless looking glass studios crownthe other  lgs games aresystem shocksystem shock  greatest pc game ever createdthief the dark projectnow go get itthem tafferso here is how it works the metal age has a better story
the metal age has better missionswonderful game all round frankly it is also one of a kind because no other game forces you to reley on strength speed and wits at the same time
if you are feed up with the other games that really seem to have no point other than to blow stuff up try this game on for sizeoverallhas the best theif mission everlife of the partyfor once a thinking shooter that is well done
some levels are too difficult though but most are incredibly fun
this game is a slowpaced thinking gamehowever there was so little difference from the original that most people may forget they are playing thief   the menu system is virtually identical and the engine is becoming a nuisance
for example the map is an important tool in thief  switching between the map and gameplay takes a surprisingly long timethe makers should have made the map integrated right into the gameother than that no complaintswell maybe more updated graphicsthief  the dark project was an example of gaming genius
was there ever a game where you had to complete levels without killing anyone
it game out the same time as half life and other first person shoot em ups but here we  had a classic first person sneak em up
there wasnt another game like  itso how does the sequel play
even better
looking glass studios  did something superb when they asked gamers what they wanted to see in  thief  the metal age
it is everything the first instalment was and more  so if you liked the first one you will love this
not only are the graphics  and d engine looking as good as ever but the story line is better there  are less zombies and more thieving
the human characters talk to eachother  more and there is a better atmosphere
there are new objects like the  zooming eye and the ability to look around walls by throwing a device that  can see around itself
the maps can now be written on so you can take notes  and like the first there are  levels of difficulty for each level
this is  superb also cos you can go back and replay levels so there is a better  element of lastability
back to its theiving bestthe levels are huge  and wont be completed easily but you can save the game as often as you want  which lately hasnt been the normal in a first person gameall in all  thief the metal age is a very rewarding and brilliant game that has lived  up to the high standards it predecessor had set
it has not become a sequel  which feels like quotjust an add on packquot its a sequel with new  features which has made it even bettersteeling has never been so good
go buy it nowi absolutely fell in love with this game even before i had played thief the dark project
im so glad i started out with the better part of this game with garretts mechanical eye vine arrows and probably a lot more
these help big time in getting past the levels
i experienced its absence when i played thief the dark project which was pretty tedious but it wasnt badthief  the metal age has got quite a story
youll be amazed to find out which i did after analyzing the game during algebra the pace in progress by starting out at some fancy mansion to help someone to actually saving the city
on the way a lot of things are encountered which lead to other things causing subplots but in the end theyre all related to the big picture and it doesnt get off tracki was pretty addicted to this game and still am
i long to slip into that sober and forbidding atmosphere which is brought out so well through the music and the lighting and garrett helps the situation through his sarcasm and cynicalnessthis is one kind of game which i know i wont grow out of
in a way its not repititive as sometimes when you save the game at a point where a guards going to walk in on you he sometimes wont turn up when the game is loaded
also in levels that require locating some kind of loot or item which you carry on to the next level considering that youre starting fresh on the level it can be hidden in  different places and i havent experienced all of it eitheri really recommend this game especially if youre a firstpersonshooter person and for once there arent the usual shotput guns or bazookas or alienated monsters and whatnot
thief  the metal age is definately a breakthroughthis is the best game ive played
i do prefer it to the original thief because they seem to have gotten rid of the zombiesif i had to say something bad about this game it would be that it is so dark
of course  darkness is consistent with being a thief but i have to play it at night  with the room lights practically offsince i just got a new pc   copperminemb rdramgeforce  mb ddr it runs like a dream and i  play at max resolutionif you have played thief one then youll love theif ii it is even better then the first with compelling graphics and stunning missions will keep you hooked to the game till you beat which could take a while with the number of assinments in each mission
plus the veriaty of the missions is great
anywhere from being a assasin to framing someone
this game is sure to be a classicthief  seems a little less convoluted than the first game
there were some really long and arduous levels in the that onethe same stealth and tension remains in  and the graphics are ok
but in all seriousness not that much different from the firstthe different levels are varied and beautifully scripted
one time you may be required to steal certain items from a lord the next simply follow a guard through the streets without being detected
the whole atmosphere is one of tension and fear
you may enter into a room where guests chat and pass comments about characters you are after
thief  is an example of how computer games are pushing the standards of gaming and story lines
its not for serious sam fans but it is for lovers of beautiful game design and carefully crafted atmospherei have worked in the role playing game industry for about  years and thief  is hands down the best game i have ever played
the story the characters game play everything is increadible
a game like this is a rare treasurethe story doesnt make much sense i dont like that there isnt many cutscenes and frankly i think its too short
but i really like all the levels and its as fun as the third onei think they shoulda added this to the first one but you dont always get what you want rightim sure if you liked tomb raider  youll like thisthis is the game that got me into first person shooters
i think all kiss fans will like it as well
in playing this game i have found that its easier to see the monitor to see where you are and what your doing if you turn off all the lights around your computer with the exception of leaving one light on so you can see the keyboard however its easier not to have any refelction on the screen when playing
i would suggest turning on a light somewhere close enough to your pc so that you can fully enjoy this game
thats it for nowyey
kiss has their own video game as well
and being a die hard core fan i of course bought this onefirst off like the other video games i own i wasnt the first to play this game
i read online reviews and most of them criticized this game because the screenshots were misleading and because the game was merely overrated
well ill admit kiss pyscho circus the nightmare child isnt a major breakthrough but the story line is fun and in a while it gets addictivethe plot revolves around a child of evil that has been born
not to take this statement literally it means that a new evil has just been stirred by the closetodefeated nightmare king
as a last resort this spawn of hell as been awakened
also during this battle with the nightmare king the  elders have been scarred and running out of strength
the only person aware of this is madame raven a sorceress who must devise a plan to ovecome this seed of satan as well as choose  people to substitute the exhausted elders to carry out this task
meanwhile  band members with their band name being wicked jester which you will remember was the first band of paul stabley and gene simmons arrive at the coventry a roadhouse
of course theyre surprised to find it desolate and deserted
but then madame raven out of the blue informs them that everyone has gone to see the circus and maybe they should too for the grand finale something of an allusion to armageddon
then she offers them  tickets to which they readily accept since they have nothing else to do
all of a sudden the four of them are surrounded by mirrors and beyond the looking glass she fills them in on the path theyve chosenyou have these  characters to choose from each representing the personage of the band members itself pablo ramirez starbearer like paul stanley patrick scott beast king like peter criss andy spades chang the celestial like ace frehley and gabriel gordo the demon like good ol gene simmons
also notice that their first names begin with the same letter as the band mambers first names so thats a hint by itselfive read and heard that its preferable and recommended to start off this game by playing as pablo ramirez but its no big deal
i picked pablo because paul stanleys my priority i was lucky enough to have him on the cover of the box
youll start off the level as pablo at an abandoned cafe of some kind and like the typical first person shooter monstersll soon start to jump out at you
pablos quest just like the other  is to find every piece of his armor and also stumbling upon new equipment with the starchild mask being the last before getting to the real nuts and bolts of it
the final piece of armor the mask will then complete him and transform him into the starchild himself
even though this has often been related to the humurous doom and quake kiss psycho circus is feverishly difficult even on the easy level setting so saving and loading will be done very frequently
i know that there are those classic cheats of having longer lives and completing your armor without having to really look for it but ive never tried those and its said that theyre not of much helpalso this game like the name suggests has a circusrelated theme
information on guns ammunition and armor will be in the form of circus pamphlets and flyers strewn all over the place and a few monsters will be in the form of half mechanized clowns the other half is human
stephen kings it anyone
plus there are many kiss easter eggs jukeboxes play kiss songs a very robotronic version is to be expected and there some items and equipment even named after kiss songs like black diamond and this drink warehouse called cold gin
also in this one level youll arrive at a pool place and therell be pictures of individual members of kiss all around roomthe graphics arent very stunning but fairly good
while theyre not completely d theyre not very pixelated and boxy eitherkiss pyscho circus the nightmare child is actually pretty funfilled and eerie
youll might only be taking some time to warm up to itive always loved the might  magic series and this one is no exception
i love first person turnbasedparty games
i have been dumb enough to periodically waste money on some of the various third person games out there like baldurs gate and neverwinter nights but i hate third person and cannot get into it at all
might  magic does not have that problemthis game is the third in this format after mm  mm and has the most tweaks
some say the story and engine are getting a little long on the tooth but that is fine with me
i have become so engrossed it them that i have played all three of them at least three times each
there is no other game that even comes closedespite the crudeness factor i love the graphics
the spell system is just right and i dont mind all the monster bashing
the story kept me engaged each time i played even knowing the outcome the second and third time aroundi just wish someone would continue the series in the same format with maybe d graphics but the same game play and all the rest
i give a hats off to the might  magic tribute people who are doing it on their own since no company seems interested in doing ithighly recommendedim only a few hours into the game and i can tell this ones a winner
i am what todays gamer would label as old schoolbut personally i could really care less about the thoughts or comments of those who place eye candy graphics and million  cutscenes above a well told story and adventurous fundont get me wrong i own many of todays modern rpgs and ive enjoyed them all and find them loads of funkeywordfun are ya still with me on this
being into gamedesign has taught me one huge lessonno matter how awestruck a player is over all the tech you put into a gameif they dont remember it in years to comethen you havent done your job well at alland it is these elements that the mightmagicseries has done and hopefully continue to do in the futureif you enjoyed then youll enjoy this one as well
it takes a real rpgfan to appreciate these types of games in a day and age where hype sells and commercialism rulefor the true rpger onlydarviusthis was by far the best baseball game of its era
obviously technology has rendered the graphics of this title obsolete and playing with  rosters isnt all that appealing
that said i think this was still the best baseball game available until mlb the show   this was a better product than the mvp series by ea sports despite being many years older
if you want a classic baseball game this is the best choicei dont usually play sports games but i am a baseball fan and i played the previous two games in this series
all i have to say is that i have played hundreds of games in career mode guiding the tribe through several seasons and ive never gotten bored with it
the pitcherbatter interface is the key to the game there is a steep learning curve to successful hitting i found but after many games i have topped out at being a pretty good hitter my team usually leads the league in offense
however i am still susceptible to being shut down by good pitchers and even though the computers pitching is sometimes predictable a welltimed changeup is still a devastating out pitch
another aspect that keeps me playing is the career mode where i can manage three levels of minorleague teams draft rookies every year and invest a lot of emotional capital in new players i have developed myself
there are lots of good details included in the game as well such as a battingpractice interface for working on your hitting a midseason allstar game trading with other teams customizable leagues and seasons and a headtoheadwithanotherpresenthuman mode which is quite fun and easy to set up if you both have sidewinder gamepads my preferred peripheral for this gamethere are a few downsides  the minor leagues are initially stocked with madeup players and not real minorleaguers
the graphics are good but not great im not complaining  theyre perfectly fine for me  im just noting that other baseball games have slicker visuals
basestealing and defense are reasonably wellexecuted although i still make terrible errors on both counts sometimes partly from brain spasms on my part but not totally  i think the interface for these aspects could still be improvedoverall however this is by far the best implementation of a baseball simulation ive ever playedi was one of the biggest advocates of eas triple play series
after the letdown of triple play  and  they havent made a good one since  i began to be turned off by pc baseball games
until i found hh and this game hh  is even better than its predesessor
the graphics are gorgeous
the ai is the most intelligent i have ever seen in a baseball game
the physics are pinpoint accurate
outfielders cant throw laser beams from the wall to the catcher in  seconds
the pitcherbatter interface is the best of any game
and perhaps the greatest gameplay feature that it has over all other gamesyou can actually draw walks while batting
this may not sound like much but believe me it makes the game so much more realisticthe player editor is a great feature letting you tweak players abilities for instance if you leave it the way it is mike sweeney would be a career  hitterwe all know hes better than that
 you can guide your franchise through an infinite amount of seasons
i have one of my teams in the year  right nowthere are so many features that this game offers but i cant talk about all of them in this limited space
but if you love baseball youll absolutely fall in love with this game
buy it now if you havent alreadywow
play for as long as you want
really great game
good downloads patches ectlooks feels sounds like the real thing
the fact that you can make your own players make the hof be on the dl for over a yearwell it is just like the real thing i know i said that already but this is the first and last game you will every need
an the idea that i can play many many many manyect seasons well nothing else is neededthe first baseball computer game i ever owned was quothardballquot for the mac
black and white two teams cheezy as all getout but i loved it
i played a whole season once  games tracking home run stats with those two teamssince then i never owned a baseball game  until now
and man sammy sosas high heat  is one hell of a game
the depth and breadth of the game is incredible from the accuracy of the  team rosters to the inclusion of the newest ballparks to the trading  model gasp for breath it goes on and onto the folks below if  you computer is crashing its not the game because sshhbbfor short  has never crashed on me
try a clean reinstall of your system
any true gamer knows that the real heart of any game is how the  game plays
graphics mean absolutely diddlyand anyway sshhbb has  great graphics
players faces are mapped onto their bodies they run  throw and bat realistically different batters stances are accurately  depicted the stadiums are accurate down to the advertising and the color  of the infield dirt what game were you playingand as far as the  gameplay goes sshhbb has wonderful gameplay
you can play as pitcher  batter pitcher and batter or manager
there are myriad options for  customizing your game making management decisions etc etc plus the  game offers x different modes exhibition mode to play a single game  matching any two teams season mode to play a whole season career mode to  theoretically play as long as you can creating your own stats hall of  fame on and on and on
there are also batting practice and home run derby  modes
man ive had this game a week and i already know my girlfriend  will kill herself for buying it for me
bottom line great graphics
stellar gameplay
incredible depth plus infinite tweaking available in  the tunetxt file
this game has it all and i suspect ill be playing it  even more than i played hardballnow before we begin this review lets get this straight
if you have come into this game thinking that it is like unrealunreal tournament just because it was made on the unreal engine you are totally wrong
now that we have that out of the way in this game you start out as a viking warrior who is taking revenge
smooth gameplay and special things such as rune power make this game one that you will be playing until you beat it one or two times
rune also allows multiplayer capabilites to increase the carnage
the overhead view of the character is that of metal gear solid or tenchi both playstation games metal gear a pc game now
get this game if you want a keeper good luckdiary of ragnar jarlsonth of june passed my manhood trials today
had to fight the best warrior in the villiage whos a pushover
didint even break out a sweat
then that nasty guy conrack attacked our longboat and sank it
everyones deadexcept for me
after swimming through lots and lots of underwater caverns im now fighting my way past snake things goblins and crabs
this doesnt feel right
im a viking
shouldnt i be fightinguhother vikings
running around caverns killing snake things doesnt really fit into the job description of viking
oh well i shouldnt complain
its easy to do all the stuff a viking can do like run jump swim and attack wtih my weapons
need to get bigger swordsnd of june spent my second day in hel today fighting zombies
man these buggers are everywhere
and there are still more crab things to fight
at least i keep getting bigger and better weapons
hel itself is an interesting place to vist but im not sure i want to live here
lots of lava huge caverns and that creepy chick hel talks to me occasionally in that creepy voice of hers
no wonder odin banished her down herethere were a few tricky traps as well
i have to watch out everywhere to make sure i dont get burned to a crisp or worse
right now im in a room that has a lot of stone platforms lying on the ground and the floor is made out of steel grills
hmmmaybe that switch will do somethingrd of june note to self  do not pull every switch you see in hel
im lucky to have escaped with burned feet and those rooms filled with spinning sharp insturments wasnt too pleasant either
but ive gotten bigger weapons
i was lucky to get out of this mountain range but damn its cold out here in the snow
wish i had a shirt
guess its into that fortress in the distance for meth of june at last im fighting actual vikings
too bad there are a lot of them and they have very sharp curvey axes
the good thing is ive got one of those axes in my hands already stained with the blood of many dark vikings
hehe
good thing my foes are pretty stupid
i can just walk backwards let em come forward and then slash once
rinse and repeat until they die
works every time
i do admit the food here is quite tasty
if i take a drink of mead or as other people call it beer my health suddenly goes up and its fun to smash the mug afterwards
sure beats eating lizards all the timeand i keep getting bigger weaponsth of june finished going through some rather big mountains
keep getting bigger weapons keep killing goblins and fighting giant snow beasts
no places to stay around here but the scenery sure is prettybut a thought about my weapons
why did odin in his infiniate wisdom let the rune powers i aquire last less then thirty seconds
i risk my life to fill up my power bar and most of my weapons deplete over half of it when i use the rune magic
in my opinion using power for only thirty seconds when you risk your life for it is not really worth it
but i have to admit freezing enemies is quite coolth of june im finally out of the dwarf city
those little punks were a pain in the butt
they sure are ugly they have riddiculously huge feet and they sound funny
but at least i picked up some bigger weapons along the way
this huge bloodstained hammer sure is mighty satisfying to carry and swing around
and i got this nifty suit of viking armor as well
ive started to notice at this point that all i do nowadays is fight fight fight fight fight pull a switch fight fight jump jump fight and fight
but at least the scenery changes a lot so i never get bored exploring the enviornment
and i still get to fight zombiesth of june i think this will be my last entry
that punk conrack is down here somewherei can feel it
and it helped that odin appeared and told me that
i have to hunt him down and take him outbutits creepy down here
there are lots of zombies but theyre changing
getting biggerstrongermore demonicand that laughterim not sure what lies before me
ive gotten all the weapons that ill find on my quest
and the last ones have been huge
that dwarf battle axe in paticular is so large i can barely lift it let alone swing itoverall its been a fun hack and slash quest
im so glad i havent had to push any boxes just have to flip switches and jump a lotif odin gave me the chance id gladly go on this quest again
its a lot of funbut my destiny calls me
i must continue onwards
the laughter is getting louder and my heart is beating faster with feari must press onthis game rules
for all you wussies out there who whine about it being to hard i laugh
thats what we said about super mario bros when it first came out
this game is a fast paced fight for your life thrill ride
what better way to spend the evening getting the crap scared out of you
it may be difficult but thats what they said about half live too
for those out there who whine about it being to hard maybe you guys should stick with it and learn how to play in a combat situation
the marine was actually easy once you got to know his assesstsi admit this game was not a walk in the park but thats what made it so much fun
if you want a fast paced run amuck and blow the other guy away type of game this is a must have for youthe product was shipped on time and there was no damage to it at all
its one of the very few avp games out there that actually meets quality standards of the franchise
who cares about the blocky graphics when the game play and story are exactly how they should be and more i was very pleased with my purchaseive been a first person shooter fan since wolfenstein but for some reason didnt pick this one up until now
id heard it was insanely difficult and had no save game feature which was true
however the gold version has a save anywhere feature that comes in really handy
the graphics are somewhat dated by todays standards but the engine they used lithtech i think but i could be wrong im guessing by the look was very imaginatively utilized resulting in some really beautiful levels
i mean you feel like youre in the movie
level one is mostly indoors but level two gets you outside into a really beautiful bluishtinted and rainy area
very moody
ive only had experience playing as the marine and im only on the second level so youll have to take that into account when you read this
you start out in a room and the first thing you notice is someone is talking to you
turns out its a commanding officer talking through a videophone on the wall
this feature is superbly used as your friend keeps you up to date on your situation as you progress and you can see him and hear him talking to you at various points
it doesnt sound like much i know but after some extended alone time running into one of these monitors and seeing and hearing your commanding officer again is a huge relief to your lonliness
its a phychological thing mostly but it really works
and im not sure how they did it but they flawlessly incorporated these fullmotion video scenes into the engine into small screens on the walls and at computer stations so it looks perfectly natural
after exploring a bit i discovered another huge aid the image intensifier
youll use this a lot in darker areas and once again the makers did a fantastic job of making this effect look just like youd think an image intensifier should look
also theres a motion tracker just like in the movie which lets you know where the aliens are
just hearing that beep is enough to raise gooseflesh without even seeing anything
the first alien i ran into was totally unexpected and i about fell out of my chair when it came at me
the developers did a fine job of creating the beasts
the surroundings are surreal and will cause your imagination to run wild
sound effects are firstrate too especially the ambient sounds and they are positional meaning if theyre to the left youll hear them from your left speaker
this is possibly the scariest game i have ever played
that honor used to go to the quotthiefquot games but those games used more tensionfilled fear than true gutlevel nightmaretype fearthe box gives a pentium  as minimum and recommends a pii  but i installed it on my pii  with  mb ram and a voodoo  video card and it ran absolutely smoothly at full detail
i also installed it on a pii  with  mb ram and a first generation nvidia tnt  video card and it performs flawlessly there too
it is one of the smoothestperforming games i own
sure its a couple years old but it looks great and is sure to become one of those classics youll be looking for later if you dont get it now
also i highly recommend playing this with all the lights off and at night
and not because of the mood though playing in the dark will certainly enhance the mood
i recommend playing in darkness more because if theres any kind of light glaring on your screen you wont be able to see well
this is a very dark game and ive found that at night with all lights off you can see all you need to
but dont forget to use the image intensifieryoull need it in places
if you can stand the fear this game is a musthavethis game is something to shout about
let me rephrase that  these  games are something to shout about
thats basically what you get
the different characters are varied enough to make this a highly original fps  which has features important enough to make it a landmark fps
it may not  be halflife or ss but its damnright up there with the best of them this  must be the best movie spinoff of all time
the games mirror the movies so  much
from the sounds the aliens and predators make to the way the predator  uses his medikit
every aspect of the movie is there
the marine levels are  the scariest i have ever seen
aliens appear from nowhere and with surround  sound i guarantee you will jump in fright in no timethe cut scenes are  gorgeous and once you complete a game there are bonus levels
you have to  complete the game on the hardest level to get all of themthis game also  saw the first use of limited game saving per level
this is great as you  cant save your game every  seconds
this has been seen in later games  since
you will replay bits and it is tough but at least you have to use  your brain and skill a bit morethe marine levels were my favourite  followed by the predator
each character has different attack modes and  ways of moving
for instance the predator can survive high jumps while the  alien is the quickest and hardest to hit but takes most damage
learnin  these skills is a key to sucess
there are also nice touches like the  predator being able to pull the heads off marines and aliens blood spraying  at youthe predator has the different vision modes while the alien has  the fish vision mode
while a marine it sometimes felt like half life but  its the closest youll get to being in the movie
the guns make the same  noise theres the constant beep of the detector which speeds up as an alien  gets closer
it cant be faulted for realismthe multiplayer aspect is  super also as you get to fight a mixture of baddies
theres a big online  contingent of players out there
afrer quake unreal tournement and team  fortress this probably comes next in the hierarchythe only fault is  that there could have been more levels and maybe the storyline could have  been a bit better being picky
still this does not detract from a pc  classic with gripping atmosphere and moments that will give you  nightmaresit is a great fps even without the movie license which should  appeal to fans of both the movie and gaming genrei cannot say enough  good things about this game
especially in a time when fps are  a penny
this has new elements like the save options  game modes and vision modes  that makes this a cut above most other fps out there
this game has added  to the fps genre for sure
you can almost hear the cries of quotgame over  man game overquot
go get it nowalien vs predator gold is a fantastic game difficult at times terrifying and completely addictive
there is also a great multiplayer option that takes place in office cubicles
the scale is a bit off but the  ability to blow up the computers on the desk along with the enemy is  wonderful
another great thing about the gold addition is that it comes  with the full manualthis is a fun fast and frantic game
it is a must for any dreamcast collection
its great for solo play or to play with friendslike i just said the name really throws people off and makes them think this is a babys game
no baby could handle thisthis is a very fun game with incredible dreamcast graphics
the music makes this more suspensful and more fun
the gameplay is sweet and the puzzles can confuse and frustrate you
play online or with a couple of friends
of course you can play by yourselfso if the name is stopping you from buying this game dont let it
i did until my brother bought it and now i always want to barrow itso dont be fooled by the name and dont miss out on this incredible gamethis game is incredibly simple yet dangerously addictive basically it is a game of cat and mouse you have a rocket positioned on the game field and you have to lead chu chus mice to your rocket by placing arrows for them to follow
if you or your opponents lead a kapu kapu cat into your rocket you lose a third of all the mice you have collected so far
whoever has the most mice after three minutes wins
throw in the fact that some mice trigger special events mouse mania cat mania speed up etc
and also that you can only place three directional arrows at a time and you have a fantastic fastpaced puzzleparty game that should be in any selfrespecting dreamcast owners selection
the best moments in this game are those panicstricken moments when you have  seconds left and youre losing by  mice
can you lead that cat to the winning rocket in time and take the lead
only one way to find outwhile the game has brilliant puzzle and challege modes that will keep you occupied for a while the brilliance of the game lies in its multiplayer modes
play with up to four players two teams of two or four single players on one dreamcast for ultimate party fun and black eyes if it gets out of hand and it usually does
or if you cant persuade your friends to join you play with three other people online
the online play is excellent
lag is definitely a factor but you just have to get used to the fact that there is a delay and treat it as a challenge to think ahead
the online menu interface is very simple to use and it is easy to find and play your friends up in north dakota or out in oklahoma
the server lets japanese and american players play simultaneously and surprisingly the lag is no different to when all players are local
sadly there is now a slew of other online games which means interest in chu chu rocket a pioneer in dreamcast online gaming is waning
there are a loyal group of followers who play online however and it isnt too difficult to get a game or two especially in the evening when the server is at its busiest
during the day the chances of finding someone to play a game is remote although if you hang around for a few minutes you can usually bump into a lost soul from tokyo whos willing to take you on
there is a ranking table for online players but youll have to win over  games if you want to take the  spotyou can still enjoy the multiplayer mode on your own using the computer ai which is generally very intelligent
you can set the level of difficulty to suit your skill levelthe puzzle mode should not be overlooked as it has some very interesting and frustrating
puzzles to complete
and if the many puzzles arent enough for you im at  and still going
then you can make your own
if you think theyre good enough you can upload them onto the internet for other players to dowload and try and of course you can download other peoples puzzlesthere is also a stage challenge mode where you have to finish  challenges as fast as possible
this is much easier if you persuade a friend to help you
you can upload your times onto the internet to see how you rank in the world but dont expect to see your name near the top unless youre prepared to spend a lot of time perfecting each challengethe graphics of the game are quite sufficient
theyre simplistic and colorful they are in full d too
although they arent exactly pushing the dreamcast to its limits they are perfect for the game
one bonus is that the game only uses  blocks of your vmu memory card space so you can use those precious  remaining blocks to save those vmuhungry games in your collectionthis game is well worth the money if puzzlemultiplayer games are your thing
if you hate all puzzle games then dont bother but if you are looking for a departure from your usual dreamcast gaming then you will undoubtedly find this an enjoyable game to own
it simply oozes fun all over something many newer games lack
go for it you wont be disappointed as long as you dont expect an earthshattering gaming experience
if you want a simple frenetic game to pop into your dreamcast every now and then and relieve stress this is a musthavei had never been much of a fan of strategy or rpg games so i didnt really expect to find ogre battle  much fun
a friend that owns the game also expressed his disappointment when he lent it to me he didnt like the little control you have over your troops attack nor did he like the traveling that you must do in the overworld
despite all of these reasons i figured that i should give ogre battle  a try
i checked out the tutorial first and although it was helpful it was unbelievably boring
the graphics werent anything special
the only thing i liked about them were the fact that they looked like the type of people in harvest moon  oh well
sound effects are simple and the music isnt entirely catchyhowever as soon as i started my own file i realized why this game is so popular among the critics and the gamers
this isnt your typical rpg
sure you can level up and change your character type but its not one where you keep on fighting until your enemy dies
nope
battles only go on for a limited amount of time and you win if you deal more damage than the other unit
each unit has a leader
if the enemy units leader dies the unit will retreat even if they had won
if you weaken an opposing unit then they can either heal themselves or retreat to a stronghold and recuperate
it is always desireable to slaughter the enemy units leader but he or she can be protected
there are different classes to deal with and they have different attacks
yeah
the strategy in this game can get pretty complex
usually i dont enjoy this type of strategy but i found ogre battle  strangely addicting
i also loved the sheer amount of customization that is possible
you can change the names of all of the soldiers in your legion and even tinker with their classesi had originally criticized this game for having a faulty save system
however i was later informed that one can indeed save between missions like i wanted by saving in the map screen that plays between missions
previously i had just ignored everything and went on to the next mission so i suppose it wasnt surprising that i was missing everything that the map screen offers
and the map screen does offer a lot that i was missing out
for example not only does it give you an option to save but it also gives you an option to read more about the story and the characters and it even lets you watch past cutscenes
there are a lot of cutscenes but they are all text
there is even a hidden and quite amusing cutscene celebrating the birthday of your character
not only that but in the map screen you can fight enemies for training your troops in bitter battles to the death
knowing about this save feature has completely revived my interest in the game
there had been so much that i was missing out in ogre battle  but with this newlydiscovered save tactic i can confidently roll on
and a game of such lordly caliber deserves itthis is my favorite game of all time
period
other games have made bold and valiant attempts such as final fantasy x and harvest moon
but none can compare the the masterpiece that is ogre battle  i have always been a fan of the rpg and i picked this game up with mild expectations
i hold high standards for my games you see
and lots of games just dont cut it
they are good but not great
and thats what i expected from ogre battle
but what i got was the most fufilling game adventure of my life
an army groups in the army  characters to a group males females clases upgrades of classes beasts dragons undeads angles and thats not even including the special people such as carth destin and meridia
then you could go into the customizable weapons and armor
all wraped up into an easly managable batallion at your command
if this isnt gaming bliss i dont know what isi haved play this awasome game since  and still playing this amazing game and i keep  find it new content in to the game  every time i played it again and again new item or soldier  or character to create  show it up this is the best strategy game ever played  as  final fantasy tactics but ogre battle has  alot reply value amean alot 
and for a special classes  of solders  custume and  new weapons you can go to atlus page and find out that you have miss a brand new game to play ang get a new content tp play and accesories for the game characters after played and beaten  over many times   to be exacly
i have found  to  difernt endining 
buy this game for downlode at nintendo via wiifor a low price recomended gameogre battle is definetly one of my favorite strategy games of all time
very challenging tons of secrets to unlock characters weapons etc
 great game concept and ridiculous amounts of replay value  go ahead and take the path of evil if you want the game changes to suit your style
that being said lets take a look at what youre getting yourself into herethis is not a quickly paced game
your button mashing skills are completely worthless here
you will not have to put in  move combos
in fact you dont even directly participate in fighting
think of yourself as a general
you assemble your troops give them their orders and send them out on the field
you can direct their movements but once they engage the enemy the battle is decided by the computer based on how you have arranged your men and how strong they are
its all about planning
what kind of units do you want
where will you send them
what style of fighting should they engage inand thats just the basics
night and day play a role in combat as does terrain youre on deployment costs and a host of other factors that youll have to experience for yourself
playing this game through to the end will take you quite a while especially if you go hunting on all the side quests highly recommended
its an awesome game but dont expect an rpg
its straightup strategy at its bestand im going to be sad when it fails to continue keeping a save
but hey if dragonquest  can be over  years old and the actual nes cartridge can still keep a save then theres no reason this game shouldnt still keep a save for a few more yearsi love this game
a lot of the time i want a game no matter what the magazines say but i originally didnt want this one
that changed when i read a walkthrough in nintendo power and they talked about how indepth it was
i wanted to at least try it but eventually decided to straight up buy it
this game was what i played almost all the way through high school despite already having the playstation and ps to worry about
i didnt get either system til much later
i loved my nintendo  then and i still love my nintendo  now
for a video game system i equate it to a teddy bear although i dont cuddle it like i would an actual teddy beartruth be told ogre battle  was my first outing with the ogre battle series
it actually inspired me to play the playstation one when i got that systemand im still waiting for a home console followup
not necessarily a sequel to this one but a new home console ogre battle
atlus doesnt care if a game sells
theyre a cult publisherdeveloper whatever they do and ogre battle  is a cult game
they need to get with the people who made this game and make them work on a new ogre battle already
theres plenty of people who would buy it
myself includedi was quite surprised by how much i am enjoying this game
i absolutely love it
it throws you into the action right away and keeps you wanting more from the get go
there is so much customization and so many interesting characters to collect and develop it really draws you in and keeps you thinking about all your options for the whole game
the combat can be a little slow at times but once you get used to the pace it doesnt bother you
sometimes it even seems to be going too fast when bad things start happeningthis game is amazing fun and any rpg fan should own itmy wife bought this game for me and although i probably wouldnt have picked it for myself i gave it a chance
it turned out to be one of those games that is kind of tough to get into at first but once you do impossible to put down
this game ate up a big chunk of my time the first weekend i had it and i play for a little while every night after work
the storyline is just amazing its like a good fantasy novel
i find myself playing to find out whats going to happen next
the ability to choose and answer questions that alter the story and your characters alignment really gets you involved
the battle system is really simple and everything is explained within the game
at first i thought i was going to get bored because you dont have a lot of control over the actual battle but it turns out that choosing classes formation and equipment is just as much fun
also there are many missions where you must dispatch other units which adds to the strategyall in all hightly reccomended
there arent many n games that have real longterm singleplayer value
this one doesif nintendo would remake this game for gamecube i would be in heaven
but until then i will continue to play this epic saga on n
i have played this game to the finish  different times
each time it gets even beter
i get to have new characters who join me and different outcomes ensue
if you want a game where you lead an army of awesome characters then this here game is for youyour main character is magnus gallant a young rookie assigned to lead more rookies on missions to liberate the kingdom of palatanius
on his journey magnus sides with the rebels leaves the kings army and joins the revolutionary army
thus your mission beginsdid i read something about old school graphics
who cares
you tend to overlook something so minor because this game will keep you in awe
there must be some comprise when you have a game this large coming from an old school cartridge
where this game lacks in graphics it more than makes up for it in storyline and game play
and in the end is that not what its all aboutyou have the ability of leading many teams and different fighters
i recommend that you keep your teams to a minimum
you can have up to  characters fighting on a team so i would totally utilize that
you can and will change your character classes and i would implore you to train your teams between and before starting new missions so that they are always strong
the higher the levels of your characters the more classes you have to choose from
plus the lesser amount of teams you have means the more they will be fighting and the more experienced and stronger they becomei would also suggest turning most of your female classes to sorceress or sirens and your males as fighters
females tend to take more damage and die easily unless you put them in the back
from the back those sorceress can become mighty powerful they are actually my favorite characterstry to match the characters alignments with the appropriate classes
alignment is key in this game
if you need low alignment characters train them up their level and have them fight high alignment enemies and if you need high alignment characters have them fight teams with higher level and low alignment
when you go into battle you will need to analyze your teams and your enemies teams their fatigue and levels
do not hesitate to retreat if you need to try to never have a character diethis game is very long it requires alot of strategy and thinking
there are many sidequests that you must do to get special items to turn your characters into special classes
always check out hugos reports and his events there is always valuble information there
do not even think twice about buying this game
it is actually my favorite game out of all the new systems out there
it does not get any better than thisi was blown away when i first started playing
new moves new weapons a whole lot more variety when it comes ot stealtn fatalities
the graphics  are very good and the enemies are creative and quite entertaining
if you  like violence then this is for you
more blood and death then ever
if  you liked tenchu then you will surely be astonished by what tenchu  has  to ofter
in my mind tha greates game in its genrein my opinion tenchu  is the best game of the trilogy is the only tenchu game that is sooo realistic and more accessible
of course it have some flaws comparing it with the first gametenchu  the stealth kills are very realistic but more difficult to do
the bad guys are soo suspicious
 the combo fighting system is cooler
 the character desing is awesome
 you can enable the japanese voices
 you can play a flute to distract the bad guys
 the game follow the real code of the ninja you dont have to kill everyone to get the grandmaster rank
 sho kosugi and his son kane kosugi collaborated with the ninja movements in the game
 some characters like to fight or die in the name of honor
 the missions are kind of harder
 a very good game to remember the best decade of videogames the stenchu  the graphics and movements are sooo realistic
 the items are many and much cooler you can use the poison darts as a instant steath kill
 you can swim or hide underwater
 there are daylight and nightime missions mainly nightime
 there are no silly magic demons
 you can use a chameleon camouflage instead of a silly bad guy dress
 the story is longer detailed and more emotional
 there are three main characters instead of two
 there is more violence
 more stealth kills
 you can create your own missions
 there are more stages and there are massive 
 you can put out your sword anytime you want
 no music on the missions which makes the game more realistici preffer tenchu  because tenchu wrath of heavens overcame the first tenchu
if i want to play the first tenchu i preffer to play wrath of heavens but as long i have the poison darts swim underwater mission editor and a good detailed emotional story i will stick with this oneadiosi was a big fan of tenchu  sneaking around getting behind the guard and chopping off his head
my main complaint about it was that it was just too short
only  levels it only took me two weeks to beat
i soon found out that tenchu  was out so like i always do i rushed out to get iti soon started playing and i was amazed
the control while a little hard to get used to let you do more with your character than in tenchu  new things such as rolling big jump and crawling on walls are now used
also new were more missions  in all a third playable character a killer level editor and many more stealth kills
coolreviewers hammered tenchu  with its one main flaw the camera
yes the camera was a pain in a lot of areas but it actually is not that bad after a while
the only time i really had problems with it was during the boss battles
also there is some slowdown in some of the missions but it usually lasts for only a couple of seconds
also the voice acting while better than the first tenchu is still very badanyway with all the flaws aside tenchu  is a lot of fun
youll be playing for hours just trying to achieve different kinds of stealth kills
the missions will take you a while to beat and the replay value is great with the level editor
pick up this and the first tenchu
they are definitely worth your time and moneyi played tenchu  for the first time about  months agothat got me hooked and i recently bought tenchu  more great stuffi didnt buy tenchu  at first since i heard it was inferior to tenchu  and tenchu  appears to be only available usednevertheless in reality tenchu  is quite a bit better than tenchu  some extras that make tenchu  sweet build your own game levels  if you use the free psx emulator you can download and play levels that other people make graphics are better in tenchu  than tenchu  graphics are significantly better if you play it on the psx emulator since it takes advantage of the full resolution of your modern pc i can play it at x on my laptop
 comes with a real tutorial  unlike tenchu  and  the tutorial is weaved into the game where you first practice as an apprentice ninja on a number of obstacles before being tested by your master ability to swim and breath under water thru a pipe is cool ability to drag dead bodies to avoid having them be discovered is coolthese last  elements make the ninja sim more complete than the other  gamesdefinitely worth getting new or used
dont worry if you cant get the documentation on the used versions the controls are well documented on the webthis game came in today
i played right away
it is a good game
i remember playing this game when i was younger
now i can play it again
good storyok i like all the tenchus thay are cool but this one in my book is the best one of all you pick for two character and a unlock character in this one you can pick how you kill bad guys in a lot of diffrent ways one way you can duck get close behind him hold duck and push square when close try it eny way you can make you very own levels i made some realy cool levels but thats me many people like the st one better thanks for readinga game a friends asked me to get for him before he had access to the internet so i got it for him so thank youtenchu
need i say more
this is a prequel to the first one
you play as rikimaru and ayame two ninjas on a quest to protect a lord and destroy the burning dawn a mysterious ninja group
stealth gameplay and one hit kills are what makes this game awesome
did i forget ninja gadgets like shurikens smokebombs and poisoned rice
they are all therei fell in love with this game when it first came out years ago
and there arent or werent many microsoft games i could easily say that about
yeah its not the greatest space combat sim ever but its well worth the play and i have enjoyed it over and over againif you dont know much about the game think space above and beyond
if you didnt watch that tv show from the mids its finally out on dvd so think about picking it up to watch it and youll understand the allure of starlancer to someone like myselfim not a multiplayer kind of guy so i never used the multiplayer function
i preferred single player missions onlyi think the various fighters you get to pilot provide an excellent variety along with the plethora of different types of guns and missiles you can arm your fighter with
the only thing i would have loved was the option to trade out your fixed guns for different types of guns
that would have made an excellent game absolutely superbwhat more is there to say
if you are a fan of realistic space combat sims then this game probably isnt for you
if you liked space above and beyond youll probably like this game toothis is in my top two favorite games of all time
the story is engaging
the world is fantastic looking
its like you get a shooting platform puzzle fighting rpg mystery game all in one
it is like the ultimate game
if i could make a game i would make this game
it has david bowie songs in it to
from one of his best albums
how can you go wrongomikron the nomad soul quantic dreams first game known for their work on titles such as indigo prophecy and heavy rain is an incredibly ambitious game that brings story acting atmosphere and more all into one game
while its lacking in some key areas such as the overall gameplay which is slightly clunky in its execution as well as its technical execution as it happens to suffer from a good amount of loading as it struggles to stream in the open world environment and theres also some framerate hiccups all over the placetheres no doubt that the dreamcast version of omikron the nomad soul was possibly too ambitious for the hardware as its very taxing on the system but it doesnt hurt the overall impact that the story and ambiance will bring to the player
this is a deep and rewarding roleplaying game that mixes combat platforming and more all into a game that is so rich and dripping with atmosphere that you wont want to stop playing
fantastic characters plot environments music all by david bowie who is actually in the game etc makes this one experience that is  unforgettable despite being plagued by technical issues
buy this gamewhen it say for mature  they meant it
with guts foot sword you are bond to go berserk yourself
the game features  types of grotesque enemies each with unique and fearsome attacks fight in two combat modes  including the devastating berserk rage powerful combination moves and four weapons guts possess over  hour of engrossing cinematic movie sequences superb high resolution graphics with fluid combat animations quick time events within each level test reflexes and increae the action
this game is not for the faint at heartthis game isnt the most popular hack and slash but its surely a great one
the dreamcast never had a chance its a shame really
this game alone is what proved to me the potential the dreamcast hadberserksword of the berserk guts rage is summed up as this its one hell of a game
in fact its pretty much an interactive movie with over an hour of dramatic cinemas but thats a good thing
the storyline is quite possibly the best ive ever heard of in a video game revolving around a mercenary named guts who is desperate to find a cure for his lover casca who is suffering from a disease leaving her with the mind of a child and is accompinied by a naked flying elf named puck
there is a disease in the village that causes people to have the same symptoms casca has but i wont spoil any more surprises from there
guts carries with him a sword called dragon slayer which measures taller than guts and when you fight hordes and hordes of enemies you learn why he is called guts in the first place
its simple hack and slash action with a superb storyline based on a japanese manga incredible graphics rivaling those of code veronica alone in the dark and sonic and some of the best game music youll ever hear
an overlooked gem of a game if you own a dreamcast you should own this its that damn goodwell now you can cut your patientsenemies into bits and pieces
you can actually chop some of your opponents in half and you see their insides for a second before their body disapears
this is a very bloody game and the action is very fast paced
its not slow and time consuming like some resident evil games
another great feature is that this game has great movie sequences
i felt like i was watching a good computer animated dvd movieif you liked the furious acrtion and gore in spawn the game then youll definitly love sword of the beserkwell this is a great game
it starts where sonic goes on a trip to find adventure
he returns only to find all his animal friends missing
he then finds a note from tailsquotsonic robotnik has kidnapped me
he says that if you dont bring six chaos emeralds to his lair hell kill mequotsonic sets off on the hardest sonic game apart from sonic spinball
the levels areunderground zonefans expected green hill first but this level was there instead
its quite funsky high zonethis is quite a fun level but act  is too anoyingaqua lakeon act  this seems easy
but act  is the hardest single act in the gamegreen hilldoes it need any introduction
this is the most popular sonic level evergimmick mountain zonethis is one of the best levels in the gamescrambled egg zoneyouve found robotnik but if you dont have all the chaos emeralds you wont go to the next levelcrystal eggthis is the last level in the game
its quite hard but beating robotnik feels goodverdictthis is a great game with lots of hidden stuff
the gameplay is also goodan old game never really goes out of style
same is true with this game
it is an old game that has never gone out of style
as the levels go on we find them to become harder and harder
but the game is still easy enough for people of any age to finish the game
a great game overallwhile sonic  for game gear was a good game it didnt have much of the highspeed action we expected
sonic  on the other hand contains thatsonic  for game gear is not what you expect to be if you had played the genesis version it has a completely different storyline and zones
tails is kidnapped by robotnik and sonic must save him
isnt tails supposed to be the sidekickanyways the gameplay is identical to the genesis games which is great
the music and sounds were still welldeveloped
what is kind of a letdown is that there are no special stages
you gotta find the chaos emeralds in the zones themselves
theres your challenge for yaoverall its another great sonic gamethat was eclipsed by the more wellknown genesis versionthis game is similar to sonic  with the graphics and scenery but this time tails is playable
you have to go against nack knuckles and eggman hence the name triple trouble as either sonic or tails to restore peace to south island
this title for the game gear has an abundance of action with sonics new moves and tails ability to fly
this is also one of two games on game gear to feature nack the weasel which shouldnt be restricted to the archie sonic the hedgehog comic books
nack the weasel was also included in the arcade game sonic the fighters which i only have in sonic gems collection for the gamecube because the arcade machine is impossible to findas fang the sniper and sonic drift  for the game gear as a racer
but this game shows how nack can give sonic hell as one of three bosses
this is truly a classici love this sonic triple trouble game
at first this game started out being hard
now every night i practice on beating the levels
the special stages is sort of hard especially the last special stage
im still practicing on that one
other than that sonic triple trouble is a good game and i highly recommend this game to anyone that still have their sega game gear systemif the mmpr titles on segas wholly handheld device didnt convince you then triple trouble may especially if youre a sonic fan
and lets be real who isnti got my game gear in its heyday and cherished it ever since
i have only about  games but that was enough to satiate my desires until i saved enough for a playstation
sonic chaos was my first dive into the world of the blue blur
then on one christmas i arrived home after visiting my family on the eve
santa had visited while we were away and my kid sister and i raced to the tree and tore the gifts before my parents could take their coats offi remember receiving a few gifts but all i can remember is a lion beanie baby and a copy of sonic triple trouble
i had been eyeing this particular title for a while as it had knuckles whom i thought looked really cool
i remember thumbing through gaming magazines at the grocery store while my mom shopped and knuckles had already appeared in genesis titles
when i found out triple trouble would include i knew i had to get that gameto this day tt remains one of my favorite sonic titles and ive played through most of them from the d era into the d jump
theres actually more than one villain this time around as the eggman takes a step backgoing from chaos to tt youll notice some differences with graphics
though subtle they are much improved especially with the sprites
youll see more liveliness in sonic and tails try standing next to edge and youll see what i mean and environments are much more detailed
chaos had a narrower pov but youll get more screen candy in ttthe music is fantastic
sunset park act  remains one of my favorite sonic songs to date
too bad not many have heard itthis is a great gem any gamer should trytriple trouble to me is kind of like a game gear equivalent to sonic  for the genesis
like sonic chaos you get to play as either sonic or tails i actually prefer the latter
like a d sonic game you go through several zones destroy the bosses at the end and defeat dr robotnik and demolish his evil plansthe game borrows stuff from sonic  and sonic cd
sonic can do the peelout dash and tails can fly for a certain timeoverall its your average classic sonic game for that competitor of the game boysega at the time really cared about the quality of their sonic games so they tried to put a genesis style game onto the gamegear
it is epic
sonic runs through loop de loops something that everybody said was impossible for an bit system and then added cutscenes and a d bonus stage
take that gameboyif there are video games taht have truly stood up to the tests of time its the sonic the hedgehog video game seriesback in the days when video games for the most part were just plain clean fun and not the gorefests they are now sonic the hedgehog was and still is the defining video game series of my lifetimethe controls are very goodwhile many would argue that the graphics are dated and while they may be very dated by  standards this game was many years ahead of its time and i still love every moment of this gameone of the greatest things about this classic video game that i have enjoyed was the music
wow
looking back on it now i have to say that the music was just amazing for video game music
i could very well say that i remember the music almost by heart
my favorite level music was on the quotscrap brain zonequot levels  through  and let me tell you i havent loved video game music like i did on this leveloverall the video game music was incredible
if only my sega genesis system were still working i would still be playing this but since age finally took its toll on both the cartrige and the system i feel sad at seeing a great era in my life in video games come to a close
i still find myself humming to the music on the quotscrap brain zonequot level even to this day years after last playing this gamesonic the hedgehog is in my opinion the greatest video game series of all time
mario and crash bandicoot may offer competition in this field but sonic the hedgehog came first for mei find it to be one of the greatest entertainment tragedies seeing one of my childhood favorite activies video games decline from good clean fun and degerate into nightmareinducing blood baths of gore and violencewhatever the case between mario sonic and crash bandicoot let me just say that it is the sillier games like these three game series that have truly lasted as opposed to the countless gorefests that video games that are forced down our throatsi say they  should rereleased the sonic games that were on sega genesis onto an archives video game set for the computer or for the newest video game systems in the near futureif this game is put back in print i will be first in line to regain this game so that my children can enjoy the fun i had iwth sonic the hedgehog years ago when i was working on sonic adventure dx  directors cut for the gamecube i discovered that you could unlock  different game gear games that were sonic related
for example  sonic chaos sonic drift tails skypatrol etc
this was exactly how i discovered  for the first time  sonic the hedgehog i had already beaten the genesis version several times so it was quite awesome to see how well sonic had translated to the game gear
mind you people the sega game gear actually had color when it was first released ie
because the game boy was several years behind with that particular feature
sonic the hedgehog  remains one of my favorite game gear installments of all timewhat stands out most about this installment is how well the levels music and graphics carried over such as the green hill zone labyrinth zone or scrap brain zone
but this is not an exact port of the genesis version  there are new kinds of levels to explore such as the jungle zone
if you are familiar with the sonic franchise then you know that you are required to collect all of the chaos emeralds if you want to watch the best ending to the gamei truly recommend that all gamers download this title for your nintendo ds posthaste because it is a must have
and just like sonic you should start getting speedy about it because theres no time to wasteif you have the game gear you have to get this game
probably one of the best games for the game gear sonic the hedgehog is sonics handheld debut
if you can get it for  or lower then you have to get it
i still never beat it yeah i suck at game gear games but its still  fun to try
it never gets tiring although its very challenging
the first boss has to be the easiest boss in sonic the hedgehog history but other then the bosses the levels are tough to master
i beat the genesis version but i still have trouble collecting all the chaos emeralds in this one
theyre scattered throughout the zones no special stages where you have to look everywhere to find them
the graphics are pretty good much better than gameboy games
i highly recommend it if youre a fan of sonic the hedgehog or own a game gearim am for sure this is the best game on the gamegear
its not hard or long but still super funnot much to say
the sonic  game on sega game gear is a fun game and its a little different from the sega genesis sonic  game
the green hill music is similar to the sega genesis sonic s green hill level
i like all the levels though
the sky base level is a little hard with the electric bolts flashing and trying to dodge the fireballs on sky base act  i highly recommend this game to anyone that still have their sega game gear systemthe sega game gear was the first handheld that sonic appeared on
i have to say the game gear was a little bit futuristic because it looked more like a game boy advancein this video game dr eggman has built a robot factory on top of south island
he has captured all of the animals and put them inside his robots to be his slaves and serve his evil purposes
whats worse his robot factory is polluting the island which means the wildlife will soon die
only one hero can save the islandthe hero with the type h personality h for hedgehog that is
thats right its sonicthe reason why i like this game is because it is very clever and the graphics are great and it has really cool music for each stage
hidden in each stage you will find a chaos emerald
collect them all to reveal the happy ending
if you end a stage with at least  rings you will get to go to the bonus stage
i like the idea of the pinballlike bonus stagesoverall  stars
a super fun game gear game
once you play it im sure you will agreeredone on the original sonic the hedgehog on the sega genesis was and always will be an alltime classic
however who wouldve thought that sonic would be so much fun on the bit game gear
as technically limited as the game gear was sonic was reworked to be a perfect fit for the handheld
the result was significantly different than the genesis hit but was nevertheless a great gameplayers were treated to a pretty good variety of levels
weve got green hill zone like in the original but now bridge zone and jungle zone come to replace the marble and spring yard zones
honestly i prefer those zones over marble and spring yard
they are just so much more fun to roam through although this game couldve gone just fine without an autoscrolling level
theres also sky base zone which takes place after scrap brain zone
it serves as an allnew challenge that sonic enthusiasts need to triumph over to deal with robotnik for the last time until a sequel comes around and then well have to beat him againthe graphics look gorgeous on the game gear and while it certainly cant beat the genesiss graphics capabilities they still look lovely and welldetailedthe music is arguably catchier in this version of sonic though
the allnew zones had really lively and upbeat tunes that just sounded so much better than the zones they replaced
not to mention the old zones that still exist on here aside from green hill have their tracks redone for the betterso how exactly does the game play
after all that is the most important aspect in a video game
well it doesnt pack any loopdeloops nor the many multiple paths or even the ability to recollect the rings you dropped after being attacked but it does offer plenty of the enemypouncing and ringcollecting that we also adore so much in the original game
plus the zones help affect certain elements of gameplay
green hill contains slopes bridge zone features crumbling platforms and autoscrolling in the second act jungle zone has some platforms being eroded by the waterfalls as well as running on logs and a level in which sonic must keep going up and up and not fall down whatsoever the bottom of the screen kills you etc
the game is not afraid to introduce players to new game mechanics as they advance through the levels and it is all the more satisfying for doing soone hook to the game is that there are  chaos emeralds sonic has to collect in order for the player to access the games good ending
where do you find these emeralds
well apparently you dont go into the special stages this time around to find them although the newly revamped special stages present here are pretty rad and you can earn extra livescontinues in them but rather do you go look in the levels themselves
yup thats right
exploration still manages to be a key element but this time for finding chaos emeralds
this quest for the good ending is nice way to add replay valueoverall sonics portable debut is a pretty awesome game
definitely pick this one up if you canif you dont have a game gear youre not out of luck  its available on sonic adventure dx as an unlockable game sonic mega collection plus and the sega master system version which is the same game with a few small differences is on the wii virtual consoleone of my favorite n games that i rented over and over when i was smaller
now i finally own it
its a classic kirby platforming gamemy kids love it
expect at the end where kirby and ribbon battle zero two that has some blood in it because if you shoot zero two with the crystal gun he shoots blood at youi had this game since i was a little kidprosgreat music for an old gamei still go on youtube listening to them to this dayfun and simple gameplaygreat graphicsthe simplicity overall is extremely funconsyou basically do the same thing just kill enemies so it can get boring once in a whilepretty shortthis was the first kirby game i ever got my hands on
and since then i have been playing numerous games from the series
i heard about the kirby series while playing super smash bros  i became skilled with kirbys character swallowing link and samus and using dks super punchthen i heard about the crystal shards on a commercial and got itit is indeed an excellent game
the story is thus kirby gets smacked on the head with a strange crystalline object and is thrust into an adventure with countless baddies deadly bosses and cool music
i particularly enjoyed combining two powers and make a new one
you could combine spark and freeze and turn kirby into a refrigerator in order to heal himself with food
or you could combine needle with freeze and turn kirby into a giant expanding snowflake that freezes enemies that come near it
pure ownagefor the most part this game is short and simple with the exception of a few levels and bosses on world  shiver star there are two difficult levels
and as for the bosses id have to say the boss of neo star is real coollooking and hardthe effects are what really give this game a significant boost in terms of quality the sound effects are devastating
when fighting mag man the boss of world  neo star it uses a special attack in which lava thrusts your platform into the ceiling you could hear the magnificent sound effect of searing lava lunging upward and it really amplified mag mans image as a boss characternot only are the effects great but so is the level design
each level has great detail enemy locations and great twists
on shiver star there is a level that most closely resembles a megamall in the winter time you can ride escalators elevators dodge colorful falling shelves
another exciting level would be the underground factory on the same world
the background art is astounding for this level you see tanks of frozen organisms that look extremely freakish there are strange grinning machines that try to crush you and there are tight spaces with cannons and the ceiling trying to crush you against the floor
whoaand the music goes along with the situation in the wintertime megamall level christmastype music plays
in the factory level mechanical percussion dominates
in the more pleasant grassy stages peaceful classic kirby music plays as you hop along swallowing guys for their powersthe only fault i found with this game was that i wish it was longer
if you ever get bored with it start collecting enemy info cards playing the multiplayer minigames listening to the sound tests and even trying to collect each and every crystal shard and experiment with various abilities
it is nigh impossible to be bored with this gamelet me make a comment on the graphics as well they are great
these graphics are worthy of a sega dreamcast they are not the traditional blocky graphics of several n games they are easily told apartthats all the info i need to state that this is easily one of the best n games out there
being a huge nintendo fan i highly recommend you buy this game
if you have an n without this game in your library i hope you find it because youll regret it if you dontmy kids love this game and it works wonderfully
it arrived in great shape and is so fun to playi know what youre thinking a sidescrolling adventure game for nintendo 
whod buy thatfear not
kriby  is a gorgeous and entertaining game
i had lots of fun playing it cutesy as it may seem
this is probably the best sidescrolling game ever everything looks d and the view actually pans and zooms as kirby moves along
unlike the highly cartoonish yoshis story this game manages to suck us into its colorful and whimsical worldsthe plot involves kirbys attempt to stop dark matteragain by finding all the broken shards of a powerful magic crystal
accompanying him on his quest are a cute little gut named waddle dee a fairy named ribbon a painter named adeline and kirbys old nemesis king dedede who is apparently trying to make up for his villainous past
their journey takes them to far distant planets and some very wierd localeskirby  takes things from previous kirby games and improves upon them
perhaps the best element of the game is kirbys copying ability
not only can he steal the powers of his enemies but he can actually combine them to create new outrageous abilites he can turn into a refrigerator shoot guided missles transform into a gigantic snowflake or weild a dark maulesque lightsaber  to name but a few
as for levels the game includes the usual meadowvolcanounderwatermountainetc
levels plus some inventive new ones
my favorites include an evil shopping mall a vast desert ufo and an oily sewer systemthe enemies are fun the bosses are inspired the music is extremely cool and the cinemas while wordless are wellmade and entertaining
all in all this is a great game for kirby fans and those who need a break from the likes of quotresident evilquot i really enjoyed it and im confident that many others will toops did i mention the multiplayer minigames
ah the magic wordskirby
this name brings back memories from ever since i was about maybe  years old
gameboy nintendo super nintendo in all these systems i owned kirby games were some of the most fun and enjoyable ones in the bunch
now after a year or so of waiting kirby  explodes onto the scenethe plot is this
a planet is being attacked by a strange and powerful enemy called dark matter
a fairy picking up the precious crystal of the planet escapes only to be followed by three smaller dark matters that separated from the large one
after a short and fast pursuit the three dark matters manage to shatter the crystal and knock the fairy out of conttrol
clutching a shard the fairy falls on pop star home of kirby and by chance lands on our hero
the fairy then asks kirby to help her find all the crystal shards and rescue her plnaet from the evil dark matter
with a glimspe into the sunset and a nod our hero excepts the task and begins his journey this is how it all beginsthis game can be explained in one word
great
its a cute but still awsomeley cool game
kirby now can hold up to two powers making great combinations to surpass the enemies and get through the somewhat challenging levels
experienced gamers will maybe find the game easy but in my opinion the game still holds a very good challenge
there is a lot to do you have to find all the crystal shards to see the full ending of the game and to fully beat it
its a great game for all kirby fans and even those who may not bethe multiplayer games are fun to play and support up to four gamers
the multiplayer games include a mad very cool battle on a checkerboard where the objective is to knock your oponent off by knocking the floor out from under him
the second is a hopping race where you have to avoid hazards such as frogs and water puddles to reach the finish line
the third and final is a fruit catching game where you must quotbumpquot your oponents out of the way to catch the most fruit
all of these are very fun and great for a family or a bunch of friendsthe graphics are an awsome mix of d and d elements that work together to create great looking levels
the flash of the electricity and the view of factory machines working in the background are very wellmade and cool to look atthe powers you recieve from inhaling enemies are very cool and some are even funny
in this game you can have up to two powers at once to create even stronger and better powers
the combos include a double light saber or even a very awsome looking fireworks show
a definate must see
in all these powers and combos just add to the games high fun factorthe characters are directly from the other games and some are new additions to the kirby collection of characters
good guys include waddledee a very cutecool dude that helps you by riding with you on rafts and working machines
an artist named adeline that in some levels supplies you with items to recover your life etc
the fairy that was attacked by the bad guy who sortof helps you by carrying the crystal shards
and finally king dedede an ancient rival of kirby who now sides with the pink dude and helps out by clearing obstacles and at times you even control him through parts of levels
all the characters are very cute cool and a help throughout the gamethe controls are easy to learn and the gameplay is excellent
you travel through many planets to reach the fairys planet and rescue it from dark matter
the whole game is filled with puzzles to solve and enemies to battle etc
the fun factor of this game is highthe sort of bad things about the game is that there isnt a two player mode for like the adventure mode
this would have been great but i mean its still a cool game
the other is that some of the levels are easy and the bosses can be easy at times
but still despite the cons that this game holds the game still rates very high for fun great multiplayer mode and an all out great game
the sound effects are great
when enemies are destroyed theres a sound like a pop or something and the music is exciting and keeps you in the spiritparents are also in for a treat
the game has no blood guts or gore a thing i beleive parents apreciate
the animated violence is really not bad a enemies just disapear with a puff of smoke or a crackle of electricity
this is a great game for any age
i recomend this game to kirby fans and anyone else who wants a game thats just fun to play
a definetly great game for anyone and well worth the moneyhey hes pink but just dont blink cause this cream puff is here to save the dayfrom an owner and gamer andrew h kingim reviewing this game based on the virtual console version because honestly this game is too expensivepeople say this game was too easy but this is actually one of the harder kirby games out there mass attack is probably the hardest in terms of actual gameplay while all the kirby games are hard for the  percent competition
this game required you to get the  percent completion to get to the final bossthe plot takes place after kirby dreamland  completing the dark matter trilogy consisting of kirby dreamland  and  plus this game
ripple star a planet full of little fairies is suddenly attacked
the queen of the fairies sends one fairy named ribbon away from the planet to protect the crystal shard that if it were to fall into the wrong hands would be devastating
as ribbon attempts to escape the dark matter chases after her
they managed to break the crystal sending it spiraling in different worlds
kirby is just enjoying star gazing when ribbon and a crystal falls on him
immediately he decides to help ribbon collect all the crystals and save her planet
joining kirby would later be a waddle dee who might as well be bandana dee from kirby return to dreamland a painter named adeline and king ddd as after saving them from the dark matter they all join kirby and ribbon on his questthis game was known for kirbys powers working differently
when kirby inhaled an enemy he would gain a power
this is one of the only games where kirby can combine the powers of his enemies and create a more powerful attack
for example getting a fire enemy and a boomerang foe would give kirby the ability to use a fire sword pretty broken in a lot of boss battles where he can choose to swing it protect himself from the top or throw it at the enemy in front of him
if you take two fire enemies the ability of doing a simple fire dash suddenly becomes a phoenix rush
the rock  cutter ability is one of the best abilities in the game turning kirby to stone and changing into one of his many friends from the previous game and each of them except kine can do special abilities along with kirby being immune to damage while stone the best is being able to fly higher than how far kirby can fly
which is another thing
this game gives kirby a limit to how much he can fly
you can tell as he starts drifting downward so no more flying over the stage or flying to dodge enemies for a long period of timethis game is divided into  worlds with a theme for each
the goal is to find all the crystals before moving on and its essential before getting to the final boss or get a bad ending
and finding the crystals that arent in pop star or the first stage isnt easy
the bosses are unique in the game and some power abilities are pretty useless depending on the stage
the game is also surprisingly creepy despite the cute cover
shiver star is probably one of the most speculated topics online especially since the common theory is shiver star is our planet earth and we as humans abandoned the place leaving it to machines that kill you in one hit and the planet freezes overyeahthis game is worth the buy on the virtual console
however this game is also available on the th kirby anniversary
it brings nostalgia back and has a good difficultyfeaturing our favorite pinkpuffball hero the crystal shards is a wonderful game that isnt too difficult but is challenging nonetheless
its a great adventure that will have you wanting to play more and more until all of the shards are collected
this is definitely one of my favorite video games of all timethe reason i rate it so highly is kirbys wide arsenal throughout the game
there are seven different types of enemies elements that you can absorb and combine with any of the others leaving you almost fifty different powers for you to control
testing them all out is the best part of the whole game
certain levels enemies and restricted areas require specific combinations so its up to you to find the ones that work the best
my personal favorite is an exploding ninjalike throwing star that flies so fast through the air that you cant even see it attaches it to an enemy and then explodes
now thats joy for youthis game is a great play and is so much fun when it comes to kirbys abilities
i would highly recommend this to anybody
serious gamers might find it repetitive but for everyone else who is looking for a fun game to play you must try the crystal shardsjust playing this game for the first time this week definitely enjoying it
i like how the graphics and effects are all d like mario  or ocarina of time but the gameplay is like an oldschool d game
musics good very easy concept and definitely has its challenging moments
glad i finally pioked it upkirby  the crystal shards is the greatest video game in the world a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a huge kirby you wont be sorryin  kirby made his debut on the nintendo  and for the first time he was able to combine enemies powers to get some pretty interesting results
the story of this game follows ribbon a fairy of ripple star trying to retrieve the crystal shards which were scattered throughout  worlds after dark matter smashed them they were all one huge shard
ribbon is aided by kirby king dedede thats right dedede is now a friendly character waddle dee another enemy now turned friendly and adeliene many say this ado from dreamland  which i also think is true
thus the main goal of this game is collecting all the crystal shards
the game overall is very fun and tricky in that in order to collect some shards you need to have special combo powers and that makes the game pretty difficult if you dont know which combos to get
this is my favorite kirby game that ive played
this game offers hours of funkirby  is a great game
use powers for other guys
all though the game is easy its fun
i recommon itthis game is still fun to play ever since it has came out back in  the classics are still fun to play first of all this game is d in a d perspective except for the final battle where you move in d
i like it this way better than if it was in d mostly because its kinda retro feeling
this game is shorter than the other games only has  worlds with  levels each level  has  levels for a total of 
if you complete the  you get some minigames like on the snes kirby superstars
the number of indiviual powers are drasticlly reduced stone fire needle bomb ice cutter and spark but the game allows you to combine  whih is necessary to access some crystals and provide you with around  powers you can have dual of the same power to get a bigger of that one like on x needle you get bigger reach of needles
controlls are simple enough like all the kirby games are so you can focus on the game
the only major drawback of this game is that it is really shortespecially compared to the nes version that hadalot more
also some of the powers really make it to to easy like a needlebomb makes you into one of them floating spike thingies and a stonecutter makes you into the stone creatures in the snes gamesoverall its a great game could use a few more worlds and an option to go first person view but its still funanother game i bought for the kids they had a blast with this game and the price was good tooid rented this game a long time ago and thought it was a blast
i loved mixing and matching the various powers in the game
its a really fun game just for experimenting with the various things that can be found in the game
the controls are simple and easy to pick up and overall its just a fun game to play
no complaintsa fun and cute game with a bunch of cool abilities
as like the other kirby games made for the beginner and advanced gamers alike
kirby teams up with his old friends waddle dee king dedede and adeline
but dont forget his new friend ribbon
a whole lot of kirby fun enjoygame showed up early in better than expected condition securely shipped  well buy againi played the snot out of this game when it was in the arcade
too poor to buy it as a kid but though about it many years later and dropped the cash to bring it homethe same great arcade game lacking the midfight switch feature thats it
at first i though that this was really going to break the game but once i got through playing it i saw that no switching made me better with whatever character i was using
i wouldve got the dreamcastdc verion if my dc still worked
a classic fighter nonetheless
got  more ps classics to goi love the syphon filter series and syphon filter  is one of the best from that series
its got a great balance of hardcore action and stealth and the missions are really cool
you switch between playing as logan from the first game and lian logans partner in the agencyits an old school playstation game so the graphics are weak but the game is a blast and its one of my all time favorites
i as stoked to find it available in factory sealed packagingthis game comes with two disks
and you can play against your buddy in the game
something like james bondsf  was some of the mosr fun ive ever had playing a game
the game has fantastic weapons and has multiplayer
the good things are that the gameplay is loads of fun and the soundtrack is amazing
the game is said to be very hard for some but ive managed  beat this game over  times when i was  loads of fun
if u find this game buy iti love these two games
syphon filter  continues the great gameplay its predecessor set up while adding a few twists such as playing as lian having help from other characters during missions teresa a great addition chance etc
 and the twoplayer modeif you like exciting fastpaced games you will not be disappointed by sf or sf
i beat sf in less time than it took to beat the first one but thats probably just because im farther up the learning curve of the games now
this one delivers challenge enemies can now use snipers on you and take you out with a head shot
and plenty of plot twists right up until the very endthe twoplayer mode is nice though the screen should have been split horizontally instead of vertically its quite difficult to tell what is going on around you at times
basically the twoplayer mode feels like a neat minigame if you happen to have someone sitting around
the levels you play on are not huge or incredibly interesting and your only objective is to kill the other playerone neat new feature the twoplayer mode adds though is having to look for secrets within the oneplayer game in order to unlock characters and levelsthis and the fastpace of the game though about half of the stages require you to stop and think your way through sticky situations  it is rarely just running and shooting will make you want to play it again even after you have beaten it plus unlocking all of the secret movies by playing through hard modeif you own syphon filter you have to buy the sequel
if the game interests you at all you should definitely rent it and then possibly by it
it is one of my alltime favorite gamesthe games great the graphics are soso but the game itself is greatthere are many weapons it this game like shotgunsms and grenadesthe game also has a multiplayer which the first one did not have and that really improved the gamethe multiplayer is the meat of the game boy oh boy i spent  whole days playing this game with friendsthe problem is after beating the game and having your share of multiplayer there is nothing else to do in this gameit probably would be better if  sports put some extra stuff for beating the gamefor example maybe if you got some secret characters for multiplayer to reward you for beating the gameanyway weather they do or dont which they dont this game is still one of the better games on the playstationi still cant get over the horrible voice acting for some reason and i wish i couldthis is one of the best if not the best game ever
you really have to play the first game to understand this game
there wasnt really any inprovment in the graphics from the first game but the story is great
the story picks up where the first left off
it starts in the begining video that gabe still at the pharcon wharehouse and he is getting the vires data disks
then the agency comes and captures liani wont tell anymore
the game is really fun you play some levels as gabe and some as lian
there are alot of new weapons including hand taser you use it alot cross bow
there are also bincoulars and you get night vision goggles for hen the lights go out
the game is inproved in some ways for example there is a jump move when you come up to a gap and you run strate at it you will jump it automatically
the game is so fun
oh and at the end watch the credits
after the credits like in the first game they hint that they might make a third game i hope so
over all i give itheck ten thumbs upi absoloutly loved the first game
it was a perfect blend of many types of gameplay and succsesfully combined them
does the sequel live up to the hype
wellkinda
taking place right after the origianal left of gabe and lian are searching for a cure to the really naughty virus that is running rampant through lian
however you must know the plot of the first story if you are going to understand this
the graphics remain unchanged from the first game and the level design is still as interesting
there are a few more weapons this time around and all of the weapons from the first game are back
there is also a two player mode that allows you to duke it out head to head with two charachters in lots of neat enviorments
also you get to play as lian xing this time around in two levels in a tight wet suit however this game has some big flaws that inhabit this game
one flaw me and other fans had about the first game had little in the way of stealth
apparently  studios listined because now there are too many stealh missions and all of them are insanly difficult
the two player mode is nice although the camera can get a bit wonky at times and some areas are way too dark
some of the secrets that are hidden to unlock  player options are insanley difficult to find
the computer ai is supposed to be improved but it really isint
all they do new is just roll occasionally and team up against you
many of you are wondering why this is rated m there is more blood a lot of swearing and lots of screams
one thing  studios improved was the enemy personallity they will chat to each other talk yell and also scream
early on you have to fight some of them with a flame thrower and it is really gutwrenching to listin to them scream it shows you how painfull getting hurt can be
overall this is still a fantastic game but it didint deliver everything it promisedthe good great selection of weapons lots of action interesting level design great music more stealth missions improved enemy personalitythe bad lots of swearing especially the d word enemy ai
isint really improvedand the ugly the air taser is gruesome to use screaming of enemys is really difficult to listin to secrets are incrediably hard to find really hard stealth missionsthis is one of the classics here
i loved this game  years ago and i wanted to buy it and play it again
its fantastic with the rollings and all the weaponsgreat gamethis game raises the age old question is the sequel better than the original
the answer is given about  seonds into the game
heck with metal gear this game kicks
and why not play as more than just gabe
the texures are more fluid than before and the missions are harder
its as much of a shoot em up like the first was
you have to sneak around more which makes the game more intersting
you wont be disappointed with the game
if you do ill buy the game off you
just kiddingthis game is the very pinnacle of the syphon filter series
i highly recommend it to anyone who likes gun games or a real good story
this time around the script writers made it really difficult to predict the story
buy this game you wont regret itthe original syphon filter had pretty decent visuals
they may have not compared to metal gears but were still pretty good
in the sequel the visuals were slightly changed there are just a few tweaks around the edges and that is all about it
the cgs on the other hand look excellent they dont show a single sign of poor data compression and they remain smooth the whole time
in my opinion i would compare them to those found in final fantasy and resident evil titles
the stage design is excellent sf includes most of the stages from the first one in the two player deathmatch mode and that made me feel kind of all tingly inside
the new courses are flooded with great looking environments and navigation
some stages are extremely huge and it takes quite a long time to check them all out
the character detail is there but it lacks in good polish
you wont find grain here but you will find some sharp edges on bodies
i noticed that the bodies in sf look a bit edgy on the sides it isnt very noticeable but its there
syphon filter s graphics arent very bad they just need a little refinement and thats all otherwise the visuals are fineill admit it not much has changed thought the sequel
the gameplay remains the same but that is a good thing
when i picked up sf i felt like i was right at home it didnt take me any adjustment at all
from the moment i picked up my dual shock i was able to smell the blood of the enemies
though the gameplay style may not be different ill tell you what is the value
not only does sf carry a two disk package but it also contains over  global areas to shoot some ass on
the game starts out with lian and gabe at the pharcom wharehouse they are putting the finishing touches on the pace when helicopters come in and start havoc
during the process lian is kidnapped and she has also been infected with the syphon filter virus
gabe quickly gets to his feet and he starts his journey and escape
the game has a few new faces such as teresa who is lians fillin and new bosses to give gabe a hard timethe twoplayer mode is an one killer addition to the sequel
it really gives the game more value there are tons of characters to choose from but many of them have to be unlocked
the stages that you play on are either the original syphon filter stages or new ones that need to be unlocked
of the top of my head im guessing that there are about  twoplayer characters and that includes gabe logan lian xing mara aramov uri gregarov and more old faces from the first sf as well as new faces from the sequel
with the sequel not only comes more stages but more artillery
gabe has now got over  weapons and gadgets to help him out on his missions
and finally speaking of missions the game is divided into two parts not only do you play as gabe but you also have the chance to play as lian for a segment of the game
thats about for the gameplay portion of sf if you thought that the gameplay was great just wait till you read about the soundlike the first syphon filter sf has voice acting
the quality is as great as ever and at no time did i find myself trying to figure out what gabe lian or teresa had said
the background theme still remains so those who liked that touch will be pleased to know that it is back
the explosions sound great and so do the gun shots for that matter
i cant really think of much to say about the sound because it is basically the same as the original and its just not a very deep subjectall rejoice people who have hard times getting used to controls in sequels can now settle down and stop worrying
sf features the exact same control layout as syphon filter
shoot roll side step aim all of them are at their original placement
but gabe has now learned how to jump instead of just plummeting to his death gabe will now jump at a ledge
as for the basic stuff like analog and dual shock its all there and both are working greatfor those who loved every second of syphon filter like me will love every second of syphon filter  the visuals may have remained the same but everything else has changed
excellent gameplay great sound the same control and especially the twoplayer mode make syphon filter  a definite winner
a must havethis has got to be one of the best games i have every played
its just a little too short i beat it in about  days but it dosent matter because this game has tons of replay value
the only thing that sets it off some times is its extreme difficulty and you can get frustrated with it rather easily
i still however still recomend you buying this great game
it will most likely find a prized addition to your psx collection
this kind of game makes a playstation owner proudsyphon filter is one of the most enjoyable videogames currently available  for any console system
syphon filter ii is everything that a sequel is supposed to be  bigger bad guys more explosions and more exciting storylinesyphon filter is the successful blend of a number of elements from other popular games  metal gear solid tomb raider and golden eye  and yet it still retains a high degree of originalityyou play gabriel logan an agent for a mysterious government agency that has been betrayed by his own agency
with his partner kidnapped and dying from a mysterious virus gabe must escape from goverment agents rescue his partner and destroy the traitors
a fairly standard setting however the progression of the storyline is gripping and adds a great deal to the gameplayyou control gabe with a tomb raider style over the shoulder view with a couple of cool changes
first you can enter a targeting mode which lets you take out the bad guys with a single shot to the head
secondly you can slow down and move in stealth mode letting you sneak around guards
finally the game allows you to quotpeekquot from behind walls allowing you to quickly check out yours surroundings without giving yourself away
it is these additional touches that add considerably to the feel of being a stealthy commando rather than some soldier that runs around blazing away at the enemyin addition to cool moves you will acquire a plethora of interesting equipment aka weapons as you progress through the game
each of which behaves very differently and is more or less useful depending on the circumstances you are in
you can obtain shotguns ms aks silenced pistols grenades gas grenades sniper rifles night vision rifles machine pistols armor piercing machine guns fully automatic sniper rifles and grenade launchers
if you are really desperate you can alway light your foe on fire by shocking him to death with your tasergraphically the level design is spectacular each level is innovative and interesting
similarly the sound is extremely realistic and important to your gameplayi loved this game
when is number  cominggraphics certainly not the best graphics ever seen on a ps game but you have to admit this game looks a lot better than most other ps games
even the explosion effects are nice to look at
no complaints here
however the only complaint i have is the character models
for some reason most of the characters dont seem to have faces and in one cutscene gabe and lians pictures are on a news broadcast and both of them look like a faceless bonnie and clyde
the problem with the faceless character models was remedied in sf though but if youre like me you wont care about the missing facesgameplay the physics engine is not a legendary makeup but you wont find yourself complaining either
since this is  people expect better from a games physics engine but this game was made during the pss final breaths so of course it might feel a littleoff
i havent played the newest sf game the omega strain but that game may prove these physics obsolete
also the targetting system of sf is perfect
you have two target modesmanual and auto fix target
holding l down will switch you to stperson view and fix the green target reticle on what you want to shoothold down r to automatically fix your target to nearby enemies
you will find that auto fix will be the most commonlyused function
you also get an enormous selection of weapons to choose from
youll only run across certain weapons at certain points but if you access all weapons into your inventory at once you will see theres enough guns to do your secret agent bidding
even when you pick out a target a small info tab will point to them telling you whats happening with them
so if you aim the target reticle at someones head the info tab will tell you youre about to make a headshot
info tabs will also tell you if the enemy is wearing a flak jacket
this will force you to perform a headshot
theres also a multiplayer mode but dont expect an iteration of goldeneye or timesplitters
you and a friend are chucked into the playing field and are forced to shoot each other for points
thats basically all the multiplayer is about but you still might have a little fun doing itsound the sound is probably the best ear party you can possibly have
shooting unsilenced s as others fire back practically sounds like a warand dont complain about the musicat least it sounds better than sfs quiet and unexciting tunesstory simply put the syphon filter virus runs rampant for the second time around and its gabe logans and lian xings job to contain it
the game is long enoughitll probably last you quite a few hours if you die a lot but if you know what youre doing it will certainly be no problem
theres also a lot of agentspy talk which contradicts how the actual cia would work
gamers who just play something to shoot something will probably be turned off by the dialogue in this game but if you actually like listening to secret agents talk about shipments provided by the nssoaa after nasdaq collapsed in  and the cia requested a peace treaty with the taliban by the way none of that ever happened in the game then youll be engulfed into the storyline and dialoguei actually played the demo on the squaresoft  collectors cd vol
 i got with vagrant story when i bought it way back but was this game actually  when it first came out
heck ffxi is  and its brand new for the ps
its only a ps one game and games for the ps usually ran at most  when they were new
is there something extra that comes with this game like a k gold ring or something
my goodnessthis game utterly amazing though i have not touched it in about  months
ive been meaning to put it back in my ps
the battles and menus are very neatly organized within the game
much of this game is standard but there are a few things that separate this game from the rest of games out therethe first thing is customization and aquisition of wanzers
you can easily put together wanzers as easily as putting together legos or you could keep it the way you aquired it
there are benefits in putting a certain arm or leg on a wanzer which will enable you to obtain more battle skills which come in so handy in tough fightsthe acquisition of wanzers is such an amazing experience
the way to really obtain new cuttingedge wanzers as opposed to buying them which is more limiting is stealing em from you enemies
and there are plenty of fun ways of doing so
my favorite is in battle while having an quoteject punchquot battle skill equipped pull your wanzer right up to the enemy and use a fist attack
with some luck the pilot will be ejected
then you can eject from your wanzer into his now vacant one or attack him on the ground in which case he will get mauled
this is great fun because he wont jump in yours after you are in his wanzergetting and trading new weapons is also lots of fun
a plethera sp
of customization available if you want it you choosethis is one of the finest ps titles to date
it is exactly what you think it is final fantasy tactics meets robots
a turn based tactical rpg at its bestgraphics and soundsquare is solid when it comes to graphics and sound
by  standards its a tad pixelated and choppy sure
by  standards this was state of the art and the cut scenes look better than alot of what you see on xbox  and ps
the music was right on targetstorythe story takes place on earth but  years in the future
a future of walking tanks wanzers silly name right
also most the super powers of the world have amalgumated into economic blocks
there is also built in internet thing in the game where you can find easter eggs and unlock the ultimate wanzer make money buy weapons and parts for your giant walking tanks or just train and earn money on the simulatorgameplaydid you like final fantasy tactics
or anything with tactics in the title
chances are pretty good you will like this
you move your character in  directions across a big chess board gridded map that covers a variety of heights and terrain as well as destructable invironments ie trees certain walls
you have a variety of weapons that include rifles machine guns flame throwers missiles shot guns assorted melee combat weapons grenade launchers and even the much loved pulse rifle beam weapon
you may target your enemies body arms legs wheels and even pilot
when you have destroyed enough parts your enemies may try to surrender allowing you to claim their wanzer but not other vehicles after battle
your pilots may learn and execute special attack or defensive moves such as leg smash or firing squad
customization of your robots is limited only by your immagination
that and weight restriction ala armored coreover allthis title comes highly recommonded
it is greatly fun and immersive
this stands out among its other front mission counterparts released stateside
this is easily one of the finest square soft games ever maid
however buyer beware
if you do not like top down turn based strategy games maybe take a pass at this one and stick to the call of duties and tiger woods golf games of which you may be accustumedi have been burned repeatedley it seems lately by squaresoft and their ho hum games
not so with this beauty
deep gameplay with with two stories  which makes replay a must the second time
if you have wasted your money  on final fantasy  xenogears and the like this will take the sour taste  out of your mouth
for  hours or sothis is an extremely entertaining and fun tactical turned based rpg
the graphics are great the story is in depth the style is different than a lot of games in its genre and you never get bored of it
pick it up if you like games such as the shining force series final fantasy tactics tactics ogre or the like
highly recommendedafter playing the greatest turn based strategy of all time final fantasy tactics i was convinced that squaresoft was the ultimate gaming company
keeping the faith i got this game not knowing what to expect and the rest is history and so are the hundreds of enemies they pitched at mein this game you lead a character and his freinds through the nd century as you search for a mighty device called midas an energy creator that can be used for good but is just too easy to turn into a bomb of mass destruction
as you go along you fight evil from around the world like the japanese defence force jdf the united states navy usn and even superhumans called quotimaginary numbersquot of the chinese quotda han zhongquot dhz
combating them you are eventually pitted in almost  different battles each with a different map and group of enemiesthe battle system is the core where you select methods of defending yourself from the enemies and which people to choose with their specialities to blow the enemy away
a few times i got pitted against enemies i just couldnt beat but for the most part it was very clean and rather simple not like final fantasy tactics which was unbelievably hardwith the battles and the talking sequences you have some decent graphics and music
while ill wait a while before i buy the soundtrack for this game i will say that the music ranges from kinda weak techno to some awesome stuff
the graphics also could use a polishing but all the required things are here except a big explosion when a wanzer dies
when attacking your enemies you go into a really awesome sequence of camera movement or angles
this adds almost a western style of shooting others but you can still see that you are in a modern city with futuristic machinesall in all while many will argue that final fantasy tactics was the better game i think i might too actually there is no denial that this is quite possibly the only game in the world of the genre at the same level as fftactics
this game is awesome a change of scene from the midevil madness with kartia vandal hearts and fftactics and is good training for the harder ones esspecially fftacticsfront mission  is one of the best games ive every played
i think it will remain on my list of favorites for quite awhile
it was a great deal of fun and i was personally slightly more compelled to enjoy it by how much ive liked other turn based strategy rpgs namely the shining force series which to this day are still making a huge case for best game ever in my mind at least
it is also refreshing to see another excellent product come out of square as i have never really been a fan of the final fantasy series so i look favorably upon almost any departure from itfirst of all i think the other reviewers have exceedingly over estimated this games length
with both scenarios there are only about  battles total i guess there are also a couple training missions but it is nowhere near the  to  numbers other reviewers are throwing out and from my experience beating them both only took me about  hours but i could see less experienced gamers taking  or  morethe major focus of front mission  is the combat
there is some story but it is completely overshadowed by the fighting
like i said front mission is a turnbased strategy game
the combat takes place on grid systems and the fighting is done in giant robots known as wanzers
these wanzers can be equipped with a large variety of different weapons such as machine guns rifles shotguns missile launchers and grenades launchers as well as short ranged but deadly melee weapons
each wanzer has  different hit locations head body each arm and legs and destroying different parts has different effects
each weapon is actually different in not only pure damage the special moves that can be used with them and range  but also in which spots they hit melee weapons missiles rifles hit one spot grenades can hit multiple wanzers and machine guns and shotguns hit multiple locations
anyway front mission has a solid in depth combat system that shouldnt take too long to learn and though there are some easy missions many of the battles are very difficult
i dont think the complexity is one scale with final fantasy tactics which i have never played but it will still take some time to masterthe storyline is okay
actually for this sort of tactical combat game it is actually pretty in depth
the game did actually tell you why you were fighting everybody which some games neglect to do
the plot is almost completely linear besides the two different scenarios and some minor decisions you are allowed to make
instead of getting to run around and talk to everybody front mission just gives you a list of people to talk to and places to go and these interactions were linear themselves
some people will miss that but i let it go easily enough because it sped up the pace of the game and it really is all about the fighting anywaythe graphics are good
they arent terrible but they arent wonderful either but that comes mostly from it being for the playstation
there are some nice d models of the wanzers but the texturing is very blocky during close ups
i also noticed that the people walk using the same animation as the wanzers which is sort of silly but forgivableeverything considered front mission  is one of my favorite games and i really want to see a sequel for a better system
if you are looking for pure eye candy look elsewhere and if you are a pure old school rpg fan this might not delight you
fm is great fun and i suggest it to almost everybody else even those who have never really enjoyed the rpg genre before as the combat system will probably be much preferable to straight rpg hack an slash
check it outhello this truly is one of squresofts many great games great storyline mech action good computer generated movies tactics style game play final fantasy tactics but much larger mapsstrategyrpg
plenty of action and mechs i have played  hours since i got it  i use to have this game years ago but i lost track of it when i saw it here on amazoncom i knew i had to have it
it seems to me that the games of today have million dollar grafics but the story and game play is lacking i get much more joy out of my retro games  i have ps   a pc laptop gameboy  xbox  and plan to get snes again and psp
i would recommend this game to buy you will enjoy it some battles can be long mechs can be outfitted and upgraded with better parts and weapons
my copy was used it looked new as well as the manuel the case had a a crack nothing serious
i would buy from this seller againthank youawesome game amazing story cool customization options
get it
its so much fun
if you like robots look no furtherthis game is like medal of honor with a twist it is challenging but very fun probably the best of the army men seriesi bought this game about yrs ago when it came out
til this day its still awesome
graphics  r old but still fun
the controls in this game was kinda fustrating
i didnt like u got no checkpoints but it was a challenge so u coudlnt just blast right thru it
land sea air i hated
final front was ok  team assault i never played
sarges heroes  and  was awesome 
sarges war is prob my favorite
the air attacks i never got into cuz i like fightin on land
sucks do went outa business ever since they can make a good one 
wish sumone out there would put out one as good as the old ones
very fun games
turn my ps on the other day jus to play a army men gamemy son is in to army things right now and he found this game and talked me into buying it for him
i wasent to sure being so cheap
but once we got it  i found it to be in good condition and he is having a blast playing it
it got here faster than i expected it too
i would order threw these people againthis game is really old i miss playing it with my cousins
i decided to buy it and surprise them
they were like oh where did you find it we lost it so that was another reason why i bought it
they werent really surprised they felt that it was a bit babyish
after a while they opened up and played it again with all smiles and laughseven though i thought the game was easy there was some challenging part along the way such as the tracks will get harder and the competition is tougher you can always use some hidden passages to help you
there are  characters you cannot get at the beginning of the game but if you get all the flags trophies and all the parts to the fireworks machine and we cannot forget to get the  faries in each level
this will enable you to get the three characters that you couldnt get at the beginning of the game
if you pass through three blue rings in a row it will open a secret passage
a great game for the whole family
dont waste your time renting it just buy it when you see itthis is a wonderful racing game that young and old alikewill be playing for hoursthe soundsmusic and graphicsare welldoneand i like the story about having to getpieces to put the fireworks machine back togetherthecourses are hard at firstbut with enough practicetheyllbecome easyit would of been better if familiar characterslike mickey mousepeter panmad hatteretc
were includedlets hope they make a sequel to this fun gamei had this game way back in the day on the sega cd rom
i did like the  first one better but this is one sick game
the story is more in depth  than the first one and the characters backgrounds are much more developed
this is one of the best rpgs ever made and i think it blows final fantasy   away and is almost as good as ff
this game is well worth the money  because i have beat this game several times and i still have fun doing it  and i usually hate going through a game the second timeto those who owned a sega saturn the lunar series may be well known to you
to the rest of us this game is a new frontier
one that i encourage you to explore
the game is an excellant example of what an rpg should be
it focused on the story which in my opinion is the most important part aside from the music
right from the beginning of the game you are immersed in a deep and involving game that will steal you away from your freinds and family for the  hours of gameplay not including the epilouge
the game is filled with anime style movies that are beautiful to behold and the spoken dialouge yes spoken are very well acted
working designs can pat themselves on the back for this one
the music is simplistic but very moving at times
the only part i dont like is that there is no beginning animation like in lunarsssc complete with singing
then again this story has nothing to do with singing
the game also is mainly based on a love story like its predecesor
may i say they did a much better job handling this story than ff
if you are looking for a game with a love story get this one and leave ff alone
it may look old school with d graphics and a seemingly super nintendo look but who plays rpgs for its graphics
the presence of an epilouge lets you see everything that happened after the game ending
a nice touch
it makes it appear that the video game characters actually have lifes and shows you what happened with them
ex
in game there is a town planning a wedding
in the epilouge you get to watch the wedding
well i thought it was cool
go ahead and buy the game or rent it if you want
who knows maybe youll be paid a visit from lunarsssc charactersif you love rpgs youre definately gonna wanna play this
note the graphics are very dated but they dont take away the feel of the game
hell people still have fun playing the original tetris
this is the sequel to the  game that was enhanced as wellthe game takes place  years after the first lunar
during a treasure hunt hiroyes thats his name notices a light shining from the blue spire
investigating he finds lucia one from the blue star who wants to see the goddess althena about a grave matter
the new villain zopharquite interesting looking is bent on destroying lunar and making it his own
all villains want that right
so its up to hiro to help lucia and defeat zophar with some help from friends he meets along the waythe look of the game isnt the best looking
dont expect final fantasy vii or even vi looking graphics but the new anime scenes made for the game more than make up for it
used in places like character introductions and plot points the animation flourishes with very vivid colors
even xenogears anime scenes looked a little adultthe music isnt that memorable but its great background music for its respectable part in the game
the voice acting is especially great using some great voices
even the heros voice improved
if you hated nalls voice you wont like rubysif you love rpgs you should definately pick this up but play the first lunar so you get caught up with several things that the game might not coverthe games of the past truly are marvelous accomplishments
they know nothing of the modernized games we have today and their quality is more focused and mature
with the harness of gaming graphics pretty nonexistent in lunar the game has more power and depth and certainly more room to grow than recent titles do
with each passing moment lunar does not become old and boring it just becomes more charming and impressive
lunar is a game that only gets better in timesince lunar is a relatively old game it was free to run with a complicated story rather than just display some appealing eye candy as you drag a character through another repetitive task
the fact that lunar is so different than other games is what really drew me to it
here you are in a massive world with a hole mess of party members when you realize that youve just embarked on an unforgettable and hilarious adventure that you would be foolish to hope to find in any other game
lunars story is touching and it doesnt insult you with the old clicheacutes and stereotypes
just when you think its all over you always seem to find another important task at hand
when you finally do finish this game your left with an indescribable feeling of accomplishment and you finally understand just why everyone loves this oldschool game so muchlunars charm washes over you completely from the moment you insert that first disc
its filled with characters that you just love to interact with
when your away from the battlefield you dont always find yourself worrying about what boss is next sometimes you just want to talk to the townspeople and see what hilarious thing ronfar or ruby or any of your party members will say
its great that theres an rpg out there thats not all business lunar is just plain fun
lunar is a lighthearted but dead serious game and you can always appreciate whats going on
in one scene youll be laughing your guts out then the next second your back to business when something huge happens
the game is soo exciting and its just awesome to play itif there is a thing that lunar lacks it absolutely makes up with it tenfold with its laughable dialog interesting story and massive amount of extra goodies
lunar is a game that youll love forever and youll never ever regret playing it
so if you havent already experienced what a true rpg can be dont waste another precious moment play lunaron the surface it would appear lunar  has little to offer one who has played countless hours of dragon warrior final fantasy and many other rpgsturnbased combat
check
adventuring party storyline
checkmix of music to match the scenes
checksidequests and towns
check
but what puts lunar  above and apart from most of its rivals are the followingtranslationas far as jrpgs go this is easily the best ive seen
why
because the dialogue doesnt feel like it has been translated at all
every line of dialogue reads as if a nativeenglish speaker were behind it
the dialogue has a flow that is seldom seen in other jrpgs
some jrpgs read as if the translation department merely ran the text through babel fish
here the text reads as if they read the japanese script took the time to understand it and rephrased it in english capturing the overall gist of the situation instead of striving for wordforword perfection in translationcharactersyes many rpgs have good even great casts of characters
but here we have a game with something specialoptimistic characterscharacters you can cheer for
characters who if they were real youd want to be friends with and not just on facebook
characters who dont mope about and cry riversas if that isnt enough each of the characters has their own backstory
hiros dungeon adventuring
ronfars days as a priest and friend of leo and mauri
jeans dark past in a cult and leminas magic guild dreamsas satisfying as the basic ending is one cares for the characters so much that the epilogue is practically mandatory 
and definitely worth the  or so extra hours to complete it
second only to the  minute ending in final fantasy  this is my favorite rpg endinganimationthe lunar series is one of the few rpgs that uses animation for the cutscenes
some might argue that it makes the game seem childish but if you pay attention to the dialogue there is enough innuendo to make up for that
in addition the animation only heightens the sense of optimistic adventuring that the characters are about
yes some of the more serious cutscenes are done with cgi but overall lunar is a hopeful lighthearted warm rpg not a dark woefully depressing onemusicfor a game that spans  cds the track count is somewhat lacking
however there are some excellent tunes in this games that perfectly capture the emotion of the momentleos theme is one of the first tracks you hear in the game and has a very grand epic sound to it which is perfect for introducing leo and the dragonship destinyghaleons theme is another great one full of mystery and menace as befits one of the most dreaded antagonists in the gamesomber memories is one of the saddest tracks i have heard on any rpg
there is just so much heartfelt sadness and memory in this track that it is hard not to shed tears while listening to ithiros fight and lucia vs zophar are two similar but superb tracks
the classical sound makes them as epic as the bossbattles being foughtingame extrasalthough the majority of the main storyline is rather linear there are plenty of diversions and things to doyou can collect bromides to see pictures of the characters at their best 
or worst 
momentsyou can collect the ingame music tracksyou can collect the ingame animations for cutscenesthere are plenty of towns where the locals have tons of witty funny dialogue to entertain you withlike the purring girls in the tunnel of terrorafter the main game is complete there is an epilogue which features new monsters new bosses new animations new dungeons new events new dialogue and new equipmentthere is also an audio outtake selection at the end of the gamepackaging extrasoff the top of my head here is what i remember coming with the boxed set of this game
you can tell the makers of this game were enthusiastic and passionate about itan amulet that looks just like the one lucia wearslittle cardboard character figuresa hardback colorillustrated game manuala making of cdthe lunar  eternal blue soundtrack oh yeahconclusionyou might have noticed that i havent mentioned one thinggraphicsthats because in an rpg graphics are not importantdo people who play tabletop dungeons and dragons the grandfather of all our console rpgs worry about graphicsnothey worry about story and characters and combatif youre one of those gamers who is easily lured by eye candy then lunar  may not have much to offer you but if youre like me a gamer that can do without the eye candy i think youll find a game that is not only good but great and a wonderful way to spend  hoursyes is has been a long time when this version of this game came out but even now it is awesome
i got caught up in the story and the visuales were awe inspiring this rpg takes your breath away in sevral ways and you grow attached to all the players involved
you will enjoy the battles and enjoy beating the bad guys and love saving the good guys
this is a dated game but even now you will enjoy this great rpglunar  originally appeared on the sega cd several years ago
for those unfamiliar with lunar  its an old style rpg with mostly d graphics and a simple yet involved battle system
the remake for the playstation while reworked in many places still retains the spirit of the lunar series
as in the remake of the first lunar some eventsitems have been changed added or cut out and most of the areas are a lot shorter
the areas in the game have been shrunk mainly because they dont need to be big
you encounter enemies by running into an icon on the screen this time so there is no need for giant dungeons because there are no random battles
this may seem sacrilegious to some rpg gamers but in the end it works out well
one of the cut areas includes the ghost manor near the village of takkar
in the original lunar  it was a big red mansion with slamming doors and lots of dialoguenow its nothing but a run down shack
differences like these may turn off some of the more hardcore fans but overall i doubt lunar  will disappoint
from its epic story to its memorable characters and music lunar  is a classic that no rpg fan should miss
plus the extra stuff that comes with this package will certainly please those who have known the series since the beginningi absolutely love this series wonderful story and a great collectors item
came with all the components of a new game
i couldnt be happier with this productwithout going through what i stated in my other review i wanted to follow it up
i recently purchased this game even though i got my ps the day before
this series is a classic and simply one if not the best series in rpgs
lunar sss definitly widened the audience of for this game but i think this game will remain a favorite to fans of the series
first off some of the added quotbonusesquot seem a little uneeded
small popup lunar paper pictures
come on working designsalthough the lucia pendant is actually pretty good size and nice
when i first popped it in i noticed immediatly that the dialogue and cinemas were very similar to the sega cd version
also some of the dungeons are similar
for all you old school lunar fans there isnt too much new here
the thing is anyone who played lunar will pick up this game soley because this game deserves the devotion that it deserves and is simply fun to play especially a cleaned up version
not much else is new accept for some added cut scenes which are gorgeous as usual
there are no world map battles which seemed odd but refreshing in a way
instead as in lunar sss there are small mini areas where you fight monsters
this game is top notch rpg greatness
i cant belive some people down this game because of its graphics
these i think are probably one of the games best qualities
i really dont get the same feeling with d flashy games as when i play lunar
lunar will definitly remain my favorite rpg series of all time and i will continue to play this game until i beat it
buy this game if you love rpgs because this game is seriously underrated
i wait for the day that lunar  comes out because i simply cant waitthats right this game is absolutely solid
ill readily admit that i belong to the old school rpg players who strongly believe that the garbage that many companies try to give us is just that garbage
it must be understood that the psx version is actually a rehash of the sega cd which im proud to own with a more animations and extra video this game does shine 
if reviewed on its ownneedless to say i was very surprised that working designs decided to go ahead and release an aging game on a near dead system never mind the recent release of the playstation 
and yes despite popular opinion this game is not new
because of its age and the ultra quotcoolquot eye candy that more recent rpg games have to offer this game will most assuredly once again become a cult classicunlike many games this game actually has a history
every one knows that the sega cd was a major failure in terms of sales
but what most people dont realize is that the original lunar was a raging success
several hundred thousand sega cds have been sold in japan while the same number plus  lunar games have been sold
the same holds true in the us as well
what that means is that every single person who bought a sega cd also has one or more copies of the game
lunar  wasnt quite as successful but still managed to hit the  ratio of owners
and im sure that many people including myself bought the sega cd  based solely on owning the lunar gamesso why buy the psx version of the games
easy despite the fact that the game is based on traditional sprite based characters the game actually has a story
one of the things that game companies today are suffering from is the attempt to create a game with so much eye candy with d polygon graphics prerendered backgrounds and special effects that the story literally disappears
worse still is that some games attempt to make up for this by adding so much dialog that even an quotauto firequot feature on controllers wouldnt get through it all before you return from a trip to the store with a new game
however lunar is perfect
the story unfolds at a perfect pace not too slow and not too fast
video is a reward and not used as quotfillerquot to help the story along
the only thing that could cripple this game is the lack of d polygons or full use of sgi prerendered backgrounds
but with a story like lunars who needs the eye candyso i guess we get to the story
one thousand years after lunar silver star takes place
evil has crept across the land again or has it
is there a plot twist there
 now it is up to hiro and ruby to help a young girl to contact athena who actually appears in the first game as well under a different name
now really
i cant spoil that plot twist for you can i
to help rid the land of the evil zophar
in their many adventures or would that be misadventures
your band of character meets and joins up with a myriad of characters including lucia who is innocent to the things around her
lemina who is pretty much a selfish greedy brat who wields powerful magic
jean who is a beautiful dancer who has a deadly battle tactic
ronfar who is pretty much a  pay attention to his innuendoes and nall who 
um 
whoops ha ha
another branching plot linewith twice as many plot twists as the original the game certainly feels very long
and with good reason
play through the first time
and the game lets you think you quotbeatquot it
reload the saved file and you have to play through again backwards more or less
this game is lovable and a classic
the entire series harbors many secrets both in game and real world
do the research and youll be surprised
i wasi would not be very surprised if this game fails
ive shown this game to people who never played the original and all i got was a quotho humquot response
when i showed the same person the garbage that other companies put out with zero story and tons of eye candy they instantly want to borrow the game
trust me buy or at least rent the game
the sprite based characters wont be fantastic but youll like the story as it unfolds
youll be surprisedtigerpommeplaystation takes a trip back in time to sega cd and makes a remake of one of the most enjoyable games that ive ever played
its basically about a girls mission to save the planet of lunar and a cool kid named hiro goes to help along with other people that you find along the wayokaythe proswhat i liked the best were the cut scenes and voices
but they were never consistent like theyd go from voices to dialogue to voices again
i think thats cause they wanted to get a specific dramatic point across buti dunno
the cut scenes were great and fun to watch
ruby was a riot to listen to calling people pinheads and commenting on dumb things
shes definitely one of my favorite characters from the game
i also liked the characters
they are very unique and are oddballs that stand out from the group
hiros just a kid who has a flying cat thing yah i know what she is but ronfar is a hasbeen priest who now specializes in gambling hes kinda cute too
grins jean oh boy shes a fan dancerkarate master that kicks serious butt in the battles
lemina is a moneyloving sorceress i guess
and lucia is a weird girl that everyone is chasing thinking shes a destroyer
i especially love the characters because they show their personality in their dialogues and their voicesnow for the consthe battles got annoying and long even though the badguys were simple
and some of them kept calling more and more badguys and the stupid game wouldnt let me run away from the  or so badguys
the attacks took a lot of hp from both teams so each badguy had to have at least  hp to live some badguys have at least 
some of the graphics are definitely outdated but graphics arent the things that grab my attention
its the quality of the game that counts
this game has a lot of qualityoverall i really enjoyed this game
i havent played the first game in the series silver star story nor have i played the playstation version i have the sega cd version but im sure that fans of that game would love this oneamy rosegauntlet legends is a great game for both the nintendo  and sega dreamcast both games are slightly different with the dreamcast version having cut scenes and better graphics and i feel like the n version has better music and slightly balanced better gameplaycontrols
a great game and i am glad it is finally starting to get the recognition it deserves
if you can find this game for around  bucks pick it up and play with a few friendsfamilythe gameshark cdx for dreamcast is probably the best thing that i bought for dreamcast
now i can finally beat dino crisis
but there are some flaws
first is that it can be used only in a standard dreamcast controller
another is that you need to use the cd that came with it to enter codes
third and final that i noticed is that the gameshark could mess up your game
but the third problem is easily avoided by having multiple saves of different files on your vmu
however some games only let you have  saved game on your vmu
so you just use multiple vmus for this problem
the cheats do work so i would reccomend this to anyone who wants to actually be able to beat a game completly
and that would be just about everybodyi remember playing this game over at a friends house after it came out and i was very addicted to it so i wanted to borrow it but my friend said no so i was very frustrated the fact that i couldnt borrow it so i waited many years to actually play this great game againlet me ask you all one questionis it a cool game if you can strangle someone with a piano wire drag them into a sewage drain and finally steal their clothes and put them on yourself
very cool
the only thing you will have to get use to is the controls because in hitman codename  they used the numpad as the main quotcontrol centerquot
sure you can change the controls around to your liking but it would be best if you kept them as is because you will regret it otherwise
here is what i am running hitman codename  onmhz voodoo video card mb ramit runs beautifully and the graphics are very nice
for the best out of this game i suggestatleast a mhz voodoo or nvidia geforce ultra  video card and atleast mb ramkeep in mind that is for awesome gameplay and it will run on much less
great action great strategy great gamea must buy is my suggestion
good luck shoppingbrowsinglike other games that came out in the same time period eg
dues ex the hitman codenamed  will go down in history
unlike fps of today the game takes skill and patience to playhitman looks like me cuz he aint got any hairrrr he never had any eithrlike me hes only tallertis game is al about stealth kinda like mgs so its fans should get it and wotch aut for da seqwel  hitman da silent assassinwhen i first read about the game i read shoter  so i think it was like all the other shoters games but it is not
this is a excelent game you have a lot of cool devices like pianowire  car bombs sniper rifles and all kind of guns
when u r in a mission you must think every move you will do cuz a false move and u r death if u aim your gun then kill the enemy with a shot or let them kill you with a lot of shots
this is the kind od game where a quick brain is better than a quick finger in the trigger
if you like games like thief metal gear then i am sure you will like this onethis game does have its occasional glitches but if you can truly appreciate good gaming you can look past those glitches
i came back to write a review of this game even though its already almost  years old
this is probably because when someone asks me some of my favorite action games i usually always list hitman as one of the elite
ive tried to figure out why that is and ive come to the conclusion that its all about the concept of this game
the graphics are excellent dont get me wrong but i cant think of any other game where you have the sole mission of assassinating people for money
in this sense hitman goes above and beyond most other games
the people at eidos also did a fantastic job to ensure that when youre playing hitman you actually feel like a hitman which is a key element of any game
think about it if you cant slip into the role of the character youre playing as its difficult to enjoy the game
part of gaming is escaping reality and hitman enables the gamer to do this providing hours of evil fun
the first time you use the piano wire to choke someone youll know what i mean
hitman takes you all around the globe from hong kong where youre in the middle of a gang war to colombia to assassinate a drug lord
completing these missions is also extremely openended which is something that i absolutely loved about the game
one mission in hong kong requires you to whack the leader of a gang
the question is do you storm into his restaurant with guns blazing
or do you do as i did and acquire a vile of poison to poison his soup
now if that doesnt entice you i dont know what will
this game isnt getting any younger so pick it up while its still availablethis game is so tight
i had a really good time playing through it
the difficulty makes it a challenge and makes it last longer than most other games on the market
hitman has great graphics lots of weapons and items to use a welldesigned plot and many levels to play
all in all it is definitly worth the money if you are into action gamesfirst game of the series was good but it became better when its sequels came out
i think they should make a remake of this gamei love the hitman games
how many games can you choke someone to death with a piano wire and change into thier cloths after you hide the bodyive played the game several times and still enjoy it to this very day
the easter eggs knee slappers and devastating weaponry make the game solid and high in replayabilityi wall aways liked the the duke nukem games since i was growing up as a kid i play games every day duke nukem is a allsome gamethis game is just awesome
the graphics are much improved and so is the game play
there are so many new tracks and terrains to ride on its crazy
hours of fun with this game
definetly something to buyever wish you could catch air on a dirt bike like those crazy motocross  racers like stephane roncada or jeremy mcgrath
well now you can
motocross  madness  straps you to the seat of a wild beast waiting to be unleashed
with wonderfully rendered graphics intense game play and mind boggling  stunts this game is as close as you can get to real racing
the controls  are simple and straight forward i personally use the sidewinder freestyle  pro game pad
you have a huge number of jerseys and bikes to choose from
the number of tracks that come with the game is enormous
the only thing  the game is really lacking is a true career mode where you decisions on  what you purchase and tweak really matter
other wise this game has it all  dont forget multiplayer
microsofts zone enables you to race opponents  world wide
the best dirt bike game on any system to datewe run this game on our home network and i joust it out with my nephew or any one else who dare take me on
great game with easy controls and good graphics
runs great on both my piii  ghz hp laptop and  ghz celeron emachines desktop
we have also played on the msn gaming zone and been smoked by some really good players
we like itbut dont buy this
microsoft offers a title called racing madness that gives you this game and midtown madness  in the same box for the same price of this game alone
search for racing madness or look up asin bnaa
have funas probably the only fan of the tv show that i know of i couldnt wait to purchase   we already owned no and i like it so i got my chance when they went on sale
although i do better on the computer than i do playing along with the tv i have too much of a life to log on while watching the real show on tv i find the questions tougher on the pc especially the first fivemy wife said that when everyone gets sick of regis and they cancel the show  theyll be giving these away
and she was right  for a while they had the fullversion not a demo cd rom inside of specially marked cereal boxes
im not kiddingall in all an excellent game one of my favorites
the negative comments from others are well taken i agree with some but that doesnt bother methe sequal to the original captures brilliantly the feel of the hit tv show
the first one was repetitve and sometimes the hardest questions were the  ones with this game questions actuall make sense for the amounts  and it really helps the actual game
ive played my beta version several  times and am yet to get the same question something that happened the nd  time i played it
the game features new coments by regis like quotso you  gonna make it your final answerquot and this time you actually see him  instead of just his voice
this game has little requirments so it will work  great on anybodys computers
with new questions new voiceovers and new  suspense you cant go wrong especially for just 
pick this puppy up  as fast as possible because its gonna be hugeokay
this system has yet to be released in the states and it already has a number of reviews
even more foolish though is that people are comparing it to other systems that are even farther into the future
quotyou should wait for the xboxquot  microsoft doesnt know rule one about video games
i know what youre thinking quotneither did sonyquot  well that may be but they know now and quite frankly i trust them a hell of a lot more than mircosoft
so heres the skinny the ps can play all ps games
that means immediately you have a library of hundreds of games many of them priced around or even below twenty dollars
you also have exclusives with developers like squaresoft
want final fantasy
turn here true believers
the things a dvd player hows that for a true quotplayquot station
its a cd player not that that is really important admittedly but its there nonetheless
what does the xbox have
bill gates need i go on
forget the hype forget the critics
take a look at the facts
this is the video gaming machine of the future
oh yeah and for those of you screaming quotdreamcastquot
well i dont think i even need to dignify that with a responsethey are perfect to stay busy forever play dvds and interact with people kicking eachothers butts in games lolfun game collection and failry cheap right now plus they lasti took a big chance and bought a used playstion  when it came it looked like it was new box and all were in great condition and it got here faster than i thought it would
i have been on it every day for hours at a time with no problems
i will keep buying for amazonplaystation is almost coming to our storepeople at coast to coast are very excited to get there hand on this ultimate machinethe machine that can play dvd movie and original ps  discme and my older brother are not ready to buy ps yet we are waiting to see if this game console sell welland what kind of game that will come outi seen ps on the website last fall of i was surprise of what this console can do then playing gameyou can watch dvd movie on itnow that a added bonus baby
i seen the graphic for the ps on the gamespotcom website they show the new street fighter ex and the gt racing car gamei was surpris of the graphica very good bit graphici think sony is a genuis to put dvdrom on this game consoleis better then buying a stand alone dvd playerwell i hope this ultimate machine well be a best seller like the playstation  consolepopulous the beginning is a great game and doest have any downsides
you control a tribe in their quest to promote the shaman to god
to achieve this you must guide the tribe through  levels destroying any enemy tribes in the way
there are many types of followers braves firewarriors preachers shamen warriors and spies
the shaman is the most powerful follower she can perform  spells such as volcanos lightning tornados and earthquakes as well as four very powerful spells armageddon bloodlust teleport and ghost army
each spell has its own use to guard followers attack enemies and other uses
there are three enemy tribes matak green chumara yellow and dakini red
levels can have one two or all three enemy tribes that you must destroy
in each level there are vaults of knowledge stone heads andor other special things to help you
some may give you new spells others can destroy parts of the enemy
you can also build buildings but your braves must build them for you
all of the buildings have different uses such as training followers to be warriors or other special followers except the shaman or to reproduce new braves to increase the size of your tribe
overall this game is great and has no flaws yet it is difficult especially the levels toward the end so i would recommend this game to people who have patience lightningfast reflexes and intelligence to form strategiesi had this game years ago and never finished because the disc was broken by mistake
anyway i bought this and have enjoyed playing up to the point i was
i plan to finish the game soon and hope the rest of it is as enjoyable even though the game is years oldi am frugal when it comes to purchasing video games and pc games at full price
i always wait for the reviews and play the demos before i ever buy a game
back in  when i got my first computer i had subscribed to a pc gamer and the demo for this game was on one of the discs
i tired loved it and went and bought it
this is my all time favorite game
i have had and played all sorts of games from pc nintendo xbox playstation dreamcast etc and they all have some great games but i always find myself going back to this one game
i play it over and over and never get tired of it
surprisingly there is a whole community who thinks the same and am so happy about it
with new levels being created for online play
visit strategyplanetcompopulous and you will find a whole world of newness for this game
from the expansion that came out for it to the matchmaker for the online multiplayer option to the age of chaos mod for it
i could go on and on on this game
this game is the one that truly made me enjoy pc games and video gamesthats what i had to do
this game is singlehandedly responsible for my blowing a semester of college
fortunately the classes were easy but man im paying the pricethis is the only game ive ever began playing after dinner and didnt look up to see the time until the sun was rising the next day well with the exception of sid meiers alpha centauri but thats only because i wanted to get the blasted thing over with and return the game to my cousinmy only complaint is theres not enough swamp or fungus
its delicious to hear the natives get gobbled up by these antipostespopulous the beginning is possibly the cutest command and conquer type game ever
its humorous d cartoonlike graphics add a good deal of relief to the sometimes frustrating level difficulties
combat is actually made somewhat funny what with all the wild cries of warriors clashing in battle
magical spells cast by a shaman can cause enemy units to scream histerically and run around like idiots
and maybe best of all the fact that after winning a level aka
world all your followers stop what they were doing dance cheer nonstop and sometimes make kongo linesapart from the amusing graphics populous has extremely addictive gameplay
the mouse clicking skill needed is relatively highthis game deserves any and all high ratings it gets and should be on all pc gamers lists of gamestobuy
its inexpensive price tag makes up for the minor drawbacks it has
if youre still reading and not buying than youre wasting your time
buy populous the beginning put the disk in the drive and then start using your time more efficientlythis game is great
the graphics is great
the sound is great
the spells are awesome
bullfrog have made a great game once againat st when i read all the reviews i was planing not to get the game
but i still decided to get it
its beter than what i expected
i love it
its really cool
i like how you raise your own digimon
i herd the nd version of the game would come out soon
and i herd it would be beter
i think you should get this game
its fun
and by the way im the game works and is great
no scatches and the game is very fun
i love it  this is a great gamecommand amp conquer red alert is the best strategy game out there
use tanks infantry tesla coils planes subs and more to blow the computer apart or take on a friend or seven in multiplayer headtohead to  headtohead  play as the soviets and crush the allies
or be the  allies and save the world from the soviets
make sure you have enough  power to keep your important buildings such as radar and sam sites in  case of a surprise attack
there are three things you need to do  make  sure you have food close by you dont want things like hunger distacting  you
 make all your phone calls now you will be using the modem so much  you cant call them
buy the gameviewed rate  back in the s i played command  conquer when it first came out
it was a good enjoyable game that i quickly followed it up with command  conquer red alert
again it was another good enjoyable game and even better than the original
some of the missions took a while to complete
probably one thing to notice about either was how formulaic they have been
my routine went by this order defend my troops from an initial onslaught find a spot nearby massive deposits of ore to establish a base build up with the usual buildings surround it with defenses ward off incoming skirmishes get to the point where credits are coming in fast enough to build a large supply of tanks and wipe the other base out by a blitzkrieg of tanks
all in all command  conquer red alert was a nice simple game to play
you can easily download the game for free onlinered alert is one of my all time favorite games
i would recommend it to all
the missions are great
there is only one problem in that you cant save skirmishes
this mistake is made up for by the fact that you are so  addicted youll play for hours
the theme of the game is that scienticts  went back in time and killed hitler
now the soviets and allies do battle
both sides are intertaining and diffrent
the game is diffrent enough to  own tiberan sun and red alert
i would recommend to one and alli bought this as part of package deal that had red alert amp both upgrades and man what a deal
this is a very cool game with some great gameplya battles on cut scenes that wer just too cool
the only thing bad about this game was the multiplay
seemed like the russians had too much of an advantage
you always had to over for paratroopers dropping behind your lines otherwise you lost something critical plus the russians got to make bombs which caused alot of damage
i played a freind of mine and beat him  straight times before he wouldnt play me anymore
that was the first time i ever played the game and i was always the russians
other than that this was too cool
you get to play both sides and alot of the levels are very challenging
a must for any command amp conquer fan and realtime game loversone of my favorites but you can only play it on older computers as we had to find one that had windows  on it
one of the games i grew up withthis is quite a classic game
it might be hard to get past the graphics and enjoy the game if youre used to modern games but if you can get past the graphics and enjoy the game for the other aspects you should really enjoy this gameif you enjoyed the other command and conquer games youll likely enjoy this one as well
in my opinion the music on this game and red alert  is also better than the music on some of the newer command and conquer games as wellthe single player can be challenging and quite enjoyable
the campaigns had great storylines fun missions and some quite frustrating ones too and cool unitsthe only downsides that i can see are the old graphics the tanya in this game doesnt seem as good as the one in red alert  and the actor they selected to play her was better in red alert  as welli really enjoyed campc but red alert is all in all the best and most engaging of the  including tiberian sun so far
a great game in the real time strategy genreif you pop this game in and start playing having no clue what youre in for you will either be outrageously amused or annoyed at how ridiculously corny it is
its a rhythm game just like guitar hero
its just plain silly and ulala the protagonist is a caricature of femininity which is just fine because theres not an ounce of degradation about it
i dig this game
it makes precision button mashing a blast
youll have a whole mess of backup dancers before you know itohmygodis she wearing anyumundies
male friend oosslaps male friendmale friend continues to ooi bought this game about  months ago
it was about  less than world series baseball k
world series k has the  correct rosters
i am a guy that likes the mlb team rosters upto the minute correct
since i had time i did all the trades from last season and this season and put it in k
i saved 
for you people that dont have time to do that i would buy k but besides the rosters and maybe a few minor changes k and k are pretty much the same
the game is awesome though it is kind of hard to get used to pitching
excellent graphicsi like it better than ps
the season mode is awesome
go out and buy either k or k soon
ps uptothe minute trades can be found on espncom or mlbcomrecently i am a very deep fan of mlb though i am japanese
it is for that i have many opportunities that i can watch mlb games on japan tv because japanese top baseball player went to mlb
obviousely mlb playing style is very wonderful
mainly the batting is power vs power
the batting form and the flying figure of hit homerun ball is splendid
for instance bbonda rod and gjiamby is sowhen i played this game at first time that is for a few weeks i was very bore for the game
as wrriten in this game review when we set in our defense play the movement almost rely on the computer and we can not reflect our thinking
after that for a few months i put the game to my book shelf
as i got to be a hot mlb fan day by day i remembered about the game of the shelf and played that againunexpectedly i enjoyed the game more than the first time
that will be because i got many knowledge about mlb
i knew that there were some players who had many unique batting forms
in the same time in the game i knew what is expressed many unique batting forms too for instance gshephield sharp batting form ngarusiaparas nervouse glove touch is so
i think that the maker put the deep consciousness to the detailed graphics of players
off course for the native american fans as you such things may be natural but for foreigner fans that is sufficient thingthough the defensive is a little bore certainly the batting play is fun
we can reflect our thinking for the play to some extent therefore the more we improve our batting technique as the batting player will react to our wish
i hit  homeruns a game by using all star custom settingthank you for reading my poor englishthis is the sort of game that should have come out on the dc ages ago
spectacular graphics an interesting story and a great conceptthe game does have some problems still but they are not big enough to diminish the enjoyment this game bringsif you can avoid all the hype and just play the game on its merits and hopefully we will see more games of this calibure being releasedit is a really great game but really hard to beat the product is in perfect condition but the case is little bit chip off other than that i like the game i havent beaten it yet but i will soon enough thanks for the gamethis game took my breath away
the graphics are amazing the story excellent and the suspense never seems to fade
the cutscenes in this game are quite long and advance the story very well
the musical score in this game is truly worth a purchase alone because it mixes asian and european influences together
the one thing that kinda bothered me about this game was the voice acting
this game would have been a whole lot better if they left the voices in japanese
this is one of my all time favourite games and right now i only have two games that stand out from the rest
this game is a must buy
if you dont have a dreamcast well than buy one this game is worth the purchaseas a diehard dreamcast fanatic i fully recommend shenmue
you dont have to spend a ton of money for a factory sealed copy or anything but if you have the console you should absolutely play through this game
the sequel is a little bit better because they addressed some gameplay issues with the first but im lumping them together as the best dreamcast game because the story arc runs across both games
you need to play shenmue before moving on to shenmue iishenmue is the game that really got me back into gaming
how is this possible
it does something no one has been able to do correctly until nowcreate a living virtual world that is not only interactive but open ended enough to allow plenty of freedom for the player
i made the decision to buy an xbox on launch day partly due to the fact that shenmueii would be available for itagain something ive never done before for any gaming systemi had purchased many dc games before shenmue as was thoroughly disappointed or bored with them
when i bought shenmue i found myself so engrossed in this epic game that the hours would pass by without me even consciously knowing itsomething no game was able to do for me since the bit days
for that alone the game ranks very highlyanyway youve heard me rant about how i love shenmue but whats it about and how does it play
the game is about a young japanese man whos father is killed by a mysterious man
the young man ryo takes it upon himself to avenge his fathers death and herein is the beginning of this awesome adventure
the game is similar to a role playing game in that you build skills solve some minor puzzles and do lots of questioning of townsfolk and so on to get to the bottom of the mystery
along the way youll have the opportunity to not only focus on the quest and your physical martial arts training but thanks to the openendedness of the game you can also play and have fun whether by playing actual arcade and parlor games gambling in the casino visting bars or shopping for stuff and building your collection of toys
it all takes place in a third person point of view similar to tomb raider but with incredible graphics and without the horrible control
basically you can do and see whatever you want
some minor rules such as time of day and some physical boundaries exist but nothing too restrictingif you dont have this game yet and own a dc you must play it now
if you have an xbox be sure to buy shenmue ii when its released this fallshenmue is an epic game a masterpiece a must have
is weird as this sounds its a combonation of zelda and crazy taxi
this is a must own for dreamcast owners
its possibly the most realstic game ever
get this game noweven over all the new ps and  games ive played nothing has beat this game yet
this is a game that last with you years after playing it
hope to see some more shenmue games soonthis game has to be the best rpg of all time
its my personal favorite gamein the game you can do anything in this game you can spend the whole day in the arcade if you wany to
the fighting is great to
theres a bunch of cool combos and you can buy more
theres some major twists in the story to youll find the game amazingi have to hand it to yu suzuki and sega
their games may not be immediate classics but they are clearly groundbreaking and players will look back at them and say quotwow i cant believe this game was that inventivequotive played shenmue for only a few days and i have to say its one of the best games ive ever played
the quality and attention to graphic detail is stunning
clearly when youre looking at some characters face its hard to imagine that they are made up of polygonstwitch gamers will not be happy
if youre in for a quick visceral fix youll be disappointed
but if you like exploring like seeing whats behind the corner or underneath that tricycle or even whats in someones desktop drawer you will be estaticshenmue is just one of those games you can sit down and play
play and play
even without following the plotline to the tee you can still do a million thingsif you have a dreamcast buy shenmue
if you dont have a dreamcast do yourself a favor and get one
this game and many others hint hint nflk hint are definitely worth itbefore i write my review i whant to get this straight shenmue is one of the greatest adventurerpgs there arefirst of all the graphics are crystal clear the plot and the fighting scenes are excellent and besides maybe not being enough fight scenes at points in the game this game is greatwhat else can you ask for i mean with know bad parts in the game this game is one of the dreamcast greatsi loved this game
the attention to detail is incredible
the seasons changing the town folk and the citys themselves are just stunning
this isnt just a simple game you assume the role of ryo and play out his life for the next few months
i love this game and wholeheartedly recommend it to any gamerever since the launch of the dreamcast ive been hearing about a game called shenmue
ive seen screenshots first impressions and previews
when it finally came somewhere around  hey 
you cant expect me to know all these things 
 sega has proven to rpg fans that it would become the future of rpgs
in yu suzukis latest creation you will play as main character ryo hazuki in his quest for revenge for the death of his father
shenmue is an interactive game that keeps track of the times changes and events
for example if christmas was only weeks away someone would be dressed as santa claus and some houses and stores would be covered up in christmas decerations
okay thats enough
now lets talk about how the game is like
first off the graphics are flawlessly detailed
some characters dont show much facial expressions but most of the time theyll make a slight twitch or an expression even
the sound isuhnot bad
theres some catchy s style tunes no 
were not talking about billy idol or aerosmiths music 
its segas customizable s music youll hear when you go to a bar somewhere around the outdoors anywhere 
the voice acting is kinda horrible
ryos voice sounds great but most of them are straightup annoying 
the more i kept hearing goro use his squeaky voice i press the bbutton to skip it so i can hear ryos
the gameplay and controls are cool
controling the character isnt really that hard if you have already played rpgs similar to shenmue
some people would complain how slow and unresponsive it is but its actually easy thats what you get for playing to much corny adventure games kid 
the best part of the gameplay are the qte battles and the freestyle battles where you can duke it out with neighborhood gangs and mad locals
the storyline is seamlessuntil disc  the storyline on discs  and  have great stories but disc s story lags a bit
most of the time you have to race daily everytime you got to work and after the race is done you have to do some work as a forklifter
wowfun sarcasm 
there are times when youll encounter a fight on disc  i love beating the tar out of the mad angels at the yokosuka harbor which turns disc  slightly exciting
and the most exciting part is you get to play classic sega arcade games like hang on and space harrier  yen a game
so in the end shenmue turns out to be a perfect gaming experience for rpg fans
this game is so great even some of those ignorant ps lovin dreamcast haters will give this pup a go
if you want to be taken back to the s again shenmue wont dissapointshenmue is just a great stinkin game from start to finish
the characters are memorable the story is interesting and most importantly the graphics were hardcore awesome for their time and still look pretty nice and this game did all kinds of things that were never seen before and you still dont really see in games todaythe qte system really made you feel a part of the game prompting you to hit buttons in the middle of a cinema in order to lead your character in one direction or another
often it would be to block a punch or leap over an obstacle and the most interesting part was that blocking that soccerball with the b button might not neccessarily be the best thing to dowith a clock that ran through every day it gave such an interesting way of managing your time being able to explore places at day or night and the awesome feeling of never knowing when your going to run into a hidden cinema which there were quite a few depending on where you went which day at what timethe collectibles were fun although since they made the sequel on the xbox worthless tradein value bummer but there was just so freaking much to collect
you could even participate in lotteries to collect certain nes games or collectible figuresthis was just such an open ended game and the fighting system was and still is somewhat unique
spending days and nights training in the park those were the dayssome games are just must owns and if you are looking for a cheap way to have a good time with some old classics this is just one of those games that has to be sitting in your collectionoh and if i ever buy a watch of any company i choose itll be a timexunlike some ignorant gamers my opinion is  fair and unbiased
i have no favorite between nintendo sega and sony and i never will
im a hardcore gameri play games to play games thats all
the only reason i mention this is because everybody seems to be throwing that quotfanboyquot word around at anyone who shares their opinion on a game shenmue particularly just look at some of these reviews
with that said onto my review if youre a gamer youve already heard it all about shenmuesome love it some hate it
every gamer has an opinion on this game now and i just so happen to love it
first things first shenmue is not the best game ever like it was hyped up to be its not the best d game ever like next generation thinks it is its not the best dreamcast game so far and its not even the game of the year
what shenmue is however is yu suzukis new groundbreaking masterpiece that could have been at the top of all those best of lists if it wasnt crippled with numerous minor problems
this game is pretty flawed so much so i dont even know where to begin
i guess my biggest complaint would be the control
it definitely takes awhile to get used to as its not very accurate or precise its a bit on the sluggish side and sometimes its overly responsive
the control isnt the worst ever and ive played games that are worst parasite eve just sprang to mind but it could have been so much better too
my second biggest complaint would be the voice acting
in one wordhorrible
if you thought resident evil was bad you havent heard nothing yet
goros line of quotwhats groovin broquot is the single dumbest line in video game history
but despite the voice acting being awful it also has that itssobaditsaddicting quality to it that resident evil does
theres the option of just reading the text yet i never used it
the voice acting is so bad that it kept me wanting more
i wouldnt say that its so bad its good because it isnt
instead its just hilarious
its like those classic kung fu flicks
dont get me wrong i wish the voice acting was done by real professionals but at least theres humor in the game
the music would be my next complaint
ive never really been a huge fan of video game music and shenmue reminds me as to why i probably never will be
most of it is snooze material while the rest isnt enough to be classified as music
falling somewhere between the stuff you hear in an elevator and shudder jpop shenmue is a prime example of just why video game music wontand for the love of all things musical shouldntever appeal to that outside of its game realm
what makes this even sadder is the fact that you can buy cassette tapes in the game and then hear the  my favorite part of the game was fighting
sadly there werent as many fights as youd think there would be
also and while this wont apply to some i found the game easy
clue a leads directly to clue b which points right at clue c and so on
and if all that isnt bad enough i didnt see anything in the way of replay value either
now i can overlook all that stuff if the game itself is that good
and let me tell you it sure is
the story goes a little something like this arriving at his home ryo hazuki realizes that somethings not right as he looks around at the entrance
the doors are wide open a sign is smashed and theres a mysterious black car as well
as he goes in he finds his friends have been beat up
when he walks into the dojo his father iwao and a mysterious man are at odds
the man is asking for a mirror that iwao keeps refusing to hand over
iwao and the man fight and iwao is knocked down
as ryo tries to interfere the man uses ryos life as a trade for the mirror
after he is told where the mirror is ryo is free and then the man and iwao fight again this time iwao was dealt a devastating blow that kills him
and as the game says quotand thus the saga beginsquot original
no nobody is these days but effective and enthralling
very
the first thing youll notice about this game is the freedom you have
you can search through drawers turn off lights train in the dojo play classic yu suzuki games in your living room hang on and space harrier to be specific take pictures off the walls and even use the telephone and to think thats just the stuff you can do at ryos house
wait until you get outside
you can interact with anyone go to the arcade darts and qte title were my favorites feed a cat shop til you drop you can buy everything from little toys to a bag of chips drink soft drinks or coffee and you even get a job
actually forget what i said earlier the first thing youll notice isnt the freedom but the graphics
it honestly wouldnt surprise me if yu suzuki came out and said he hired a small third world company to work on the graphics alone for this game
the graphics are by far and away the best of any console game yet
ps doesnt have anything this good looking on its system and it will be awhile before it does too
graphics certainly dont make or break a game but they are a nice bonus and even those jaded gamers who sneer will be drooling like a dog after seeing the eye candy this game has in store
simply putanyone who tries to tell you the graphics arent impressive is a fool andor liar
my favorite aspect to the game is the fighting system or more specifically the fights
the fighting system is surprisingly deep with a lot of moves to learn and master
you have your standard punch kick and throw moves but it goes beyond that in depth
you can uncover moves by practicing having them taught to you or by buying them
but when it comes down to fighting itself theres nothing like it
the fighting system is like tekken or virtua fighter but completely free roaming you can run behid someone if you want
you more often than not fight numerous opponents and this also makes things tricky as you could be fighting more than one person at the same time
then theres the dragons lairesque parts of the game or as theyre called here qte quick timer events
for those that never played dragons lair the point of the game was to quickly press certain buttons at a certain time of event
for instance when youre about to get hit the a button may flash in the middle of your screen for you to push
if you dont do it quickly enough well you get hit
simple as that
this happens quite often and its pretty fun actually
later in the game you even get a job at the harbor moving crates
riding around on your forklift is funner than you think especially since youre work is often interrupted by a certain gang and while i didnt love all the characters i did like some a lot
ryo of course and master chens son yeah i forgot his name sue me
hype has a way of destroying a game
just look at metal gear solid read very overrated
and shenmue is a flawed game
its not perfect
its short and the ending just leaves it open to its second chapter but its a groundbreaking masterpiece that every gamer must play nonethelessplaying this game is like playing a good movie
avenge your fathers death
its the best game i have ever played on any console
you can interact with just about anything you see in the game
you can go in the arcade buy drinks from vending machine and even go shopping in the stores
everything is realistic
magic weather lets you play a part of the game while its snowing but when you play the game a second time which you propably will
it may be sunny at exactly the same scene
this game has it all
elements of roleplaying action adventure and arcade
i highly reccommend this game to anybodyin shenmue you play as a young detective named ryo who awakes to find his father s been murdered by an evil fiend called lan di
incensed by this ryo vows to exact revenge on those who killed his father and begins a journey of revenge violence and furious anger a bit like kill bill
ryo wakes up at  am everyday and depending on your mood you can do a whole range of things with your day
most days however you will spend your time looking for clues
go around asking people whether they remember anything about the day of your fathers death and soon you will have a whole notepad of clues which will help you on your adventure and gather more cluesfor the most part the fight scenes are quick reaction fights where you have to quickly press corresponding buttons to protect yourself from defeat
a lot of the time though you engage in tekenlike fights where you have to rely entirely on your fighting skills to succeed and move on
by pressing a series of different buttons you can execute a huge array of different moves just like in tekenif youre becoming bored with your mission you can sidetrack and do other things like collect toys play in the arcade listen to your walkman etc
and its this among other things which adds a glorious feel of realism to the game
all in all the experience of this game is so potent that you will find no need to visit japan at all for this is japan
there are hundreds of different elements that add to the realism of being in japan the friendly neighbours
the corner shops
the vending machines
the toy machines
the beautiful japanese architecture
the arcades
the buses
the peaceful tranquility of the place
its a small spordically populated japanese town which i could easily be convinced actually exists it probably does exist actually
i love getting up in the morning and occasionally discovering snow outside
i love the crowded streets in the day time and the isolated disquiet at night
i love the way peoples attitudes change as you progress through the the weeks months seasons
i love getting up in the morning and going to bed at night
it really is like a really exciting version of real lifethe genius of shenmue lies in its ability to merge two worlds together the mundane and the extraordinary
ive reviewed a lot of games that could arguably be called the greatest game ever but if i were made to make choice id probably choose shenmue simply for its uniquenessit was just beautiful
not perfect by any means
you cant go to see anyone in the city or visit
i almost wished it didnt have a driving story but concentrated and fleshed out the town which is what keeps me coming back for its unique depth
it all just feels so beautiful and full of wonder like taking a vacation and living this adventurous life
i could put away those boxes for a long time
after awhile youll wish there were more arcade games or pool or cards something like that
it seems to go too fast but what a time i had with it ill always want to play more the music is incrediblewhats wrong with the game the kitten had no reason to be in the game it adds nothing to the story and has no payoff
the shenmuecom site is down so you cant trade pinball prizes or do anything of much fun also if the kitten adds nothing the stores add very little you cant go into homes and most restaurantsbuildings are purely for looks and i never had to buy move scrolls there were very few big fights until the end you can ask a billion people the same question and they might all answer i dunno in different ways which is a waste of space and adds nothing to the mystery
the second disc could have put you in a new area or something but it didnt the game is satisfying but they chose to make it fall short of what it could have been
youre just left with the story the job and the arcade when it comes down to iti was amazed from the very beginning
breath taking graphics fluent motion and great sound
the largest assortment of interactive characters then any other game around 
along with the top notch visuals and sound shenmue told a great story as well
revenge honor and love are all mixed into this great game
i recommend this game to anyone
and no lie once you begin to play you will not be able to stop till your done
cant wait till the next one comes out
hours of great realistic game play almost begin to wonder witch life is yoursthis game shatters dimensions and to have it again in my life brings me back to my childhood days of lovei cant wait for the sequel ive had this since if first came out and i am still findings new things to domy friend had bought this game hes like man you have to buy it now serious
and i went to the store looked at it i was like ehh alright then the graphics look hott
took it home damn that whole night was gone
gone playing shenmue lol
this game is one of the best games ever made
but then again its a really underrated game for how good it is
its better than most games out there right now but its hardly noticed by gaming fans i would ask people sometimes if they knew what game shenmue was and they wouldnt know
but this game has one of the best story lines in any game and it keeps you playing and playing because you want to see what happens next
the fighting is really fun and the qte battles
one thing i like is that when you need to wait a couple hours for a place to open etc you can go to the arcade and mess around on the games thats fun especially the boxing game lol
but you if you have a dreamcast buy this game dont hesitatethis game is seriously cool it has a very involving plot and amazing graphics
there is an overwhelming amount of speech in the game and most of the voice acting is pretty good
the battle system is very exciting and works a lot like a fighting game like virtua fighter
it is very original
the game has some strongish language later on in it though so it shouldnt really be for kids
its also a little easy but since they are coming out with like nine more sequels its ok  a very awesome game thoughif you own a dreamcast do not miss this game
it is primarily an exploration game with some minigames and classic arcade games playable within the game
you walk up to an arcade game as ryu the character you control in the story  and put in money that you have earned
it is very immersive has spectacular graphics and a great storythis game was very fun to play and sets up the story for a nice sequelalthough it wasnt released in the usa on dreamcastthe graphic are out standing for dreamcast its the quality of early xbox  releases cod  and such best played with a vga connector but i tried it in p with another connector cable and wow the colors popped and the graphics were amazingthis is the greatest game on the sega dreamcast
the second being sonic adventure  i say this because this game is unlike any game youve played before
trust me i have a strong disliking towards rpg games but this isnt a rpg
its like an rpg but there is so much that makes it different from a rpg game
in fact its a genre of its own called free
it is one of the most interactive  innovative games of its kind
unique
dare i sayperfection
you can play arcade games inside this game such as hangon or space harrier
if you know how to play virtua fighter youll do very well in the fight scenes
forget final fantasy
this game is for youthis game was so explosive when it first hit shelves the rumor was that the creators spent over  just to make it or something like that
its a story of a young man who is on a journey to avenge the death of his father and well it goes from there
the graphics are highly stylized in and located in japan where you talk to people ride motorcycles play arcade games train hunt people down make phone calls and more throughout different towns and villages
this is just the icing on the cake but lets say the amazing thing about this game is that it emulates real life so perfectly and on such a deserving system  it has i believe  disks to it and i wouldnt dare leave this life without one
very good game
a must havethere is only one word to describe this game awesome
this game has everything from a highly detailed d world unlike anything ive seen in a game
ever
an awsome plot that makes you want to keep playing as much as you can so you can unlock the the rest of the story as soon as you can
quotmagic weatherquot and quottime controlquot make this game even more lifelike than most rpgs even though this game has rpg elements in it
and the qte is something weve never seen in a video game before
which makes this game more original than others
now some complain that the game is too slow and for some it might come out like that
this game is not for everyone
however i think everyone should get the chance to play it and try something unlike any game weve played before
although i do find it annoying that this is only quotchapter quot and we have  more chapters to go untill the game is compleat
which means we have to empty out a lot of pocket money to play the whole game
but other than that this is a great game that should be played by everyone
and remember its only on dreamcast
take that sonythe worst things you can say about this game  its slow its graphics are datedif you dont think youll mind those things and you like an immersive game that makes you want to climb through the screen and exist in the world beyond chunky polygons and all give this game a tryi have a library that covers over  dreamcast games and i would have to say that this one impresses me the most
this adventure brings any gamer closer to realism than she or he has ever been
dialogues do not have to be read but they are heard and you feel like a third party member eavesdropping on a conversation every time the main character engages in one
the graphics are not the only reason why i am impressed so much but the fact that it spans all genres is incredible
if you like fighting games there instances where you can beat up some thugs or if you like racing you can hop on a motorcycle and burn rubber
feel like gambling or playing pool it is there and if you want to go back to some classic sega master system games you can
this is a must buy because it is the best game of its type that has ever been created and it is the most revolutionary for all of its attention to detail
this game is a must buy for any gameri recently wrote a review for shenmue and i realize that my judgment was completely premature
i hadnt completed the game yet
in fact i wasnt very far
anyway this game though frustrating at times trying to find people etc
is amazing
the graphics are crystal clear control is great fights are awesome and the realism is unparalleledpeople exist in shenmue as they do in the real world
you have friends enemies and strangers that go about their lives and arent concerned with yoursmy personal favorite parts of the game include the following
your job at the harbor
driving a forklift is so cool
plus you race with your coworkers everyday before you begin your work
you are supposed to move crates around to different warehouses
its pretty fun really
realtime battles
i think there should be a shemue fighting game because i loved these battles
theres nothing quite like getting in a fight with six people and using your moves youve learned from friends to beat the  out of all of them
the instantaneous judgment situations
at certain parts of the game a button will flash on the screen and if you dont press the button you will for example get punched in the faceso in conclusion kudos to yu suzuki and everyone at sega of america inc youve done a great jobshenmue is without a doubt an experience in video games there truly is nothing else like it on the market today
the graphics are so superb and meticulous attention is paid to every detail imaginable
the voice acting is rather well done too although some of the voices sound rather sarcastic and like theyre hiding something
the controls will take some time getting used to but once you do youll be loving shenmue
this massive game was originally the first of many chapters but shenmue  has been cancelled for the us dreamcast a shame so this is a true gem
by the way there is nothing better than being able to play the original versions of space harrier an all time favorite of mine and hang on even though the controls for it are rather sensitive and the other arcade games are fun too
tedious at times and sometimes just plain frustrating shenmue is an experience and its a sin if your a dreamcast owner and dont have thisfor those not in the know this is the dreamcasts hype equivalent of say metal gear solid
the one game that is supposed to pick you up and knock your socks clean off
and it does that but not with constant action fighting or gunblazing battle scenesthis is an exploration game very much in the vein of the old sierra games like kings quest police quest and space quest
it is less of a quotbeat em upquot than a quottalk and walkquot  because that is basically what you do talk to person a get a hint as to who person b is and where to find them then take a walk to find person b  there are little diversions along the way such as taking care of a kitten buying everything from canned soda to little toy trinkets interacting with the largest set of characters ever seen in a video game and morethe action comes in  forms either tqe scenes which are twitch reaction events that demand you hurry and press a button that appears on screen and the other is the actual fighting sequences where you use various moves to battle differing amounts of enemies
the action is fairly few and far between and you will spend most of your time walking and talking
there is training time but since it is not normally against an opponent the action there is minimalwhat made this game so jawdropping for me was the scope of it all
you roam from city to city meeting dozens of different people all with their own personalities visiting dozens of buildings and shops each with its own flavor and purpose and manipulating dozens of objects
i give the games creator and allaround sega mastermind yu suzuki a worlds worth of credit because coordinating all of the aspects of this game must have been a nightmare
and to think this is only part  of complaints
well compared to metal gear solid the voice acting in shenmue is well laughably bad
it could have really made you feel like you were living a fantastic movie but the absolute wooden stiffness that the lines are delivered with along with their interminable slowness quothiryo howareyoutodayquot really ruin the awesome sense of realism that remains otherwise intactthe only other complaint from me is the stubborn control
in most games such as this up always walks you forward
in shenmue whichever way you point the digital pad is the way you move
this makes for some maddeningly uneven amp unpredictable movements
luckily due to the slow exploratory pace of the game the only place where the molasses control becomes truly infuriating is during the scant battle sequencesbut control and translation issues aside this game addicted me like no illegal narcotic ever could
you dont ever want to put it down
every event leads to another event with more areas to explore and people to interact with
the game is fairly easy to beat but a game like this is meant to be an enlightening exploration experience not a frustrating quotdo the same board   times just to get it rightquot kinda thing
it really took me back to an era of simpler games with epic storylines and expansive worlds to explore
i had more fun with this than with almost any other game in recent memory all the way back to metal gear solid on psx
a landmark achievement that will most likely be one day crowned quotbest dreamcast title everquotone reviewer already said he prefers metal gear to shenmue so if thats your cup of tea then maybe this game isnt for you
but taken from an rpgreality simulation game this game is the best so far
you have to train and discover new fighting moves on your own
at times there are qt scenes where you gotta react instinctively for certain events to unfold
how many out there were too slow at first and managed to get the ball to hit the little girl
 you can raise a little cat while youre on your adventures
theres just alot of little mini things that may or may not have anything to do with the plot which makes this interesting
so if youre the type that just wants to blow stuff up and likes a fast paced game then shenmue isnt for you
but if youre like me and love little distractions and have patience then this game is great
heck i once spent  minutes just stalking one guy in tenchu and that was fun for me
of course the game isnt perfect
there are little flaws like the dialogue becoming repetitive at times not being able to skip certain scenes youve been thru before or my biggest gripeno analog control
it does get a bit inconvenient at times when youre in a cramped space and only have digital control
but still this game definitely ranks up there as one of the great games
but like every great game it might not be your cup of tea
if you dont like a particular type of game why buy into the hype
that would be like me buying madden when everyone says its one of the greatest games but i dont give a care about sports gamesput simply shenmue was the main reason i picked a dreamcast at allthe notion of a truly open world game albeit a relatively small one was so far ahead of its time when shenmue released it is almost tragic
far worse is the fact that there is no shenmue  yetshenmue at its core is third person exploration game with actionrpgfightingqtequick time eventselements
this style of play is still copied today in games like indigo prophecy farenheit oustide the us and heavy rain
the main difference is shenmue beat heavy rain out by a decade and included actual fighting based off the virtua fighter enginefull of beautiful music and an engrossing story shenmue still looks grapically decent today in  it is the prime candidate for these hd rereleases so popular in this console cycle and its a wonder it still hasnt been made for download in xblpsnif you own a dreamcast shenmue would be an oustanding and must have addition to your libraryshenmue for the sega dreamcast may possibly be the greatest video game experience ive ever had in my gaming daysincluding shenmue ii for xbox
shenmue is about a young man out for revenge to find his fathers murderer but theres way more too it i wont spoil anything other then this game is flat out beautiful and should be played by gamers that wont wyn about the slow paced actionlike the title above this is yu suzukies masterpiece the man worked extreamly hard on this amazing gameshenmue is also known as one of the most expensive video games ever created
sadly yu suzukies hard worked game never made any good sales because of the pss launch i like many others got it at the time it was first released this game is just pure brilliance
the visuals are some of the best seen in gamesthis may be the longest game review ive ever done so lets get to itvisualsthis is one of the if not theeee best looking dc game ever made everything is so detailed and the character models are great
the building the atmoshpere thank you so much suzukiegameplayok this is probably the reason this game is the most hatedloved game ever created
its extreamly slow paced and may turn off some casual gamers but if you can hold on long enough the action will start to come up
the game play is simple and easy to get use to very quickly
the game plays like a mystery novel ask people question and clues about something and when you find some clues you go ask other people that may know but this game pulls it off so well its not even funny
this gameplus shenmue ii has the best fighting engine ever
its taken straight out of the virtura fighter games
and the free battle sequences are extreamly rare yet very fun in the game
did i mention you can do almost everything in this game
well not everything but alot of things like getting a job gambling and alot of the other things that can be done in real lifesoundmusicwhen i say this games music is beautiful it is ten times better then mgs   especially the main theme which youll notice alot its amazing if theres one thing yu suzki did wellother then everything els its the music in this game pure brilliancecontrollsim really lazy to get into this but there pretty goodlemmi just some it up right nowthe goodsuperb visualsgreat controlssuperb soundamazing inviormentsloads of things to doawesome fighting engineone of the most expensive games ever madea beautiful story about vengence but with alot to itthe badaction gamers will be turned off by how slow paced this game gosfor some long for some a short game took me about  hours my first time but thats because i just did all the story parts and not the side queststhe sales for this and shenmue ii did so bad that we probably wont see a shenmue iii anytime soonfor anyone looking for a good challenge for this and shenmue ii look elswere its pretty simple an pretty straight forwardif youre looking for a unique game try get this game and get it quick because this as well as many other dreamcast titles are very hard to find these daysand are already out of print and youll be lucky if you find it used
other then that shenmue is an instant classic with everything on the spot yu suzukie created something more then a gamethis game is not just good because it feels like youre acctually in that world and living ryus lifethis is good because yu suzukie braught us something that just feels so real and like as if there really is a world like thatacctually there is japan duuhh but still no other game has hit me or motivated to the point were i have to play this game more then shenmuethis game is hands downone of the greatest video game experiences youll ever have when it all comes down to this i give shenmue for the sega dreamcast a out of  starsbrilliantjustbrilliantquite possibly the most underrated video game of all time
shenmue pushed the limits of its time with absolutely amazing visuals enamoring stories and lovable characters
what shenmue does right a lot of current games should take note
shenmue was way ahead of its time during its inception and years later  remains one of my constant revisitsif you happen to have a sega dreamcast i highly recommend this video gamethe goodgraphics while the current gamers of the mass effect days may not appreciate shenmue its graphics are well above its time
quite possibly the most visually exceptional video games on the sega dreamcastgameplay the realism side games fighting training and exploring of this game makes an excellent mix of a classic rpg  fighting game
if youre a fan of fighting games like tekken and virtual fighter  you will absolutely love the fighting offered in this game
and for those who enjoyed such games as hard rain  youll enjoy the qte which was originated in this game
and if youre a fan such as i who loves free world roaming in their video games  again another thing you will love
shenmue offers a lot of different gameplay for fans
and even has some cool arcade games that you can access in the ingame arcadeimportant note this is a long game especially for these days and will keep you interested for quite some time  especially if youre looking to get all of the collectables and side challengesstoryline the storyline is absolutely gripping
mixed with some spy sleuthing exploration and all out fighting  the story captures you like no other
the story that starts here and continues in shenmue  will always keep you at attention
a story of vengeance and so much more
a solid plot that continues to unveil itself as you progress
the characters are lovable relatable and the bad guys are just fun to hate
great job by sega and yu suzukithe badvoice acting while it gets better in shenmue  the voice acting if left on english is pretty poor and is quite the target for parody
but if you can look past that  the rest of the game more than makes up for itthis is my favorite game of all time
virtua fighter mixed with an rpg
the most detailed and realistic environments i have ever seen
i played this back when it was originally released and still have not played a game that can blend fighting action and story together
its like playing a martial arts movie
way ahead of its time
yu suzuki has made some of the most important games of our time
along with shigeiru miyamoto they are in a class of their ownshenmue takes place in japan circa  lan di a warrior comes to ryos fathers dojo in search of a mirror
ryos father refuses to give lan di the mirror while ryo finds out his father killed someone in battle a long time ago
since he didnt give lan di the mirror he killed his father
ryo sets off in an adventure to avenge revenge on lan di
awesome game
superb graphics high detail
my only con about shenmue is you have to walk around too much
a great mix of fighting adventure and rpg
great job sega
lets hope shenmue  is just as goodshenmue has got to be one of the greatest games ever if not the best game
it has everything you want in a game action adventure fighting rpg and even a little driving
dont listen to people like themindzi he is probably someone who only plays stupid games like grand theft auto and doesnt apreciate the originality of shenmue
believe me there is no other game like shenmue which shows that a game just does not get any more original and innovative than that
i own shenmue  and  for dreamcast and i cant wait for the next one to come out on xboxalthough this game has been released for a while and i have played this like a year ago it is still an extrodanry game
i love the little town and how you can talk to any person at all
also i love the gte and free battles
i also liked the storyline
that is what drew me into the world that ryo hazuki lives in
the music goes from cheeryin the daytime to almost unnerving in the nighttime
also the different array of moves that ryo learns is awesome because there are just so many
i highly recommened this game to owners of dreamcastsno review is worthy of such a awesome gamegraphics sound  gameplay fun  you know those adventure games that try hard to put you in the roll of some person while still keeping you entertained in whatever the story is about but ultimately ending up failing and leaving you feeling disappointed
well this isnt one of them
this game is so great and captivating that you will be hard pressed to put it down until it is over
yes it is that good and everything about it is a masterpiece
the voice overs are probably the weakest point but that is a trivial argument compared to everything else
the music and sounds are great and the graphics are fantastic
the developers really knew how to push the limits of the dreamcast considering this game looks better than alot of xbox games
anyways i would recommend this to people who want to experience a truly incredible game
although newcomers should keep in mind that this game is not for those who are lacking in patience and this game requires backtracking and talking to lots of city folk
its too bad shenmue  didnt leave me with the same wow factor that the first one did
now i am looking forward to shenmue  since it is supposed to be an mmorpgshenmu is an absolutely astonishing game
the graphics are the best i have ever seen on the dreamcast so if this is a starter for things to come then they have made me well happy
the game has loads of detail in it from the proper sized shadow to the sky changing depending on the time of day and the real time factor
there are plenty different ways to go and there are plenty of people there to help you as you go along but there also people who wont be happy with you for asking them questions
the fight sequences are one of the best parts of the game and learning moves as you go along was also one of my favourite parts
i also enjoyed the added touch that sega had added with the arcade games i loved playing some of the old classics
this is the game that no dreamcast should be withouti can still play it some  years after it was released
this game is amazing
now if i could only get shenmue   lan di has had his coming for some time and i want revengethis game is very slow paced at first
i was so not into it it felt clumsy and boring
but it really pays to play those first few boring hours because it really picks up once you start getting more into the plot and the coolness of being able to be free play games and just checking out the awesome scenery
discs  and  are really great and the fighitng engine is superb and very reminiscent of virtua fighter
having a day job working  to  in disc  is more fun then youd imagine
and the story line is good enough to keep you going
like i mentioned above it really feels like youre playing an epic movie like lord of the rings or crouching tiger hidden dragon
it has an ending that leaves you really wanting to continue and frustrated that part  will never see the light of day on dc
this is the last game i bought for my dc
and what a way to goyes thats right i will always hold on to my dreamcast there are a number of classic games i own for it but shenmue perhaps tops them all
now i hear a lot of people saying that shenmue is boring and you spend a lot of time doing nothing but i couldnt disagree more
im the kind of person who loves to explore in games i play a lot of rpgs and i like to make sure i find all the secrets in a game if its any good
that is the beauty of shenmue as well as advanvcing the plot which is great i can also spend free time down at the arcade or play pool etc it is as close as you will get to real life in a gameboth this and shenmue ii are classics but i can never forgive sega for not releasing the rest of the series
i know it was an expensive game to make but im sure there is a huge demand for shenmue iii i only hope they get their act together and get yu suzuki back to working on it again
back to shenmue itslelf the plot is superb i even enjoyed working at the docks as a forklift driver while trying to get info on the mad angels
the fighting is superb both regular battles and the qte fights which you see in all sorts of games now in fact the moves are taken straight out of virtua fighter
it also had a great replay value i completed it numerous times trying to collect capsule toys and better my scores at the mini games like darts
the best mini game of all though was right at the end the  man free battle time attackthe  man battle involved fighting your way through  mad angels members including  bosses along the way and was the highlight of the game
once you had completed the game you could do it again and try to set a best time for it as with all the mini games you could then enter it on the world rankings
i cant remember my time but it was at one stage in the top  in the world and i must of tried to beat it at least  times
i havent even mentioned the classic sega games you could play at the arcade space harrier which is impossible super hang on etc were all available to set top scores on there is just so much to see and doif you still own a dreamcast and not this then you are mad pick it up now before it vanishes off the face of the earth classici am so happy to finally have a copy of this game
it is a great looking game fun to play toothis game is great
it has the best graphics that dreamcast has to offer
it has a great storyline great music great voice overs and a lot more
you dont have to follow the story line very much
you can go to the arcade and play old timer d games this game takes place in 
you can even by the little cheap  cent toys out of those machines you see at food stores
thats just for his collection
i like the battles and all the characters that are in it
if you have a dreamcast and you like rpg games then this is a must haveone of the best games ever made
this game is so in depth there is no other games out there that are like this game
its unique in its own style
when i first purchased this game i was shocked first of all to see the graphics are how good it looked
being on dreamcast it used all of dreamcasts potential
this game has one of the best storylines than any other game that ive ever played
it keeps you going and keep wanting to play to find out more and more it keeps you locked into the game
you can keep up on your newer objectives and what needs to be done by looking in your notebook
its a free world here
you can do what you want
talk to anyone you want go where you want pretty much
its a free world
you can pretty much walk into any buildingstore
it has really good fighting battles
like the timed qte battles are really fun where it tells you what button to press and you have to press it within a certain amount of seconds then he does a karate move on them
and also the free battles are really funif you have a dreamcast and what an awesome game and has an awesome storyline i stronly recommend this game nowshenmue is an incredible experience right from the start
i just got the game on sunday and today friday i am just completing the st out of  disks
my advice to you is dont believe what many people are saying about this being a boring game
it is actually one of the most addicting gaming experiences i have ever had i play this more than i played zelda sound the sound is fantastic
i love how the tone of the music reflects what is happening in the game in a tense situation the music adjusts accordingly
one point off however for the sometimes annoying music at ryos residencecontrols a lot of people dont like the controls at first
they are awkward but after about a half hour of playing it will be like second nature
at this point i wouldnt change them even if i couldgraphics the best graphics on any console
playstation  has so far been unable to match it
no detail is left outgameplay  this is where shenmue goes from being a good game to a fantastic one
the storyline pulls you in and doesnt let you goreplay value  i havent finished the game yet but i can tell you right now that i will play it again
the storyline is one you would like to see repeated and it is virtually impossible to do everything the first time through
rpgs however eventually get old but that is what shenmue ii is for
even if the series is never completed even if shenmue ii is the final chapter i will never regret having played this game and will play it again and againreviewers tilt overall score  folks shenmue is the reason enough to warrant the  on a dreamcast
no true gamer should miss out on this experience
after completing the game i will be sure to give you my final thoughts
by then all of you should by this gamedeveloped by csks am and procuded and directed by the legendary game creator yu suzuki shenmue is nothing short of absolute brillance in the history of gaming
to the overwhelming amount of graphical detail nothing comes close folks
not even ps not by a mile
 and the beautifully realized theme song
imagine a game where you can go where you want do what you want almost any time you want to and you too will get the idea of how much you can make this game be either an unforgettable experience or a bland attempt at doing whatever you want
yes you choose how this game is to you
if you stand around in real life youll be bored
you stand around in shenmue youll also be bored
if you do stuff youll have fun
its up to you to make this the experience it was sought to be and theres nothing more fun than going to a virtualarcade
shenmue will become part of your life you will want to learn japanese and yes oh yes you will remember this game
one of my personal favoritesif you own a dreamcast you have to give this game a try
if you liked the tony hawk games but want something a bit more ridiculous and silly then this is probably something youll enjoyeverything was done right with this game
its an amusing interesting unique game concept
the graphics use an outline technique that makes a d world of d characters to produce an effect something like quotwho framed roger rabbitquot
i generally cant take video game music and i used to live in japan and hated jpop even more but the soundtrack for this game is great has some genuinely cool tunes
gameplay is smooth and fun and baddies have an overthetopness to them that matchs the cartoon atmospheretheres unfortunately minor difficulties with slowdown and camera angles
aside from these problems this is a game like pacman a really unique idea thats executed so well theres nothing that could be improved upon
i think this is the best game for the dreamcast or any other system
and strongly recommend itthis was probably one of the greatest titles for the dreamcast and probably one of the most memorable games made
this is one of the first games that used cell shade style graphics that gave it a really unique look and added to how visually striking the game was
the premise of the game was simple youre a hooligan with roller blades trying to put your graffiti all over town
its been awhile but if i remember there were other groups trying to do the same and police would try to catch youthats about all i remember
if youre interested in this title it sounds like xbox live and psn will probably have them available for download in the futureratingawhile the sega dreamcast will always be known for its niche following of specific licenses and projects that were well thought out but never received the commercial accolade they so deserved it is by sifting through the grains of sand and finding specific games of this long gone system that we find a hugely underrated and classic game in the wake of jet grind radio
featuring a cast of characters that never seems to get old and the continuous joy of tagging graffiti and running away from the police becomes increasingly more enjoyable as you collect graffit souls that open up newer and bigger tags
while i personally prefer the quicker pace of future dont let that fool you into tinking this game is not as enjoyable its just not as polished and as quick paced
in this iteration spraypainting is accomplished by doing motions on the controller similar to streetfigthers fireball motions etc
the music is as equally impressive as the visual style which at the time of this games release was one of the original titles to featre celshading a technique employed just recently to capcoms killer  with excellent results
perhaps a game like this deserves to stay as an underground success but it is unfortanate that we will probably never see a third game in this excellent series after the lukewarm sales of jsrf
oh well though at least weve got the two games but who knows maybe one day smilebit will grace us with another excellent entry into this forgotten artistic masterpiece of a gamethis game is the best
its like tony hawk with graffitti
you do tricks and grind up and down rails
you have to collect cans to do all the graffitti in the levels
there are  different cities and  differnt gangs going against you
plus a bunch of differnt charactersthis game has such style and character that you havent seen since the dawn of the original nintendo
this is the most hip and fresh game that i have ever laid my eyes upon
granted rob zombie is not the best representative of quothipquot but trust meeverything else is
the animation is simply amazing
outlined d polygons on top of motioncaptured charactershugely detailed sets with an impressionistic style
one little glitch is that the viewing distance is not as long as you would like it to beitems can be just out of view even if you can see the background just underneath it
and the camera angles can be a bit of a nuisance as i read in a preview long ago
if you get stuck in a corner you cant really use the recenter tool effectivelybut make no mistake the music and visuals leave an indelible impression on your mind that you will remember for a long time
the soundtrack includes the aforementioned zombie jurassic  mixmaster mike and many many more tracks
and after the initial storyline you can skate around the vast locations and race the cpu make your own tags etc
one thing i would love to see is a two or more player mode where you challenge each other to tags or races
itd be fun to even just skate around with your friends online and tag each other
capture the flag the possibilities are endless with the broadband adaptor
till then heres to the most original game in recent years
great job smilebitbut not without its faults
jet grind radio is getting comparisons to both tony hawks pro skater and crazy taxiand its obvious as to why
the jumping and grinding the rails the tricks and the skating vibe has more than its share of tony hawk in it
the arrows that direct you the nonstop action and the way it plays is very much like crazy taxi
so is jet grind radio basically those two games put together
no
definitely not
the characters and the graphics are superior to those two games put together and the tagging element is original
my biggest complaint is the controlits pretty lame
the a button is to jump the r button is to accelerate and the l button is used to both guide the camera and tag
the three left over buttons arent used
duh sega
its so frustrating using the l button when trying to tag the bosses ill get to this later and instead it refocuses your camera
theres no brake button either which isnt too important but would have been nice
what also bothered me was the lack of a two player option
why would sega not put that option in here
jet grind radio couldve been one of my alltime favorite games had there been the option of two players
ah yesmy nemesis that plagues video games everywherethe camera
its bad enough that theres a cheap cameratag button but the camera has a way of screwing up like they always do
but what about the good points you say
theres plenty of those let me tell you while i usually shy away from starting my praises with the graphics theyre not as important as gameplay ya know i cant really help it here
the graphics in jet grind radio are simply astonishing
the celshaded world of jet grind radio is unbelievable
just watching this game looks like youre watching a cartoonactually that would be an insult the game
jet grind radio looks better than the cartoons us companies put out not on par with anime but we cant have it all i suppose
it makes disney look like crayon books in motion
unbelievable i tell you unbelievable
next would be the gameplay
addicting comes to mind so does amazing
but the word that describes jet grind radio best is fun
i havent had this much single player fun for my dreamcast since well when was the last time i had this much fun
yes this is more addicting than shenmue and i think it belongs up there in ranks with it
i cant tell you how much fun it is grinding down a rail at top speed leaping through the air like a superhero and then tagging the wall
sweet
the music to jet grind radio is more quirky hiphop than anything and it easily fits the game and yes i like it
theres some cuts from real artists such as rob zombie why did they label him industrial though
duh
 jurassic  mix master mike cold and more
some are complaining about this since most of the jpop is gone from the importi say good riddance as i hate jpop
but the music in this game is catchy and even though i am a rob zombie fan it still seems odd putting him in this game
still a good remixed song though and i enjoyed it very much
the characters are great too
my personal favorite was cube of course us goths are neglected in games so its nice to see one in hereplus shes cute heh
she has become one of my favorite video game characters of all timeshes cool shes hip and well shes a goth
but i loved all the characters in this game they all have an irresistable charm to them and even the bad guys were great love shockers
one has to wonder why beat is the main character though i love the guy but him over say cube or combo
please
i would have prefered having cube and combo you gotta love the fact that combo skates with a boombox kicking out quotphat jamsquot didnt come out so late in the game thoughas they were my two favorite charactersbut thats alright i suppose
like they should the characters all have different statistics
one may be better at tagging one might be faster while the other might have a bigger life bar so experimenting with the different characters is key here
speaking of life bar something that tony hawk or crazy taxi didnt have was enemies
at times this can get annoying seeing as how your only real defense is to flea but they add a challenge to the game
there are all sorts of enemies that chase youfrom tanks to helicopters to losers running up and tackling you theres a fair amount of baddies to avoid
te bosses can get annoying though as you have to tag three of them onthe backand like everything else you do youre on a timer
they always knock you down and take off this gets frustrating when you need one more tag and they knock you down and you die
the length of the game isnt very long actually but for some reason this didnt bother me as i keep going back to it for more
all in all jet grind radio is one of the best games for the dreamcast yet
it has a decent challenge great characters great dialogue the option of creating your own graffiti and it leaves you with a strong addiction due to its infectious semioriginal gameplay and hey theres even some more levels than the japanese versionalthough i wish they stuck with the original name jet set radio
a must own masterpiece that deserves to be in every dreamcast owners library
i cannot wait for jet grind radio sega just better leave cube in though if they know whats good for emill make this short and sweet
you skate around huge towns spraying and avoiding
the sound track kicks something for anybodyand if not blare yours and turn off the others
create and download all types of grafitti imaginable
it is also only  bucks
so go out and buy it and one last thing jet set radioi got this game for christmas and i havent put it down since
i havent even touched nflk or shenmue since getting it
dont get me wrong i really love nflk and i have only played shenmue for like  minutes since getting it but jet grind radio has got to be one of the most addictive games i have ever played
its a lot like crazy taxi but in my opinion much better
the graphics are excellent the music is by some of todays hottest artists including rob zombie and professional murder music
every single stage i play i learn something new that i can do concerning tricks
man if someone doesnt take away the controller from me soon i just may not see the light of day againif you have been looking for a while for another good dreamcast game to add to your collection look no further
jet grind radio is one of the best dreamcast games ever
the first things you will notice about the game is its graphics
sega made jet grind radio the first cellshaded game ever created
another nice touch is the funky music they play while youre playing the gamethe story behind this game is great
the city tokyoto is under control by four spraypainting gangs
the ggs youre gang poison jam the noise tanks and the lover shockers
your goal is to wipe out poison jam the noise tanks and the love shockers
however the police force in tokyoto has had it with all the graffiti all over the walls of the city on buildings as well as on cars and buses
the police force is willing to do anything to capture you and your gangthe object of the game is simple yet extremely fun
in each level you skate around collect spray paint cans find the red arrows and spray paint your tag
but you must be careful and pretty skilled to avoid the cops tear gas dogs misslelaunching helicopters and even tanks
this makes the game much more challenging and will often leave you dead before being able to complete the mission
after you beat some of the levels you will often be challenged by rivals to show off your skills
other times later in the game a few punks will want to join your gang but for them to join you have to be them and copy what your gangs members dothis is definitely an awesome game with tons of replay value
if you never had a chance to pick this one up for your dreamcast you dont know what youre missingthis game is very fun
very cool looking
im recommending this game to all dreamcast owners its a must havethis game like the console it was released on went under the radar among gamers
for those of you who have played the game know it pushed the dreamcasts capabilities to the max and was a funfilled game for anyone to enjoygraphics the developers of the game went with cellshading which was probably the best thing they did for the game
the characters and the way the game was done jumped out at youstoryline actually pretty decent you play as a member of the ggs fight the main villian gouji rokakku or something like that who is bent on taking over japan using other street gangs and the cops to take you out
you can choose between tab beat or gum in the beginning and unlock more characters as the story developes
after you beat the game and get jet ratings in sidestuff in the game you can play other events as a member of poison jam love shockers noise tanks and even your dog pottscontrols its easy you pick up the controller and start moving aroundthat simple
doing grafitti at first can be tricky but once you get it down its very simple and fun something they unfortunately took out in the second game
your character moves really slow but you can press a button to help sprint you along but doesnt last to longlevels levels are easy to navigate and all the grafitte and cell shading is candy to the eye
one thing my friend and i did would go around the areas looking to see if we could find rails and boards and stuff to do tricks on and make circles around parts of the level for maximum pointsmusic the music in this game is incredible and youll eventually start singing along with it and not even know it
there are a few songs that will make you go nuts but its only one or twooverall this game is fun easy to pick up and an overall joy to play
i cant think of anything bad the game really does
it gets an easy  out of  stars from this longtime fanthis game is one of the dreamcasts finest
its fun exciting and the visuals are pretty interesting
there isnt a lot of lasting appeal but it certainly is worth the experienceto tell you the truth i didnt like the tony hawk games very much
in fact after about an hour of that game i was ready to throw my dreamcast nintendo  or playstation across the room if i had to play any more of it
it wasnt that it was a bad game
it just had no point to it what so ever
and that is why i didnt preorder jet grind radio right away
i thought right away that this would be the same this as tony hawk
boy was i wrong
while tony hawk was about nothing but performing tricks jet grind radio is a game that takes place in the futurewhere the government has too much controll and teenagers now have only one way to express themselves
no its not music
its graffity
you have to spraypaint your logo everywhere you go while avoiding the cops fbi air force assasins and watch dogs
sound fun yet
theres more
you can also creat your own logos get a bunch of new charicters to play around with and perform tricks just by pressing the abutton
while tony hawk gets old very quickly jet grind radio keeps you intrested till the end
 you cant go wrongjet grind radio is the kind of game you can just play forever or at least it seems
for those who quotgetquot the premise theyll find endless interest in trying to perfect their grinds find more runs more tricks and just see how far you can push your ideas and the game
jet grind radio is the kind of game that rewards those who like to really spend time with their games
if youre a more casual gamer you may be disappointed that working through the game seeing every level is not that hard nor takes that longjet grind radio is yet another impressively creative title to come out of sega which is why im so fond of sega and definitely rates as a successthe concept is simple you skate around towns tagging spraypainting certain objects while evading police officers police dogs rockets from helicopters and other baddies
the animation style is really what cements the experience as being something out of the ordinary though
dubbed quotcelshadingquot the end result is something that looks very much like a cartoon
its really beautiful to watch as well as playthe gameplay is fun but has some problems
the first which likely everyone has addressed is camera control
there are  unused buttons on the controller and the developers still decided for some unknown reason to double up controls
its annoying but you learn to live with it
the other issue that bugs me is that youre constantly on the run from police with no real defense other than fleeingone other problem i have is with the menu system
when you boot up youre given the choice of starting a new game playing a tutorial or loading an existing file
however once you have a game in play through creating a new game or loading you have to reboot the system to load another
this is really a patently ridiculous feature and particularly annoying if you like alternating w a friend but keep seperate game filesone other note i should make is that the worlds may seem smaller than they were described by other reviewers at first
i was pretty aggravated and disappointed for a while until i got far enough that i was actually given the opportunity to skate more or less freely without worry of harassment by police etc its a bit into the game but worth noting if you get discouragedall in all jet grind radio is still a fantastic game and definitely a game to get for the dreamcast
there are minor points that really should have been taken care of but other than that a solid efforteverything about jet grind radio has classic written all over it
the anime style graphics and some great original gameplay keep you entangled in the game for days
not much plot but who cares basically you play an angry teenager skating around spraypainting public property and outrunning and outmanuvering the cops while doing it
after the first real mission the game gets downright addicting and even more fun than before something sega is great at doing with most of their inhouse developed games
the soundtrack is surprisingly decent too even though im not into hiphop at all tracks from rob zombie cold and professional murder music add to the replay value
the only problem with jet grind radio is that there is no multiplayer internet mode which would have made this the greatest game ever made but thats only a minor gripe
all in all an excellent game that any dreamcast owner should havereally worth much more than the price tag this is a game that anyone will like
the fairly juvenile premise did turn a lot of folks off when the game was first released myself included but i am very glad i looked past that and picked it upawesome gameplay good cohesive storyline fresh stylish animation very inventive and compelling level design that shows how much the dreamcast as a system is capable of
not to mention a fairly decent amount of playtime in order to beat it no arcade minutesandyouredone syndrome
cruise around a portion of the city bumping off opponents amp painting over their graffiti
eventually the cops show up which you can usually deal with just be keeping active and running away
but then the chief shows up and this dirtbag has a loaded gun
i still get freaked out when i try to run away and the dude is firing live rounds in my general direction as hes chasing
yikesall i can say is quottry it youll like itquot  it may not be the ultimate skating simulator but it isnt meant to be
there really are so few decent original action games for the dreamcast and that makes jet grind radio stand out that much more
the game is pure fun no matter what age you arejet grind radio is not your average skating game and thats what i love about this game
its hip its new and fresh something thats has never bin done before
jet grind is not only a terrific dreamcast game but it simply one of the best dreamcast games next to shenmue and soul calibur
the game is an instant classic that no one with a dreamcast should miss out on
the game is extreamly original and a very underrated gem heck this is better then the tony hawk series
it has a pretty cool story
youre are the ggs a skate gang that pretty much takes over other groups of skaters turfs and to make matters worse you are being chased by a ruthless cop and his minionsaka swat teamsand tanks helicopters and so on
this game unlike the sequal jet set radio future is more challenging because it has a timer
the games level desighn just keep getting better and better and the best part about this game isthe music
this game has the best music next to metal gear solid
the music will really get you into this game which if really awesome
the game is also pretty original cause you can spray grafiti on walls trash cans windows ect
and no game has ever pulled this off but this game is cell shaded and is very well done
every character and level is so well desighned that your mouth will be drooling in such amazment
put simplythe visuals in this game are amazing
im going to make this short and sweetprosthis game has extreamly addicitve gameplaythe cell shading in this game is absolutley amazingvery original and ten times better then the rest of those skating gamesthe characters compared to the enviroment look nothing alike which gives the game some flavorbest music ever
this game has some really awesome tracks inculding rob zombies dragulaconsnothingoverall jet grind radio lives up to my opinion as the best game for the dreamcast and is highly original very addictive
it has sweet cell shaded visuals which even put games like zelda wind waker to shame
the game is a bit of challenge with the timer and everthing  overall jet grind radio screams originality and awesomefinal verdict  this game truly deserves its out of  starsand im sticking to itjet grind radio isamazinglatesthe style of this game the cell shading the tokyo street life the ultra coolness
its the must have dreamcast game but now you can get it on xbox live for your   id say yeah the  version is better but cmon you gotta have this classic for the dreamcast if your an old school game hoarding junkiethis is a very addictive game
if you like tony hawk skater you would probobly like it
it has its similarities
however im not a big fan of the tony hawk games and i loved it
you get to skate around on futuristic rollar blades spay paint the town gangs and run from the police
its not really set up to be vulgar like the grand theft auto games which is a plus for younger players
i would definitly recomed this to anyoneit seems like such a silly premise to me
you play a character that rollerblades around various locales spraypainting graffiti on things and running from the keystone cops when they spot you
nevertheless this game is a lot of funthe graphics for this game are actually quite simple but the celshading effect makes them a breath of fresh air in a time when most d games look the same
everything appears like its happening in a comic book but has the depth and detail that you expect from a d game
in addition to that the sound is really good if you enjoy this kind of music
not everyone does and since only one track plays on any given level you run the chance of hearing it a lot
my cousins would play the tutorial for hours and just one track would play the entire timeits exciting to play the game though
theres plenty to do and discover but its not a daunting task to do so
tricks happen almost automatically just from jumping in the air
things like grinds flips and spins require no series of controller manipulation and button smashing to accomplish
and secrets are found by skill and accident in equal parts in my personal experiencethere are some quirks to get used to or simply deal with regarding the controls but it doesnt do enough damage to detract from the overall enjoyment of the game
its just another great game from segaholycrap
that is the best dreamcast game i own out of my collection only  games but who cares
the graphics are great the gameplay is great control is great and camera angle is great
the plot is really interesting toothe game gives you great challenge and sometimes it gives gamers a little dose of game rage
this is a great game for a great price i got a used version
if you have a dreamcast buy this game
its well worth itsega never ceases to continue their amazing leaps forward in the gaming industry and jet grind radio can only amplify that
the unique celshading techinique which draws black lines around objects is not new but new for actual ingame playing
youll think its d at first until you see the camera rotate around a character
mindblowing indeed
if cartoons were real this is what theyd look like
the game takes place in a fictinous tokyo and its up to you to spraypaint the town with your logos all while avoiding tanks helicoptors and the hordes of cops
what other game can you spraypaint the back of a police chief
jet grind radio 
yeah its comingwario land  is the first one i played in the series and while i really dont have a favorite from the  gameboy titles this could be the one i had the most fun out ofgraphics really good for gameboy color they are extremely colorful clear and crisp
though im still wondering why wario is wearing whitemusic actually pretty catchy even though its the bleeps and bloops of the gameboy erastory captain syrup leaves and wont come back until the new wii game wario alone in this one
wario is flying in his plane when it crashes to the ground
hes alright but he stumbles upon a cave
inside there is a mysterious music box
when he observes this he is teleported into the world inside the music box
there he meets this being who is supposed to be the god of the music box world
he says that he was sealed with five music boxes by evil and tells wario he can keep the treasure he finds
wario does it for the treasure of coursegameplay like wario land ii wario cant die
well the final boss can kill him but thats a different story
but for the rest of the game whatever you do to him he shrugs off
but his powers have been stripped from him so he must get them back by powerups hidden in some of the whopping  treasures
when you start the game he can only jump and attack but that will change
each level has four colored treasure chests with four colored keys to open them
getting the treasures wont be easy even with warios rambolike behavior
most of the treasures can unlock new levels and remove obstacles in existing levels so youll visit each level at least four times
like ii wario can react to an enemys attacks
all the reactions from ii return with the exception of small wario and there are new ones such as but not limited to snowball wario yarn wario and one of my favorites vampire wario
getting the treasures requires you to use these to solve puzzles
also every time you complete or exit a level the setting changes from day to night
some of the treasures can only be found by completing a minigolf minigame which is the only use for the coins in the game
the minigolf game is quite fun
it involves hitting an enemy instead of a ball into a hole with your attack
once you get a certain number of a certain kind of treasure you can unlike a place where you can play courses for the golf minigame the last course unlocked by collecting eight wellhidden music coins from each stage
there are also a fairly good amount of challenging bosses in the game as well
whats also great about this game is that its nonlinear
many treasures unlock other treasures so you can choose where to go
when you finally beat the final boss you probably havent got them all so the game can last a while
once you get all the treasures a time attack mode is unlockedbuy this game is a must
god i wish that there were handheld games this fun today
also check out the other games because they are also awesomei enjoyed playing this one and the older one too
i grew up with playing the first one and nd one
this one is a good one to play and is fun tooi have this about a year out of the five i have it my fovorite good graphs for  bits and be besy colecting all  treuses so there lot to do and funny reactions like geting flat as pan cake if he  get on fire he start to run around wario land  is a great game for any fan of game boy or of super mario
the game is basically like and mario game with different boards and many creatures to defeat throughout many worlds
when i first started to play the game i noticed that the graphics were pretty good for a game boy
another great thing about this game is that you can save a thing that some game boy games dont have these days
so want a fun game that you know you will enjoy
try this wario land  i know you will enjoy this game
just trust mehappy gamingi own this game and its really a great
before warioland was in stores this game was the best
if you dont have this game get it
it is a long game
this game is almost like super mario world
but the difference is that its in a different area and and also it has a different plot
if you played warioland in the days it was being sold you would have thought it was the best game ever that no game could have been better than it
but if you played warioland after you played warioland you could have thought that game was more better
so if i was you i would have bought it right awaywario is back in yet another game
dont get me wrong this is the best and biggest one yet
there are four different sections to advance to and  after you beat a level you could unlock one of four treasures found in  every level
dont worry if you get frustrated you can always go back to  the temple to ask the mysterious figure where you should go next
besides  a weird storyline warioland  boasts many different moves including being  turned into a vampire or a ball of string
besides these there are all  the familiar points of the game but warioland  adds a new minigolf game  to open passageways
this is a good buy for a fan of nintendothe original donkey kong country has the best sound and graphics on the snes and it is safe to say the same for this gbc version
it also may be the must fun for game boy color the only problem is that an autosave replaces candys save point as the way to save which makes it a bit easy but that doesnt matter
either this or super mario bros dx is the best gbc title
anyone who fell in love with donkey country like i did must get thismy little brother has this game
i played his and it is just like the snes game
i love it
i have got to get one
if you have a game boy and love the snes donkey kong country one then this game is a must havei bought this game as my first addition to my game boy color unit and it is awesome
the gameplay is challenging and entertaining and the graphics are incredible
i suggest that you buy this gamei played donkey kong country to death on the snes and i loved it so much back then that i bought this gbc version to see if it could live up to it and it did
i immediately became addicted to it all over again its almost exactly like the original
the graphics amp sound are not as good but afer all its the gameplay that counts
donkey amp diddy kong can still bounce on tires ride ostriches rhinos amp frogs collect golden bananas ride on runaway mine carts cartwheel through enemies and swing on vines
if youve never played the original version then youd better get this one to see what you missed  its an alltime classic nintendo game and definitely a musthave game boy game as wellin a world where there were cds companies like sega and do had tried to capitalize on the concept of playing video games on a cd giving the games enhanced graphics and sound
there is one company however named nintendo and it created donkey kong country
donkey kong country was a game that proved that you dont need cdbased technology to make games with flashy graphics
you just need to put in effort to fit it to your console
and years went by it was ported to the bit game boy color
did it make the transition well
well the donkey kong land games were great so maybe this one would be gooddkcs graphics were incredible on the super nintendo
the game almost looked like the characters came from a cgi movie
at least at its time
even the backgrounds had tons of details and neat movements
here on the game boy color the graphics are still very colorful and greatly detailedthe sounds and music were memorable
even when you defeat a kremling alligator enemy his voice effect when he dies will always be remembered for a long time
as for the music well you can never go wrong with the sweet beats of kongo jungle and the king k rool boss battlethe game is one of those games that show the characters on a map before actually going into the levels
once you go to a level youre gonna be expecting barrelblasting kremlingsmashing animalromping fun
there is a lot to do in donkey kong country
as a platformer it doesnt disappoint with its gameplay
you can even find and play as an animal buddy like a rhino or an ostrich
rhinos can knock everybody out of its way while the ostrich guides you safely across the level
it can also float in the air like racoon mario in super mario bros  the entire game is a bunch of fununlike the original super nintendo version this game can save anytime
so where does that lead candys save point to
it just so turns out that it became a bonus game area
thank god you can now autosave
i kinda dont like having to struggle through a level just to get to the save point
either i have to reach there or lose all of my lives
now that thats out of the way i can save the trouble for hard levels easilyoverall this is a really great game boy color game
its well worth the moneythis is a terrific game
it is unfair to compare it to other nes versions of the game
for the game boy color this has the best graphics i have seen
the game play is great it holds my attention for hours
i am  year old adult
i love to take my game boy on business trips
this game has memory too so you can save the level you are on and go back later
you can save up to  different games in memory
there are also special features with little mini games
you can play in  languages
and there are special features for game boy camera and the game boy printer
i dont have these but my son doesdonkey kong is one of the best games to grace the gameboy
admitidly it has less colours than its counterpart but the gameplay is amazing
donkey kong is a must have game there is so much fun to have with this game and there are loads of levels to complete so it willlast you a long time
hidden within the levels are secret areas which you have to find if you want to fully completely finish the game that is where the real challenge lies
buy this game asap and you wont stop playing for a long time
enjoyeven though i finished the snes version it is to long ago to remmember so its like playing a new game
graphics are great gameplay that is very addictive
everyone should get this gamei wanted an original nintendo controller pak
i know the aftermarket ones hold more space but i just wanted to original one just to say i have the originali have bought  of these and they are as sturdy and reliable as can be
the majority of n games that did not support battery saves required memory packs to save your progress and other stuff
some third party knockoffs were okay and even increased the size of the nintendo made one but werent too reliable
so do what i did and get the official ones made by nintendo if quality is what youre looking for
trust me this one works well for your nintendo this controler pack is very useful
before when i use to not know about the controler pack i kept getting angry that i couldnt save levels on my n but once i heard about a controler pak i went and got it and it works great it helps me save new levels on games
it also saved me for giving up on my nintendo  and selling itdefinitely something you want if you have an nthis product is nintendo brand you cant go wrong with that
a lot of the games require this function of saving to the contoller pak why they called it that i never understood other than its a pak that you put in your controller
they should have called it memory pak because thats its function storing save files as a memory card
well i can sort of understand after thinking about it for a little the kids werent as mentally declined back in the s so they could use common sense to assess this as a memory storagesorry about my rant i just dislike this generation of kidsoverall athis memory cards works well on all of our n games no exceptions
we have six memory cardsand have issues with all of them with exception of nintendobranded ones
our two other brandsof aftermarket cards have problems with certain games
spend the extra money and get nintendo brandive had a nintendo  for  years and dont play it often anymore with all the newgeneration systems around but it served me well
and nothing served better with it then this one memory pak
all those  years i only used one yes one memory card and that was this very one
still use it today
it saved every single game i ever entered into it never forgot anything and when i needed to delete something never for the reason of needing more space it worked perfectly with no problems at all
get thislets say you go buy a nintendo  one day
you purchase it with all of its required hookups and controllers
you go home you play super mario  but guess what is missing
oh yeah
the controller pakthe controller pak is what you seriously need to put in the back of your controller so you can save your files for the games you playif you cant find one of these for your nintendo  you are immediately helplessyou would be a total idiot to leave this out of your controller
you need this thing to save your gamei bought this because some games need it to save
it works great and makes game like turoc much betterone needs this to fully get the most out of the game
a must for the nintendo  great purchasethis rumble pak is a very neat idea to add to the games
bad thing is it only works on some games
check the red bar on the right of the package for the games to see if it says rumble pak
good thing if it does because it is very fun when it vibrates like when you get tackled in nfl blitz or wrestled in wwf no mercy
it will be tons of fun
enjoythe nintendo  is a classic console with some of the best games of all time
i find that a rumble pack clicked into your controller enhances the gaming experience tenfold
i bought a few of the official nintendo  rumble pacs and everyone loves them
they make the controller vibrate and react to games like modern controllers do
they are well worth the purchase if your gamer and want that full immersive gaming sessionthe cheap thing that the nintendo  didnt have was a rumple feature
but with this rumble pak the vibration u get from it really depends on what game u r playing
like in goldeneye  the more automatic weapons u get the heavier the vibration isif u want the best vibration i suggest get this pak and also buy star fox  goldeneye perfect dark and racing gamesim going to whine for minute that nintendos rumble pack should not have had to use batteries boo
but on the other hand it works great
thank youim glad i got this
it really makes me feel like im in the game
its also small and fits perfect into the controler pak and its excellent for any games though please note that some games wont allow it but any way worth buyingthis rumble pak is cool to have on your game system
because when you get in danger you get to feel the rumble pak buzz in your hand and it makes the game more interesting to methe rumble pack for the n fits nicely into the n controller and looks well you need to aaa batteries to use it
works just finethe nintendo  rumble pak is a great addition to use while you play your video games
too bad the rumble pak only works on certain games which are indicated on the games box
but if you play a game compatible with the rumble pak its awesome
it vibrates if you get tackled in nfl blitz get wrestled in wwf no mercy or shot or hit in other games
youll have a lot of fun with the rumble pak with your n gamesthis is an absolute necessity for an n controller because of it we can now play a multitude of games that we have for the systemnot pretty much to say but the truth stay close to branded products stay away for third parties when it comes to items like these
this specific gimmick for your controller is the only one that actually is strong enough and soft enough the quality end frequency of the servo is amazing almost as good as a dualshock  if planning to buy a rumble pak get the nintendo licensed onelet me start off by saying im a big fan of the nintendo  system and its controller
the rumble pack accesory sticks into the n controller and when you play the video games that have the rumble feature the pack makes you feel like youre part of the game and the action
i think the rumble feature became a standard in the game systems that came after it such as the nintendo game cube and microsoft x box
i think the rumble pack has so much rumble to it that you not only feel it but you actually hear it
it gives another great sound to make an even better audio experience
the games that work with the rumble pack are even more fun when you use it
some examples are the original super smash brosf zero xkirby  the crystal shards and the epic zelda game ocarina of timethis rumble pack accessory takes  aaa batteries and the battery life for this accesory seems to be quite long so you wont be disappointedthere was nothing about this product that wasnt as advertised
it plugged right in had the battery cover and worked like a charmthe nintendo rumble pakhas a much stronger rumble than i thought it would have
i am a st time owner of this rumble pak
i honestly did not think itd vibrate as strong as it does
i expected a slight movement when it rumbled
was i shocked
this is true name brandnintendo not generic brandmaybe thats why
youll love this feature while playing your gamegreat investmentwhich youll never regret
 this isnt just for kidsits also for us mature big kids heeheeheeworks great
needed for a lot of n games
just plugs right in and stays there dont ever need to removethe rumble pack was one of the greatest inventions to come out in the video game era
now with the more updated systems the rumble function is built into the controller
that is not so with the nthe rumble pack was introduced along side starfox  when you get shot hit someone get hit explosions and many other actions will cause your controller to shake
it makes game playing a lot more fun
its great in a football game where your sizing a guy up for a hit you do it and then you feel the rumble
the controller will shake more if its a harder impact
lots of fun
there are some cons
you have to use batteries and you have to take it out to put your memory pack in
to me the cons dont come close to the pros and fun of the controller
if you have an n you must own a rumble pack
you wont regret iti got the n for christmas by a nice worker at a chinese restaurant in   when i first tried it i was amazed
i never saw d graphics since i upgraded from the snes
then i heard of the rumble pack but i purchased a rd party one from interact since it was cheaper but it was big heavy and required  double a batteries
not to mention the rumble quality was poor
then i threw it out and got myself a naki rocker pack wa built in memory card plusthis pack is battery free
i was really happy with it for a year until i tried the official rumble pack
at that very day i noticed a difference the rocker packs rumble was weaker than the official one
i decided that it was time to put in some extra cash to get the real rumble pcak from the trustworthy nintendo
the only problem was that it required  triple a battries but at least the performance is top notchremember the good timeshey people
rumble paks says it all
you put it into your controller then bam
it rocks
when you play a game with great sound effects you feel your controller rumbling like youre actually in the game
i used this mostly on golden eye and star fox  its great i tell you
the only thing is that you need  aaa batteriesah i remember the day when i walked into walmart saw starfox  playing on the kiosk and eagerly grabbed the controller and to my astonishment my hands were shaking with every explosion
i couldnt believe how much a simple battery operated shaking device could immerse me in the game and it instantly ended up on my christmas list along with starfox  which the the pak originally came bundled with btwnowadays the novelty of rumble has largely worn off but it still remains an important part of gameplay in many genres
the shooter genre was somewhat revolutionized when gamers were able to sense every time a bullet hit them and take cover accordingly without even needing to look at their health bar
racing games let gamers feel the rumble of the rough offroad terrain every time they took a wrong turn rumble had existed before the rumble pak but it was the rumble pak that brought this nifty technology to the console front and made it a standard for every controller from that day forwardgreat purchase
one needs this to get the most out of the game
great purchase for the nintendo  to know when you have been hitthis is by far the best star wars game on the market at the present time
i love this game so much
it allows you to be what most kids wanted to be a jedi
when you beat the game as mace windu and then beat the endurance round then the game gets really fun because you have the ultimate saberthis game is so realistic to the movie
i love it and will recommend it to anyone who asks about it
it shows three jedi that havent been shown fighting
plo koon ali gaddia and mace windu are in the game and none have been shown fighting in the movie so this is a great introduction to themthis game is fun by far one of the most thrilling star wars games the controls are a bit awkward but grow on you within timeusing lightsaber moves are awesome because there are so many of them get this game its awesome
