dungeon siege was a good game
not the bestbut still alrightthis one is definitely worse than the first especially when you acknowledge the fact that the game is released  years later than the originalin the  years how can a series evolve so littleim not sayin that this game should be different than the original butseriously just play the original and try this and seeyoull see what i meana game like this could be fully developed in  months no joke where there is a prequel that you can take as an examplegahhhhand graphicsmmmm not badbutwhereas dungeon sieges graphics was so superior compared to the games that were released at the same time such as diablo ii dungeon siege s graphics is mediocre when compared to other games that are being released these daysa sequel to a million seller with terrible flaws an ultimate lowbudget production at its worst  dungeon siege iidang my grammar suxi tried the demo and its actually very lenghty nearly  gig of play and i took it to the end
it looked cool at first but i was quickly disappointed
i pretty much had to puke my way through iti saw the full game and all the features because a friend of mine use to own it
he threw it in the trash after playing it for about  hoursthe character creation is rather lame not much to choose fromthe music is okthe graphics are decentthe npc voices are nice except for the captains and leader voices
they sound like they have a mouth full of food
lolthe battle system is quite choppy and there is quite a bit of lag in the loading and new areas when you arrivethe spell system is not bad but is a bit weird to get use tothe coolest feature i found was the ability to pick up all items in the area by pressing z on the keyboard but umm thats about the extent of iti really didnt like the game and am glad i tested the demo and my friends copy before i purchased itits more of an action game than an rpg
you point click kill drink potion rinse repeat
not many options
two thumbs downdungeon siege was a neat game
dungeon siege ii is not
the fatal flaw is having the saved game put you back in the most recent town
you then have to fight your way back to where you left or got killed in the first place
this gets boring
i tried setting a teleport before the fight but it just took me back to the town before i got to fight
i doubt that i will finish the game
save your money
very disappointingid was the creator of the fps genre with wolfenstein and the original doom
after doom there was doom ii then quake etc etc
john carmack is a ternchogenius and has pushed technology developers to the edge to support everbetter looking gaming expeirences
and then it ends like this
pressing out tripe dressed in dazzling graphics
i got bored with doom  of the way in
no story or a lame attempt havent played since
same dark narrow passages same dingy boring design blah blah blah
id turned into their worst nightmarepotential genius drowned in corporate greedbuy half life  or fearthink real hard before you buy quake for pc
its all over the web there is a serious lag time for tons of users even those with good systems
your mouse cursor is faster than the game
a few claim to have the solutions to it usually involving playing it on the lowest qualities and using a cheapo mouse or low hz mouse settings
these solutions dont work for everyone including me
some reported bad problems with the sound
i had no problems with that before the lag set in
the official sites are no help
i had occasional problems with lag for the first levels
tweaking the settings seemed to cure it but when i got well into the level with the hovertank it became unplayable
the video took as much  to  seconds to catch up with the mouse
my computer handles halo doom and ut  with no problem
quake on the other hand  i cant believe they let it out like thisi bought this game in the hopes that i would not have the same  technical headaches as with doom  sadly it was so
the game will boot up and then boot back to desktop this pc was an alienware with a  processor and a nividia fx  i tried the game on a dell xps latop with a  radian mobility video card and a  processor that one crash the laptop to the point i had to power down completly and then reboot the latop
i contacted tech support but from what information they have gave me tells me that i have to upgrade my pc to their specs in order to enjoy the game
which really means to me i was suckered out of must include sales tax
so i have been ripoff again first doom  now quake  save your moneyi bought this since i was a die hard fan of the previous quake game
q was disappointing
my system exceeded the minimum requirements and still it did not play smoothly despite tweaking all the videoaudio options
loading times are excrutiating as well
i dont think people should buy games and then have to manipulate their systems to get even the basic requirements out of the game
the developers need to go back to the drawing board on this one
a complete disappointmentback in the mid to late s two major application programming interfaces managed to dominate the pc game scene  directx and opengl so much so that graphics hardware developers like ati and nvidia built hardware around these apis
opengl seemed to enjoy a life with game developers who used silicon graphics workstations sgi to create models and animations for games and film
we could buy highend opengl graphics cards that where up to mb back in the days when mb cards where mainstream
even the nintendo  built some of its architecture around opengl graphics
in the year  the high end mb cards where quickly bought up to enjoy the power of games like halflife  and doom  in fact hl was the only reason for the upgrade
doom  is an opengl game and looked amazing
halflife  used directx  where previously halflife  offered both opengl and directx support
because doom was so dark it led many to wonder that if the game was brighter would it reveal something questionable about the quality of modern opengl graphics
doom also had an option to use mb cards that have only been released in the autumn of  valves choice not to support opengl further fuelled speculation that opengl may be badly lagging behind directx 
quake  is confirmation of this problem and it is more serious than previously thought
quake  is built on the doom  engine
since doom  was mostly occupied with hiding you in dark places you never got to see the full quality of a brightly lit opengl first person shooter
now that quake  has had to come up with a sequel to quake  id software handing over development to raven software the horrible truth has come to light
opengl is simply leagues behind directx  and we are talking a big difference here
quake  offers absolutely no reflections
instead we are still in the world of mapped reflections
texture detail is the equivalent of halflife 
polygon shapes are clearly visible even with every setting maxed out
bump mapping is hardly visible
steam and smoke is displayed as big successive blocks of floating transparent maps
fire is duke nukem quality fat orange blobs of quickly changing pixels
the shading and textures of the weapons look terrible
again no reflections on the guns but we do have shadows
the facial expressions of your space marines are an attempt on matching fear or halflife  but you must turn up the antialiasing to round them off
sadly even on a high spec gfx card this results in an even lower fps
you are a space marine that must run through the alien enemy complex usually to meet up with a special marine who you must bring back with you or to defeat an enemy outpost
the enemy ai does not exist
everything is scripted
the enemy the strogg instead moves exactly the same coming in waves of two or three and you can see them move like clones of each other getting blasted up the same way and dying the same every single time
not good
lighting looks extremely blurred and the sky background is just one big map that does not even move except for the odd ship that flies around the place
even the ps has better graphics than quake  which when on a pc at this quality begs the big question  what will the xbox  have to offer if the pc version looks like a premillennium first person shooter
this is terrible news for everyone
the quake series has been ruined
multiplayer is the same quality as quake  there is absolutely no need to upgrade
opengl is now officially dead
only doom could mask its failure
now we know why valve did not support it
the xbox  is faced with marketing a bad port to show off absolutely nothing that the s architecture can handle
various tweak scripts have been released for quake  on the internet
these seems to have a little bit of an effect on improving game play ever so slightly but sadly do not help much
you simple cant get what isnt there and that is the bottom line
to add further trouble to the mess is the fact that these poor quality opengl graphics are so demanding that even high spec card users will find themselves turning off lots of features and running the game at a low resolution
that is why doom  and quake  have a mb option because it takes a juggernaut of a graphics card to actually round the graphics off and even then we are nowhere near looking at something as good as halflife 
things are really that badas quake  was duel released with fear a fully fledged directx  name i would point gamers in the direction of that first person shooter instead and to also keep an eye out for call of duty 
opengl is dead
quake is dead
noooooooooooooooo
pros absolutely nonecons shockingly subpar graphics poor graphics still demanding high end system specs no enemy ai nothing new
same as quake  you must quit and restart the game every time for graphics settings to take effect same price as better first person shooters out there it will break heartsi played it for  hours and then uninstalled it
its crap
everyone online said they had to turn the game to its lowest graphic settings to play
avoid at all costthe game is fun if you are in jail and time is not an issue
to say it takes forever to load does not begin to describe it
a half hour to get it started and then ten to fifteen minutes of play and then all over again and again
my computer exceeds all requirement of the game and still this game really and truly sucks
not the game but the load timespend your money else where or take up sowing
or read a good book
you will finish the book before you finish this game
hope this helps
dont say you were not warnedan incredible game ruined by an incredible glitch
i thought the first one i bought was just a random dud but the second one was just as bad
all the rumors about this game are true and if you call the  number inside the instruction booklet for technical support no one will answer
the phone just rings and rings
this was my favorite ds game of all time until the earth caved in and sucked my cartridge into a black hole
is anyone at majesco paying attention to these complaints
im thirty bucks in the hole because some programmer fell asleep at the wheel
is there a majesco technician that can tell me how to get past the black screen on my game to fix my short login name
how about some practical help here guys
can you throw us a bone
at least let us know youre listening
anything
helloi bought this game after reading all of the extremely positive reviews comparing aoe to advance wars dual strikeafter playing one match and losing since i didnt read the instructions i paused and pressed the quit option
my game immediately froze and made a  humming sound
after turning it off the game would not restartafter taking the game back the same night and getting a replacement i played a  hour long battle
but again when i went to save my progress and progress points
 the replacement game froze and made a humming sound and also refused to turn on againthe game had some good qualities and ideas and an amazing library feature all while converting a rts to a turn based game like advance wars
and i know not every person will get a glitchy game or have any negative experiences with theirs
but based on my experience i cannot give this game any higher than  stari purchased this game used for less than ten dollars and i paid way too muchas other people have said it is short
actually this is a godsend
had it been a full length game the drag factor would have been incredible
i quit after the standing stonesmy son on the other hand has battled into the sixth sorrow and discovered to his own sorrow that whatever it takes to unlock those four stomping manikins is not worth the effort
if they pound on the floor often enough does it break and let you throughat any rate  this is a flusher or a gift for an enemydo yourself a favor and play pacman
itll be more challenging and last longeri am a huge fan of the gauntlet series by midway
i raced home with this newest version eager to reimmerse myself in the gauntlet universe
we finished the entire game in four hoursim not saying this to say were game gods
im saying this because we were in utter shock that the game is so short so boring and so completely unlike the previous games that we loved
i cant even imagine how the company that created the previous fantastic gauntlet games could be responsible for this release
maybe they lost their good programmers and were under contract to release a new gauntlet by x date so they had their newbie coders kick this out
i am just horrified at how poor this game wasfirst you get a choice of four charaters of course  the elf warrior mage or valkyrie
however you dont get to choose their color
i know its a small thing but i was ticked at that to startyour character has  main attacks plus  longrange attack  so the elf gets  sword swings plus his bow attack
in addition there are combo attacks and dbutton super attacks that you can pay to unlock over time
you then move from map to map bashing away at enemies killing the enemy generators and finding keys for doors
that part of the gameplay is similar to previous games
you cant shoot your friends in the back of the head which my fellow gamers appreciated greatly
i was notorious for standing in the back area as the elf and just letting the arrows flyreally the huge issue is the games shortness
if it was  times longer at least it would seem perhaps worth playing
but i really found its entire layout much less interesting than the previous gauntlet
in the previous one you had a central area from where you could go out to various worlds each with its own theme going back and forth as you wished
in this one its just a straight line and while there are some thematic elements it came across as a dungeon crawl that just plodding on for a few hours then stoppedalso in the previous games when you got character upgrades it was really exciting
you clearly saw the change and it was something fun to pay attention to
in this one when you get weapon and armor upgrades you can barely tell
we would even stare at our characters before doing an upgrade and it was hard to see anything had even changedthe vocals really didnt impress me much
part of the problem is that they would tell you elf needs food when the elf still had a ways to go  but then they would tell you starving and has died right on top of each other
so you were always being harassed about needing food but never when you really needed to know
also with death being able to be slain with a mana blast you pretty much were able to kill off death in  seconds any time you opened a chest
so death was barely announcing his presence before he vanished againthe graphics were good
there were many spots that looked walkable that you were magically blocked from going into which was a bit annoying
if an area isnt open dont put a wide open door pointing to it i just dont know what went wrong here
i am extremely disappointed
be sure to rent this game first to see if its something you would enjoy more than a day or twodont play this game or any of its sequels
these games are too hard too difficult to control very repetitive boring annoying uninventive at times irritating to listen to this one is available for original xbox and so on
midway should have died around the time it sold its first few games
midway is dead for many many reasons and midway arcade treasures will remind you of those reasonsavoid this hemorrhoid
you gotta have a serious need for a nostalgiafix to enjoy this game there are only  mildly fun games in this collection one is a x trucks racer that has all kinds of jumps and stuffbut its outdated and lame compared to all the decent stuff available for your xbox like burnout    and midnight club  dub edition remix and good old rally sport challenge  and there is a boat racer here that is sort of okay also but these  games dont make it worth while
the graphics suck throughout trust me a couple of those old school racers where you are looking down on a track trying to steer little cars around are here
always hated those this disc is only for engineering students researching a term paper on video game history or something not for playing i wish i had read this review before i bought itthis is the problem with reading reviews before you purchase something sometimes everyone is wrong
the controls for this game suck
the only games i like are the mortal kombat     triolgy
i have mk  on the ps network and that was a good make over to the new system however the change over to the psp was not so great
there are long loading times between matches and the sound is cheap unlike the revamp  dolby digital for the ps version
and the controls are very unresponsive you have to use the analog stick to jump and the directional stick to perform combos and other special moves which i find incredibly difficult to do
bad bad makeoveri bought this on its release date earlier this weekand ive already sold it
yes it gives you a decent number of games on one disc
but i quickly discovered thats not much of a value if none of the games are very funmany of the games have emulation issuesthe most common being flaky control and a distorted aspect ratio many of the games get stretched to fill more of the psps wide screen
but the real problem is just that these games havent held up well
i got some enjoyment out of rampage   years ago but its incredibly repetitive by todays standards
youve seen everything there is to see within the first minute or two
the same is true of most of these games
even gauntlet seems boring  years laterid rather play the more recent update to the seriesor better still something like diablo and its clonesthe mortal kombat games at least look pretty good but lack any kind of extras youd normally associate with a home game
they dont even include move lists
and thats aside from the fact they didnt play as well as the street fighter games to begin with and the passage of time has only made them feel staler
if youre a huge fan of these games already and dont mind some emulation issues youll probably enjoy this disc
for most people though id recommend skipping this and picking up a modern game or waiting for capcoms collection for the pspa million glitches and freezes no way to figure out or complete any ending a complete struggle all the way
no pc cheats or hints anywhere on the web
this game sucks plain and simple
got all the way to the end and couldnt get the game to finish
piece of c rapwould have been a great game and worth the price had midway worked out all the bugs before rushing to get it to marketgraphics and storyline a little above average but game is constantly locking up and freezing making gameplay nearly impossible even for those who are not easily frustrateddont make the same mistake i did and read all the feedback online regarding the many complaints about this games bugs and freezing problems on all platforms before wasting your moneyterrible graphicsboring gameplay and it freezes at the end
the first suffering was great this one just outright blowsfast delivery but as i said this game sucks
do not waste your money
google this game and see what i mean by freezinggot all the way to the end and bam
frozenthis is not really multiplayer
you cannot connect other s and play multiplayers and you cannot play more than one player per box on xbox live
this is microsoft trying to maximize profit at the expense of increasing game players
they want to sell an xbox game and controller to every person that you want to play withit is a great single player game but only for about  days
by then you have beat all the levels and since you cant get your friends into a game you are done with itit seems that microsoft does not like the way that halo allowed all your friends to play at once with youthis game is the top selling xbox  launch title
however theres so many bad things about this game it was clearly rushed into manufacturing
since firstperson shooters are my favorite type of title i hurried out to buy a copy but i should have rented it firstthe game for all its incredible sounds and graphics is incredibly poorly made
it uses the checkpoint style of save games so youll spend hours literally shooting the same people at the beginning of the level only to die near the end and head back to the checkpoint
this is the most frustrating experience ive ever had since some of the levels are so poorly made that theres no possible way to pass them except by luck
i would not play this game over again for that very reason alone
in addition the game has incredibly stupid bot teammates who walk into your line of fire and wont shoot a guy that runs right past them and incredibly bright enemies who will shoot you and not the bots because they know doing so will end your game
i cannot tell you how many times ive had three bot teammates in front of me and the enemy runs right past them without my guys firing a shot and kills meonce you get past these incredible oversights in single player youll be disappointed to find that xbox live play is even worse
theres a petition on the internet right now demanding that activision issue a patch to support  player support the ability to create custom games and many other featuresi strongly suggest renting this title instead of buying it
theres no need to feel the same frustration i did and then have it sit on your shelfall that i really need to say is while me and two other friends were playing this game on multiplayer i was beginning to fall asleep
one of my other friends actually did fall asleepi found this game to be utterly slow and relatively safe in terms of what it can dothis is not a good thing
there is nothing innovate to speak of
how many times can they redo wwii video games
theres no story line unless you enjoy sham remakes of what really happened
there really isnt much historical fact here eitherbut i guess most people that play this junk are too fat and lazy to open an actual text book to learn what really happenedeverybody says sonic was perfect when the genesis was around
wrong
this collection has all the proof you need
they included half a dozen lamegear gamegear stuff which made me want to cry
tails adventure was awful so was tails sky patrol and sonic  gamegear version not the genesis masterpiece
i did enjoy triple trouble but i liked the ds port betterthen the other gamessonic cd sonic cd is very average and dull and the time travel function was really glitchy in sonic gems
i ended up stuck in a cliff when i traveled into the future
even worse i cant change the music
sonic cd on the playstation network iphone android and xbox arcade i think its on xbla all had an option to switch the music between the japanese and american version but all you could have on gems was the usa versionsonic cd i wrote a full review for the real sonic cd just click  star and look for tdlsonic fighters a d fighting game that was so bad i enjoyed it
it was a port of some arcade game so the controls didnt match up the last time i checked the gamecube had no k button
the game itself was very creepy
tails made the scariest face ever when he won a match knuckles stole amys hammer and smashed her and eggman whos obesity was extreme due to the poorly made d polygons came and cloned sonicsonic r an interesting idea but it cleary failed
it is another poor d preadventure sonic game with terrible controls that make sonic s controls seem smooth by comparison
the problem with all of these ports is that the gamecube has a very tough controller
a joystick was never on the saturns controller so it just fell apart when it reached the gamecubes cstick
also the game only has  tracks did i mention it is a racing game
 so it cant be compared to mario karts  tracks or sonic drift s  tracks that is a game gear game
couldnt sega have found more room on a bit sega saturn cd disc
the soundtrack was also wierd a lady is singing can you feel the sunshine takin away the rain
while you are racing not to mention that person sounds almost like the lady who sang i want to fly high
in sonic adventure and i loved the voiced over music in sonic adventure but it does not belong in a bit racing game that has enough issuesi liked this game even though it was basically the same thing over and over but it was still enjoyable until the end
this is the reason im giving this game a  star rating at the last part when youre fighting the guy with the sword on the rooftop for some reason it would let me pick up the health but it wouldnt let me pick up the board or the small steel pipe
i tried this  times the only thing it would let me do is kick so needless to say i had no weapon besides my foot and i could not block
i took the game out and threw it away glad i only paid  for it
that part right there made this one of the worst games i ever played
i do recommend it if you want to kill a little time but thats about it
i was very dissapointed in thatthere are few things in this world that make me weep openly
first theres terminator  when the tman has connor lower him into the molten metal
second theres the direction the final fantasy series has taken
third there is this retarded repetitive poorly written abortionthe most disturbing thing about this game is the number of people that liked it
it has been a trend lately of justreleasing a game
do the people making these games even communicate
who writes the storyon this game im going to go ahead and guess that a  year old sweaty guy with the greasy hair and beard of an apple productuser you know the people im talking about sat in his moms basement and wrote this crap on a mac
actuallyi think a mac is about the only thing that could manage to be as useless as this gamewhat the frick is the storyline
i am a sharp guyi get things with relative ease
this story was mung
mung is more interesting to study than this game
id actually rather go out and poke poop with a stick than play this game
i stopped playing to go out and mow my lawn and the grass wasnt even that tallalso you probably think youre going to get to study crime scene evidence and hunt down clues in order to find a serial killer righthahahahahahaha
fooled you
there are little glowing pictures of fingerprints or shoe prints or evidence
you then pull out your scanner or whatever other makebelieve tool you could think of for a men in black movie and then point at the evidence
then the voice of a woman comes over your headset and tells you what the evidence is
i dont even get to put the evidence into context for myself
this part of the game seemed like something that was added at the last minute
its almost as if someone bothered to play the game before release and then went to their boss and said dudethis thing plays like a first person double dragonexcept that it sucks
after this employee explained the level of suck this game had attained upper management started throwing out bones until the game was tolerable to victims of brain injuries instead of people who demand very expensive and poorly designed trivetshmmlets go through a check for this gamerepetitive levels and gameplay
checkrepetitive enemies and weapons
checkbroken promises regarding game properties
checkno continuity or sense in the story at all
checkmost goatlicking ending of any video game ever
checkits official
this game sucks more nasty burrito than a homeless guy sleeping behind taco bellthe absolute best part
i see theyre making a sequelcoming soon to a video game store near you  condemned  a whole new level of sucki weep for the people that enjoyed this game
it just goes to show that the younger generation has no idea what it takes to make a good game
its the no one loses philosophy
the truth hurts boys and girls so dont hate me because im righti bought this game because i loved new super mario and wanted to find another game i found addictive
first of all this game is for little kids
but i cant imagine anyone enjoying it
it seems like it has no point
sonic speeds through this roller coaster type course that goes so quickly its not possible to follow
and there is nothing really to do
there is no challenge value all you do it push the forward button and sonic moves really quickly until he gets to the end of the course or runs out of time
maybe i missed the point of this game but i wasted my money on this purchaseterrible game
it had to be the worst sonic ds games of all times
my mind said whoever beats the boss
i would actually sell it
so guess who did it
sean
buyer bewarewhen i bought this game my son was very excited about playing the last of the zelda series in our nintendo game cube
this game starts the introduction but a few seconds into the game it the cube is not able to read the cd and must restart
it makes it so that this is the only game cd we cannot play
he was very disappointedi have waited over a year for this and now i am disapointed
the game looks good sounds good and is big and adventurous  nearly everything a zelda player is lookiing for but not on gcfirst they lied and said the delay was because of tweaks to the game no it was because they wanted to release the wii version with the wii system and not have people playing the gc version a year earlierthe control on the gc version is substandard after windwaker and even the updated n games are more fluid
its obvious this was ment to be played on wiialso the graphics are only  aspect ratio
the  go so far as to give you a screen with  squares so to calibrate your tv so if you have a widescreen you set it to make the game a little square in the middle of your big setthere is no excuse for the gc version not the have a  widescreen alternative except they want you to buy the wii
they want you to have to buy the wii
they dont want you to enjoy this game without buying the wii
if you want good graphics widescreen and smooth control you have to buy the wiihave i mentioned if you want to enjoy this game you have to buy a wiilink turns into a wolf
i mean my step dad like this game
but not me
this game is bad
some link levels and most wolf levels
nintendo wants link to be a wolfi only played this game for  daysit is boring and my dog was an idoit sometimeswhoever had sent me this game did something to it cause it came completely flawless with no scratches and the case was perfect but yet it wouldnt work
rip offi had the game for  years now and finally played it
i beat it at the lowest setting and for being the very first ninja gaiden game ive ever played its also the last one i will ever play
no matter how much this game is praised as allegedly being considered the greatest and hardest game ever by many fanboys out there i really dont think so
the designers of the game just disabled the cstick thereby not giving me any control of the camera during gameplay
thanks team jinja freekin dorks
if i have no control of the camera then i cant see or move through the game perfectly enough in order to beat your monsters
metroid prime games did the same thing disabled the cstick but as least in doing so they added a lock on feature which allowed me to strafe around the enemy and fight it
and also at least the fights in metroid prime were balanced enough in a fair but challenging way that made fighting all the monsters in that game fun
in ninja gaiden black however the camera cant really keep up with all the crazy action thats up there on the screen
it just doesnt follow the players movents fast enough and i found myself moving around like a slow robotic tank around the battle field and corners as i encountered enemiesin addition to the bad camera the gameplay is also a problem
many times i clearly got the jump on an enemy but the gameplay is tweeked soo much in such a bad way the enemy wins over  of the time
in these situations the player is not rewarded for the efforts and right decisions that they made simply because the designers stupidly tweeked the gameplay soo much that the enemy always have an unfair advantage throughout the entire gamedisabeling the cstick made me feel like a one arm one legg ninja fighting through the game and because i see what the designers did to the cstick and the game controls i dont think the game is actually hard at all
disabeling the cstick doesnt make any game hard
it just makes them poorly designed as this one isthis is not the tecmo bowl that everyone loves
this is a compelation of aweful games that are not entertaining at all
the fact they write tecmo bowl on the cover should be grounds for a law suit
do not buy if you are looking for tecmo bowl from nintendoi notice people shiver when they talk about the fatal frame franchisei really dont know whythe whole thing suckscastles are not completely dark ghost have a cartoonish feeling your character is superslow and looks drugged rather than scaredother thing is that i was running around the castle like if it was my backyard just running freely without a reasonable doubt of not being scaredi didnt care whether the ghosts attacked from behind from the sides over the rooftag teaming in a group of  i just said cheeeeese and took their picand kept running some moresilent hill is the scariest franchise outtheresecond all the resident evils third clock tower and haunting ground fourth sorry
but this fatal craps dont qualifyi know this collection is a bargain price but there is just one major problem
that is the difficulty
the games are by nature difficult but you pretty much have endless continues
its kind of like mario brothers in that once you used the warp zones and stepped on the turtles you could easily beat the game
the only difference here is you can continue anywhere and you are not running out of quartersanother thing that is missing is strategy
these are all action games that the enemies and obstacles are in a pattern
once you very tediously mastered the pattern you win
but you will not have to master the pattern because you can just continuethe only games that are worth playing are the street fighter series
at least there is strategy behind your moves and combos
and though you have endless continues you still have to win the fighti recommend you dont buy this series and leave retro games to roms
im an older gamer and while i grew up playing games like this series and have no clue why i thought it was fun
the are some classics that are good like the original zelda pac man mario brothers
i just prefer a modern shooter role playing strategy or simulation
the elements behind these action games have already been exhausted and its time to play modern gamesthis is an over priced worthless rip off
this and the x were the last life supports for the sega genisis when it was getting owned by nintendo
the games for this were terrible it required its own ac adapter which is the same size as the one for the damn genisis so good luck with that
thank god nintendo now owns sonic and sega
this add on is garbage the video was terriblenever worked at allthis is a great game in the arcades
but pales poor on the atari   i still have my atari  and both et
and pac man and some other games aswell
i mostly now days play games and stuff on my dell  which as been upgraded some
anyways did you know ataris et
was one of the worst games produces and about every one of et
games plus some pac man games were returned over whelming atari so atari had a good bunch of its merchandis buried in the new mexicos landfill
this happen in  when the so called crash of video games of  accured
its all over the internet
and theres even a band called wintergreen that played in a music video about this story of atari buring all its et
games plus some other games that did not sell
atari produce ruffly around  millions copies of et they thought it was going to be a big success just in time of the holidays christmas of   but it was a complete failure
heres a link to the wintergreen video about the dumping of et
games story of   just click on media player at the bottom right to view this cool video
anyways back to the pac man deal well its about like the et
game dull and it gets old fast
like i said the arcade version was alsome thoughback in the day pacman fever was the fad
naturally the  conversion was one that made anyone who didnt seem like not being hip to the fad remain silent about how shoddy this release wasthis game was nothing like the arcade version
due to the limitations of the hardware the monsters were turned into ghosts pacman becomes a oneeyed gumming monstrosity abuse of various tones that made the game a dtmf simulator a poor one at that and the mazes were justwell filled with cheap pills and wafersi was a child back then and i didnt know any better
i thought this was what the vcs was capable of
but then ms pacman showed how a solid conversion could be done
it wasnt perfect but it was by far much better than this shoddy clonefor the ultimate in irony the game which offered a lot of pacman gameplay including sound effects and more quite similar to the original wasnt even a pacman game
the  game was alien
yeah the  game based on the filmanyway heres a mystery solved what was the real purpose of the s et
cartridge
simply to make the  port of pacman look goodviva eddie torresi have no clue how anyone with reasonable intelligence could give this game  stars let alone first of all if you have played the other hitman titles this will be nothing new
graphics beautifully done
that is all the good i can say about this game
game play barely playable
totally stinks
this game was converted over ported from a console like the ps
for the uninformed this means the developers wanted to go cheap by taking a game designed for the ps save a buck and make crude changes to the code to make in playable on a pc
playable is the operative word
this game is barely playable
tons of bugs
cut scenes that dont work or run all the time
suspiciontension levels that wont drop off no matter how good you did the job or how far away you are from the scene
guys that wont die when shot
guards that just appear from thin air
the list goes on
pointless game options you get a small choice of weapons but basically every mission will only require your silenced baller pistol
if you use the other heavy weapons you can get the job donebut the damage will be so great that you will lose money paying for damages and to quiet witnesses
i did the entire game using only syringe and  the garrote
 bugs there are numerous bugs with this port
the worst is the repeat of civilians
horrible
you can be in a dining room and see  or  of the same person
a bald grey haired guy with a sweater on
a short black haired haired woman in a green dress
the worst was the mardi gras crowd
you will literally see  of the same character all around you
pathetic
eidos and anyone other decision maker behind hitman blood money should be strangled and sliced into disposable chunks for making such a crappy game for the pcthis game could have been more
the developers could have offered more varied mission with different styles needed to get the job done
instead it is basically the same thing every single time
sneak in disguised get the victim alone execute and hide the body
escape before you get caught
ho hum ho hum
pardon me while i fall asleep at the keyboarddo not waste your moneyi played this demo and at first everything is wonderful graphics
amazing
lara
hot
controls
great and a great interactive tutorial
but then i get to this place where you push a rock on top of a branch
i tried a million times to climb to the top of this branch but i cant because of this branch on it sticking out in the way
im certain this branch must be the way
why else would it be sticking up far in the air
i even uninstall the demo out of frustration
i download it again later and try again then it hits me  im not supposed to climb to the top of this stupid branch
its there for no reason at all
im supposed to just use my whip from the rock next to it
oh my god
what are these game makers thinking
do they want to put useless branches in the way and make me this frustrated
so i get past that part and i come to a part where you run across a trap ok thats fine but then when i run past it i go out the other door and i end up somehow coming out the door i just came in like some weird kind of time warp
what the hell
i try different ways to get out of this part but cant find a way out
is this some incredibly weird bug or what
i dont know but if this game is this frustrating in the first  minutes i can only imagine what its like later on
also while the graphics and gameplay are amazing whats so special about a game where everything must be totally linear and laidout for you anyway
come on tomb raiderthis game is really bad and guess what i am a huge  cent fan but i call it the way i see it some one said  should have had rockstar to help with game believe it or not he was suppose to be head person in san andras but  told them he wanted to make his own game well he droped the ball on this onethis game is horrible
heed this warning so you do not waste your money like i did
i do not usualy write reviews for a game that i didnt like but i feel it is my obligation to save others out there from this garbage
 cent is way too cool i cant handle it
by the way  cent is not bullet proof hes just luckyi didnt like this game
i am a hug tomb raider fan i have been ever since my moms bf gave me the first demo disk of the orignal tomb raider ever since then i can spend hours apon hours plaing it but that may be my problem
in my opion the new company changed lara way to much
the thing i realy realy loved about her was the bad a independent lara she was
in this game shes no longer a smart mouth or a bad a they also put her in a dress whitch is a lara no no
i have read a lot of difrent things about this game on amazon it seems to be a favorit but in some tombraider forms its called the tomb raider that ended the legend
my oppion stands firm i like that they brought the tombs back but how much they changed her into a proper lady realy did suck the other thing i didnt like was how easy it was all the other tombraiders was longer and more difficult you realy had to stop and think to finsh the other tombraider games but with tomb raider legend i didnt i got all the way through it with out much thought
i never thought id say this about tombraider but i was very very disappionted
however since there are may mixed reviews on it rent the game and be the judge your self before you go and by itif the plants are done glorifying this pseudointeractive disc of data id like to give it an honest reviewalot of what this game is is a motorcycle driving game
for a good part of it you are forced to ride on a motorcycle as the ever sadistic programming code repeats scenery in order to dishearten the gamer as it become apparent that you are going through a seemingly never ending limbo of a sequence that was never fun in the first placemost of the bosses in the game would be able to kill lara  times over in a split second if they decided too
whether or not they decide to is completely up to them youll just have to hope youll be allowed to play what you spent forty bucks onthis is not a game you want to buy if youre into games that are ahem fun
some would call this game challenging
theres a big difference between challenge and flawed design
this game is a prime example of when every effort by the programmers desingers and directors went into graphics graphics graphics
the gamer can just mope while watching lara get killed for the tenth time by a boss who can defeat his own weaknesses through a glitch or inexplicably fall through the floor and die that wayhaving played this filth im inspired to buy a game cubeyou enter a pitch black cave
with the aid of your atomiclevel laserguided pixel hunter you find hopefully what you need to start a fire
then you solve a puzzle
then you solve a ludicrous puzzle
then you leave the cave
then you enter a pitch black cave  sorry about that
i could find no way to write a review without writing a detailed walkthrough of the gamesince there is really no plot interesting characters or dialogue and the graphics are only average there is really no reason to leave the first cave
this game would make just as much sense if you stayed in the first cave and solved all the puzzles there
echo secrets of the lost cavern is just another dumb puzzle gamewell after waiting  hours in line i finally got the system
first let me say the graphics are no better the the xbox  second this box gets hot i mean fry an egg on it hot
i dont know if theres something wrong with it or this is normal but you cant touch the unit after playing for an hour or so
im very disapointed
it doesnt play my playstation  games the graphics still look cartoonish and it does freeze up from time to time
the only plus is the blue ray drive which can play hidef movies
my take on this is save your money and either go with the xbox  or wait for the prices to come down
its not worth the money at allthe shipper just placed it in an over sized thin cardboard box with no packing material
when the ups man dropped it on end on the concrete porch that was that
the cords were just tossed loosely in
i really wanted it toothe last thing i wanted to do this afternoon was spend several hours writing editing and typing this review
however i needed to do it because its indeed the best way to invigorate the effort to reach solutions by increasing the scope of the inquiry rather than by narrowing or abandoning it
to organize my discussion i suggest that we take one step back in the causal chain and rally goodhearted people to the side of our cause
sony descends from a long line of testy hoodwinkers who like to subject us to the impulsive yapping of insensitive enemies of the people
let me try to explain what i mean by that in a single sentence sonys cohorts have learned their scripts well and the rhetoric comes gushing forth with little provocation
if sony continues to pose a threat to personal autonomy and social development the result can be a tonedeafness a cluelessness on matters that are at the center of experience for vast segments of the populationsonys pledge not to turn over our country to shambolic beatniks is merely empty rhetoric invoked on occasion for theatrical effect but otherwise studiously ignored
sony has now become part of my vocabulary
whenever i see someone exploit other cultures for selfentertainment i tell him or her to stop sonying
sonys canards are based on two fundamental errors
they assume that things have never been better
and they promote the mistaken idea that the psis a beall endall system that should be forcefully imposed upon us
in closing we must work together to clean up the country and get it back on course again
together we can make a difference
forever and alwayseven after a year the ps is out performed out classed out gamed and lasted by the xbox
two of my friends have returned their pss at least three times with one guy getting a rental game stuck in the drive after the ps crashed and shut off to a right light of death
the xbox  i have however is still flawless with better graphics performance multiplayer and games than ps
do yourself a favour get a psp and an xbox  and your setfirst i got one when it came out the first day and i have a wii and a xbox  elite
in grafics the xbox is much better than playstation  and in gameplay the wii is much better than playstation  and xbox the playstation  is too expensive for what it is
from the  machines first is xbox  elite is the best second the wii is so much fun to play with all the family and last is the playstation  because you need a lot of money to play p you need a brand new tv and special cables for the playstation  so can go in full p and the cables cost more than hundred dollars and the tv is like  is a lot of money
is less fun to play with it if you have to spend all that money dont you thinkive had an unsatisfactory experience with the ps
after only three months im waiting for my third ps from sony
my first unit would freeze up when playing blueray movies and it crashed permanently when i played my first p game ninja gaiden sigma
sent it back to sony
the first replacement unit from sony would not boot up so it also went back to sony
i have my fingers crossed for the next replacement when it arrives
my xbox  is doing just fine and it has better graphics imook i like all game systems so im not some nintendo fan boy saying this is bad just because it is not nintendo
the playstation  was my favorite console and may very well still be
but the ps was doomed by its own name
when your on top there are those who say you can only go down from there and i feel that right now this is what is going on with the ps
i kept hearing talk of the graphics
people were talking about how amazing they would be
often people hear this and just have in there heads that the graphics are outstanding
while the graphics do look good you will not notice much unless you have a high deff tv
i know alot fo people have them but i choose not to spend over  dollars on a tv
so unless your a person with a really great tv the graphics will not be as good as they could be
sony cut alot of there market by doing this
you must think of every one in order to succeed
then i hear people talking about the sound
well once again sony took off alot of fan base with the sound
unless you have a receiver and surround sound you will not hear what is ment to be heard
now to the games
from the reviews i am reading both fans and media there are only a few games out that are any good
i know this is how most systems are when they launch but if i am going to pay  i want gold
every game i play sound be as amazing as the last
that is another thing
the price
i dont know how many people can just throw out  some dollars for a toy
i hear the  gig playstation  was discontinued
if sony is so secure about its product then why would it do this
i hear that there are game companies with playstation  games finished but they will not release until the fan base grows
so even after companies spend all the time and money on the ps games they still will not let sony sell them
they would rather loose money
that is how low the sales of the ps are
the reason the price is so high is because sony is failing in there  bluray dvd players
so they put one in the ps to get people to buy dvds to use it with
then im sure they think people will buy a bluray player
so what it comes down to is sony is failing in pspblurayumdand ps sales
i chose not to take a risk of wasting my money on something that i am not sure will stay in the industry
im not saying dont buy a ps
if you want to go for it
i will just sit here and be happy with my nessnesnintendo game cubewiigame boy sp nintendo dspspsxboxxboxplug n plays and my pceverything is great until yellow light blinking red light
sent it to sony to get it serviced they returned a refurbished one back  year later the same problemcontacted sony again and they sent the same reply back to me
gave me a copy and paste answer and told me to get it serviced again
for save your money and buy the slim its been a year so far and no problemi purchased a sony ps to play video games
now every time i turn the ps on sony is fixing their mistakes and wasting game players time with constant updates
i do not want to spend my time downloading updates just because sony did not properly setup their machines when they first shipped them
i have now had to spend  hours updating items that should never have been a problem in the first place
there have been  time wasting updates within  weekssoftware and hardware manufactures have become so lazy that they are willing to jeopardize their good name by wasting our time constantly updating their broken software
this is a mental illness now shared by a large percentage of the electronics industry
in windows vista updates are constantly being forced on the consumer due to lazy programmers in the corporate rush to sell more goods
i did not purchase a game machine to update the hardware every time i turn on the machine
a notice to all lazy companies we are not your beta testing grounds
if you can not properly setup your hardware and software then do not sell your products
customers have purchased these game machines to enjoy them to play games to have a fun with a group of friends
how can i have friends over to enjoy an evening of games when as soon as i turn on the machine the first thing it does is whine at me to download a pointless update
now a group of us can all sit around for  hours waiting for your company to update my machine
this is a game machine
it is for playing games
to all electronics manufacturers it is no fun updating your screw ups with your constant updates
do not waste out time anymore
get your products right or do not sell them
periodi will simply sell the ps on ebay and tell anyone i can that it simply wastes your time constantly updating the software
i will recommend to all people i know that you should buy a wii so you do not have to waste your entire evening updating the ps every other time you switch it on
no more forced updates sony
i want to play games not download pointless updatesthe console itself is designed fairly well
it puts out a lot of heat but unlike the  it does not have any reliability issues
one problem with the vents though is they exhaust out the right side of the console if you have it laying horizontally
anything sitting to the right of the console in that situation will get baked
the controller is not bad but sony is releasing a new controller with rumble next year so it would be a waste of money to buy the console with the obsolete controller at this time
one nitpick with the controller is the usbcharging port is on the top of the controller so charging docks require you to insert the controller upside down to charge them
also the batteries is internal and requires unscrewing the controller apart to replace
it uses a proprietary battery as wellas far as games go take a look at the release list yourself
there is absolutely nothing worth buying at this point
the only exclusives worth buying are not coming out until late early  so you may as well wait another year or two and enjoy the other  systems out that have plenty of great games worth buying right nowsimply put sony released the ps a year too early
none of the software from the games to the firmware of the console itself was ready to go at launch
they should have waited until xmas the console was very fun the first few weeks
the limited number of titles for this console and its poor online experience need to be addressed
the system is also a bit pricey for what it currently offers
im however waiting to see what is in storeim gonna get right to the point
the wii is really the gamecube version  nothing groundbreaking here
yes the idea of the wii nunchuk was kool but the novelty has worn off now
gamers should really be given the option of utilizing the classic or gc controller as alternatives
the wii nunchuk can be really hard to maneuver sometimes
i have zelda for the wii and after almost  years i still cant get past stage  i just cant catch a fish no matter what way the controller is pointing
i popped in my friends gc verion of zelda and caught a fish in  seconds
if anyone has mario kart wii they will know that the controller with the wheel is so difficult
i dont know a single person that has won a race who wasnt in th place when using the wheel
i popped in my gc controller and kept coming in st place
nintendo if your listening please make every game have alternative methods
the nunchuk is not flawlesswii is not fun at all
i find it very glitchy and unreliable
xbox is way better
it may cost more but you will like it a lot betterthe wii is nothing compared to the xbox  or the ps
the wii is only selling well in japan not in the us
this system only produces second rate copies of games on other consoles and its exclusive titles rely on stupid gimmicks
it is not a nextgen console because its graphics suck its online is worthlesscannot play movies at all and its store is useless
this consoles defeat is imminent and you dont want to own this console when that happens
any one even considering buying this game should go with either the xbox  or the ps
unless you dont care about graphics or you are a nongameri have owned the wii for a month now at first it seemed great but after playing a couple of games i came to a conclusion this was a waste of moneyi own both xbox  and ps and thought it be nice to own all  current gen systems  so i grabbed it thinking it be great
well its not i get to play some great gamecube games which i missed out on since i never owned a gc gc controllers can work for some wii games built in wifi small system doesnt take up alot of spacethe graphics suck after playing ps and xbox  it seems like i go back in time to last gen when i play the wii the motion control is not precise and lags though i hear wii motion plus fixes it it gets very costly  for remote  for nunchuck and  for wii motion plus thats  for a complete controller set online gaming sucks big time no matter what game i play online it lags like hell friend codeswtf is this garbage the sensor bar is garbage and seems like it can snap any second very few good games majority games are crap or kiddy games no hard drive not hd we live in the hd age now its a shame that this system is not hd  more and you can buy a ps or  my hands feel awkward after a while i still rather prefer the good old fashion gamecontroller to bad most games dont give you the optionoverall this could be a great system except it has way too many flawsi was very excited to finally recieve a wii but then i was only disapointed when i actually played it
they almost pulled off the motion sensing controller but it just does not work very well
games are a major problem with this system theyre hardly any games worth owning in its selection and hardly any have internet
ours now collects dust in our living room bottom line it is not a very good systemwiiak very weakthe nintendo wii console has approximately the same stats as the yearold xbox system
and still it carries the same price tag as the next gen consolesthe graphics look very gamecubish and sometimes plain atrocious red steel anyone
you cant access pages with more than a dozen pictures with the internet browser or the system crashes due to lack of memory and computing capability
it lacks hd support or dvd playback optionnone of that would really matter as we all know its the games that make the console
but not surprisingly all they offer are just rehashes of games published in the late s or mid s
all the innovativeness is long gone buried in the dark pastthe wii is controlled via a motion sensing system which youll find appealing if youre a toddler
the revolution of gaming
come on people
give us virtual realityyou can buy old classics through the internet at prices even the mafia darent ask
if theyd at least put amiga games availableyes this console might be fun to play with family or friends but true gamers have neither
this is the revolution of nongaming
if you want to buy an actual console i suggest buying xbox  or ps insteadunless im really confused this product does not work
it did not come with directions  had to go on youtube to make sure i set it up properly
needless to say it did not load or read the disc i bought new from gamestop
the one game that did work i couldnt get passed the main menuto start like everyone else says the graphics are horrible now usually i dont care about the graphics if the game is goodi mean if the graphics are good as well i wont complain but really
really
another thing im a pretty big zelda fan and metroid and mario party on occasion and i wanna play a game not a workoutwhich technically isnt even a work out i mean i cant play the legend of zelda if i need to use these weird ass motion controllers im am completely disapointed by the wii
my main concern is not being able to play zelda efficiently
i wanna play it and continue the story not swing my arms around like an idiotas an owner of all the nextgen consoles i would not consider the wii a true nextgen console as the graphics are not even hd
i would call it a semi nextgen console because of this
the graphics can be more compared with the gamecube
the only improvement is that the games are in widescreen and a slight improvement in picture quality
some would say though that some of the gamecube games had better graphics
i can see that ini some games made for the wii
i can say that the wii has not been a good investment
this console does not have very many good games
i would say that for the limited games put out by first and third party companies only about  are passable
the only game even worth a look is the zelda twilight princess but then that is also available on the gamecube and i already had that
the controllers are what made this console new in a sense
but the use was force implemented in games such as zelda skyward sword
problems with the controllers were really apparent in games like new super mario brothers wii where the jumping mechanics were not well implement
i can understand why people complained about the dash
nintendo realized the problem and put out a new controller to correct some of the problems with the wiimote plus
but by then the damage was done
further who wants to spend another forty bucks for another controller
i got the console in order to play zelda skyward sword as it was not available for the gamecube as i am a fan of the zelda series
but after having played that game i can say that it was not worth getting the wii for
the other games were mot very good
it reminds me of the experience i had with the gamecube where there were lots of bad games
the best games for this console is actually the wii sport and that can get quite boring without others to share the experience with
if you are getting the wii for the fitness game research shows that it is not an effective way to get fit
so thats out the window
now this console just sits collecting dust
the only plus is that it does play gamecube games but then i already have a gamecube
if you buy this you will need to buy the gamecube controllers
i spend most of my time on the playstation  i spend a small portion on the xbox  as it is only for campaigns
i dont play online on xbox  as i refuse to play sixty bucks just to play my games online
i used to subscribe to xbox gold but then after comparing online games i even had call of duty world at war for both consoles and saw no difference in graphics or gameplay i realized that xbox gold was a waste of money
as far as online gaming on the wii goes it is very archaic
you cannot actually hear what the other players are saying
of course you can chat with your friend but the system is terrible
to add insult to injury nintendo came out with a microphone that they discontinued because it was that bad
that is a far cry from the sony playstation  headphones which i use for online gaming
if you want to know what it is like to play online with great sound and microphone the sony playstation  headphones are simply the best
and dont get me on the code system just to paly with your friends online
that is just simply a pain in the ass to say the least
further having played call of duty modern warfare  online on the wii i can say that it lacks the fun of playing it on the playstation i have always been a big fan of nintendo and i have a nes and a gamecube but the wii was just awful
first you have to use batteries for the controller
the batteries need to constantly be replaced
it also needs sensor bar to hook up and the wire is very fragile
the systems tips over easily and is made out of cheap plastic
the controller sucks so bad that the super nintendo had more buttons
they say you can play gamecube games on the wii but it doesnt come with a gamecube controller and it is not the same experience
most wii games suck too like mario party  was just a gimmick for the motion controls
also the motion controls dont work well and because they are wireless it takes forever to change the player numbers
on the gamecube it was much easier
even the mariokart on the wii was crap compared to the gamecube version
the wii is just not fun and once you find that you got the damn controller to work youll see there arent any good games
mario galaxy was good but it doesnt have camera controls like  and sunshine did because the wii controller sucks so bad it doesnt even have enough controls to move the camera
the wii cost several hundred bucks but youll end up spending several hundred more replacing batteries
the charging stand doesnt help cause thats just more money and you cant play while charging
overall the wii is a piece of s and i highly recommend the classic systems like the nes snes nintendo  or gamecubeprisoner of azkaban is any goodthe other three are older and have relatively primitive graphics and mediocre gameplay  far be it from ea games to go back and update older games to match newer gameshowever what dragged the rating down to a single star was ea games customer servicemy set came without the serial numbers needed to install the gamesi emailed their customer service who then insisted i snail mail proof of purchase and a photocopy of the white strip on the back of the jewel case to their office in californiaonce verified they would send me the needed numbers by return snail mailare they kidding
what a jokeanyway i went online and after about five minutes of searching found a warez site that allowed me to download the serials for freeand also bear in mind that the games require the cd to be in the computer when playing even if you transfer the entire game onto your hard driveforget it
it has no save game except for checkpoints that are ridiculously far apart
if you get killed  of the way to a checkpoint you have to do it all over again clear the trenches gun emplacements bunkers artillery emplacements blow up the artillery fight off several counterattacks  die once and back you go
the weapons have the worst accuracy of any game ive ever played if you dont include the ones at the local carnival
the online cheats and patches did not work and the ones by the maker dont fix any of the real problems
otherwise the game is great
kind of like a new bmw that has to go back to the shop every time you almost get to where you want to goi am all for a good world war ii shooter
i get even more excited when it is a tactical game
i read the pc gamer reviews and talked to a couple of people who had played it
all gave it pretty good props
one guy warned me it was a bit tricky to get used to but that isnt a reason to not buy it
i played this game and i seriously had to stop and regather myself after five minutes in the first board
since when does the army train someone to shake his gun like he is a drug addict who is going through withdrawal
i was emptying clips at guys who were standing still with no cover and i couldnt hit them point blank sometimes
even if i did manage to get a few rounds in the guy he would turn around and blast me and i would be a goner
i used to shoot rifles competitively in a league that had age groups one being  yrs old and those kids were putting this aiming to shame
no one shakes like that
the whole tactical thing is a complete joke
i would tell my guys to fire and they would run off to the right and disappear
or i would want them to fire and my guy would tell them to flank themwhich would be fine if there werent walls in the way or no way around
i got so sick of it i tried going through it disregarding the squad stuff and it is impossible
i gave up on this game after the second board
i would recommend for a decent fps game set in wwii that you get cod or mohi contacted ubisoft about an issue with the starcraft cd protection drivers and they never even responded
avoid this headache at all cost
save your cash and purchase another wwii fps from a better group software coderscan not really review it because there is no patchfix for win and trust me been there done that as far as trying to come up with one spent mucho time with ubisoft and they are at a dead end so to speak about any fixes so it really isnt fair to knock it but then again i cant give it a fair shot so atleast one star will draw attention to the fact of its short comingsi do have the other two of this series and do enjoy them for what they areseems odd that two out of three would have the necessary driver fix but not the one that came out between the ones that do have patchesfixes
and do beware if you try to install it to win anyway it will cause your win os to hang up in reboot modeand you do have to reboot it upon installation to play itso unless there is a fix just say no to the protection system reboot and await the fix which i understand is not forthcoming as the writer starforce and ubi soft have parted ways over the copyright issuesso once again the old drmcopyright boger bear has reared its headsimply putearned in blood is identical to the first brothers in arms game
it really is not different at allthey put that starforce antipiracy crap on the disk
many computers really get screwed up by it too
i actually kind of like the style of strategy and squad play found in bia
i really prefer the style of cod but this game was actually fun
i just think this game falls short of what it could have been
that is one reason why i rate it only  starhere is what i really do not like at all about this game and why i gave it  star  you get some level load freeze ups that will happen even on a fast system  annoying long and poorly voiceacted cutscenes and storyline that you cannot skip past
ughhhhhhhhhhhthe stupid dramatic puss spews out for minutes on end and you just get so sick of it after the first few chapters you feel like muting the volume until it is over
and i do hit my mute button
it is that bad and that boring nothing new since the original came out
basically ubisoft wants to rip you off for  more
i say it is flat out greed this time
if you played the original your going to feel cheated
if you haventsave some bucks and buy that in the discount rackubisoft has really become a huge disappointment to many gamers over the past  years
they were rolling along nicely
however it seems like they have just stopped trying to work hard to provide an interesting product
they have resigned themselves to pumping out subpar games hoping you wont read reviews like this onethe game itself is an acceptable try at a tactical game though a little bit of a one trick pony in that it is played by doing pretty much the same thing again and again  get a base of fire and flank the germansubisofts decision to use star force protection software is a major problem
deleting the game leaves the star force crap in your registry
using star forces deletion software available from their site leaves crap in your registry as well
you have to get it out manually and even then it may be too late  my plextor dvd burner now no longer display the contents of any cd put in it
and no i have never had any disk copying software on my computer and even if i had wtf business is that of either ubisoft or star force
and even if i had how do they justify disabling one of my optical readers even after their game is deleted
i hate to say it but i am no longer purchasing ubisoft games not until they get rid of star forcedo not buy this game does not work with windows vista
some times window xp games will play on vista but not this game
live and learnsome game reviews had said theyd gotten some things right that hadnt worked as well in the previous pop game
not true
everything about this game is infuriating to play
thumbs downyet another game using the invasive starforce drivers
my friend installed this on his computer and the reason he is not typing this now is starforce pretty much baked his hard drive
the drivers bar you from using legitimate functions of your computer playing the game half the time and install drivers with administratorlevel access making them a very popular target for viruses and the likethis game is terrible
dont waste your money or time
the cover and explanation of the game look great but playability is terrible
to start off i have a fast computer with  gb of ram  ghz athlon  computer  kbs dsl connection ati radeon   mb video card
not the best but better than what is recommended on the boxlet me just say that the load times are so long for both single and multiplayer
and when it is loading it doesnt provide you any progress bar
it is so long that you might think your computer has hung and will need to be reboot
also when trying to play multiplayer and you select a servergame to join it will take about  min to load
what is even more frustrating than that is after youve waited between  min youve suddenly been disconnected and the computer hangsoverall i found myself sitting and waiting more than ive found myself playing
this game sucks
dont buy it
marketing guys did a great job displaying and hyping this game
the artwork on the box looks great
but the programmers and project leads for this game are all amateurs need more practicei decided to write this review because i cant return the game to target and get my money back
i just wasted 
so to all those who are considering the game run dont walk away from this gamewhat the heck ubi
ghost recon
rainbow six 
what are these things
not even close to the previous version
come on please give us a true improved good game to play instead of fool us with the old title
todays pc game is dead and hard to find a good title as before
i am very very disappointed
just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield gamesyup its a console game alright
its somewhat pretty and explosions are very cool but thats where it ends
i cant beleive i wasted  bucks on this frustrating no manual saves ai is horrid
ai sees you before you even turn the corner squad mates are dumb as stumps
tell them to follow and they run past you into a crossfire no jumping or walking over short obsticals squad commands dumbed down and limited for the twitchersdo i need go onthis game would be ok for an arcade setting
but ghost recon it is not
shame on you ubithe original ghost recon for pc is hands down my favorite squad based d shooter
i loved the tactical aspects and the real life feel of being in the battlefield
from the tactical map allowing commands and control of all your men this game really gave you the feel of being a battlefield commanderwith each new version of ghost recon it has become apparent that ubisoft is no longer concerned with supporting the pc environment or its users which is a real shame
while i enjoy some console games primarily sports ive never enjoyed d shooters on console
i like many of my friends prefer the mouse  keyboard as well as the beautifully rendered graphicswhile the  and hdtv eliminates one of these i dont think its enough to port a console game directly over to the pcmost important i believe that the game play has been dumbed down to the run in kill get killed mentality
gone are the tactical  squad based maneuvering that really defined the original game
that was something original that set this and the swat series apart from other d shootersmight as well go out and buy quake or unreal because here is yet another clonegame of the year no moresome of the extremely aggravating things about this game are  the ai ghosts either wander off and do their own thing or get stuck somewhere and you have to go run into them a few times to get them unstuck the gameplay is predictable and very very linear you can only go a certain way even if it takes you directly into a line of fire  there are some problems with the graphics where you see your team mate in places they arent and get stuck on some of the trees and hillsides and  there are no save points in a multiplayer missionon the plus side the game is very challenging even on the easiest settings
for the cost of this game and the amount of frustration that it causes i would just buy something elsemore than a little bit of a dissappointment if youve been into the tom clancy tactical games
i thought graw would really set a new standard
so much for hype
i dont know if it is because it was developed as a console game they tend to be a bit dumbed down compared to pc games  please dont take offense if you only play console games or was badly ported or the developers just ran out of good ideas
on top of this it has star force protection which is a major problem
wierdly ubi pulled sf from its other major release this year but has not as of this writing issued a patch to remove it from graw
you can remove sf from your system but then you cannot play the game it will reinstall the stuff
given the problems folks have had with sf if you are going to get ghost recon i recommend waiting until it  a patch is issued or until sf is removed from the diskea you suck at making sports game and every other type of game on the market
your madden game of  is the same as the  edition
the graphics looks identicle  useless feature is added and you charge full price
its pethetic
your games suck
i played a game without ever touching my controller on defense
isent that amazing
the computer controllers my character and plays defense
i dont need to touch anything
the ai and the graphics are not even close to next generation
dont buy this crap or  becuase it will be the exact same gameironic how the most visually impressive game of the madden franchise is also the worst one of the buncheverything everybody is saying is true
one glaring omission john madden
the whole generic announcer through an am radio commentary is incredibly annoying
why didnt ea include the audio tracks from michaels and maddenthis is a halfbaked game no question about it
dont waste your moneyjunk that says it all but all of ea launch titles were i think they shouldve refunded our money for these launch titles but thats why they went from first to third
they still are doing this just look at dragon ageorigins another unfinished gamethis game especially now that the original xbox game is  is complete robbery
the xbox  version sports only  courses compared to the  courses on the original xbox and this version is filled to the brim with bugsfor example when playing a tournament on the final hole the putting line will mysteriously disappear this actually happens countless times throughout the game but interestingly enough ive noticed it appears most often when youre about to finish a round
also as you make your last putt the announcers will often say thats a tie atop the leaderboard
or thats for a share of the lead
when youve actually won the tournament
announcements will also come late for example when youre putting and the announcer calls out that youre  yards from the hole
top that off with the fact that their putting advice isnt just useless its often totally wrongthe online version of this game is using eas own frontend as they have in the previous tw games
if you havent experienced how bad it is consider yourself lucky
game dropouts which are tallied on your personal xbox profile are far more likely eas fault then a sour player
ea even taunts us by directly telling us that the only way theyre going to update their question online faq is if we send them a question wrapped in cash preferably twenties
ea has never offered additional courses for download
there is no download menu item in the xbox live menu of this game and i will personally fly to ea and buy every member of the tw team a copy of this overpriced overrated game if they ever offer even a single course
it simply wont happen because they dont carethis game has a fallbehind catch up feature so bad that if youre winning the tournament tiger woods will come out of nowhere on the rd day and score an impossible round
for example he shot a holeinzero yes you read that correctly on a par  to catch up to me on the back nine
hell also take the lead in the tournament
the reason this is done is so that you can do head to head against tiger
however it also ruins any course records youve worked hard and fairly to earnthe final nail in this games coffin is that the system cheats
and by that i mean that the controls on the system will mysteriously pull left or right or push over the green your shots when youre too far in the lead or making an early gain at the beginning of the higher tournaments
if you want an example try making the exact same eagle approach shot in one of the major tournaments when youre ahead and behind
if youre the leader you wont ever hit the green if youre the leader youll never hit the green if youre a few shots behind youll amazingly land near the pinfor the price of this game you should really go out and play a real round of golf
you wont be giving lazy developers any of your hard earned money and youll be playing at a far nicer course than ea has virtually createdits sad i have to get out my old xbox and play my old nba live  to enjoy a quality game
other than the graphics this game is terrible
the camera angles are ridiculous
i tried every camera angle in the game and the game play was still hard to follow
there were times i slammed the ball and the camera wasnt even showing the basket
i just heard the dunk in the back ground and id be seeing some akward did not make sense camera picture
also the players move a lot slower
it definitely took fun away from the game
ea better get it together because the quality of this game sucks
do not waste your money
if you are an ea sports fan and those are the primary games youll play on xbox  dont even buy the system
sad sad sad ea should be ashamedlive takes a below and beyond fall in its competition with the k seriesprossweet graphicson close ups you can see the fantastic modeling on your favorite nba players and sweatmarv albert and steve keer comentatingupdated rostersstill got create a player modeconsthe camera angles are so poor it makes a bum seem as rich as the creator of this console
seriously i cant see layups or dunks for the life of me cuz of the crappy camera angles
 modes
this systems younger cousin had a crapload of more varietey than this usless excuse for modesno superstar abilitieswell everything from the previous version was just flat out stripped including the modesthe gameplay went from fastpaced to slow
now im in a diffrent paced limbo
im used to rabbit speed not a turtletoo many blocksnot a issue in the previous version but i find me playing as tim duncan going for the dunk and getting swatted by chauncy billups
ok now theyve done something you never seen before
good job ea
ah impossible free throw shootingyou know i might have been able to eventually get over not having other modes as long as i could win
free throws just blow more than wind
i mean they just completley threw away their old chemestry and invented a crappy new one
using the r trigger to go down and up
you cant limber to the left or right even a bit and if your free throw shooter is  or below and on superstar ods are youre gonna miss even if you get it right
i mean it isnt ingenious at all
i lost by  points on superstar against the heat by going  at the free throw lineand i am dead freakin serious about that
and i was leading near the end but the kept fouling me i kept missing and they came back like a bad memory
the free throws just ruin everything since i cant win almost at all
my last shot is always blocked
nba live  is just another reason for bee gay sports to just bow down to the k series and seriously just give up
i mean even madden blew donkey butt
with this masterpeice of crap ea just completley lost all my trust in them
i thought the xbox version of nba  sucked man when i got a taste of this i vomited and thanked god i still kept my xbox version
i mean at least in that game i can hit free throws to still win
i was hoping ea was holding out to make this better on the  but the took a giant crap on me and many other ea fans who bothered to shell out  more bux than the xbox version to see if it would pay off and it didnt
no body should buy this overpainted version of nba live that was the last live game to have  modes
go get kat least it stays to its chemestrypeacei really enjoyed this game until the designers threw a  foot thick brick wall in my way around rd the way through the game
when you get to trying to work your way to challenge the th person on the blacklist you will be forced to have to either avoid  spike strips tag  police cars or make it through  roadblocks
by the time you get even halfway through meeting one of these milestone you will be at police level  you will not ever be able to escape from the police at this level unless you get completely lucky i have tried  times now over the last  hours yeah that is real fun guys and since i play games to have fun and not get completely pissed off this game is going on ebay
there is of course no difficulty level selection that you can choose from  so forget about any hope of completing the gameunless you are a masochistic sadist twitch freak that has no issue with taking massive doses of stimulants before playing a game to meet this games difficulty level stay awaythis game is a waste of time to play after you get to blacklist member  jv
in the milestone section where you have to hit  cop cars and then evade them you cant cause they either run you into walls have too many cops on you or spiked roadblocks you dont know about until is too late
according to my husband you have to play this game for more than  hours a daythis is without a doubt the absolutely worse fighting game ever made
tecmo has removed all the enjoyable elements including removing a difficulty level for beginners
if you arent a doa pro youll be pummled countless times while you just try to learn the controls
the computer will pull off x combos on you while you just try to land a punch or kick
whats worse the game has  achievements including more than a dozen secrets which you must unlock
but youll be so frustrated by this game that you wont even botherthe worst part of it is that this is no longer a party game
meaning you cant invite over your friends and have fun fighting each other
the few people that master the games new countering system which is aptly named since its so counterintuitive will slaughter the newbies and completely remove the fun of the multiplayer elementlikewise when you take your game online which you must do to earn  of the public achievements youll get destroyed by users who are far better than you if you havent dedicated your life to doa practiceso before you waste half of your life trying to become the doa guru of your social circle or the entire online world remember that the only things that are new to this game from dead or alive ultimate which is  the cost is a few new characters the hd graphics which are i admit absolutely amazing and a set of new features which only make it tougher for those of us who werent good at playing fighting games in the first place
thanks tecmo for completely ignoring the entire gaming community to make another game like ninja gaiden black a game that no one wants to play unless its the only game they practice ati love adventure games as in myst riven ect
i should have read reviews on this game before buying it though if there had been more than  at the time
i didnt care for the comic bookchildish type characters
i also dont have a degree in horticulture and chemistry needed to play
i grew very tired of mixing chemicals and also plants holding on to inventory items  pages and reading subtitles which come later in the game when you learn to speak seleneze
i played  of the game but grew bored with the story and inventory nonsense
i gave this at least  star for gamers under the age of  with the help of an adult or 
oh and if one more selenite threw up on me i was going to trash the gameis this some sick joke nintendo
i played this game and it was so annoying that i wanted to personally wanted drop an atom bomb on my fake little pixalated dogreal funny nintendo real funnyokay i can kind of see the concept behind thisa virtual puppy if you cant have a real one
on the other hand the execution has lead to a boring boring gamegetting into the game initially is hardtraining my dog to respond to its name took quite some time and the instructions given in the slim manual included were nearly useless
i am beginning to wonder if the increasingly awful documentation included with hot new titles is intentionala drive to get you to buy the official guidehaving said that after many tries i got my dog to respond to its name and how to sit
now what you askwell you  have to do more repetitive stuff in order to buy supplies for your dogonce you unlock the menu to feed water walk and groom your dog you have to just keep repeating things in order to do more of the same
you then apparently enter contests in order to get more moneyto feed and water your dog and so on and so oni cant figure out the appeal here whatsoever unless you really really really like dogsand doing the same thing over and over againim a huge harry potter fan and its been a few years sine i played the games watched the movies and read the book
so i read the books watch the movies and now im replaying the games
i never finished playing number  and had forgotten why
now i remember why
because its so far from how amazing  were
i can no longer explore the castle the beans run away from you and i have to cope with that by casting accio and i dont know what in the world im casting at half the time
i cant figure out how to buy wizard cards i can only play with my keyboard which really sucks because i use a laptop and the arrow keys are a cramped little rectangle that i keep accidentally hitting shift instead of the up arrow key i cant walk in a straight line and when you hit s to cast the super spell boost or whatever i do it on accident and waste it because im so used to moving around with the a s w and d keys
you have absolutely no choice but to move around with the arrow keys and cast with the z x and c keys because this is not optional
they created this for a tv game system and rather than spending a little time adjusting the controls for pc game play they wasted our time and money with this crap
i will only play because i never finished playing the series in game for but i do not enjoy playing this in this format
it would be more fun if i could use my controls as i did in the last if you are expecting a game like the other harry potter games you are in for a bad experience
this game has no real interaction with characters like the others there is no feeling like you are there reliving the movie
all this game has to offer is running around and knocking things over and slaying things
no real beauty in this one and ea has failed on this game terribly
sorry i spent the money
lindai agree with everyone else as far as the lack of mouse function lack of audio adjustment i cant wear my headphones because the sound is too loudill have to see if the windows volume controls can adjust the game volume etc
ive got a really good gaming pc so have had no problem with the way the game runs and i just bought a gamepad so i dont have to rely on the keyboard controls which would have been a major setback for me thats the only thing i hated about sorcerers and chamber when in the game you had to use the keyboard
but even after reading the manual  times i still dont know how to select certain spells when i need them
and i have yet to figure out how to get all  characters to do a cooperative spell cast on the same item at the same timemostly its harry casting a spell in one place hermione over there yelling lapifores 
we dont need rabbits when were tryig to put out fires and ron running around whining about something
i have only played maybe  levels and quit for the night because it was so extremely confusing and frustrating
and im not even bothering to collect beans or cards if there are any at this point since ive been concentrating on trying to keep my character from losing all hisher stamina and trying to figure out what im supposed to be doing nowits not all intuitive it took a while to figure out those gaps with gates on the other side needed to be crossed
i dont think the graphics so far have been goodif you want to see some spectacular graphics take a look at syberia or even riven
i am going to finish this game but unless the game play improves significantly i probably wont replay it not even to find all the cards or shields or whatever unless someone writes a walkthrough
its just not funand yes fun is important in real life when you have bought a game this is the way some of us destress after another horrible day in hell
that one reviewer who admitted hasnt even bought the game but then compares the game to the book well thats nonsense
this is a gamenot the book
games should be fun thats why we all went out and bought the thing and eagerly looked forward to playing it
i dont mind not being able to run around hogwarts it would have been nice but not necessary i dont mind not being about to talk to other students and all that
however so the only thing the characters do is shoot a spell shoot a jinx shoot a charm etc
just shoot shoot shoot which is boring
if id wanted a shootemup game id have gone for well i dont know since i dont like and never play those shootnig games
theres none of those amazing floating blocks or clouds you can climb on or rotating platforms to jump on in exactly the correct timingmaybe later i hope
thats what i loved about the previous hp games those very imaginative impossibly unreal wizardly things that the characters had to deal with
i dont like the birdseyeview eithertoo reminiscent of computer games where the developers didnt want to bother with real perspective didnt want to spend the money to get a more realistic rendering of people and scenery basically just wanted to present a layout of the battle field you were to usewhat i always thought of as cheap designing
i do hope it gets better because right now i am disappointed and feel ea let the pc players down i would have gladly paid more to by a better devised game specifically designed to take advantage of what a pc can domost of us nowadays are serious mouse users ya know
im glad the movie is out cause if this game doesnt improve soon im just going to spend my time watching the movie insteadi wish i had waited to buy this game until i could have read other peoples opinion of this game
it is terrible
i finally got into it last night after completing the prisoner of azkaban and it was great
this one however is terrible
it is very hard to maneuver the characters
you cannot get them to move in a straight line
you have to remember the right letter keys to work spells and you cannot use your mouse
all in all a very difficult game to play and what a let down from the first three
dont waste your moneypeople
dont  waste your money on this game on pc
i bought this game today and it sucks
i loved the last  they kept getting better and better but now oh now this game sucks so bad
i have no idea what ea was thinking
no wonder it was only  at walmart for a brandnew game its a piece of crap
next time ill check the reviews before i buy another ea game
ill say it again think  times before buying
dont waste your moneygame did not load
contacted tech and was told to clean boot my system
this will eliminate some programs when you follow microsofts clean boot directions 
in order to recover these programs one has to undo the clean boot and reboot
this game is not worth the trouble
it would be nice if we were prewarnedthis game doesnt stand up against doom  maybe is more fun but not that original and why buy the black ed
while the gold ed
has the same content
except that it came on  cds
different media doesnt justify the added valuei purchased the game in very good shape but when received the case was damaged and the game simply does not work
i cannot express my anger and disappointmentthis game is a bug ridden mess
its also a terrible half  effort game
i beat this game by using the debug menu otherwise it would have been quite troublesome because this game freezes a lot
remember how much fallout new vegas froze that times  its rediculous this game was even published
shame on you activision also your pratically spider man at one part
he climbs a wall with his hands and thats it
do you know who published spiderman  activision
which came out a year before this
also this game makes fun of grand theft auto
ha do you know whats funny rockstar actually doesnt have games that freeze constantly
do not ever and i mean ever buy this crappy game its horrible
buy grand theft auto  instead or  grand theft auto sanandreas or if you bought because you thought oh cool a cop game the first one is ten times better
the gameplay is terrible
the ai is terrible
the sound is decent
the music is ok the graphics are of an average ps game
overall nothing special is in this game other than the rediculous bounty of bugs and a terrible story that has the most wtf ending evertrue crime  is just plain awful
it starts interesting yet it doesnt present anything original or interestingthe gun play just isnt that good compared to true crime  true crime  had you flying in different directions and doing slow motion dives behind cars
when cars would explode you would be thrown backwards
in true crime  you basically just point and shoot
there are different weapons that let you take people down nonlethally that you are given
theres no point in using targetingthe melee fights arent that cool either
in true crime  you were doing all kinds of kung fu moves while breaking everything around you
in this game you press a button  times and the combo is executedalso the actual feel of the game has been lost a little bit
in true crime  you had no map and were basically cruising to a destination unknown
it was fun driving to new objectives at night during the rain
in this game you arent quite as lost but then again that isnt a great thing
i enjoyed getting lost in true crime  and i enjoyed feeling out of place everywhere
it was weird cruising as far as i could go and feeling like i should turn aroundone of the more interesting features about true crime  is the fact that you can enter any building
this isnt a bad feature but it doesnt make up for the limited gameplayi would skip this game and go for gta in the wake of the revolutionary grand theft auto  there were a horde of pretender games released that couldnt come close to gtas audacity and style
true crime streets of la was actually one game that came close in this sense which is why this sequel true crime new york city was so looked forward to
however not only is this game supremely disappointing its almost unplayable
at first glance the game looks slick enough but once you engage in the games storyline and horrible dialogue along with the unbelievably choppy frame rate youll wonder how this ever got released
the story of the game is you play as marcus an undercover cop looking to clean up the streets one way or another
no matter which route you take good cop or bad cop its going to be hard to get past the fuzzy graphics the clunky controls the derivative gameplay the inane collision detection and bugs that plague true crime new york city throughout the game
theres hardly anything good worth noting about true crime other than a somewhat decent soundtrack featuring punk favorites the misfits as well as the godfather of ghoul rock danzig and naturally plenty of hiphop ugh and a surprisingly solid cast of actors supplying their voices including christopher walken laurence fishburne mickey rourke and mariska hargitay among others who are sadly wasted with the cliche dialogue
also it should be noted that the game will crash randomly a lot
its a wonder how this game ever got past quality control but then again i guess everyones got to make a quick buck these days
do yourself a favor stick with gta any gta for that matter even the original one for the ps
just whatever you do leave this game on the shelfthe only true crime here is the shoddy work done on this title
true crimes streets of la was like many grand theft auto rip offs
big city plenty of running around to do
except instead of working for the mob or whatever youre actually a cop
it may not have been the best game but it was a start
some of the mechanics werent bad
some were actually fairly well done
i guess one could only expect a sequel
in hopes that true crimes new york city would be better i seem to have had my hopes upyou play as marcus reed a gangster who has just become a cop so he can clean up the streets of new york
and as marcus youll take on the assignments given to you by the police department
theyre all pretty straightforward
each mission is divided into parts
each part consists of you gunning down all the thugs and finding the bad guy
rinse and repeat
the missions like streets of la are very simple and dont really call for any real strategy at all
and the bad guys are as stereotypical as the main character himselfthe game is pretty simple and should you only do the missions youll complete it in fairly short time
the same thing plagued the first true crimes game and i was hoping there would be an improvement here
unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the caseif you dont want to do the main mission though there are alternatives
much like gta there are side missions you can do
you can street race go off and stop other crimes and you can frisk people for contraband including drugs obscene pictures weapon parts stolen license plates and the list goes on
you can either turn these things into the station for career points which help your rankthere are five ranks in true crimes  and theyre all based on whether or not youre a good cop or a bad cop
unfortunately theres nothing special about the ranking system until you become an extremely bad cop and that will overall lower your rankingbeing a good cop simply means youve taken the proper precautions such as frisking your suspects clipping them in cuffs and not killing anyone needlessly
bad cops are obtained the exact opposite way
its a lot easier to be a bad cop than a good cop but it is still one of the points of true crimes that sticks out as being plesant
you just wont notice until youre an extremely bad cop or an extremely good copthe gameplay is simple
you shoot or strike down your enemies to death
you can lock on to them but for some reason marcus isnt always accurate in doing so
you can also pick up weapons your enemies drop but there isnt much variety in them and in the end youll most likely find yourself picking them up because youre low on ammo in one weapon so you need moremelee combat isnt bad
youll probably only do it because it looks cool but its almost suicide in some cases
you can pick up objects and lug them at your enemies and whatnot
you can also snap their necks if youre good enough or throw them up against the wall
theres a lot of variety there
hey you can even do it to random pedestrians but it isnt much fun especially when they for whatever reason dont diethe vehicles you drive around in are pretty realistic based off of real cars but you cant help but look at how messed up some of these mechanics are
a slight tap on another car will send it flying into traffic without a doubt
it doesnt matter what the car is it sends it out there
youll also run into a moment or two of floating cars and thats another of many bugs this game hasthere are more bugs than one can imagine
for example you may just randomly fall through the ground into eternal darkness
youll eventually die but youll wish you hadnt stepped on the crack when you do
some of the scripted moments for whatever reason just stop cars changing colors the list goes on and on and onsurely the graphics will save this game right
naw and if you think they do something is seriously wrong with you
this isnt up to the standards of this generation at all
the character models are blockier than a cube of ice and the framerate is terrible
every five seconds or so the game will freeze and then resume
this very apparent when youre roaming the streets of new york
in the indoor areas its less frequent but youll lose several boss fights because of that
the game freezes for that brief moment but the action does not
not only that but sometimes the sound will cut outas far as the music goes it really isnt too bad
you can rank your songs so that the ones you want to play actually play and if theres a song you completely hate you can rank it a zero and itll never playthe voice acting isnt bad
christopher walken lends his voice but sometimes the celebrity voice actors feel like a waste
especially with the poorly written script
now i can be a good sport about cusswords but not when theyre used as senselessly as this
they come as sounding like little middle school kids saying these words just to be cool rather than to be serious or toughtruthfully i think this is a game that isnt worth getting
way too many bugs the game is short the dialogue is bad is there really any reason to want to get ths game
even the graphics lack
this isnt worth your time
even if you like true crimes streets of la this just isnt worth your timethe goodthe sound for what its worth isnt badthe badchoppy graphicsterrible frameratebad dialogueway too stereotypicalway too many bugs to enjoyjust avoid it
not worth your timetrue crime new york city is the sequel to true crime la though you are now playing as a former gang member named marcus instead of kang
marcus was framed and betrayed by his own gang boss so from the beginning of the game you will start blasting away in a bitter state of revenge
marcus then makes a new lead in life by becoming a cop with the help of his fathers friend
five years later marcus is being offered the undercover detective position and sets out to fight crime in the city of new york
first let me comment on the good points of the game the shooting driving and martial arts system in the gameplay have been improved over its predecessor
in the shooting aspect you can now lock on to targets and blast away
the weaponry has improved and are more fierce feeling a bit like max payne
you can also do presiscion shots again but it feels better
the driving vehicles also improved feeling tighter and you can even drift on cornersthe good points however are dragged down by sloppy programming that left the game unfinished and full of strange glitches which are not acceptable
my ingame mini radar showed a bad guy as a red dot and i went searching endless for the bad guy and could never find it even though i was right on the dot
then i made my game character look up and the bad guy was floating in midair
the ingame police characters often chased after ghost criminals yelling stop right there and then took off runningsometimes when i crashed my cars with other vehicles their body would sink halfway into the ground
the sound effects and character speeches would cut off abruptly especially on the streets with pedestrians
shooting bad guys in the head is not always a kill but i shot someone in the leg three times and they died
the graphics are cheap and the framerate is full of lag
i dont care how wonderful a game concept is
if the gameplay is so buggy as to hinder its enjoyment then it is junk
game developers should not release buggy games like this and sell them to the public as a finished product this simply is unacceptable
skip this and save your money youve been warnedprosminor improvementsarresting people is funconscheap looking graphicsfloating bugscollision detection problemssound issuesterrible frameratecontrol issuesimprovements ruined by glitchesok im confusedsluggish controlsbad soundbad graphicsnot even comparible to true crime streets of laman i thought sequels were supposed to be betteri was excited about this one but i played a little of the beginning and turned it off in disappointmentguess ill play the originalby the time i played the game it was already two years old so i already knew that there were going to be antiquated issues to deal with
what i didnt realize at the time was there was going to be the glitch of death
as i started playing the game i was hooked and the story line was pretty good
it kept me wanting to invest my precious time playing the game
now to the catch
you cannot buy weapons in this game only upgrades
as part of the story line you have to lose your weapons
it does not matter how much money you earn during the game you can never buy weapons
you loses your weapons at least twice in the game
the second time you lose your weapons and i thought that the game gave them back to me and it didnt
i saved the game and there are no cheat codes or nothing to get your weapons back and you cannot buy new weapons
well i had to fight an end boss without my weapons and there was simply no way to beat the guy without starting the game over
too many other games out there that beat this game hands down
i chose to sell it instead of starting over again
thanks for wasting my time activision
buyer another western like red dead revolver instead one that does not have this foolish glitch
how can you beat an end boss without weapons
this mistake should not happen in a game but then again this is an activision game
if it werent for this glitch and i could have finished the game it would have gotten at least a high three stars or four starsi normally dont play first person shooter type games because i dont have the quick gaming reflexes necessary to play such games and most games dont have effective ways of controlling your characteraiming  shooting
i took a chance on this game though because it sounded interesting
i couldnt get past the poor aiming and firing controls to delve deeper into the game
the voice acting for the two main characters in the game was really good and the graphics were pretty good but i couldnt play the game for more than the hour it took to learn the controls and play a ways into the game
people that play fps games a lot may enjoy this game but it wasnt for mei love the game
ive played it before
but this particular copy freezes up in the same spot every time
and i couldnt get anything done about it
what i did get to play of the game was funthe third game offers nothing new or exciting enough to warrant a third visit to this series
everything couldve ended fine with the second one but instead ubisoft had to poop out another prince of persia game in turn creating the least fun version of the series
get warrior within or sands of time insteadok so i rented the other versions of graw i own the  version to see how they all played
i thought id give the ps one a shot first and im extremely glad i got it out of the way
first off i dont like playstation games at all so i wasnt surprised that i didnt like this game
while playing the game i realize how grateful i am to have a  because the graphics and gameplay of this ps version are pretty sad
the thing i noticed right off the bat with this game was the controls
they felt a bit awkward and it was definitely hard to control
it seemed almost boxy
to put it in better terms it was nowhere near as fluid as seen in the xbox  version of the game
the second but probably most obvious thing bad about this game was the graphics
things were almost textureless and extremely bland
yet another bad thing i found in the game was the ai
this game had some of the dumbest ai i have ever seen
the enemies would just walk out look at you and wait for you to shoot them down
that may seem a bit farfetched but honestly the ai was that badobviously there had to have been something good about this game
hmmm lets see
well the night vision was good in the sense that you can see your enemies with it in broad daylight even at far distances
so i guess thats kind of bad too
the menus were ok but woopdedoo for that considering thats not part of the game
the environments are a lot smaller which makes for an easier way to get through them but again thats not really a strong point either
overall this game is so bad that its not even worth a rent even if you only own a ps and want to play graw
trust me its not worth itall i wanted to know was if it was as bad as the one for xbox
well i was very wrong in fact the ps versian is ten times worse than the xbox versian
which makes it in comparison to the  versianugh dont go there
i really dont want to go into detail lets just say the graphics caused me a mild cause of nausea
and as for the gameplay well lets just say playing with a turd you just let loose in the toilet is more fun than this game staring into sun is more beneficial to you than playing this game
i could go on but then i would have to keep reliving the short hour i played this turd
and what is the worst part you guessed it the price
for the mere price of  you can enjoy a game so half assed that youll have trouble believing ubisoft made iti rented this game on ps because i dont have a  ive played the  version and it was fun
however the only thing the ps version has in common with the  version is the name
nothing else
the missions are different the graphics have been toned down massively the ai is choppy and one of the worst things about this game is that the cover system is terrible
when i take cover behind a wall and try to peak around it doesnt even let me look past the wall
its hard to explain but once you take cover and try to peak around corners youll understand what i mean
you cant change from st to rd person
there are a limited number of orders you can give your teammates
there are much more bad qualities this game has that i wont mention youll have to see for yourself
bottom line if you own a  buy that version
if you dont ignore this game and stick to the previous ghost recon gamesi picked this up on release date because i had found out the same day that the pc version had been pushed back to mayit was by far the biggest waste of  dollars i had ever spent ubi should be ashamed of this portgraphics  really outdated even for the ps it reminded me of playing the original medal of honor and even that game had decent atmosphereas a fan of the gr games and squad based games in general i was really disappointed to find out you didnt actually have more than just one guy to order around whereas in jungle storm you had a team of sixtrying to aim was harder than shooting blind the controls were clunky as heckthe missions were way too linear you follow one path to your objective and thats iti just played the demo on the pc for the same game and its so many fathoms betterif you want it on consoleget an xbox dont bother with it on ps because its like trying to play with a beer coaster which this game made nicelyor get it on pc if you can run itokay pleeeeeaaaase dont get me wrong people go ahead and check out this game heck im sure its worth it
well ive lost allot of faith in games anymore metroid prime hunters what can i say
its typical anymoreloss of imagination
people who make games they do it for the money and lose heart in the making itself anymore
i am a huge metroid fan
hugely obsessed
but im just not feeling into the game spirit anymore
the action wasnt there compared to zero mission and fusion i just didnt get the feel
metroid prime for the game cube gave me the same pessimestic but true to heart feeling
maybe its because im too use to classics or that i can only play games as sidescrollers games like this anyways
i honestly dont know what to say to tell you the truth
i know there are allot of people who love this gameand games like it
i just feel things have gotten a bit too different anymore
i didnt like how this game looked cartoony
the other hunters did anyways
sure the graphics were outstanding but there was just something missing i didnt know what
okay im just trashing this game thats not what im trying to do though
like i said i love metroid
just not this one or any of the newer ones out there
the fun of it stopped at metroid zero mission
fusion was cool
super metroid was the bomb
hunters
corruption
prime
echoes
i just got bored
and now heres hunters i played it and got the same feeling
but im going to keep the game just because its metroid and i like metroid and i dont ever want to change the fact that every game system i have absolutely has to have a metroid game in it
so i still make an acception
i just hope that samus returns to  sidescrolling and this thirdperson stuff ends
or
both both would be fine too
because people who like her in sidescrollers can enjoy her there meanwhile the thirdperson fans can enjoy her as well in thirdperson
it wasnt a horrible experience though michel jacksons moonwalker was
no game could ever be that bad everokay okay its just how i look at it sure
the monsters were more vicious sounding in the older games looked more nastier meaner full of hate prime they looked like shiny forms of graphics
computergenerated animation
well of course
its just so darn noticeable though
thats it
thats what bugs me older games and even the ones on game boy advance were animated for a comic book feel
with that i was actually hooked
thats what i miss that old comic book feeling while i visualize the game itself as a sidescroller
metroid fusion had it
hunters doesnt
well people will argue with me im just waiting for the comments
not welcomingly but i know there coming
hard core fans of hunters would definitely bark at me for this one
hey its just how i feel i cant help it
i just miss the old days is all you know what i meanfrom personal experience this is an awful game
but im aware a large number of people gave it five stars so im forced to conclude that they either have some type of superhuman ability to cope with the funky controls or theyre masochistsi waited literally years to play this game
the promotional videos looked incredible and the prospect of encountering and controlling other bounty hunters was enough to make my mouth water
i bought the very first metroid prime back for the game cube a game which was hard but good
metroid prime hunters might have been good if they had bothered to release it for the wii a console which is several orders of magnitude more suitable for this style of gamethe controls kill this game
a game should be difficult because of the challenge inherent within the game not because of the challenge of using the controls
it has four control schemes that i am aware of and none of them worked for me
two of them are lefthanded
it boggles my mind why they didnt design one of the control schemes to switch the fire and jump functions
tapping to fire just seems much more practical than tapping to jump albeit at the cost of rapid fire but they really should have taken all the limitations of the ds into account before they put this game into production
whats worse they removed the lockon feature which is present in every single other metroid prime game i have played
did they honestly think the touch screen aiming was enough to offset the loss
this leaves me to decide between two control schemes one where aiming is slow and fickle and the other where i move like i have an inner ear infection
plain and simply put there was no way of establishing a reasonable facsimile of the metroid prime controls on the ds handheld and it should not have been attempted on any game they wanted to actually sellill confess i only made it to the second boss and it was only because the game itself seems to realize how awkward its control scheme is
the first boss was very forgiving and i managed to defeat him with mostly just determination and patience
the second boss however slowly whittled down my hp with a near constant sweep of lasers
i tried fickleaim control the first few times and couldnt deal damage fast enough to wipe out the boss
i then used innerearinfection and did a little better damage but had trouble dodging the lasers
mind you these are slow lasers
dying to them was humiliating but couldnt be helpedthis is a game that really should have been the first wii tiein to the the metroid prime series
nintendo has a weird habit of incorporating whatever new gimmick their latest system advertises regardless of whether or not it works for the title or the game mechanics
but the wiis manual point and shoot is a far more intuitive approach to first person shooters and im surprised its not implemented more frequentlymaybe youd be fine if you had the manual dexterity of a neurosurgeon and the reflexes of a fighter pilot but us normal human beings have to rely on the patience of a saint and the tenacity of a badgerthis is one of those few rare games that i completely regret buyingfirst of all the game doesnt really feel like a metroid gamethe single player game doesnt really have much excitement or exploration
you go forward you kill the same handful of enemies sometimes with a different color and you move on
most xs have a more stimulating plotline than this gameits pretty obvious that the multiplayer is supposed to be where its at in this game
unfortunately its fairly unrobust
you get to choose between a wide variety of different hunters and by wide variety i mean about  that are worthwhile
the maps are shoddy and poorly designed and with little variety between themnow all of that might be forgiveable if the game was at least fun to play
unfortunately this game has what could possibly be thought of as the worst control scheme ever invented by a man
you use the stylus similar to how you might use a mouse in a traditional pc fps
unfortunately youve got about an inch and a half area on the screen to move the stylus before you start bumping into other buttons and randomly changing weaponsswitching into alternate form
i have yet to discover a way of handling this game that doesnt result in wrist or finger pain after about  minutes of use but fortunately i rarely play that long before i turn it off in disgusti cant really think of very many merits this game has
its boring poorly designed unbalanced for multiplayer and has a number of level design glitches as well
its unfun to downright painful to play
i guess it has fairly good graphics for the ds but thats really about iti loved the game when i was  years old
then i loaned it to my autistic brother  yrs old and it seemed like a good ideai thought that making freinds with animals could really help his social skills and he really liked the wii version
however hedid not know how to save on my dsi so he just cut it off
every time you reset the game a mole named resetti comes outto lecture you
i never really cared much about what he made me do but he made my autistic brother type ini am a loser
his therapy instructor is currently working to teach him not to say things like that and then one of nintendosstupid characters forced him to type negative stuff in
this game could have been a major step for him and me but now im getting my copy backand here is what i thought of the gameif you decide to purchase this for a more selfconfident child or yourself this is the worst installment of the animal crossing franchise
the whole point of animal crossing on the gamecube was for your family to interact together in a virtual town which can be pretty neat
that dosent work out on the ds because it is a personal system the gamecube was a family system
nintendo also tried using wireless connections for multiplayer but that does not work out either
local play makes me wonder what nintendo thought about how many ds systems each family was going to have
even that is not the social level the gamecube  wii provided
then wifi the same thing as local play only over the internet
friend codes you work hard to get a friends randomly made number then you will never know when they are online
years later you upgrade from a ds lite to a dsi which requires a completly new friend code
then you upgrade to a ds  months later new code your friends ds lite breaks new code for him
of course if you are really desperate you can always share a game card with your family but then you have to share a house
in the gamecube version they gave you a little square with  houses one for each player
in the wii version they spread the  houses across the town so you dont have to look at your sisters ugly roof
but on a nintendo ds you share a house
my brother and i barley get along in city folk on the wii so we really cant get along in  house
our houses in the wii look completly different
my brother enjoyed putting fish because he loves fish in his house with a nice gentle song playing
my house is filled with bit mario pieces because i love mario and gold sofas with a rock tune playing
it would be kind of hard to combine fish with a bunch of mario items and have room to spare
if you prefer to play animal crossing alone i dont blame you youll have lots of other problems
the animals ai is really annoying
they walk around walk some more and then say the same thing over and over
i was able to talk to nibbles and then hear sally say the same thing nibbles said  minutes earlier
it really gets annoying because most of the animals are either jerks or poets
as mentioned earlier the mean nieghbors were the main reason i stopped letting my brothers play
the rest are pretty much poets
i love poetry but not in a nintendo game
one example is that they use big words to describe the weather when they could say i wish it would stop raining
after having a conversation you heard within the week from somebody else you would expect your nieghbor to do something else besides use complex metaphors and talk about dieting for crying outloud this is a childrens game
why would a child care about diet custard
 but they dont
in the gamecube version you could do chores for the animals and they occasionally built igloos and went camping
in this version all that they do on a normal basis is walk around
and forgot nes games i know that is something that some people bought the game for
no classics in this version though not even super tortimeroverall this game is weak compared to the versions on gamecube and wii
the mole is an insulting monster who made my autisic brother type in negative things about himself
the gamecube resetti was much more amusing and less severe
the ds resetti made me want to smash the game when my brother told me what happened
i am a huge animal crossing fan but keep newer and younger fans away from thiswow this game is bad and i mean bad
the graphics are decent   the pc king kong graphics are far better
at first it seems like the game may be going somewhere because the script seems pretty cool but you quickly find out the shooting is very boring if you want a good ps shooting game try timesplitters future perfect
nonetheless i was determined to give this game a fair shottoo bad it wouldnt let me
i kept going forward and got literally stuck by an invisible wall glitch
the woman said follow me
and so i did and i couldnt go any further through the invisible wall
oh no
my terribly subpar gaming experience was ruined by a bug
oh well
king kong for the ps is a terrible game with or without gameruining bugsthe pc version is another story
its a lot more involving and has far superior graphicsi could not play this game for even  minutes
the graphics gave me motion sickness and i had to lay down for  minutes
this has never happened to me before with any other gameplaying this was the worst time in my life as a gamer i got a little stupid for playing this dumb lame as ass game an dont plan to buy or play another ghost recon game save your money an brain cells on this gameits up to youat first this is a really fun game but my big problem with it is its way too easy
even on the hard settings i had no problem
after you unlock everything it gets very boring and i dont play it now
it would be really good if it had a really hard level or more tracks to race on
it was fun while it lasted but its just not challenging enoughmario kart ds has got to be the most overrated game on the ds
it feels like it keeps the classic mario kart gameplay but very downgraded
most of the tracks you race on about  are very boring and uninspired
these are probably the worst tracks ive ever seen on mario kart
the items arent that great either which makes the overall gameplay suck
the graphics really stink too theyre very blocky even for d ds graphics but thats not a real problem i shouldnt make a big deal over graphics
my biggest complaint about this game is its replay value
when i first got mario kart ds i was bored after playing it for about  minutes
its the only mario kart i didnt want to play for at least a week
also all the extra things in the game minigames or whatever youd call them are less entertaining than the already lousy gameplay
mario kart ds overall is terrible but i recommend playing any other mario kart game besides this one that you can get your hands on
every other mario kart besides mario kart ds is worth buying
i would rate mario kart ds only  out of  points due to its poorquality gameplay replay value and graphicsthis is a compilation of some of the best most frustrating arcade games ever released
i bought this collection for galaga  alone
i couldnt wait to finally continue through until the end of that game as i remember feeding the arcade machines back in the day
then i actually played these wonderful games and i was extremely disappointedthere is no uberfast mode on the pacman games
but i wasnt really expecting one
nothe biggest gripe and what really ruins this effort is you cant continue any of the games
there is no option to insert another coin and keep playing
that means unless you are a gaming god youll only ever see about  of the total content programmed into this collection because game over is finalit just isnt fun for me to play the first level ten million times hoping to someday make it to level  much less level   a cheat device might get around this but i dont have one of these for the playstation  and i doubt most people reading this review will eitherid recommend you purchasetaito legends for playstation two as it has more games and allows continues
i heard the pc version of this allows continues but i dont think ill buy the same product twicecharger weighs about  ounces which is mostly plastic with a tiny little cable
arrived doa
quality is worse that a paper airplane
do not buy this junki did everything right but still didnt work
it might work for you but it didnt work for me
maybe im cursed by playing dr jekyll and mr hydejust didnt workfollowed the directions and it just didnt workoddly enough i cleaned games with alcohol as the directions suggestedthen put the old pin back in after the frustration and the games then worked with the old pinapparently it was dirty games and not a bad pinbut the one i ordered didnt workarrived did not work the plastic holder came bent likely due to being shipped in an bubble envelope so it was unable to properly connect to my nes board to be able to play any games
i bought one from my local game store and now my nes worksafter seeing so many good reviews on how this would work i decided to give it a shot too
unfortunately it did absolutely nothing for my nes
the blinky light is still there and i still cant play most of my games
i guess i will have to look into getting another bit system instead of trying to fix the old nesthis game is pathetic
i am a huge wrestling fan and ive played every thq wwe game
this is one of the worst and its obvious the other people who wrote reviews have never played the wwe smackdown gamesfirst off the game play in dor is complete garbage just like the firstsecond they did nothing to make this game better than the first day of reckoning
hardly any changesthe caw feature was the only good thing about the first dor
the caw feature in dor is not as good as the firstwwe should drop thq
sure they can make a great fighting style for the smackdown games on ps but they cant make a good caw on the smackdown games for ps
then they can make a good caw for the gamecube and the xbox  but they cant make a good fighting syle for the gamecube and xboxwhat is wrong with thqplease help me boycot any thq games until they get a wrestling game righti love the evil dead movies i love bruce campbell as an actor but please quit making crappy evil dead games
im not sure what game the other reviewers are playing but this one is utter crap
there are limited saves so you play the same are over and over and over
you do the same moves over and over and over
and the game is greedy when it comes to giving you extra life
i guess i shoudl add that it is not greedy all of the time
it seems in the areas that you do not need health there it isbut when you are next to dead there is none to be seen
i would at most rent this but why not just play halo  online and not waste money on crappy games based on good movieswe love katamari came highly recommended to me as a cute game with a good person mode
after playing it with my daughter and husband we really cannot understand why people like this gameit opens with a really long slow boring monolog from the king written not spoke that goes on forever and then some
when you finally get past that there is another really long boring monolog before you can do the training session
yawn
the training mode has you roll around gathering up larger  larger items and demonstrates the game
after wandering aimlessly for a long time around a nonintutive unlabeled picture screen you eventually luck upon the one icon that starts the gamethe person mode is kind of cute for about  or maybe  minutes
roll around gathering small items and then gradually larger items
there is a strict time limit that stops you from getting your garbage ball too big
this short time limit was really annoying
then there is more slow boring cant skip dialog and pictures while you score and another delay before you can play again
throughout the music is chinese and has chinese singing  my daughter thought this the best aspect of the game
the graphics are primitive see the games cover picture for a good examplethe person mode is really stupid
two people try to push the same ball
neither one has a sense that they are really in control and it ends up being pretty frustrating and dull even with adults who work well together
our conclusion after trying the person mode was that it was entirely worthlessif you want an excellent person playstation  game trythe adventures of cookie  creaminsteadurban reign is a beatemup fighting game for the ps
you fight several gangs to gain territory and advance the storyline
the graphics are really good character models look good level environment can be damaged and great looking fighting movesactually the fighting moves are the best part of the game
using a combination of fighting styles that range from boxing karate and wrestling you can do the regular punch kicks jump kicks grabs and body slams
you acquire more moves as you progress through the game and also increase your skill stats
your skill stats consists of your punching kicking grapple and defensive powers by increasing your stats your character becomes much more stronger though this happens over the long haul
i was impressed with some of the fighting animations as your character can do flips jump in the air and kick multiple enemies at once and you can throw them into objects like cars trash cans and the walls
a lot of the fighting reminded me of the many jackie chan movies with clever fighting techniques and they were just as fun to watch in motion within urban reign
i also like the fact that the game is very long and contains  levels as apposed to just  levels like many other fighting games
urban reign sounds great right
so where did it go wrongthe disaster begins with the unresponsive controls youll be button mashing like crazy and become irrate when the character executes moves slowly
many times youll want to beat up your enemies in a certain way while they are in a daze to be hindered by your characters sluggish response
many of the missions have a short time limit which will frustrate you even more
although you can increase your characters stat skills and make him stronger the cpu enemies will always be stronger
aside from that you can be pushed into a corner and get pounded continuously with cheap shots from the cpu
other than the fighting nothing much else is taking place inside the levels which gives it a empty feeling and the city overall seems abandoned and dead
the difficulty level will also tick off a lot of players as it just increases from normal to super hard in a short time
the worst thing about urban reign is the terrible defensive blocking system which they call deflecting
you have to press the block button at the right moment to deflect the cpus attacks if you press it at the wrong time you will receive the punchkick
while so many fighting games allow you to just hold the block button this game does not
the story mode can only be played by one player so you cannot play with a friend
the challange mode unlockable can be played coop but it would have been better and more fun if the story mode could be played this way
if you want a better fighting game look elsewhere because this is not itproscool fighting techniques levelsconsterrible blocking systemsluggish controlsdumb storyone player in story modetons of cheap shots by cpuyou can be corneredunbalanced difficultythis game took hours to download
installation was very slow too
whenever you are in part of this game where there is dialogue which is almost constant you cannot access the menu or exit by any way
you are just stuck listening to lame conversations which you are forced to take part in
played this for about  minutes and found very little to actually do but navigate around the train
this was our first and last nancy drew
boringthis is a terrible game
i got mine for pc
it would be a great game if the save and load options werent so messed up
i dont know who thought of this technique but it sucksyou save your game to save your progress but somehow when you go to load that game it autosaves the game before it loads the saved game and youre in a much earlier part of the game than when you saved it
autosaves are not abled to be disabled so you have to deal with it and waste a lot of time doing things over and over and over again
its frustrating to the point where its not fun to play anymore
i hate having to do something ive already did over and over again
its a big waste of time and they should really make a patch for the terrible autosaves saves and loads
it totally ruins the gamealso when i got the game it had no product key so i had to call microsoft to get one
then i had trouble getting the stupid game to install
it took the game an hour and a half to install
i have a powerful gaming computer and have no problems with installing other games but this one kept freezing while stallingi finally get it installed but as written above ive wasted a lot of time thinking i had saved a game up to a point only to load it and find it didnt save because the automatic autosave somehow messed my save up
and when you depend on the autosave and load the last one it suddenly doesnt load the last time you remember it autosaving
im totally baffled by thisalso the voice over is so annoying
when you get low in life a voice keeps nagging the heck out of you telling you that your health is low
yes
i heard you the first time thank you
also it keeps repeating that theres a new quest for you and wont leave you alone
and you have to go all the way back to the guild building to receive the quest
its not like you conveniently get them as youre progressing through the game at the place youre at
so the voice over just keeps repeating over and over again that the guy has a new quest for you
and sometimes you take the time to go all the way back and you ask for the quest but theres no new ones there
but the voice over was way too annoying i had to turn off the sound it became so distractingyou also have to get these little green orbs when you kill something to get experience points and its a real pain trying to fight  different people and collect orbs at the same time
you can shift them to make them come to you but its kind of hard to do while youre trying to fight  other enemies who are trying to kill youi dont get the good versus evil thing either
i kept getting evil points and i couldnt understand whythe combat system is a little confusing as are the controls
most normal games allow you to click or space an action like opening a door or talking to someone well all other games so far have used that method
with this game you need to use the tab key and you use the space bar to zero in on an enemy youre going to attack
the controls are poor for pc use
i didnt like them
if i decide to play again i do have the option of changing the command keys so ill try that to see if it gets any betteri wouldnt recommend this game
a lot of others seem to be praising it but ive played a lot of games and i am pretty easy going with things but this game was too poorly made to really enjoy
especially the savesthe graphics were okay but rather child likethis adapter is generic
it was made in china and can be used for the snes nes and genesisthe output is v unlike the v put out by the official snes adapterthis game might have been good for its time just as ff before ithowever i feel that this game lacks everything that made the ff series so famousfun
i had more trouble trying to figure out how to modify the graphic preferances and how to navigate my character than actually trying to figure out how to play the stupid game
and come on nowmost fo the characters in the game look just outright retardedbut hey if you want a good game then play world of warcraft or elder scrolls square proved that they didnt learn anything from the streak of horrible final fantasy sequels that came after final fantasy   final fantasy  attempts to give you an online multiplayer experience and succeeds in giving you the most irratating experience of your lifein this game you begin having to kill random little things outside of town in order to gain enough experience to have any kind of adventure for your  bucks
the adventures consist of hours of walking lame morrowind esque fights and people saying take this to some guy in some area you never heard ofoften a set of options will pop up when you had no intention of bringing those options up and those options interrupt whatever else you were doing at the time
options like chat and inventory that are brought up even though when wanting to manage either options you could do something completely different
simply typing anything on the keyboard allows you to chat bringing up the menu allows you to view your inventorypay  bucks to run around a bland wilderness and look at everything else in the world you could have spent the  bucks onanother thing i live in an armed forces pacific address
the morons at square didnt include this so i had to lie about my billing address in order to register
why they even bother asking for a billing address to register with them when you can just lie about it and register anyway is beyond mesquare can now be ranked with other horrible video game companies like eidos and the adventure companyits nice to see that people are trying to teach the word of god to kids but this is an unbelievably awful way to do it
long ago i went to a friends house i played it and it was complete crap
there was virtually nothing good to speak
all it does is ooze unimaginable tortures that only feel like you are being punished by god for some sin youve committed
being repenting immediately youre going to need itwhat the game is it is a game show game
you pick a character and you play a triviaminigame show called do unto others and you suffer for every minute wait no every second of this game show hell abomination
you play crappy minigames answer difficult old testament questions over  in total lord please end my misery you will despise the host of the show and be extremely bored all at the same time yay
graphics these textures are awful and the graphics just look bad for a ps game from  and why the hell do all the characters look like theyve been injected with freaking botox
all they do is smile and its really creepymusic this is one of this games only saving graces
the songs from christian bands are actually decent and arent bad to listen tosound you will wish chuck norris would appear on the screen and kill this host
seriously hes the kind of character you want to take out back and shootgameplay the controls dont work all that well and really hamper the minigames and makes them even more torturous to play
answering questions does not require any precision to control you just choose one answer
the only moment of joy you will ever get out of this sack of s game is when one of your opponents gets wrath of god and loses all their points and you will probably laugh at them like ha ha you lost all your points dumbass but then get enraged when you lose all your points dammit
what the f
overall heres what you do
if you have an old xbox go buy the game show game whacked in which you kill your opponents to win and enjoy the experience
there is nothing good to be had from this piece of crap and there are much better games to invest in on the playstation  than this
if you want to teach your kids good christian values take them to church get them involved in youth groups etc
got that
dont ever buy this game for your kids dont ever
run away and never look back at this game
it has no place in being on this planet other than feeling like a game that has come to start to apocalypse and end life as we know it
in fact satan will probably laugh at you for buying this game to know youre being tortured by it
it doesnt even deserve to be in a bargain bin it should only be thrown in a trash can or used as a frisbee or drink coaster
whatever you wish to use it for do so just dont play itthe good decent christian band music opponents getting wrath of godthe bad crappy gameplay difficult trivia questions bad graphics annoying host one of the worst ps games the game show is twenty minutes it is extremely boringvery disappointed with this game
thq seemed to have rush this game to market way too quickly in my opinionpros a new army  ig a bit more streamlined upgrade tree two new campaignscons only one new army yet full price
ridiculous game balance is really messed up now difficulty levels in skirmish have an enormous gap between easy and standard somehow your ally ai is dumb as a rock wasting resources on buildings when having no units to defend himself not backing you up stealing your resources while the opposing ais are smart cookies always gang up to rush one of you all ig is just cadians
their colors look like crap ig has no antitank until you get sentinels
meanwhile you are sol annoying guardsmen voices
they are not all juveniles you know marines can build just one landraider
 stationary defences seem significantly reduced in effectiveness
without meaningful fortifications the game becomes a grunt rush festival and armies like ig wont survive in a skirmish the marines get a hero unit that cannot join other units
 only six missions for each of two sides no meaningful learning curve on the new missions at all
just a jumble of units and mission objectives that often are completely cryptic as to ways of implementation
i often found myself wondering what the hell does this mean and how the hell am i to implement it in terms of the game
 automatic routing is horrendous
units just sit there wondering how to get where you told them to go
why the hell is this so difficult to do right on some of the new maps you can actually box yourself in by your own buildings
once you do there is no visible way to demolish your own structures to get outa big disappointment
after finishing the new campaigns i find myself playing the original far more often than the expansion
relic should be ashamed
instead of becoming the new blizzard they have decided to cash out by offering inferior products at the lure of an excellent first work
the same thing happened with  east
guess what i have not bought a single  east product after they went down that roadi know that im a bit older and somewhat new to gaming but this was not at all what i thought it would be
i got it loaded just fine ran through the tutorial and began
how dull
i couldnt see enough of the field to make things happen and i grew very tired of the lame responses when i gave an order
i did learn what i didnt like and wont be ordering any other games like this in the future
experience is a great teacherok  i love love love this book and the british movies et al
so i think  cool  i can play a game that will have some of the same suspense as the bookmovie
while this is true  the graphics are good and the overall look of the game is nice  the game play is horrible
once i figured out all the characters are exactly the same as the book and the plot is exactly the same i got a sinking feeling in my stomach about the  i had just spentgood things  some of the puzzles take a little bit of thought to figure them out
 pretty pictures and engaging play keeps you interestedbad things  game is very linear
there is no veering from the track that is set for you
there are several places where you have to solve certain puzzles before you are allowed to go on
however it is often hard to know if you are done investigating or not
 you have to play through the whole game even if you figure out the killer halfway through
grrr
 some of the puzzles are infantile in simplicity and some are so hard that there is no way to solve wo downloading the cheat
this seriously detracts from the game play
 if you know the book you know the plot who did it and how its solved
this fact makes the game play simply a job to get to the endi really wanted to like this game but its hard
 of the game play is just dull plugging and chugging and searching for clues or solving easy puzzles while the other  is impossible  not a great combo
while i freely admit that you cant expect a game based upon a book to have a plot thats some big surprise its basically the dos hitchhikers guide to the galaxy game with fancy graphics  exact same linearity and game styleunless you have never ever read this bookseen the movie or want to really hope for the best that spending hours in front of the computer doing monotenous searching will give you that special thrill look somewhere else
just like murder on the orient express the game makers took a wonderful premise jazzed it up with great graphics and then proceeded to torpedo the entire gameplay experience
not a good combinationi tried hard to like this game but its just too boring
the worse thing for me is the dialogue and voice acting
i could put up with the poor character graphics if the characters at least had some interesting things to say
there are very few puzzles
the action consists mainly of picking up a lot of items and using them in ridiculous nonintuitive ways
a real disappointment
save your moneyafter all the hype i purchased this game for my new psp
i must say this is the worst game i have ever purchasedever
there is no storyin fact theres nothing resembling any kind of direction or clue as to what you have to do save for a small vague blurb at each mission
furthermore when playing a mission you spend  of the time just figuring out what youre supposed to accomplish
you die way too easily which makes this game frustrating from the start
if you complete all the missions you get nothingabsolutely nothing
finally the play control is painfully awful
this is a game that should never have come to the psp since its completely vital to use either two analog sticks or a keyboard and mousedont waste your time and money on this whether its just the game or the psp bundle
this stinksgreat game and everything ive come to expect from a good rtswith one problem
everytime youre attacked off screen a trumpet call sounds
it almost sounds like youre getting a text message
well this game is basically one big battle so the trumpet call goes off about once every five or six seconds on average
now imagine a level that takes you forty minutes to complete
the entire time youre playing its playing what sounds like the first four notes of the ffvii victory tune
bah bah bah bahbah bah bah bahbah bah bah bahsir we need re enforcements onbah bah bah bahthe main gatebah bah bah bahbah bah bah bahbah bah bah bahget those archers onbah bah bah bahthose tower units  bah bah bah bah
i uninstalled the game after about ten minutes because theres no way to turn this feature off unless you turn off all soundis it too much to ask that a sequel be better than the games that came before ithere is my theory the game designers wanted to create a game that was more multiplayer friendly
therefore they took the old version and stripped it down
less units less technology fewer buildings etc
heck i think the maps are even smallerwhat they created was aoe for idiots
in fact the game is so simplified that you really dont even need half of the advances they give you
just collect resources build a big army and go smash someone
thats itwarning bugware alertafter paying my  for this game i loaded the three cds required rebooted my computer expecting to play all night longmuch to my surprise id launch the icon to start the game and it would give me an error and exit as it got to the main menu  each and every time
i made  attempts still nothing
my computer is a model hp pavillion with fast pentium  and  gb ram
definitely should be able to handle this gamebeing resourceful i found the technical support site
i wasnt too shocked to find a significant number of people who also had this problem too
and the publisher does not have any answers for them  certainly not when or if it will be fixed
they already have your money and arent giving it back
im still awaiting my answer too
and im still out my  plus tax and shippingwarning  buy at your own peril
you wont get a refund
these people need to be held accountablegraphic is not that great even compare to ron almost no units variation
units variation is very important for rts gameonly to imprerial age information is not clear
for example hit point of units and building boring home city system
this is rts game my friend not another card board gamei list it on ebay after  hour i installed this gamehow was city of villains designed
start by loading up the city of heroes game engine then begin the long and tedious creative process change the word rescue to kidnap change the word retrieve to steal change the word hero to villain release an overpriced collectors edition and a soontobe bargain bin standard version count your money and laugh laugh laughwhat you the player do in this game doesnt count as villainy in any way shape or formas with most mmorpgs you will spend the vast amount of your time on the leveling treadmill
but what is it that your villain will fight
why gangsters trolls evil snakemen and renegade heroes turned baddies
the same thing you would fight if you were a heroin city of heroes civilians cower in the streets at the hands of thugs and thank you for rescuing them
in city of villains the thugs chase you down in the street and the civilians walk by you without so much as a whisper of terror
civilians are invulnerable so you wont be robbing them or beating them up nor will they tremble at the mention of your name
meanwhile the street thugs see you as just another costume to be chased down regardless of how quickly you will dispatch them or your supposed lack of moralsyou might say hey this game is rated teen its not meant to show the real side of criminality and violence
to which i respond exactly
this game has no point
its a poorly conceived huge waste of time
this game is basically a pvp patch that masquerades as a totally new game
regardless of the claims to the contrary it does not standalone  it is the shadow of city of heroes and thus it is devoid of substance and depthi played it once and it was great but it didnt want to minimize so i could work on other things
i had to quit and save to work on other things
when i went to play again the next day it kept saying i have to relaunch
after four days of that i gave up and chucked it
i must say though that the delivery was amazingly fast four days for delivering to taiwan
no problem with the seller just the producti usually read reviews before buying something on amazon and this was no exceptioni generally dont pay a lot of attention to reviewers who complain about software crashes and incompatibility issues because i realize there are a lot of computer users who dont bother or know how to update the game with patches and updates that are usually available onlinein this case the reviews about not working on a newer mac are completely accurate
i have a  inch macbookpro with intel processor running os  and even with every patch and update available the game is very unreliable
it crashed frequently and thankfully early enough in the game that i had not spent too much time starting to build a citytoo bad  i have played sim city games in the past and really enjoyed the series
i will not be ordering another game like this for my mac again any time soon unless its a newer release that has proper support from the manufactureri dont think this was a vary good game at alli saw it on the shelf at toys r us and thought it whould be a fun game for my  year oldwean i got home he beat it in about  minuits i whatched him play it thare wasent that much to do in it expect bulid a rocket avoid swiper drive a car and fly to the purple planetafter the game my son was vary upset so we went back after lunch and we saw a game called sonic the hedgehog it was alot more callengeing for him and it didnt take about  minuits to load like the other one did we also got are  back wean we returend itwe have had to other dora games that wernt so good ether i think that nickjr jest wants your money on these sort games that get you so upseti think you should choose something else besides thisthis game only plays on my ps even though it is a ps game
i tired contacting seller and they wont respond
i suggest statying away from seller coleman biblioand game
i own two other dora games that work great
better grapihcs game play and they work on my ps
bad buyfun at first but freezes at the worst time and just before you save after complete a chunck of the game very annoying
ds sucks anyway
get pspcheck out the review on ign
the cars have zero texture and the steering is clunky at best
a total travesty
plus it is from the makers or marvel nemisis which is said to be just as bad
the sad thing is that the first nfs game on the ds was not half bad and had ea just tried to enhance that version they may have had a hit
instead they switch studios and the result is far inferior to the earlier game
shame on eathe need for speed series is not good for the ds
ill start by saying graphics are horrible
the races are very slow even though the screen says you are going  mph
there are only about  upgrades for your car and  for extirior looks
your car handles horrible making it impossible to win any races
also this game is not compatible with the touch screen
 stari agree with everyone who says the game is terrible i bought this game for my pc installed it played it for only about  minutes unistalled it and then put it away some where in my closet
the roster of national teams is awfull
if you want a awesome game save your money and get fifa world cup germany  im really hooked on iti am still playing the game but with this addon now during game play i can expect my pc to crash more extreme lag and my personel favorite being kick off a server after joining a battle for  secs into the game for any reason though not the correct onethe game is overprice and the tech support is horrible they ignore you
to only way to get the bugs fix is to speak to a game guro who know how to tinker with the source codeto download a  gig file in order to get the game to work is ridculousbest game out there
valve has outdone there self againprosgreat graphicsgreat musicgreat weapen controlsconstheres lots of glitches if you dont do something right then you have to reload your game so you may want to save alotit takes a lllloooooonnnnggg time to load and the scanning steam game updates stops you from playing the game for about an hour then another hour to load the updateyou run out of ammo fastif your a hard core gammer and like fps games this is the besthalf life  was a good game and very challeging at times
this game is good too and you have to find the right way to get to the next level
bad news now
the graphics require a very high graphics card and memory
now the worst is that i just wanted to play a single game and after i installed the game i still had to down load more crap and the whole game again and register to play a game i paid for
now i am down loading counter strike in which i already installed
it takes me over an hour just to start to play a game herei am now going to look for notices that say that i must register and down load the games that i have the disc for
steam will not have me as a customer if they keep this upi would not buy another game like this onei bought half life  after it had been recomended by countless other gamers
what i found was not a game but an exercise in frustrationfirst thing you notice when you open the box is that theres no manual or documentation of any kind
none
but that is not the worst of it
in order to play half life  you must first intsall valves own online program called steam
the only indication that i got that i had to install steam and agree to their user agreement was on the specs sticker at the bottom of the box
nowhere else on the box does it say that you have to install steam on the package
and even that was a little ambiguous to say the least
every time you want to play hl you have to sign into and connect to valves online network even if you want to play the single player game
whats worse is that steam drops a running process on to your msconfig startup list and there is no way to turn it off
allegedly theres an offline mode but even after selecting it in the options menu it still i still couldnt turn off the steam process
in essecnce even though you pay for the game you dont actually own it
if you try to uninstall steam the game will not boot up
after finding this out i pretty much gave up on the game completely since it was opened i couldnt return it and i had to eat the cost of the gameso in a nutshell half life  was pretty much ruined by the installation of valves little monster called steam
if you really want to play this game get it for a console that way you cut steam completely out of the picture
but after this experience i dont think i can in good conscience recomend any valve products in the futurebad experience loading the game
fire walls stopped installation
deleted same and gave away
would not recomendthis shouldnt have been sold online the games id was already used by its previous owner rendering this game unplayable by anyone elsethis version has steam if you buy it in only a few years steam will be gone and your game is toast
since it has to connect to the internet to make sure your the only copy using that code
you can only play a few offline games befour it askes you to connect
but it has to connect at least once to get the real cd key
the real key is stored at steam
you do not own this game when you buy it
your just renting it
alot of companys have done this in the past and when they go out of busniss you just have another coster
do not buy there are version of this game that have no steam
im so stupid for buying this copy
half life  is the same
buy that on xbox and you will not have to deal with steamfire emblem is too hyped
ive played other tactics games but fire emblem is the worst of the crop
dont know why people think that a game that you can lose you character at anytime of the game forever is fun
there is no levelling up that you can control in the game you have to go with the story flow but your enemies outgrow you in immense pace so your character will be eliminated in no time and having that annoying face showing up on the screen telling you he  she is dead
even when you character levelled up  the stats is so random that sometimes he  she just levelled up but with no improvement in stats at all
since most of the time they only level up inside the game if their stats dont go up tough they are doomed on the battle field
the number of enemies you usually have out grow you so much that they can basically kill your characters in one or two hits
if you dont want to lose your character time to reset and do the battle all over again
i have no idea why people find this kind of game fun and challenging
disgaea and ff tactics are fun because you grow with the characters
they can die but you can revive them so you wont be losing your hard work
but in fire emblem dying forever is just as easy as drinking water
that sucks manalso i could not believe that even up to now nintendo is still forcing people to read all the long winding dialogue instead of having actual cut scenes
the limited cut scenes in the game are pretty budget in terms of graphicsi personally think fire emblem doesnt deserve the fame and hype around the franchise
if you are a gamer who enjoy hating a game to make your life meaningful this is the type of game you should playthis version has a way different feel to the computer version but i bought it a long time ago when my computer didnt have the juice for the game
overall it was very boring plainly because there was nothing to do
i did find it fun in its own way before the data corrupted and i lost it alli really liked the origional sims for ps
but this one was terrible
i played it for a very short time and stuck it on my game shelf and now its probibly covered with dust
you can only do one thing at a time and i hate how people just move in with you for no reason at all
yes the graphics are better than the sims  for the ps and it is actually fun to create your people but still this game is just plain terrible
i also hate this weird socialization zone that you get into
i highly recomend not to touch this game
badthe sims  is an incredible game
the pc version that isbut the playstation  version
guess what
this is not the simsno matter what the title may be this is an unbelievable farcelet me tell you this for a fact sims  on ps is complete rubbish
there have been plenty of products that i have ridiculed on amazon but i have always been aware that they are only my opinions and everyone has different tastesbut i want anyone who is considering this game to know that what i am telling you about it is not an opinionit is a straight factthis game is a word amazon will probably block that starts with c and ends with p and has  lettersit is nothing like the real sims  and it is less interesting than any other sims game everthe create a sim area involves a few small drawings of tops skirts and pantsapparently you can be a fashion designeroh sure long sleeves or short sleevescollar up or collar downhow excitingthe body and face maker is lesser than even the first sims you wont be able to see what you are doing anyway and no matter how you morph them they stay looking the sameplus they dont even look realthey are uglystory modeforget it
how fun it is to fulfill your sims needs that include take a shower
not
all while your ridiculous looking sim runs around like a lunatic as the useless creation that it isfree play modewhat the hell
the sims  is supposed to be about creating family treesthey can not even have children
there are about  familes but they arent really families there are no actual families and theres space for you to create two more lots of roommatesthe build mode looked like a migrainne while the buy mode was absolutely pathetic with teensy childlike drawingsvery few toothsi game is expensive but reeks of amateurishness
you will have more fun with a  dollar toy
and please note that this review is coming from an extreme sims fanmaxis needs to aplogize to anyone who waited for the sims  to come to console and anyone who spent money for or recieved this ghastly piece of cow dungi have really really liked the maxis gang for a while very grateful for what they have done with the original sims but now maxis you owe us
big time
to start with can i have my money backit baffles me why they have made such an honestly horrible gamedo not buy itif you have been dying to play the sims  i suggest the computer gamei know it has steep system requirements but i managed to purchase a new computer and i dont have much moneyso it can be done if you want the real sims  as badly as i didthe computer game is truly fantastic but the console version is a nightmare created in the bowels of helli love the sims and i love playing them
but all of those versions was for my pc
i really thought i wouldnt have a problemespecially if its being released for the psp
this lowgrade but great graphics game really didnt go anywhere interestingwhich was funny because it was almost as if the sims creators just slopped this on and sold it as is
not to mention every major move or choice i made was a pause in the game with the offblack blank screen that said loading in the top corner
not even the original sims didnt do thatand i was playing with my old computer at the timethe psp is a great system that does not come cheap
you would think with all of the positive hype with the sims collection over the years and the psp that someone would actually take their time and preventing thisi hope they come out with the better version with the sims in the future if they want to be successful with the psp crowds
other than that im staying away until its changedthings have changed a lot for electronic arts since the mid s
they have turned from an upbeat company that released nothing but the highest quality games especially in sports into the biggest game company on the block  unfortunately with their quanitity over quality bend they have allowed many of their strongest franchises to go right down the drainfifa is a perfect example
fifa  really was just a treat to play whether you liked soccer or not just like the nhl franchise until   now theyre just bland bland  bland
we dont need  billion leagues or soccer season previews
we just want solid fun gameplay
the control has gotten so horrible in the name of realism that sometimes you feel you are watching the game rather than playing it
there really is no excuse for a  second delay between a button press  the corresponding action when the same franchise had instantanious precision controls a decade earlierea seems so dedicated to the dull lifeless pace of the game that they felt the need to severely penalize any upbeat defense as well
slide tackles are all but forbidden altogether even if you dont actually touch anyone
and though you can take a nice minutelong stroll into the fastpaced older fifa games you cant actually play themi sometimes wonder why i bother even renting the old standby franchises from ea sports
maybe deep down i hope that they will finally come to their senses and realize that good games arent about realism or about rendering sweat in real time just make games the fun arcadey experience they used to be
i would pay  just to have a basic roster update for fifa  or nhl  before i would pay  for a roster update of last years awful fifa gamewhen sid meiers pirates
came out in  it immediately became a classic it was the game of the year
the game had such a success that they did a powerful sequel in the early s called pirates gold buy unfortunately it had performance issues with graphics etc and had lots of bugs
now imagine a dedicated community of fans of the game waiting  years for a sequel of this masterpiece and when it comes out it looks like preteen game
the game is addictive and truly follows the spirit and nature of the original pirates however the cartoonish approach of the game obliterates any serious attempt to deliver a true pirate strategy adventure game
if you expect a serious pirate game you should not play this game because you will find the exact opposite because of its cartoonish and childish approachcounterstrike source itself is a great game
repeatedly starting a round over in the same map can get tiresome but for the most part the gameplay is enough to keep you going
in my rating the game itself deserves at least a  star rating
because you have to have the steam client to run it however the game is for me dragged down to a in my experience youll only be able to click on the counterstrike icon get it to load get it connected to a server and play about  of the time
the other  of the time well there are a variety of steam related problems
steam updates are the most frequent i think though they dont last too long it is annoying to be told when you can or cannot play a game that you bought fair and square
being disallowed from setting up your own server with bots because steam is not connected to the internet
steams tendency to remove the game from your my games list deny that you own it and have installed it then ask you to buy it again is more troubling
the fact that this has happened  times in the  months that i have owned the game is perhaps criminal
the customer support is useless waiting  weeks to respond to queries because there is nothing useful in the forumsthe kicker is that people who have stolen illegal copies of the game cracked not to need steam will be able to click the icon and play the game while youre looking for your installation discnot sure why this has happenedi bought a bogus copy s that i couldnt even installso i took it back and bought another copy the sameit seems that there was a missing file on the cdthere are six for the us version
now i not new to this series
i have and played x frontier and x and they both installed with no problem at all at the time
so im very frustrated to say the leasti havent played this because of this fact but i was wondering if anyone has had the same problem with the us version
egosofts web site offered very little explanation on why this was happening and a few others had posted the same issue i was having but i found that the advice they gave these people did not work for me such as copying the exe to the desk top and cleaning the disksthis has caused me to believe the integraty of such a publisher as egosoft was invalid and insuficiant on solving the problem overallim sure the game is good as was the last two but when you cant even install it how would i determin such a thingin my opinion the rootkitstarforce copy protection goes far beyond copy protection and flirts with being malicious software that is hidden on your computer when x is installed
just google rootkitstarforce and read a bit about what they are putting on your computerscomplete waist of money
patches only make it worse corrupted my system files causing a reinstall of winxp
constantly locks up your system requiring a forced reboot with chkdisc operations
this is equivilant to the sony disaster
dont buy this malware if you value your operating system
its a complete joke and ive was able to send it back to amazon as malware and defectivewhen youre as old as i am i guess you shouldnt expect much from any game
but when you pay upwards of  for the game and the shipping and handling you ought to get something that would keep you entertained
if thats what you think youd better buy another game
this game is as boring as the television shows it was aped after
boring not to mention extremely repetitive storylines and simply unbelievable outcomes in matches
this game might keep  year olds happy for about  minutesanyone expecting anything else will be sorely disappointedi would take a guess and say the only people that will give this game a high rating will be kids  or youngerif you have played doom  then you have already played quake i was wondering why this game slipped out onto store shelves and was released to retail without any great fanfare
now i know why
it is basically the new doom except the weapons have flashlights
i am not impressed at all
i beat this game on the hardest setting no problem
the enemies are not particularly clever just greater in number
talk about predictablethis game was that in spades
sadly you can finish this game in  hours or lessyuckquake  is built by the same team using the same graphics engine
i didnt like doom  much either but it was a great deal better than this
yes the graphics were average
i have a amd bit  an nvidia  mb gtx  sticks of corsair gb  ddr modules and a viewsonic  inch vpb monitor
and with all that power and with quake  video settings cranked up to the highest settingsit still was rough and mediocre looking
however the quake series was never known for its stunning graphics and beauty
mainly i felt there was nothing hard to accomplish or figure out
basically this game did not fill the st person shooter void within me
i am a huge fan of id software and have played every doom or quake title they ever released when they were originally released
yes i have been playing computer games since my old commodore  was delivered
this is just my opinion though
download a demo version and give it a whirl but i doubt you will want to pay  for itthat said i bet multiplayer on this will be a blast after some mods are created and released
i have hosted  different lan parties for this game and we yawned through it until we gave up and switched over to battlefield  or ut 
much better mp action
in summation enemy ai is lame graphics are weak a few cool factory scenes but no reason to go crazy for this title gameplay is predictable weapons are mediocre limited interactive environment nothing thrilling exciting or shocking that will keep your tension levels cranked up to halflife  battlefield  ut  gta san andreas even the older and outdated medal of honor and call of duty games will keep you stressed and excited better than quake save your moneyspend it on call of duty  which comes out this week anyway
fear
is already out prey is coming out soon
much better uses of la saga quake siempre a sido de las mejores y a pesar de ke fue saturada con la ra entrega esta ta entrega concluye la trama original ke se vio en quake  esta vez no estara uno solo sino ke la potente ai de los npc te ayudaran a sobrevivir y revelar la trama del juego hasta su final
con las mismas graficas ke relucieron en doom quake  se ve mejor aunok oki know what your thinking
you see all these  and  star ratings before my review and say this must be a flukeit isnt
there are many people that are die hard loyalists of this series
no matter how repetitive this game is they will always give it high marksat first i really thought this game was great
my first hour of play was exciting
then the old faults and linear problems popped up like in the first edition of codtrust me try playing fear
and you will see how lame and outdated this game model is
 is way too much to spend on this gamethe bad  very short play timei finished this game on the veteran setting in under  hours
i sincerely was not trying to beat the clock
i like to take my time and savor every moment of a game
i was hoping it would lastit didnt graphics are fairthe graphics engine is new in this sequel which is a blessing but you better have a fast cpu and vga card my friends to get quality visuals
there are moments in this game when the rain weather effects and large numbers of enemies are cranking out so hard on you that your processor or card will start to chug and vomit
sure you can solve this problem by turning down the settings but what is the point of a new graphics engine based game if you cant enjoy the beauty right
 linear gameplayonce againthe cod developers have proven themselves to be the kings of linearforced gameplay
what is linear gameplay
it means that basically you only have one path to follow and triggers spots to hit to change the gameplay
example  say you have to destroy  artillery crews
you have to follow down one particular path in a town you must clear the buildings and the enemies dont stop coming at you until you clear out one artillery base
you basically spend this game rushing forward head first into every single battle causing great frustration and it does get old and boring after the th time in a row
if you think your going to hide behind a wall pick off the enemy and clear the buildingyour going to run out of ammo
in other words you dont have a choice
full speed ahead
in some cases that is fun and exhilirating
at other times it sucksyou also know when enemies are going to hit you too
linear game play is predictable
you attack an area clear it then move to attack the next target
as you approach the enemies pop out ahead of you and get into formations
lather rinse and repeatyawn
 automated attacksin some of the battles there are secure spots to hide in
however once youre there youll get bombarded with grenades
i watched where they came fromlol no enemies are there they just magically are thrown from the ground
this is to prevent you from taking advantage of shelter and once againforcing you to run head first into the battle
lame
 no health packsthis really sucks
it has a new system
instead of hunting down health packs to recover and fight on you automatically rejuvenate
i could take bullet after bullet and not die
ergo there was no risk
no price to pay for being foolish
here is how it works
an enemy pops up and pelts me with bullets
as i get hit my health endurance goes down
if i dont take cover so i can recover i will die
the screen starts to get more and more red as an indication of how close to death you are
hide behind a wall for  seconds to recover and your good to continuein some ways this seemed like it was a neat idea to try
overall i think it is a failure
it was too easy for me to beat the game because i did not have to preserve my health levels
on the other hand it was nice not to have to collect health packs
still it was too easy cant disable the stupid music
once again activisionin cooperation with their tremendous egoshas decided that they know best and you dont matter
so guess what
you cannot turn off or turn down the music in this game
they repeated the same offensive tactic from cod
this is so annoying
the realism goes out the window when the music is so loud and intrusive that you cannot hear explosions or bullets
i am not jokingit is really that loud at timeshowever i know software so i hacked critical files in cod and i hacked cod  to disable the music
up yours activision
for other people that cannot do thislook around at some game cheat sites
i will be posting the instructions in how to form this is basically cod and coduo in a different wrapperbasically if you have played cod or the expansion codunited offensiveyou have already played cod
yes it is that sad and that much of a let down
in fact i honestly feel cod and coduo are better in a majority of ways comrades get in the wayactivision still has not fixed the issue of your idiot squad mates not getting out of the way quickly
nothing is worse than  entering a door and having the enemy lob  or  grenades at you
you try to get out the door but your moronic mates are just standing there blocking the door
bam powyour dead
start over and dont enter the building
lesson learnedthe good it is funi am not saying this game is horrible or not worth playing
i am simply saying it is not worth  it certainly has been done so there is nothing new or dynamic about this game that you have not felt in the original cod and that there are other games out there like fear
that really will blow you away with creativitythis game does have its moments
i love ww fps gamessummation this game was long awaited and could have been great
it turns out that it is not that great
been there done that
no one made a hardcore effort to introduce something new and fresh to the fps genresave your money and either wait for this to go below  or go buy cod and coduo and get  times the band foir your buck if you have not already played them or finally and definitely the best optiongo buy fear
or quake  both of those games are much better than this and will keep you happier for a much longer period of timenow i must admit i am more of a classic gamer and i can see how this game could increase in difficulty with another player
i play this game and i feel like i got handed a prototype game and they say here test it and report back
i should say right off the bat i am more of a retro gamer but this game lacks in many waysfirstly in this game money is useless to the point of why play it
you immediately get thrown in the game in a dinner
ok fine anyway you can destroy the lights for lego pieces should i call spoiler alert on that or is kind of obvious lego star wars and all
now whats the point of lego pieces or currency if you the game just gives it to you easily
to buy silly outfits and lame weapons  what else well try to understand this one when you die or anyone is in your party dies you lose currency if you lose all your hearts you money gets scattered around where you died so just pick it back up
if you fall of the edge you lose the money for falling you lose however much money you ought to lose why is money lives and you can easily pick it up if shot by enemies
money in the game is so useless and easy to find i mean you can use the force or the light saber to destroy ships for money or legos  will just say money from this point on
secondly the force watch any star wars movie and what is it about using blasters ships and lightsabers
using the force sounds cool at first but gets so over played i mean you can force kill the enemies and you use it to move pieces or switches which move in predetermined ways
thirdly perfectionist puzzle solver issue how can that be bad trust me it can
puzzles although the game tries to get you to think many times to collect rare legos is pretty pointless this is where my first to third argument play against the puzzles
puzzles why solve them you see what you can buy with the lego pieces you find that are not rare why seek the rare
another problem with the puzzles is lack of force control you use the force but the movements are predetermined
lastly controls the controls way too basic and boring
aside from unlimited force power and poor camera angles and jumping control not uncommon in games
you attack and counter button are the same and you dont even really need to play your counter attacks
sometimes you counter by mistake and it works counter really ought to be a separate button not simply your attack button
my final thoughts this game is from what i can tell pretty simple but not in a good why and easy
this game is perhaps oriented too strongly towards a kid audience being really easy from what i have played
however if this game got points for one thing it keeps to the story  and feel well
you feel like you entered the star wars universe the moment you start playing and the lego aspect doesnt ruin this infact you feel like you entered the lego world as well
unfortunately this one strength is not enough to bring this game to life it still is fairthe game will not work with our xbox  and i cant find anything online about how to make it work
a big waste of my money and it is too late to send it back it was a christmas present and it has been over a month
i wont buy any more regular xbox gamesi was amped to get this game on the psp so i can take my wwe season wherever i go
while i did get almost all of the content wrestlers and gameplay in portable format i also got the worst load times i have ever experienced period
almost everything gives way to  second load times with menus sandwiched inbetween and progressing through season mode will see those familiar load screens after every single step
it really is ridiculous to the point of being unplayable  unless youre the most patient gamer in the world save your money and show thq that we wont put up with this unoptimized tripe
for a fun time try making a man tag team match with all createawrestler characters youll be waiting over three minutes for the match to start
absolutely unreal
again the core gameplay is good and youll find all of the pss content intact  but getting to it is such a snooze that theres no reason to even bother in the first placenot a first person shooter
this fact is not mentioned anywherea big disappointmentwowi thought games this bad were a thing of the past
and they actually want  for this piece of garbage too
this game is not worth spending much time on so let me be shortgraphics are rough and crappy even on a high end system
the missions are dull the enemy ai is terrible the aiminggun siting system is terrible
you spend way too much time trying to setup effective kill shot and by then the half brain dead enemies move any waythis game is unchallenging uninspired and is a total disappointment
tons of cutscenes that eat up way too much time no substance
i cannot believe websites like gamespot actually rated this as a good
this is a first person shooter that makes you feel like your character is covered in molasses because all responses and movements are slow and frustrating even after you adjust settings in options
aiming is a nightmare
the battles are more of an exercise in learning how not to make a game than being about fun or entertainmenttrust medownload the demo if there is one and play this fully before you burn your money on this piece of trash that is lower than seagull crap in my opinionby the way if you go to activisions website to check out this game get this
they actually want you to type in your birthdate and they request a valid credit card  to validate that you are an adult due to the mature nature of this gamelol  lol lol lolyeah right
like i am really going to give those morons my credit card info
even if this game was a  star rating i would not do that
what idiotsyeah this controller was alright for a few minutes but then started electrocuting me on the  button
i thought it was just my thumb but it happened several more times
it felt like touching an electric fencei am returning this for i am not gonna be making a trip to the hospital
anyone with a pacemaker do not buy thismy psp  did not fit well in this case and it seemed like the button could scratch the finish on my psp
i threw it in the trash
would not recommendpoorly made broke on me in a few days of use and was not loud at allwhat is this
trash thats what it is  its a smaller gameboybig dealit comes with cheap plastic covers in tacky colors  pink or camoflaguegive me a breakthis is  a way  for  nintendo  to keep sucking  extra money from the consumer buyer beware 
first off you have to use new cablessecond its not compatable with older gamesand its very fragilei had a friend break his after  days of owning itthe buttons are cheaply assembled  want some advicestick with the gameboy advance spits durablehas a bigger screenor go with the ds  or a  psp  but avoid this one  like the plague 
then again if you are one of those trendy people who are suckers to advertisingthen this is the dream system for you if your a smart comsumer  then you know what to purchase  amazon  says i have to give at least a star hereactually i give it zero stars  peacei dont see why anyone would want to spend their hardearned money on this when the gba sp is cheaper and just plain better in my opinionit just seems impractical to me i mean wasnt the game boy advance sp small enough as it is
it doesnt make any sence why would someone willingly pay more for something thats not as goodthe gba sp has a larger and brighter screen its alot cooler looking than the game boy micro and cmon people the sp was already portable enough
i mean how small do you need it to be
if you want to waste your money then be my guest but i just thought that i should warn you that basically what youre doing is looking to buy something thats way too small to fit comfortably in the hands of an adult probably very fragile and more expensive than a the already efficient game boy advance spif you disagree with me then just look at the facts the gba sp is small but not too small for adult hands it has a much larger and brighter screen and because of the sps folding design the screen is protected from getting scratchedoh and did i forget to mention that the game boy micro cant play any of the older game boy gamesso you see if you were thinking about purchasing the game boy micro then you might want to take a look at the game boy advance sp first and then figure out which of the two fits you bestnote only the graphite and pearl blue gba sps have a brighter screen all other models arent as brightly litwritten byshadow mage the game maniacif you collect gameboys this is the perfect thing for you
however if you just like playing the games i honestly must say for you to pass this up
for reasons that are pretty obviousfor one everything good about the gameboy micro can easily be seen in the gba sp
this screen is backlit and easily fits in your pocket and plays gba games
alright thats fair enough
but come on
the gba sp was just like that
with the gba sp there was a backlight with a rechargable battery and if you folded it down then it went into your pocket with no problems at all
i do like all the different custom face plates though
theyre easy to use and dont leave any of that sticky residuethe gba micro is of course for those who do not already have a gba of any kind
if you dont have a gba go with the sp
and let me explain why you cannot protect the screen of your gba micro if you stick it in your pocket youll pull it out only to see several scratches on the screen
needless to say this is a big problem
with the sps fold down lcd screen you could easily protect it
the screen is actually smaller this is true too
the screen is smaller and the games are not properly brought down to scale
its very annoying
you cant play older gameboy games and gameboy color games the same thing plagued the ds but the ds i could live with
this i cannot
part of the reason i still have my gba sp is so i can play older gameboy games
you cant do that with the micro
the list price is too high i dont know about you but i certainly dont want to spend one hundred bucks on this when the sp has more to offer in terms of quality
the sp is cheaper and easier to work with
with the handheld console war advanced off to the psp and ds paying onehundred dollars for this is almost shadyoverall if you are someone looking for a decent gameboy system get the sp
you get all the qualities of the micro and moregameboygameboy colorgameboy pocketgameboy advancedgameboy spnintendo dsgameboy microthis has to be a record for the most whoring out of any console brand in the history of gaming
how many more slightly updated gameboys is nintendo going to release until they finaly give consumers something worth purchasing
just look at how long it took nintendo to add real color to their system
the damn thing didnt even have a back light until the sp came out
do you realize how many years that is
nintendo has always cheated its customers with low grade quality software and they almost always refuse to upgrade their hand helds in any real earth shaking way
even the nintendo ds is just a slightly improved sp
if you are a real sucker youll buy yet again into the nintendo scam of the century or you can save up get yourself a psp and experience the real next generation in hand held gamingprove to nintendo that they cant just pawn off crap like this and expect for us to just eat it up and call it candy
the gameboy micro is a joke and nintendo has even updated their sp to add a better backlight to the system
funny how this is done very quietly so nobody noticestheir moto should be nintendowhy settle for more when we can give you lessi love adventure games and own all the originals from sierra and lucasarts
but alot of them dont run under xp so i was really glad to see this title in the store
but it only runs on my xp service pack  computer which is six yrs
old and only used for the internet
why was it only made for sp
usually i have a hard time getting stuff to run on sp because its made for sp
i have a sp computer a sp computer and a vista computer and theyre like three different operating systems
maybe next time ill buy a maci used to play these games as a child so i was so excited when i stumbled across the collection
the picture quality is terrible the colors are completely messed up and the images are shown via vertical lines
at first i though it was my laptop until i googled the issue and found it was standard
if you follow the steps to fix the color you ruin the running speed of the actual game play
do not buy this product youre better off buying the original gamesall of the games are to old to play on my pc
the game itself just makes my pc puke pixels all over my screenthis is seriously the most useless game case i have ever used
you can fit exactly two controllers into the case you can fit quite a few games in the  provided holder but this is very risky because the sleeves are too loose and the games can easily slip out and get scratched
you could potentially fit another controller or some games in cases in the top compartment that is if the power brick didnt take up over  of the space
the package says it was designed to work with either the  or the original xbox console and while it can at least accommodate the console itself its clear that this was designed with the original box in mind because its intensely inconvenient to use with the  this thing was a complete waste of thirty bucksgo buy the officially licensed backpack from madcatz its a sad sad day when im forced to endorse madcatz its more expensive but youll end up getting something else if you buy the gpak anywaygot the   months ago no games available noticibly better than xbox
in precisely  days xbox  fan quit and overheated and started crashingcalled myxbox
warranty has expired sorry no luck
bought new fan and installed it
worked for another month before expiring from overheating again both fans workingmiracle
microsoft ups warranty to  year as it should have been from the start so i call and send in the  they send it back unrepaired stating it was tampered with and not only will they not fix it under warranty but they wont fix it at all ever for any amount of moneyit is not repairable any where else and they dont sell repair parts
same as taking your car back to the dealer and having them tell you you changed your own oil so we not only wont repair it you cant take it anywhere else or get any parts for it
throw it out and buy a new carthink about it
think about after your nice new  year warrantygo buy a ps youll be much happier
it died in middle of gears of war first game to really show off s capabilityto start off i got my  about six months ago when i was still in hawaiithe only reason i dished out  bucks for this thing is i wanted something to take my mind off things for this yearlong deployment army in iraq where ive been for  months now
the system is great when it works so the problem isnt if the system is great the problem you will get with your  system is when your in the middle of playing a game then the next thing you know your looking at a tiny lil box near the left bottom corner of your tv that says unreadable disc
puzzled youll put in  or  different games all with the same result
two of my other friends here had the same problem but for some reason theirs could only play dvdsturns out mine does the exact same thing
maybe im stubborn but if i pay  for somethin i expect it to at least work a year oh and my ac in my room is always blowing so its around the high s  im goin do two things regarding the situation our good hard working friends at microsoft have put me inim goin dust off the ol sony ps and save my money when im confident enough that the ps is over any launch problems it might occur and the next time i go to the shooting range im bringin my pretty new paperweight spray paint a pretty red circle on it and watch the sparks fly
thanks for stealing my money microsoft dput simply do not buy this productthe xbox  comes in two versions this barebones version and a fullfeatured version that comes with a hard drive
the bare bones version is a little less expensive at first glance but is more expensive in the long runfor example all games and any use of xbox live require some kind of memory storage
the barebones system does not come with any memory
you have to buy it seperately which eats up  the price difference between the core and the full version
another example the core does not have highdef output cables
if you have a core and you want to actually see the fancy graphics that the xbox  is producing you have to go out and buy a set of expensive cableswhich eats the other half of the cost difference
if you want a wireless controller you have to buy that separately too and now the core is more expensive than the full versionin conclusion if you want the xbox  experience then buy the full machine not this crippled core version
its like buying a car without wheelspretty to look at but doesnt actually get you anywhereif you are like me a father just trying to make his child happy do not buy thisfirst there are no childrens titles for the   maybe in a few years there will be somesecond this console is not backward compatible with most games
check the microsoft site and they will confirm this about  levels deep into the xbox site
however no where in the xbox manual do they tell you thisthird toys r us will sell you xbox gamesnot  and claim they will work with the new xbox
they simply do not
in the rare case they do work you must first download and install a software patch
does this make any sense
finally the xbox  is a decent dvd player and has great graphics for those with hdtv and the hookups ms supplies the component cablesi was a huge fan of microsoft until this product
dont waste your money
also dont waste your childs timemicrosoft should not be in the video game business they have no work ethic in terms of the userthe xbox  as a system that turns on and lights up has alot of wasteful hardware to give you what could be a great video game experiencefor a video game experience buy elder scrolls oblivion for the xbox   if youre not into games like that youre out of luck
simply put every game exclusively for the xbox  isnt finished
microsoft apparently doesnt care if a company that puts games on their system refines their programming codeunfinished games were a problem that plagued the xbox as well
xbox survived however because some games did extremely well for the playstation  and microsoft had the deep pockets to get them on the xbox after thier initial successthe xbox  coming out before the playstation  was the stupidest thing that microsoft could have done apparently they dont realize how pathetic their efforts always are in terms of video gamesthey failed with the xbox and they failed with the xbox   microsoft failed periodis it just me or does this look like just a computer filled with computer parts
if someone is willing to pay over  for a game console why dont they just buy a new computer with a good graphics card
also another thing i have noticed when i was playing one of the games i did not notice anything different than from the original xbox
then again i wasnt playing on a really expensive tv either
also have you noticed that the xbox  is not mentioned much anymore and a lot of the consoles you cannot find or they are way over priced
i see a flop in action
buy at your own riskthe quality of this product is sub par
this was my rd  and this one lasted about six months
i ended up sending it to microsoft for a repair then sold iti paid  dollars for  hardware malfunctions and xbox games
i see a little advance in the graphics but its not that much at all
it still dvd format and doesnt hold enough
hold off for the revolution or playstation  when the real next generation beginsfirst of all the name xbox is a misnomer
this product should be called the xbox
because when you first buy this item you are going to love it
give it a year and you are going to do a complete  and really dislike this thing
i loved it and spent a lot of money on games and accessories and now a year and a half later i am finally getting this wretched piece of electronic negativity out of my home for goodright out of the box your hardware will eventually fail
the only probability in this equation is the when component
i played mine about  hour a day
it lasted  months before i received a complete hardware failure
the second refurbished unit they sent me didnt ever work it was broke right out of the box
the third refurb they sent me lasted for  weeks
my brothers first unit lasted  months his second was a dead on arrival hes currently on his third
i have other friends and this paragraph could go on and on but to summarize everyone i know that has owned a  has experienced it breakbut the product is unstable fine
but thats not all you get out of the   you get to be treated rudely by an obnoxious twentysomething brat everytime you successfully navigate through the obnoxious robot hell that is myxbox
and you will be calling it a lot
in fact that is the only way to cancel your playtoplay online subscription
anyone that experienced the aolimpossibletocancelhotline will feel right at homeheres one of my favorites
you have to pay for everything with microsoft points with are sold in  increments
want to play the remaining levels in that  game you just bought
not so fast hotshot
you need to log into the marketplace and pay for those last few withheld levels
want a new wallpaper
nuh uh uh gotta pay first
change your gamertag
that will be  more please
the nickel and diming gets old really really fastbut all those things you are buying are drmd to your console
that means that only your console will be able to use downloads
its tied to your machine
but the really cute part is that when your machine breaks and they send you a refurb yep you guessed it
nothing works anymore and you get to pay for it all again
and again
and againthis machine isnt fun the microsoft customer service will be smug and arrogant and they paytoplay model is draconian
microsoft is running this show like they have a monopoly
and they dont there are much better consoles for the money out therethe  sucks so much i am going to type nine letter bsbbbbbbbbbwhatever message microsoft is trying to convey into something that i might better be able to understand like yiddish or that bushman clicking language
as it stands i have no idea whether microsoft is seriously claiming that the worlds salvation comes from whims irrationality and delusions or if its simply the case that it could really use a heart just like the tin man in the wizard of oz
as this review will make clear its precepts have caused widespread social alienation and from this alienation a thousand social pathologies have sprung
life isnt fair
weve all known this since the beginning of time so why is microsoft so compelled to complain about situations over which it has no control
apparently even knowitall microsoft doesnt know the answer to that one
it wouldnt matter if it did given that its cause is not glorious
it is not wonderful
it is not good
a small child really couldnt understand that microsofts encomiasts want so much to ascribe opinions to me that i dont even hold that the concept of right vs wrong never comes up
but any adult can easily grasp that microsoft bickers and argues over petty things
its that simpleunfortunately microsofts scabrous invectives neglect to take one important factor into consideration human nature
if microsoft were to require religious services around the world to begin with microsoft is great microsoft is good we thank microsoft for our daily food it would be a grave insult to everyone who devoted his or her lifes work to helping the less fortunate
why
thats easy
microsoft argues that a totalitarian dictatorship is the best form of government we could possibly have
to maintain this thesis microsoft naturally has had to shovel away a mountain of evidence which it does by the desperate expedient of claiming that mccarthyism is the only alternative to neocolonialism
the poisonous wine of comstockism had been distilled long before microsoft entered the scene
microsoft is merely the agent decanting the poisonous fluid from its bottle into the jug that is world humanitymicrosofts shills remain a small isolated minority except during times of economic or social stress when a mass following develops to blame rude beggars for the problems besetting society
how does microsoft deal with this fascinating piece of information
it utterly ignores it
in the course of my work i regularly come in contact with intrusive extortionists and most of them also feel that everyone ought to read my awardwinning essay the naked aggression of microsoft
in it i chronicle all of microsofts obiter dicta from the ignominious to the druggedout and conclude that i normally prefer to listen than to speak
i would however like to remind microsoft that even if one is opposed to stentorian favoritism and i am then surely i wouldnt want to gag free speech
i would on the other hand love to give our young people the values that will inspire them to help young people develop the ability to make informed and reasoned decisions for the public good as citizens of a culturally diverse democratic society in an interdependent world
but hey im already doing that with this letter
theres a lot of talk nowadays about microsofts ridiculous offhand remarks but not much action
i have seen what microsoft is capable of and i am afraid
i am very afraid and i am very angry
what we are dealing with here is fashion politics and money
and thats all i have to saythe best console to come out this year will be the playstation  the xbox wont even come close to what the ps can do so theres no point in wasting your money on an inferior console
wait till november and the ps will be in your handswell i have played many s and i have to say they are fun depending on the game being played until they break down
i have already been through  consoles either because of the dreaded red ring of death disc drive errors or just not wanting to cooperate in general
and then when i get a working system the disc drive is extremly noisy so noisy that i have to turn up the volume on my television to the point where my dorm neighbor complainssome more badsi have to say that i would take the  over the wii anyday because i am more of the hardcore gamer but all the accessories will add up to well over  bucks
you need that intercooler because the system runs hot
i dont need any cooling device fro my ps
secondly i love watching movies but the hd dvd attatchment adds  bucks right there
i have a ps and it can play blu rays right out of the box
secondly my  has problems getting an internet signal
its right next to my ps and it gets a signal very clearly while my  always says disconnected while after getting it hooked up about  times
its a big pain not to mention waste of timewell enough of the bads
there are lots of games out for the system and i mean alot way more than for my ps or the wii
the controller has force feedback while my ps has none
the final pro in my opinion here is that i have wired controllers
it came with a wireless but i prefer wired
i dont have to worry about batteries needing to be charged or a faulty wireless connection which happened with my original xbox
it said the conrollers connection could not be detected and it was a pain to get that controller fixedall in all my final ratingssystem design  should be  it overheats way to easily
have had way too many problemsease of use 
internet connection is a pain at timesoverall fun 
good selection of games for the entire familythere is absolutely no doubt that this is a microsoft product
it comes out of the factory full of defects
the customer buys the product takes it home and discovers the problem
the said customer calls for support
microsofts first reaction is to try to put the blame on the customer
after all it surely must be the customers fault that theyre having problems
besides to readily acknowledge a problem might mean more corporate money would have to be redirected to solving the issue
the customer like most people politely and patiently persists and microsoft finally listens and agrees to fix the problem
and microsofts solution is not always the best possible in terms of what is good for the customer
eventually the boys from washington wakes up and decides that they do indeed have a problem with their product
and then they reluctantly put away the latest copy of wired magazine and get to work looking for ways to patch the problemso now you say hold on citan
im looking to buy a console not one of the windows operating systems
what are you doin writing a windows review here
please im begging you
tell me about the xbox 
and please make it quick before the boss walks in and sees me surfing the net instead of doing his work
my friend i hate to break the news to you but i am indeed writing a review of the xbox 
and you know brevity is not one of citans traits
but i am sensitive to the fact that you might be reading this while youre at work and are risking the wrath of your boss
so let me respond to the big question nowdo i recommend the xbox 
no not for the average gamer
the hassle and aggravation that would result due to the consoles high potential for breaking down are just not worth it
not for the average gamer
you see the average gamer is not extremely particular
the typical gamer can find many games from several different genre that they can enjoy
so unless you are compelled to play gears of war or any of the xb exclusive titles my recommendation is to stay away from this console
at least for now
who knows the console might eventually become reliable after microsoft applies a few more patches to the problems that plague their console
but dont hold your breath
do keep this in mind
microsoft is still patching up windows xp for petes sakesa new redesigned version of the console will be released later this year
and that version will use a cooleroperating processor that should help alleviate one of the s main issues overheating
it will also have a larger hd
i recommend that you wait until then to make your purchasewell i am an optimists
i can find humor under circumstances that would make the average person suffer a coronary
this is a quality that helps me cope with my work as a computer technician and a parttime public school teacher
i knew before buying the  that the potential for hardware failure was very high
much higher than just about any consumer electronics product out in the market right now
but i am surprised that my brand new console lasted only one monthi rarely played games off of my s disk drive 
mainly because i do not care for firstperson shooters
but i do download a lot of movies and television shows for viewing
i also play a lot of arcade games
basically my console has had gentle treatment
one day two weeks ago my console started to lockfreeze up
the picture on the screen was distorted
it happened while downloading a movie
i called microsoft and ofcourse got the standard response overheating usually happens because the customer fails to provide adequate ventilation
i then told them that mine is out in the open on a wire rack
ventilation aint the issue louie the microsoft techs name
so the tech agrees to send a shipping box
i was instructed to remove the hd and the faceplate
i would be getting a refurbished unit most likely
i asked to be transferred to live support so i can get my spent points back
the lady on the other end refused to give me back my points at first
even though my purchased movie failed to download due to their crappy console
she said it was against their policy to give back points until the customer receives his replacement console
i asked if they will automatically credit them back once the replacement arrives
she said no i would have to call again and request them again
i refused to end the call and she finally agreed to give them back to mei talked this over with my fellow computer techs
their advise was to ask the retailer for an exchange
that way i get a brand new console instead of a refurbished unit
besides there are many customers who got their refurbished replacement and it did not work right out of the box
thankfully i made the console purchase from here amazon
amazon customer service apologized for my troubles and agreed to ship me a brand new replacement
it should arrive later this week
all i can say is that amazon customer service is awesome
thank you amazoni had heard numerous issues with the console prior to purchase
i knew that where there is smoke there is fire
but i am accustomed to dealing with hardware issues
i receive and make a lot of technical support calls
so this is normal for me
but it may not be to you
if you dread such things then stay away from this console
if youre comfortable with it then thats fineare you buying for your children
if so do yourself a favor and look elsewhere
consider this scenario
its saturday youre looking forward to a relaxing day at home
and then your child runs up to you in a state of total panic
being the good parent that you are alarm bells suddenly go off in your head and you begin to inspect your child for possible signs of injury
the child finally tells you that his brand new xbox  has broken down right in the middle of hisher game
your jaw drops
after you recover from your brief wtf moment you agree to call tech support
after the obligatory qa they agree to send you a shipment box for the consoles return to them
and then they agree to send you a refurbished unit for replacement
and now you wait patiently
you wait patiently
meanwhile five times everyday you get the following refrain sort of like what the raven says in that famous poem
from your precious child is it here yet
all joking aside if you simply must play the games that are exclusive to the  then make the purchase
but do so from a retailer that would allow you to exchange the unit when it fails
not all retailers will according to microsoftdo i regret my purchase
not yet
thanks to amazons great customer service
also i have the patience of job
i also have other consoles to use while waiting for the replacement
and being a technician i am used to dealing with technical issuesthere is one other important lesson that i learned from this situation
you see one week after getting my console i wrote a nice review of the console
i gave it  stars for fun and a  stars for the overall
five stars for fun because i liked being able to download movies and shows
three stars overall for the consoles potential reliability and build quality
i would like to revise those ratings now
and i will explain my reasons for lowering the fun rating
the overall rating decrease should be obvious
so what did citan learn
basically you cannot own a video game console for only one week and write an accurate review of its potential quality and reliability
one weeks experience is not enough
i learned that
i have now experienced those anecdotal problems that others have mentioned for myself
that makes them more real and not just someones words
on the same line of thought i also did not want to rewrite the review on the same day of the problem
fairness to me to the xbox and to you is importanti realize that the best way for me to get a lot of helpful points is to give the product a star rating
giving this product or basically any product a low rating guarantees me a lot of unhelpful points
you see a lot of people who are reading these reviews are the socalled supporters of the console
a lot of readers already made the investment and are just curious as to what others are saying about their baby
and youve got people who have made up their minds and are just saving up for the big purchase
they do not like to see low ratings for their chosen console
but that is fine
they no longer need the review
you see reviews are written for people who have not made up their minds
reviews are written as a service for the people who are still doing research
i can only hope that no one bought the console based on my original reviewi lowered the fun rating because the hard drive is much too small for its intended purpose
and honestly a products reliability will affect how fun it will be to own
and unlike windows there are atleast two other alternatives to this product that are worthy of considerationupdate its been confirmed that a newer version of the console will be released in april
it will have a gig hd and hdmi output
it will also come in black color
my advice to you if you are set on purchasing a  is to hold off and wait for the new version
you see i really do not believe that the problems with the current console have been corrected
plus the upcoming version will be a much better valuethe system is fun when it actually works but i am currently on my th repaired system which keeps destroying the dvd drive and any disk that is in their currently
microsoft refused to replace gow when the dvd destroyed it last time but they finally just let me get a new system
buyers beware you might want to get the extended warrenty if you are any kind of gamer as this thing falls apart upon touching itthe  has a great library of games
but the hardware is mediocre at best
ive went thru two s that died within months of light usage
i decided to take the lost in games purchased and go with the king of hardware sonys ps
and while there arent any games at this time aaa games that is there soon will be
so its either jump in now and get a  and suffer the consequences of having to deal with a highly defective unit
or get a ps with its reliable hardware and hd movie player and you can count on hardware that will truly play beyondwell it finally happened
my  lasted almost a year not quite though
for cutting edge technology im fairly disappointed
im not much of a console person to begin with but i decided to purchase the  i understand they have a return policy now but i think its a bit late for that considering that ive already sold all my games and invested it into some computer hardware
id advise everyone else to do the samei have owned an original xbox and xbox  and both broke in the same way after about a year of playing not even playing much
microsoft wants  to fix them and only gives a warranty of  days after that
it is widely known that xbox used poorquality thompson disc drives in the first xboxs which i had and many many problems have plagued the xbox  i have heard that as many as  of machines were defective straight out of the box and many more like mine broke down after the warranty expired
a  paperweight is not much funi had an original xbox
loved it great games and a crash once in a while
no big deal
worked through many many hours of hard usei got a  about  months after introduction should have worked out bugs right wrong
didnt notice or get  extra extended warranty so stuck with lousy completly industry nonstandard  day warrantya few crashes but getting worse and worse so i finally call when it starts crashing on boot start up and they tell me my warrantees expired and it will be  plus shipping plus another  if i wanted the extended warranty that i didnt get originallyplaystation  will come with a  year warranty
get the playstation  or if you must have a xbox get the extended warranty it came with a  day warranty for a reasonthere are over  and one half million posts on xbox  crash on the internetmicrosoft obviously knew they were selling a totally inadequate product from the start and that is why they cut the warranty to only  daysnone of us really expect much from microsoft but they have intentionally cheated me and many thousands of other xbox  purchasers and casually deny any culpabilityone star is not nearly low enough i would give them minus  stars if i couldalso really good games that take good advantageof the s capabilities have been really slow in comming outat least with the playstation  you will have out of the box true  p bluray dvd capability some decent games and a real warrantythe xbox  is a very good gaming system but however
an update was released in spring and this caused live to fail for me
after this i put an original xbox game in it and then the three lights of death came
these lights indicate a hardware failure and this has been reported numerous times
on a survey  percent of people had one that brokeif you can take aside all of the freezing and glitches and crashing associated with the  then the system would be  percent perfect
which it isnt
the system has great games like oblivion upcoming halo and others though  microsoft is being sued for the x scratching game disks
one out of every   xbox s break
microsoft will fix it for free only if it is due to the  red light failure
if it scratches your  game disks it will cost  to replace each
go with a wii or ps instead or just stick to last gen systems till ms comes out with their next gen consolethis is idiotic selling a system for so high a price
so it is sold out in stores just wait it out youll get one and probably cheaper than store price now
these second hand sellers are crooks selling them so high
think about priorities before paying these sellers such an idiotic pricespent the money babied the system
in six months it bean to freeze and lock up then when i put lost planet into it for the first time it would lock up every time
then the green ring around the power button turned red
not good
the xbox  has the best games and is a great system but that much money for a system that decays in six months starthis piece of rubbish breaks down a few times before the first year of use the average life of the xbox  is  months sad but true some of the games make me buy this thing but in the end is not worth it to pay  for a console the does not work most the time and the overheat is the worst of the worst the  red lights of dead as some people call itthis product has some fun games but whats the use if your system keeps breaking down and needs to be sent to microsoft for repairs over and over
it is very frustrating to see money spent on a  product that needs constant repairs and is away for months on end
very disappointing
maybe there should be a recall on all defective machinein the history of video games this is the only console tha burn itself the three red lights appeared just becouse  lost in a xbox console and the additional control
im very far away so i dont have the opportunity to change it or somethingjust for that the xbox its the worst video game console everi have one even though it hasnt been in my house for weeks since its being repaired
i enjoy the games it plays although there are a few too many shooters and not enough adventure games
but yeah i wouldnt recommend it to my friends unless ms fixes the hardware problems
apparently they will be soon but the customer needs to know which one is the new model so they dont end up buying the faulty onewaste of money after seeing the specs on this
download an emulator and buy the xbox  controllers for your pctheres a new fall update out which is causing systems to brick you start up the  and get three flashing red lights meaning its dead
the update was meant to crash modded s which would need to be sent in for repairs
then microsoft would tell the modifiers that they had no obligation to repair the systems because of a breach of liability
the only problem is that the update is bricking s that arent modded leaving honest gamers with a  paperweight
their solution is to charge  to ship the system for repairsthis is horrible business practice and i have nothing but anger towards microsoft for ruining my system they have admitted fault even and asking for my hard earned money to fix it
in retrospect i would much rather have an alternate consoleif you buy an xbox you are making a gamble with your time and money period
the xbox is really a poorly made piece of equipmentso poorly made in fact that the repair center in texas for their masses of disfunctional consoles is swamped with consoles that need to be repaired and the  wait time for a replacement is six weeks
d
i brought my xbox from amazon on the th of november  and now on the th of july  its got the three flashing red lights of death
i took great care of this console and all of a sudden its just stops working
yup i heard about itread about it but never thought it would happen to menow i have to wait six weeks and go through alot of headache for them to fix it
the xbox has nice games and it is fun but the over heating issuesfreezingred lightsits too much to make it an enjoyable experienceoh and lets not forget the rude and insulting customer service reps on the repair hotlineeven my  bit nintendo from  still works
thank god i have a pstime to whip it outupdate smashed mines into a wallseeing as i live outside the us dont ever buy this if you live outside the united states and the amount it costs to send it to texas is almost as much as getting a core microsoft wont pay
i used the towel trick on my system
it worked for a week or two then red rings again
i used the towel trick again and it worked for two days
towel tick again worked for a couple hoursthen finally black screen and red rings of death comboso i took it outside and smashed it into a wall then into a rock now its in the trash where trash should bewhat ever you do please dont buy the xbox  or the horrible ps just wait a couple of months and buy the nintendo revolution instead its a way better buy and you want be cheated out of your money its just crazy the spend up to close to  dollars for a system when there a way better next gen consol comeing out the revolution that will cost about  or maby  dollars turst me just wait for the revolution  your be glad you didi was about to buy this xbox as an early birthday present for my stepson whos birthday isnt until april
but after a few research and reports heard from friends who know people who have the xbox already
i havent heard a single woot or good thing
ive heard one of my friends cousin his xbox overheated and melted the cd inside and the plastic case exterior
another friend says it glitches and locked up
many reports ive read were the same about lock ups screen glitches overheating etc
i was surprised that these reports came outta something microsoft made
i mean did someone fall asleep at the assembly line or something
did they not think of putting in a cooling fan 
i mean even ps has a cooling fan in it
all major gaming systems got one
i think even gamecube
and to cover up their error they raised the price to cover the new parts and stuff installed into the xboxs to prevent any reoccurring error
thats a bunch of bull poo if you ask me
im gonna wait for the ps to come out or like the others said wait til the hype goes down and prices falli got it home had fun with forza  then played it on and off for about  months
i turn it on one day and it doesnt work
now they offered to fix it for free but i wont do it
im going to fix it myself and sell it immediatelymy opinion of the xbox  would be better had m not have rushed this out into the market without thorough testingits clear that they didnt test enough because i know a guy who had to replace his   times due to the infamous rrodthis will be my first and last  i buy as i got the rrod along with an e  errorits sad when you pay the amount you do for the system only for it to go bad in less than a year of ownership
my old xbox is still running just perfect yet the  is trash as compared to the old xboxshame on m for unloading such an inferior gaming console to the masses
so nintendo wii or ps here i comei could not have been more displeased with my xbox  first of all the system has a  failure rate according to retailers who have to deal with angry customers trying to return their broken xbox s
that means that you have a  in  chance of your brand new xbox  completely melting down within a year
mine started malfunctioning after the first month
the wii and ps both have failure rates of less than 
congratulations microsoftsecond of all if you are a  year old boy who likes insulting peoples mothers over a headset skip this paragraph
if youre not then perhaps you dont like to play sports games or firstperson shooters with  year olds over xbox live
i dont and therefore i have nothing to play on the xbox  this aside from the malfunctioning prompted me to sell mine in favor of a wii
the only games i wanted to play on the xbox  ninja gaiden and the elder scrolls oblivion are both available on better systemsalso parents please dont think that im suggesting that this system is actually good for teenagers
while it is designed for  year old boys by men with  year old minds the online gaming community would make most adults blush with its anger profanity and hatred laced dialoguesi understand that microsoft has a vision of a new generation of online gamers and that they are catering to this market
the problem with this is that online gamers are generally idiots
ive got several years of experience wading through their shallow world
i finally decided not to play any games online any more for the same reason that i dont go hang out at the local high school
its sad really because online games can be incredibly fun
its the fact that so many people in virtual space are immature and psychologically unsoundused acceptable is debatable
the casing was so trashed it had to be replaced the screen has a dead pixel and was also scratched so badly it effected gameplay
it also didnt come with a charger
buying it from amazon warehouse i had higher expectationsokay the screen of game boy advance is way too small
i dont what nintendo was thinking when they came up with this
you might as well use a little cell phone to play games
if you want to lose your eyesight go ahead and get this system
after a year you will be wearing glasses like urkel
or if you currently wearing glasses your eyesight will only get worse
the screen only show antsi would love this game if they would just fix the save systemi feel i have no control over the game and that im not really interacting with this environment because my only goal is find the next save point
im not permitted to play out the game how i want toin the traditional game saving system i would have a sense of accomplishment by being able to save whenever i had performed well
this system takes that away
it only saves by my finding a secret save spot
no thrill there at alland it wouldnt be so bad if upon getting killed i would instantly start the game play again
instead an extremely annoying philosophical message appears for a number of seconds
they disrupt the flow of the action to the point where i just dont enjoy this game
i have all the expressions memorized at this point
why the 
 did the designers impose this on us
i would really like to knowi refuse to buy the other versions of call of duty unless i can confirm that these problems are fixedughcome on this is not good
there is no talent into this type of gameplay
the problem with soooo mannnyyyy game designers today is that they are not very creative
they serotype tooo muccchhh like the kid said
yes the allies were the good guys and yes socialism is wrong but why do we see ww from the allies side
why cant we see it from the axis side
or have the choice
im dont care about multiplayer were kiddiees run around and run and gun bunny hop and alll that with no real tactics heck they know nothing of the war or tactics
go back to urt  or quake
this is war and there is no bunny hoping or rambo sytle combat in war
everyone fights together as a team in a team
the funny thing is in the uo expansion they advertised that no one fought alone yet somehow you were the only one that could kill anything as if your me were just there in the background shooting at who know what
brother and arms is  times better than this game why
you can order your men around flake the enemy more than just one way and your aim is not as accurte
the guy who said it was junk because he couldnt hit anything was saying he cant hit anything and he cant jump either
maybe he was trying to high jump over a bush
good luckanyway if you really want to be creative create a game where you can fight turn based style either side or front of the war
maybe if they just mix the rome total war style with first person battle and relisem it could be a great hit
and of course add a world map where you could move your units around being navy airforce or marines to different locations
that would change the ww humdrums totally around
you could also play different roles as a commander or a general to a grunt soilder
different battlefields different weapons from each side tanks artillery you name it
genuisi have a new pc with windows   bit on it
when i try to install this game i get an error immediately and the install exitedi played this on my old vista computer and it worked fine and was a fun gamethe same old as far as where  went but the graphics are far worse
however the controls arent badbasically if you liked resident evil dead aim code veronica and any of the movies that were out in theaters then youre in for a really big treat because resident evil  is everything those games proffered in being loud dumb and obnoxious actionpacked thrillers with amazingly stupid dialogue stupider than the first games dialogue embarrassingly weak plots weaker than the original games plots and being virtually devoid of atmosphere pacing even shock factors
god help you if you played the original games and liked them for their atmosphere decent characters and adventuring aspects of game play because to you the huge glossy four on this game that surprisingly comes before the title will feel like the biggest bait and switch in the history of horror gamingdo i even really need to explain how stupid this game is
i understand what capcom was trying they thought that a new smarter enemy would be a lot scarier and in theory they would be but they seemed to forgot that adding a bunch of bs actionpacked attacks to the hero cuts down atmosphere faster than a lawnmower to grass
would you be terrified of a group of people you could decapitate almost immediately with a single roundhouse kick to the head
would you be scared of possessing the ability to toss big heavy combat knives effectively and always hit your target
would you be shivering if you somehow possessed the ability to jump off of thirtyforty foot ledges land on your own two feet and never get hurt
what the hell
how could any of this qualify as horrorcapcom basically took leon from the second game and turned him into a devil may cry character
and his change in attitude doesnt make any sense either how can a wellgrounded mature young man lose so many brain cells that he practically regresses to an angsty middleschool student in a manner of six years
does a man become more mature by the amount of curse words or smugly witty commentary he spoutsi used to love ada wong from resident evil  because there was something interesting about her whole situation and you actually started learning a little bit about her there was something human about her then
well there certainly isnt now
not only did they change her character they turned ada into an actionpacked backflipping bullettimed super woman in quite possibly the most laughable and offensive spy getup ive ever seen in any visual mediaand how about that  hollywood back alley garbage plot
european terrorists
a plot against the presidents daughter
some completely unknown unheard of bacteriological entity that just appeared out of nowhere and has absolutely nothing to do with umbrella
oh noeveryone compliments the game play but all it really comes down to is a ripoff of splinter cell used in a completely inappropriate situation
the reason why the overtheshoulder zoom worked in splinter cell was because you didnt have to constantly worry about people crawling on screen at all sides while youre trying to sharp shoot
oh yeah and how about those quick time events eh
since when was mashing buttons scary
quick time events arent even fun
theyre obnoxious little minigames tied into the games cinematic moments particularly in moments where youll probably end up shouting oh now what instead of admitting fearfulness made to keep you from sitting back like you usually do so you can watch helplessly as your character performs so many hyperactive super moves according to random buttons they might as well be dancers in a merce cunningham production on the surface of titan hooked up to electrodesthe moments the game even remembers it wants to be a horror game run few and far between all the game has in its favor is an inexplicable waterboss and naked seven foot sniffling noseless zombies that look like they were designed in about a minute
thats it
the rest of the time youll be gunning down crazy people not zombies manga villains and guarding a prostitutelook i can see why most people venerate this game as a good action game which is why i give it a  for fun but really trying to find the game scary terrifying or worth more than a rental is pointlessi had heard nothing but great reviews for resident evil   sure its supposed to be better on the game cube but how much worse could it be on the ps
so i gave it a shot and i hated it immediately
usually when i pick up a video game i am able to kick some bu right off the bat or at least defend myself
but with this game i was bumping into things trying unsuccessfully to aim the gun and getting killed by slow moving creeps
if i had the guy and the controls from far cry or metal arms or black or james bond in this game those dudes wouldnt have stood a chance
instead i am getting slashed by one and while i am on the ground gasping and reeling and recovering from this first blow the other two creeps are closing in on my sluggish character to deliver theirs
and you cant strafe
you can only walk straight forward which means that any time you walk through a doorway anyone can wait just inside and clobber you as soon as you come through
i suppose the horror aspect of this game is how horrified you will be at the terrible controls
i am guessing there are no rocket launchers either
no thankslook with the right control unltil you are under pressure and have to aim your gun then suddenly you have to switch to using your left control
i wonder what dunce dreamed up that ideaafter so many games getting it right cod moh mgs splinter cell max payne socom syphon filter etc
how the fk did these overpaid idiots at capcom get it so friggin wrong
this is disgraceful
with the production value this could have been such an awesome game
too bad they fcked it upthis game made me so angry i had to write a review to tell the world that i now have a new reason to hate capcom
thanks i really didnt want something creative like mega man legends  anyway
ill just play one of millions of online shooters or ha hathe devil may cry remakeha hai thought that franchise was a good quick cash ini mean remake too
i wont be doing either of those thingsi bought this game at a local used electronics store for 
i also got code veronica outbreak file  and dead aim for   a piece
good finds i thought
i had never played through any of the re games but saw my friends play them and i am a fan of the silent hill series so i thought this would click with me
i should have listened to my friend who told me this one was garbage because the action combat garbage ruined itbut i decided to try it myselfi want those hours of my life back
i could have been playing a good video game
i enjoyed the first  hrs
of gameplay
the creepiness of the early game atmosphere was awesome
and then you get to the castle which i thought was the last level
but it turned out to be a long drawn out leveland then you go to another tacked on level sewer and then another island and then another some building on the island and one more i thinki lost count due to wanting this game to be overhad this game had a major boss battle with one villian at the castle and then when trying to get to the rescue spot you fought the last bossi would have loved itbut capcom just didnt know when to let this game end
they had to be making the levels up as they went along
seriously i think they were hoping most people wouldnt play to the end of this game thus not noticing the decline in qualityalso the action button sequences were lame
i couldnt dodge in game when i wanted to but only when the game gave me a split second to press a button sequence
whats stupid is the sequence changes you get to l r or sqaure and xand if you dont do it within half a secone you die
heres a fun idealet me play the game
but it seems that in recent years the cool thing to do is dumb down games so that people who are horrible at them can play them tolastly the ending dialogue was so stupid
ashleys voice actor said her lines with no feeling and there was no hint of romantic tension between her and leon
and then leon macks honey whatever her name was
they were hopping the ending would make the  year olds who are into trying to get their first girlfriends be likeaw dawg
yeah you go leon
get that number
then you stop wearing axe body spray and a combination of beenies and tanktopsand start playing games that arent total action garbagei would have rated this game way higher
but diving out nd story windows and a stretched thin game experience made me just hate this game for being a hodge podge of good and bad
i have re   i own the n version all for gamecube
i think ill try those instead
this seems to be the jumping off point for re
my friend who told me this was junk said  was better but still not great and re  is supposed to cater to the gears of war shooter people
whatever
not my cup of tea
give me a good game and ill play it
give me this junk and ill tell the worldthis is the first resident evil game ive tried and was quite surprised that the controls were this poor
i had heard nothing but positive reviews on re
most all of them containing remarks on how they finally got the controls right in contrast to eariler re games
those earlier games must of been close to completely unplayable
but youll have to excuse me i guess
i just finished playing games like halo halo  farcry and many other recent st person and rd person action games whose controls are flawless or close to it
there is really no excuse in this day and age to have controls this horrible
if the controls were done this way on purpose to heighten the suspense or something perhaps the makers of this game should have just simply made a better game to accomplish this
poor controls  no funi was originally pretty excited to play re  id never ventured into the horror  escape genre before but so many people raved about the earlier editions that i thought id give this one a try
first of all i freely admit that i am not an extremely devoted gamer
i have a lot of things going on in life and cant devote hours and hours at a time to the diversion unfortunately
that being said it only took about  minutes of play to realize that this game is ridiculously difficult
i dont necessarily mind difficulty but the character himself leon fights like gumby or a gingerbread man and this was very frustrating
he can only lamely and clumsily slash a knife in the air and shoot a wimpy handgun that he cant aim for garbage
there is no way to lockon to targets like in other games so you have to manually point the weapon
even then it only works at close range
additionally he cant duck jump punch kick or do anything unless the game prompts him to
all the while enemies can deftly pitchfork stab grab and bite at will
admittedly as the game progresses leon can upgrade to some better guns but theres no way to improve his knife or pathetic combat skills
and he is always running out of ammo and forced to feebly swat with that knife
i cant count how many times i thought to myself this is so stupid
and the story itself is a disaster
the us presidents daughter has been kidnapped and all they can send is this one wimpy fighter who has a mm pistol with a few clips and a survival knife that he barley knows how to use
i could have tolerated the poor story if the game play compensated for it
as it was i was just frustrated
ultimately i lost interest in the game and moved on to something that was more fun to engage
i recommend skipping this onethanks for readingclthis game is unplayable after just  mins playing it i had to stop cause it made me feel sick and dizzy from the game play movementeven my gf who was watching me play it got sick and dizzy from just watching the screenthe other resident evil games are just fine i played them for hours and never once got dizzy or felt sick from thembut this one is like medal of honor for any of you who played medal of honor you know what im talking aboutit makes you sick and dizzy playing itdont know why the makers of this game couldnt keep it like the new and improved resident evil for gamecubethe fact that this games movement makes you sick and dizzy makes this unplayable and that is a major flawif you are thinking about picking this up id go for the nintendo gamecube version over this one
the graphics look much better and it plays smoother on the cube plus playing on the gamecube means you can use the best video game accessory ever made the ultradope wavebird wireless controller 
the game was designed for the gamecube and the weird architecture of the ps didnt help the shifting over from that console
the game itself is fantastic but be aware that it is much better on the gamecubeive seen reviews calling rome total war the finest game of  more like the biggest disappointment of  if you want to play the absolute best strategy total war game out there pick up medieval total war
it comes in a double pack the original game plus the expansion for something cheap like  and it is x better and more entertaining in every way than the hugely disappointing rome total war
if you have never played medieval tw and dont know how much better it is than rome tw in that case rome tw is okdo not buy this game until they release a patch that solves the constant crashing
they are currently at patch  which was designed to bring rome up to the level of barbarian invasion for multiplayer   is not a patch for bimany many people who have this game are sufferring from crashing if you are lucky you will have no problems but very likely you will havenote that i do not have any problems with any other games and also rome total war works perfectly and has never had any problems whatsoeverbarbarian invasion expansion however crashes all the timehaving said all that it is not a bad expansion from what little i have played of it
the original rome total war is very worthwhile and you should find it actually works
the other game they made earlier medievaltotal war and the vikings expansion are also very very good and should be picked up cheaply and run perfectly well and fast on any machinethis expansion pack though is terribly buggythere is no support from the creatorsvolunteers other people like you and me are trying to help people get through the many problems but are overwhelmed and have no idea how to fix itkeep your eyes on it though the first patch might clear things uphonestly this game was so boring that i couldnt even get past the first level
i simply quit out of boredomthe controls feel awkward your character feels like shes skating sometimes though they try to augment the movement with the sound of footstepsthe graphics look decent however the characters look plastic and lame like theyre wearing makeupwhat really makes this game disgusting however is the story and writing
the characters are truly annoying
i could see the theme they were going for here a mix of s spy movie camp with futuristic overtones and settings
it failed on all fronts
the main character looks like some annoying arrogant super model  who you wouldnt pay to be aroundthe dialogue is equally as bad campy and lame
it really becomes annoying to hear anyone talk after like the th or th level
i dont even care to remember the name of them just that i was annoyedwhat is really strange is that this games lameness sticks with you after youve gotten rid of it
it was not even worth the  i paid for it as of dec first off its almost  and i just bought this game
i bought it because it was so cheap that it was practically free
good thing too it sucksxbox  games now have graphics that totally blow this game out of the water
the ai is a joke and the controls are well its hard to describe but basically they suck
it just doesnt feel rightthe biggest disappoint i have is that this game taints my wonderful memories of pd for n
now that was an awesome game
playing pd n with my siblings was the best
the bots the weapons the levels it was great
the controls were so much better on n tooits too late to appreciate this game too many other excellent jawdropping games are out buy something like halo or gowseriously this game on any system not just the  is not fun to control and theres no feeling of accomplishment when you pass each mission
the feel of the character during movement and shooting is inexcusably remedial very slow very tedious to aim and like others said it takes far to much effort to drop  guythe game reminds me of a poor mans red faction  for xbox with noticeably better graphics but as far as  goes the other  games i currently own surpass pdz in the graphics departmentso the reason for my title is that for those who game this game  starswhere exactly are you standards
i can think of at least a dozen shooters off the top of my head for the regular xbox that id rather be playing than pdz and doom  in my opinion has better grahpics than this game
halo halo  doom  project snowblind mace griffinthe list goes on and on and obviously quake  and cod  for the  trump this gamedo yourself a favor even if you love spytype storylines and youre in need of a shooter rent it first and youll see what i mean
its maybe worth  bucks when the price comes down but definitely not worth  and most definitely not a launch console selleri know everyone has their own opinion but giving this game  stars even if your basing it on the socalled innovation this game brings which it doesnt you skew the standard of a shooter so far in the wrong direction it baffles mei hated this gamewas bored after the first  minutes and it never got bettercouldnt even finish the game it was so badgraphics are substandard for a next gen game theres a lot of flaws like when you move alot of times you can see things actually getting drwan along the way the control is only par and there are alot of bugs like getting stuck in some places and theres alot of the doll effect on the enemies safe yourself the aspirin and pass up the copy of this waste of timethat word explains this game to a t the graphics are gamecube the story is retarded  the multiplayer is embarrassing
why in gods name would microsoft put out a game that clearly was not anywhere next to finished
this is a poor excuse for a fps
there are way better games out there halo  cod  orange box fear bioshock avoid this game at all costsi loved this game and kicked myself for not buying the limited edition when it first launched
this was offered as new but after receiving the product it was clearly not new
it lacked the slip cover extra disk and the casing was very scratched up
paid  to ship it back i was that disappointed it wasnt newthe game itself was lot of funi bought this for a friend who needed this to play gta  see this is why nobody like xboxs
oh also this piece of crap only has like  gb which i find extremely stupid
kill yourself xboxthis is a huge waste of money
gb for  and there upgrade to gb to  is completly outrageousbottom line product page is a complete lie as it is not a genuine microsoft cable but a cheap knockoff
amazon return policy on this is also a  star as i have to wait up to    weeks for a refund for this cheap crapi got this and i thought it ws goin tobe quality it wasnt it broke after working for  months 
i wouldnt recommend iti purchase this and it was a mistake in the color  we need the white one and we return it we never open and we put it back to the same box and plastic bubbles and use their label
trucking from ups say they received at their location in  lexington ky usthey charge me  again with no authorization
so what is next now
amazon have to be careful who is selling item their reputation is in the linei dont know what will happen in the next days
i contatc my bank and they will fallow this problem
be carefulyou dont need this memory cardif you have the hard drive  thats all you need  if you dont  get a hard drive instead  remember the hard drive is detatchable also  you can take that on the go  and it holds lots more datai have not even began to get close to the storage limitsome people may like the plug and play battery pack thing but i say go this way or similarbought this june of  not even a year since and the pack no longer recharges
i use the cord to power my controllers
that works fine but the battery packs are horrible
even when charged it was constantly warning me of a low battery half way through the charge
very annoying when playing a game to see the xbox button flashing in my face
i treat my stuff like gold and cycle batteries properly
this pack has ended up being worse than my rechargeable batteries
i cant recommend this item
im probably going back to lithium until they make a rechargeable battery that actually has a decent shelf lifei dont recommend this product it needs a lot of charging time to give you a few hour to use dont buy this i am editing this ancient review to inform people of what a complete waste of time these stupid things are
ive burned through a million of them
this play and charge kit basically turns your controller into a wired controller within a couple months because the batteries dont last at all
then the cable eventually breaks and you either have to take it apart and rewire it the single one i did this to is the only one that i can reliably use or dig around and find the aa battery pack you threw in a drawer somewheremy suggestion would be to simply get the wired controller
you dont have to worry about power the weight is better and youll never be distracted by the blinking lights when your controller has  battery lefti got this as a gift for my best friends birthday and it would never hold a charge
my friends birthday wasnt until june and i bought it brand new back in december
its a gift and it was brand new how was i suppose to know it wouldnt workthe seller andrea gonzalez told me as you can see the warranty has expired
we apologize
have a nice daythanks
what a great help you arethe first fishy thing i had with this product is that it came within a ziploc bag not the usual hard plastic the microsoft batteries come in
i even thought that it was a battery ripoff but it actually had the ms hologram so could well be an already used battery
no problem so far as long as it worked which did well for two months and yesterday it just stopped charging
they may be a used lot refurbished or plain and simple and old and dry useless lot
ive read many complaints about them but thought that it could be some that come bad but it results that most if not all are bad
i really do no recommend buying thiswhy buy a rechargable battery pack when you could just buy more veristal and cheaper rechargable batteries
the charger is sold separately so it just doesnt make sensedont believe me
see how much two battery packs and a charger cost then check out the cost for  aa rechargable batteries and a chargeri bought one of these for each of my four controllers
they held a charge for a few weeks not for nearly as long as previous packs ive had which have lasted years
now they wont even hold a charge for a second
if i unplug the controller it dies instantlyridiculous waste of moneyworked great for a couple weeks then the lifespan just deteriorated until there was naught but a few minutes left
also i think it interfered with the left trigger because when i replaced it with a new battery pack the left trigger worked just finethese were terrible
stopped taking a charge after a month
ive had other battery packs last for a year or more of daily playing these were shot after a month and nothing to do but throw em away
it says the vendor was microsoft but i will not believe that is true
there very likely clever knockoffs dont buypeople  dont buy this product
its a complete rip off for  reasonsfirst of all the batteries do not hold a charge at all
if you let this sit around for even just one week without using it all the juice will be gonesecond its no cheaper than standard rechargeable batteries so why not just use those to begin with
not only will they work better but you can also use them with any other product
this battery pack is propietary and only works with  controllers
if it was insanely awesome battery time it might be worth it but its not so dont waste your moneyi attempted someones suggestion about putting it back on the charger multiple times but this item never charged and did not fit snug in the controller like it should
it would cost almost the price of battery once i shipped it back and just not worth my time and effort
i thought about buying a charging cord to the remote to see if i could charge it that way but defeats the purpose of being cordlessive had  rechargeable battery packs that wont hold a charge
these things are junk just like my  i honestly got about  charges from one battery pack before it failed
the other battery pack holds about  minutes for a full charge
my suggestion is to buy rechargeable batteries from any other company than microsoft
this review may sound like i have a lot of hostility towards microsoft
ive had about every problem that could ever go wrong with my  console since i purchased it
microsoft denies all problems and tries to blame problems on the customer or the game manufacturer
if i could do it all over again i would have purchased a psbought these because i thought they were a steal at 
shouldve exercised more caution
purchased two and put them into my standard msft brand  battery charger
both do not work at all
avoid the pinki bought this for my girlfriend so we could enjoy playing games together
the problem is this holds no charge and you have to put it in another controller to charge it only to have it drain super fasti am very disappointed with this item as both batteries will not hold a charge for more than an hour
not sure why as my other microsoft batteries work great
the ones i had before are the white and black ones
why are the pink any differentdelivered timely item as described i do not recommend this item as it did not work there was no life in this battery
i purchased two and nither workedi should have read all the reviews
i bought two and they wont charge  no light at all
i repeatly removed and then inserted the batteries in the charger and only one charged
im using the ms double charger
the one that was charged i will try to use
the one that wont charge i threw outi really hope that ms did not sell these as a surplus to a distributoryou get what you paid fori purchased the blue battery pack and like other late comers to this product the battery will not hold a charge
i tossed it
if you can buy locally
for a couple of dollars more both best buy and gamestop have great options that actually worki didnt read the reviews on this product before purchasingsurely enough the battery was defective
i think its because of their age
sealed or notthey dont seem to be working correctly and drop charges or dont charge all the waythe ms brand battery is the best on the market
battery lasts a pretty long time
love the quick charge time
dont think they sell these on the market anymore by themselves includes toys r us target walmart gamecrazy gamestop best buy fred meyer etc
stock up
i have edit my review above was based on my previous experience with my original white and black ones
this blue one may only work the st time
it pretty much has to be charged over and over within a short period of time
stay away
stick with the black microsoft brand or nyko onesi like the microoft charger and battery but i have one that is fairly new which hardly holds a charge
think i paid  for mine but now they are  these things are like two double aa batteries
i hate to say i switching back to aa instead of dumping more money in the microoft traini thought for  it would atleast work
it does not and will not even hold a charge
do not waste the effort buying the pink onei knew that the pink controllers came out a long time ago but i had figured that buying one of these batteries to match my wifes controller would be perfect and they were a greal deal at only 
however after charging it overnight on the official microsoft charger and placing it in the controller it only lasted one play session
the next day tried to use it and nothingno power or even a low batt light on the controller
these are probably left over old stock from back in  when thery came out
do not buy unless you just want a cheap batt to charge and play once per day
but really why would you
i also purchased the nyko ones and they are greati bought this and it keeps falling out of the controller i have to put take on it to stay in and it doesnt stay charged longcrapped out  days after warranty expiration
pisses me off
dealer sells juhunk
so unimpressed ill be sure to buy replacement elsewhereive owned the  since very close to its launch and thus have been using the controller for quite some time now
i feel the  controller is a bit of a conundrum as so many people sing its praises yet to me its detrimental aspects far outweigh its form fitting designprosborn from the marriage of design of the original xbox s controller and the sega dramcast controller the ergonomic design affords a very comfortable grip when just holding it in your hands
the aesthetic of the controller likewise is very appealing
button placement is very good and the sticks have a nice stiff feeling allowing for precise movement
in particular the triggers l and r feel very well implemented and lend themselves to fps style gamesconsso with so much going for it there are several hurdles that make this controller subpar in my experience
first and foremost is the stiffness of the a b x y buttons
after playing a game for more than  minutes my fingers actually hurt because of the extremely rigid tension in each of these buttons
having a controller that makes your fingers hurt and tired from short use is unforgivable
an equally unforgivable offense is the atrocious d pad
the s dpad is beyond bad suffering from stiff unresponsive design and imprecise movementthe fact that microsoft let these flaws through their intial focus testing and allowed them to continue for so long in the s lifecycle is downright absurd
until they fix these flaws they will get no greater rating from me than  starme and my brother have gone through  of these between the two of us
the one that came with my elite was dead on arrival
it didnt work at all instead of wasting time with the warranty i bought a new onetheyve now changed the design a little bit
that one also was doa and i returned it
my brother has gone through  headsets without misuse and is now using a sprint cell phone headset because its a waste of money to continue to buy microsoft headsets
i would recommend a different brand other than microsoft possibly motorolafirst of all microsoft should fire whoever designed this thing
its is the most unpractical headset ever
i have a friend and she hates it
it messes up her hair everytime she comes over to play and has to use it
the first headset for xbox live rocked
the sizing sucks
overall a bad headset
goshwho designs over the head sets anymore
makes you look like a dorkthese things are terrible and overpriced
if you are a serious gamer you want to buy the turtle beach headsets
the only drawback is they require batteries but other than that they are awesome
this headset will break on you in about a month or so and always goes in and out
complete waste of moneythe original headset that came with my xbox  was great
fit well clarity was fine etcafter a couple years that one broke wire disconnected inside the ear piece so i bought this
immediately i realized this headset has a serious design flaw  rather than placing the onoff and volume at the base where it connects to the controller its instead dangling in the air
why
its very annoying the original design was a lot betterto make matters worse this headset stopped working about the th time i used it
how ridiculousbecause if you do this is the product for youi would rate this at zero stars if it were possiblethis headset defines exactly what you dont want in a headset
you cant hear anything other people cant hear you
the headset is poorly made
how can the original xboxs headset be so much better than this
do not buy this product
anything else would be better than thisi got this headset for christmas and it lasted   months until it broke
i have already gone through  im getting a wireless one
i suggest a wireless headset or a turtle beach headsetas everyone else has said this headset is complete junk
its as if microsoft went out of its way to see how much they could make this suck
the cord can come loose at the connection to the controller or it could come loose at the headset
then you have the ridiculously stupid placement of the mute despite the fact that the original design was just fine
they were like oops we accidentally did something right we need a new revisionis it just me or has anyone else had the problem of when you connect the headset to the controller everyone can hear you perectlybut you can barely hear them and it sounds like there gargling while taklingxbox has sent me  headsets and still the sameive tried both my controllers both wireless and still the samei dont know if its just the way the headsets were made or what but it makes playing online horrible
i was looking forward to playing  online but until i get a headset or till i can hear my friends without them sounding like there stuffing there face while talking i guess ill stick too single player or just not use a head set very very very very dissapointedthe  work fine on the games and runs em smooth so i dont think its the  but you never knowi say wait till a new one comes out from a rd partybut if you need oneget oneand hopefully you dont have to go through the same thing i am   starsssthis xbox  head set communicator is terrible size wise it wouldnt fit me a  yr old the mic came up to cheek and didnt swivel down only up which makes no sense if you have a small head or a child then it will be  stars for youplayed xbox live for  hours
worked at first but not very well
by the end of  hours i had a useless headset that isnt even good for a paper weightone of these came with my game card
i was able to use it for a week before the wire snapped in half
it is very flimsy and was also uncomfortable
after researching headsets no matter what company makes one they all seem to get negative reviews
not sure what else to buyi used this headset when it first arrived and it worked fine
put it in a drawer for  months took it out and now its broken
its flimsy and should probably cost about two dollars
find another option  i will beso dont follow my example cuz when it came the buttons were all sticky and some of them were broken
i aint buyin used electronics ever againi purchased a pink xbox controller because well thats just the sort of stuff girl gamers do
my red button basically broke in  months
i mean it still works if i press really hard but its just not responsive and theres no springback action
it just sort of gets stuckit also doesnt help that i just got the infamous  ring of death on my  last night
i already preordered a ps slim and i dont intend to go back to xboxthis controller is horrible
first off id like to say that microsoft ripped the wii u pro controller
clickable sticks l r and the rest
even they ripped the selecthomestart buttons from the wii u pro controller
if microsoft made this controller different i would like itthis is a ridiculous price for this item just like  is rediculous for the gb hard drive
this item should be around thirty dollars as that is how much they cost when they arent branded in a  logo
the ps includes wireless for free pretty much
when are you going to catch up ms even though you launched a year earlierfirst i like to say how xbox brags on how much cheaper they are to the ps
one word totally untrue
of course i had to purchase the  to find out
comon  for a wireless adapter when ps is built in
im sure it cost them like  from china to produce
if you must purchase one buy the linksys
i got it on sale at best buy for only  and it works with any game console not just the xbox
the xbox wifi does not have its own power supply it has to get it from the hardware itself causing it to heat up even more
as if you needed to get it any hotter then it already is especially with its hardware problemswhen you add the adapter to the  premium system thats  right there
dont the ps sell theirs for  also but it also has a bluray player and free onlinemicrosoft stop lying to the consumers and nickel and diming usthis adapter would have been just fineif it actually workedas with others on this site that have rated this item badly i agree
microsoft again released a product that only truly works on a very select few wireless routers which are not listed on any advertisement or on its external packaging
the manual instructions states that the adapter is best suited to run on a ag network
however most networks run on the bg otherwise known as wireless g
the result if not compatible is that it will still work technically but the bandwidth would be so terrible you couldnt even download mb file in under  min let alone the simple xbox live web pagesso to make it short only only buy if you know exactly what you are doinghigh priced for a simple task to dothe game adapter from linksys works better and more cheaper than thiswarningplease be advised before you buy this system that it will only work with two walls of distance between the user and the wireless routerand mind you these have to be very thin walls indeed
were talking a little bit of frame siding and plaster at the very most
if you expect to be able to receive a signal at all from a distance of more than two rooms or two rooms which have metal heating tubes in them you will be sorely disapointed and disgusted at the fact of spending over  dollars on a peice of equipment which does not workupdatechances are you arent going to buy this since the latest reviews are  years old
the adapter failed inexplicably after some time and refused to work
be sure to look into the new wireless n adapter or the dont worry about it at all since the xbox  slim models feature built in wireless n adaptersoriginal reviewthe wireless network adapter was pretty much a breeze to setup
i brought my xbox to my friends and it immmediately latched onto an available wireless networkat home i have a wep encryptedsecure network
through the console settings the adapter found my network
i think plugged in my password and it was easy from there
i wasnt sure how games like gears of war rainbow six vegas and lost planet read fun multiplayer games would handle
turns out they work out fine on my g networkill echo another reviewers issue when turning on the xbox you have to make sure that the usb plug is firmly seated into the usb port of the console
when bringing the console over to a friends i hadnt pushed it all the way in and there was no activity light on the adapter itself not red nor green no light at all
once i unplugged and plugged it back in it lit upso far so good
yes expensive but it works fineim very disappointed with this wireless adapter
i purchased this  months ago for my sons xbox   he has been complaining for at least  months about being kicked off live or just a poor connection
now it has completely quit working
thankfully i saved the old cord he had used previously to connect
its a shame this cannot not be returned its a complete waste of moneyim sure this adapter works well but microsoft should be ashamed of themselves
charging  for something that should be included with the xbox  premium pack
buy the linksys wgab
it does the same thing and costs  less
dont microsoft screw you out of your hard earned money
they have enough of it alreadyhonestly i think this is pretty bad and let me explain whyit says you can customize the opponents the style of the tournament etcthis is all true
however other than the tournament settings the changes seemed to have no effect
i wanted to simulate more of a real table with at least  bad player an aggressive player a tight player etc
so i go in and change the parametershowever the opponents played the same way no matter what i did with them
i even changed the strength of each hand to total opposites of their defaults and the opponents all played the same way
i dont think changing anything has any effecti tested this thoroughly i went and changed each opponent at a full table with various settings playing with them for hours and still they played just as they were playing before i altered themits ok as a simulator to play somewhat competent opponents under any style of tournament you want but since thats all it is and it doesnt do as advertised i give it a i am a big fan of adventure games in general and got this game on vacation this summer
i had only played it a few minutes when there was a dn and hl i expected this
in my mind that is mild language however that is not the extent of the severity of the language
immediately following these words was a gdn i really hate to spell it out but i am a christian and this type of language really offends me
other than the language this game looked very promising
the graphics were really nice and the voice acting was good just not what was coming out of their mouths
just to be fair to the company when i complained to them they were really great about it and willingly replaced my game for a more appropriate fitthe game isnt out no you dont own it you didnt win it in a contest
you are a complete tool for writing a review for a game that hasnt been released yet
oh and by the way you cousins friends uncle doesnt work for the company and that didnt give you  the game before it came out
you are an idiotbetween every screen is a  second load time
this is demoralizing to say the least  especially given all of the screens that one has to cycle through
it is truly absurd
i recommend virtual tenniscompared to ssx or ssx on tour for the playstation
this game suxsthis is a good game if you have played bowsers inside story or the other mario games that are like this then you should know what to expect
now some important information
wake up people and learn how to detect counterfeit copys of nintendo ds and gameboy advance games
counterfeit games do not work properly they have trouble with saving a games progress most of the time the game just stops working also all nintendo ds systems will give you error messages
if you keep getting error messages from the system when you try to load a game then the game is counterfeit
learn how to identify fake copys of games so you can avoid having your money stolen and having to go through the trouble of  buying the game again and bieng ripped of by dishonest sellerssucks big time  yuk yuk yuk 
they are making writ more i think i wasted enoght  time and money on the crap game  game plays fine but the original campaign is so boring and no group gameplay like bg or icewind dale
really seems like they went backwards in this game
npc characters and voice acting are good
the combat is really bland and boring
multiplayer is ok but other games like wow or diablo  just do it way better
if you want to play a worthwhile rpg start with bg iwd they just make this game obsoletei bought this game over a week ago from amazon and would really like to play it but so far have been unable to do so
i have the original nwn and have had no trouble playing it on my windows vista quad core machine
then i installed this diamond collection
the message i received on my screen said that the game is not compatible with windows vista
fine so i go to the website to download the patches and load one patch still the game doesnt work
then i try to download the other patch and its over  mb of programming
i start the download through my phonelines the computer is on all night until morning and in the morning the computer says you ran out of time whatever that means
so i go to the website again and try to get through to a technician and there is no phone number
so they give me a message that they have received my complaint and will get back to me which of course they never did
so here i am stuck with a  coaster
i really want to play this game if i could ever get it to work but i doubt it since i got no help from atari
now the atari corporate offices are in nyc and i could probably take the train over there and make a scene by using their disk as a frisbee in the ceos office but i doubt it would do much good
so come on atari and get your freakin act together so i can play what i paid for
just an update
it is now dec  and i havent heard a word from atari
its nice to know these companies couldnt care less about you buying their game and not being able to use it
if you do buy this game be sure not to have phone lines for the large download
and let me know if you enjoyed it since i will probably never play the game myselfjust an update
here it is jan  and im still waiting to hear from atari
maybe they wont call
duh
seriously last week i finally got high speed lines and contacted atari telling them that i still cant play their game
i went to the website and there was no patch for the diamond edition
when i go to play the game i still read not compatible with my computer
i am not computer literate and cant understand why i could play the old neverwinter nights with my vista and cant play the diamond edition
now they gave me another tech number and i am waiting to hear from them
why they had to do this to the game is beyond me
if i didnt need a patch with the original game then why the patch with the sequels
it doesnt make sense
one day when i am  i hope to have played the gamethis game will crash and ruin your computer no matter how many phony updates the morons at atari put on their website
this game ran well for  minutes and thats it
it looked like a great game but my computer has more value than taking a risk and ruining my computer trying to get it working
beware back up your computer like i did before installing this gameits always a bad sign to buy a game take it home and find a card inside the package directing you a website containing two big patches for the game
path of neo is a cool concept that got the rushrushrush treatment in my opinionafter applying the patches the game got a little further along before it crashed and burned taking my pc with it
cool the game comes with its own version of agent smith
the game would also freeze if i changed controller options oh dear
this is a trend in pc gaming  releasing games that are not ready for prime time then patching up the code later
unfortunately the patches for path of neo dont seem to work
oopsthe upside is that i did not pay full price for the buggy path of neo but paying anything for a broken game is too much
buy it at your own riskbefore you read my review click on some of the games that i have reviewed over the past four years here at amazon
im one of those long time reviewers on pc gamesso listen to the voice of authority
i gave this  star and heres whyi was so excited to buy this game and when it came out yesterday i pumped  into the cash register and i came home all happy and giddy
and then the nightmare startedfirst of this came as a dvdrom no problem for me
i have a p  with a mb ddr graphics card and  gb of memory so yes i was ready to play this game at max texture
the game will loadand this no kidding gigabytes of installation files
if you have a tiny hard drive better think twice before you install this game
luckily i have two  gb drives but still having gb gone to a horrible game is just too painful to bear at the moment
and then the nightmare happenedthe graphics are horrible
it was obvious that the graphics were completely ported from ps or xbox
the conversion was just poorly done
graphics were washed out it was like looking at a game that was marinated in clorox bleach for two days dried out and then plastered on your monitor
it is that bad
i maxed the texture to the highest resolution and even raised the maximum texture qualitybut it was hopeless
the graphics remained washed out and just utterly disgusting
make no mistakethis game is a poor conversion from a console game
it was pretty obvious that shiny entertainment got lazy with the pc versionok having undergone the first suffering i tried to convince myself that maybe the gameplay will save it
oh my god was i so wrong
you start out like in the movieright where neo was in the office being chased by agents
character movement was horrible
you could tell that the character was moving on some sort of rail like somebody put gridlines on the floor and neo could only move in a linear fashion
controls were completely unresponsive
i tried using a controller but it was still bad
you cant even configure your joystick
if you check the readme file it says there all the button configs have already been programmed so there is no way for you customize itthe gameplay was a long dragging struggle of mashing the buttons anywhere and everywhere
forget about key combos because they wouldnt really matter
just keep mashing that button and you will eventually win every level
the game even attempts to act like delta force black hawk down pc game where you operate a chaingun and straffing an office building while you try and save morpheus
all in all this game requires no brainpower at all no strategy you just basically follow the rails
you just follow one straight path into every poorly designed level
no flexibility totally linear in scope
this game is a sign that the matrix is finally dead
you know i could ask my dog to finish this game for mehe might get a high score just by gnawing and chewing my mouse hell eventually beat this gamethis game is dumb and yes i am dumb for having bought this game
this is prolly the worst ever game i have ever invested my money in itlet this be a warning to you buyer
you have been warned
be very very careful about plunking  on this
i suggest you wait for other reviews to come in before you hit the game stores
but i will tell you thispath of neo is a path to disasteri cant speak for the playstation  or the xbox versions of this game but as for the pc version which ive experienced there is no reason to buy it whatsoever
the game suffers from one fatal flaw you cannot adjust the controls for this game
when i plug in my logitech f gamepad the controls are preset and cannot be changed
the same problem exists with the scarface game on pc you cannot adjust the controls to your preferences after plugging in a logitech gamepad
i dont know why
you can adjust the controls for all of the grand theft auto games on the pc
but the matrix path of neo and scarface you cannot adjust the controls
i am completely unwilling to sit through more than  hours of either of these games if i cant adjust the controls to my preferences
i cant have any fun shooting running driving or performing combo attack moves with the preset controls on either game
the controls are awkward
they dont feel right
after just  days of owning it i donated this game to charity and ive never looked backi received this card a couple of days ago and to activate you have to scratch off a bar code like thing to access the code underneath so i did and also scratched off the code
what this means is that just paid  bucks for a valueless piece off plastic
xbox is a joke when i contact customer support they say duhhh you shouldnt have scratched so hard
at this point im planning on sticking with the ps for online play which doesnt set me back  dollarsenough to buy a new gamewaste of money these things are just a money pit console gaming companies are just trying to get money out of peoplethe fact that we need to buy xbox live points is stupid to begin with
we buy the system the xbox  and we pay  dollars for the games and now we have to buy xbox live gold cards to play online and then on top of that we need to buy gay points cards to access content and new maps for our purchased gamesbs
expected from microsoft though
when we buy a game it should include free updates new maps etcbecause microsoft apparently hired the dumbest people on earth to create their xbox live account system and man the online support phone numbers for it ive got to rate this a   if i could go negative i wouldi purchased an xbox   weeks ago and got it hooked up
but there are some huge gotchas amoung which is the customer support manned by people under the age of  it seems cannot actually do anything nor does microsoft care that they would piss off an lose a customer for life and have an xbox returned rather than give someone the ability to fix a mangled accountso my gamer tag and xbox live account are fine i can log in and use thembutto redeem microsoft points xbox live subscriptions or other codes and to use the messenger service you must be able to log into your windows livecom accountbut i bought an xbox  what does that have to do with windows live you may ask
indeed good questionmsft on your behalf creates a windows live account for you when you set up your xbox everything gets associated to that account
yes you only want to play video games but you will be forced to live with a windows live accountok so beyond signing me up for something i dont want  what the problemwell they ask you for a bunch of information that is none of their business and not anything they should have for you to operate your xbox  console and xbox live accountthey want things like date of birth physical address phone number credit card info
none of that they need and none of it they have from mebut and this is where it gets tricky they have  or more ways of accessing an account password reset  either through xbox livecom windows livecom a phone call to xbox live support etc etcand they all require that you provide a date of birth
it matters not that you have your name gamer tag and the secret question answer you set up  things that should be enough
nope they require you provide information they have no business having
so if you dont remember what fake birthdate you gave them you maybe screwedi can only recommend you dont bother with xbox live and microsoft points at all
the xbox  may be a decent console but the whole livepoints infrastructure and idiotic management is beyond incompetent in design and quality of customer support
it makes the horrid dell customer support system look good by comparisonno where on the page does it say you can only buy one card at a time but just tried to purchase more than one and got a message saying there was a limit on how many you could purchase i was trying to buy 
so if you buy this with the idea of saving a few bucks but then have to pay a few bucks to have it shipped to you its rather pointless
might as well just buy it right off of xbox liveyeah i guess you can try and find something else to buy to add to the cart but thats amazons way of trying to force you to purchase something along with the card
which i dont need or want anything else right now
very annoying that this policy isnt stated anywhere on the product page and you only find out when you go to check outedited to add  you are only allowed to buy one card ever  once youve bought one thats it
this should be clearly stated
you only find this out after youve added the card to your cart start the checkout process and then get a message saying one per customerlets simulate playing going to work having kids paying bills eating food and going to the washroomoh the fun
this game sucksa cool concept falls flat due to its reliance on checkpoints used to make the game challenging as opposed to creativity
you will have to do the same tasks over and over again simply because you will get killed before you get to the next checkpoint
overall this is a very short game but it is extended to at least twice its length based solely on repetition
doesnt seem like there was much effort to put this together after coming up with the overall concept
they just took the halo engine turned everyone into zombies designed a game half the normal length and filled it with checkpoints instead of user saves to make it seem longerunless you fly or flew ps you wont be able to get past the training part of the game
the plane stalls the controls are mushy and the flight characteristics of the planes are insane my hat is off to all the aviators in wwii who mastered these stall prone sluggish response war birds
give me the over powered jets in air combat  any dayi love flight sims i really love wwii games so the thought of a wwii flight sim was too much to ignorebut this game is just awful
ive played  levels of this game and some instant action and its just waaaaaay too difficult to control your plane
i am not a huge fan of arcadestyle sims i prefer a game like ace combat over something like after burner which is what this game reminds me of
dogfighting is a thrill but the controls are depressingly bad
its either too much pitch or not enough
and without the benefit of a stperson hud its even worse
essentially if you want a good wwii flight sim stick to something like microsofts combat flight simulator for your computer
until someone comes out with something like that for ps ill stick with the ace combat gamesi paid about  for this game brand new in the case sealed and i was practricly standing on my mail box waiting for it
when i got it to my suprise instead of playing for hours without blinking it did not work it loaded up to the menus and that alone was why i gave it  star before the campaign it just stayed on the loading screen for maby an hour and i just gave up on itdont buy this game
save yourself the hard earned dowe and buy san andreas and shoot down jets with the rustler insteadthis is the biggest disappointment ive had with a computer game that i can ever remember
if youre reading this youve probably been looking forward to civ iv also
well the publisher obviously rushed it out the door before it was donethe biggest issue is that its slow even on a nearly new top of the spec machine
and turning down the graphics details etc doesnt do all that much to help
the graphics arent that great anyway everything is a little fuzzy even on the highest settingthen there are a lot of minor but very annoying things that didnt get done
throughout the manual it says to roll over things to get help
but most of the help system apparently wasnt completed because theres no rollover helpit says to press escape to get out of screens
but it doesnt work on several of them you have to find the exit button and press it
and the exit button is in a different place on every screen  no consistency at alland then theres the web site  i went to try to see if there was any help or patches but it wont let you in if you dont have flash
some of us dont want or cant use flash  if you dont provide us an alternative then youre shutting out a lot of peopleid suggest skipping this game until either the price drops twenty bucks or they get some major patches out the door and let you into their web site to get themi played all the civs and for years enjoyed them
i was serverly disappointed with this version
nice eye candy but not much has improved in game play except it is a little more difficult to comprehend the other civs took some time to understand but they had a fun learning curve not so with civ anyway the main problem with this poro excuse for a game is that it is a memory hog and crashes so much that i decided to delete it from my pc and shelve it
i honestly wasted my money on this piece of junkwhile this is the first turn based strategy game i have played on computer i have enjoyed games such as warcraft starcraft empire earth warlords battlecry series and others
i was etremely disappointed when i started playing this game just to find out that on the easiest lvl i cant figure out how to win with any strategy
i dont care for wasting turns to build or research and it seems like half the game is just clicking the end turn button
maybe i was not doing something right or maybe im just not good at turn based style games
but the bottom line is i would not recommend it for fans of real time stratedy
its extremly restricting and i dont see how you can gain an advantage over your enemy if everyone has the same amount of turns
i also dont understand the fighting aspect of the game its takes alot of gold and time to build your army just to get it wiped out in the first scurmish and then you have absolutely no defences
i found the different characters on the playing board hard to find as they would stack and you had to mouse over and find the one you wanted from a small icon
when i bought this game i was assuming it would be more realistic and i had no idea that it is basically no more than a board game with ai
if you are looking to play risk buy this game but if you want warcraft find something elsei will continue to try and play it until i figure out how but it will prolly be the last turn based game i buybefore you buy this game download the free demo version and make sure it works on your computer
i have  pcs each with a different video card pro igm xt and it has severe problems on all three
the support forums have messages from tons of users with problems but very little feedback from the developer or publisher and no fixes released at the time im writing thistest the demo first
youll save yourself fustration and the hastle of returning the gamei have never been so fustrated trying to get a game to work
after reinstalling the game a number of times going through all the fixes reinstalling my video card etc etc
i can still not get this game to work
was this game even tested
check the forums for civ  and you will find that i am not alonei am extremely dissappointed
maybe instead of rushing a product to market to make money k games might think about testing to make sure it even works firsti had high hopes when i played this gamebut to my dissapointment the only innovativeor should i say newfeatures i noticed about this game was that its graphics and sound were improved but pretty much thats it when compared to civilization even new features like religion doesnt make a huge difference in gameplay even though throughout history the main source of change and influence was religiondont spend no  on this gametrust me
look somewhere elsethis is basically civilization  with improved graphics and soundthis review has been ammendedok so i now have a laptop that runs this game
its great
have a review under the collecters edition version
regardless i am still dissapointed by this lastest installment of the elder scrolls series on two fronts it was not made for the pc it was made for the  this is total crap seeing as how bethesdas loyal elder scrolls fanbase is built from pc players
its absolutely ridiculous that they would develop the game for the console
and a lot does feel like a console  the interface character interactions sellingbuying items etc the requirements for this game are ridiculous
probably another result of it being built for the next gen  im playing it on a mb x laptop card which runs it very well with good graphics
note this card is not supported
however many people with supported cards are getting nothing but trouble from this game especially if you have a lower end supported card
ive seen screenies of high end cards and let me say that the lighting on the faces hdr
looks really awefuljust be careful before buying this game
you must have nvidia geforce fx series  or above or an ati radeon  or above to play it
these spendy cards will not all run the game well
check out the bethesda forum for help if your looking to upgradeall i can say is dont bother
it seems to me to be the perfect example of form overshadowing function
the function of a game is to amuse the player
oblivion looks pretty good
water trees the sky weather etc are all rendered quite nicely
the world seems quite large and there are lots of people around who greet you when youre near and keep a schedule which includes sleeping at night etc
this can be annoying when you are trying to talk to an npc whos locked in their bedroom at night though
the game lacks a key feature though
namely fun
rpgs are fun because you get to explore and solve battles all the while gaining power and gear
a good story is nice too
oblivion has you walking around fighting such interesting creatures as wolf and bandit
in fact youre lucky if you happen on much of anything to battle with and most of my time was spent walking from one location to another
after a few hours of this i looked up the cheats and fast forward to the end of the game and while the monsters get a little more interesting they still lack anything special except maybe pretty graffix
as a previous reviewer pointed out the monsters level with you
so while walking around you will come upon ogre who are a royal pain to deal with and drop such exciting things as ogre teeth
i had to restart because after playing for a couple hours i came to the conclusion that the game is horribly ill setup for a magic using character
spells can be hotkeyed to numbers but only a max of eight items or spells can be hotkeyed
using a spell requires hitting the appropriate hotkey targeting the enemy as if you were playing a fps and then hitting the x key
oh and you cant switch spells while being hit so using combinations is more or less out of the question
so i switched to a warrior character and discovered using the cheats that they expect you to do combinations and special attacks using mouse gestures and different clicks
am i playing an rpg or am i trying to play street fighter ii turbo with a mousei understand if you liked morrowind maybe this sounds appealing to you
i do not like the first person view and the third person camera movement and feel is all wrong
the battle mechanics make this game about as much a fps as an rpg
oblivion goes beyond just being an action rpg as far as that goes
npcs will sometimes assist in battles and tend to get right in between you and the monsters and absorb your attacks
this becomes painfully annoying with tougher monstersthe character models looked okay but they were still just odd looking dolls and it actually made me appreciate the cartoonish wow graphics more
this is with the graphics set to ultra highthe inventory spells lists etc are poorly setup and look unfinished and out of place
the whole experience made me want to go back and play an rpg on the snessome people have discussed oblivion being a replacement for wow
frankly i really cant see this
wow is actually much more polished than oblivion and while the graphics might not scream for attention like those in oblivion the attempt at ultra realism in oblivion fails in my opinionin short lack of originality leveling monsters down right stupid battle mechanics and very slow game play make oblivion a poor source of entertainmenti received this game on friday the th of march
my computer was running intel extreme d onboard chipset
i changed the graphics out to a geforce fx pci graphics card w mb ddr and its own proccessor
this game turned out to be unplayable i couldnt even develope a character
the opening sequence the audio was broken and the video was jerky
at another place there were video artifacts
the graphics are kick ass fantastic its just too bad that this game was rushed to market before it was completed
hopefully the xbox version is better
oh yeah my pc is running a  ghz proccessor
oh well i still have alot to do in morrowindi have a voodoo top of the line line rig so the problems are not with the pcit is in the gamefreezes upblack screenblue screenyellow screenwhen turning half the screen goes blank sometimesnot worth the price or effortit got to the point that my pc would shut down on the blue screen of death
 the pc closed down to prevent damage near the end of the game it just quit loading
the loading bar would freeze about half way so i never got to finish the gamebeware this game could damage your computerits very hard to do this to oblivion but i must be honest this game isnt as much fun as daggerfall or morrowind duely based on a couple or threefourfive thingsfirst of all let me say for the most part if you have a midhigh end system the graphics are superb
as we well know though graphics alone do not make a great or fun gamethe initial parts are fun and quite challenging and to keep it mysterious for anyone still thinking about purchasing this im not going to go through them
im going to focus on what has made this game not fun for me and totally different from any other single player rpg ive ever played the pc ui is horrible totally horrible
it truely shows this game was made for the xbox and ported over to the pc with xbox controls you have to go through several functions to get to the page of the game you want like inventory or journal etc
etc
theres no ability to set hotkeys to these function like you normally would with a pc where i  inventory or m  map or c equals character stats or j  journal etc etc
you are forced to use what the game offers you and must memorize and learn a console system to play a pc game this one takes the cake the scaled npcmob leveling system where no matter what level you are the majority of the npcmobs are the same level or better
if you happened to find something you think would be extremely tough at level  like a dragon guess what
its level one also
only a handful of things dont scale level with you but things like wolves have a counter part like timberwolves that will be your level
its kind of funny when you level up something that was a wolf when you wake from leveling up will be a timberwolf just like that instant guard omnipresence constantly
those of you who enjoyed playing a theif in morrowind are in for a shock and surprise this time around
if you so much as touch an item that is not yours and belongs to another gang bang guards are going to appear and cart you off to jail unless you pay the fine
also as a thief what you see is not what you get you may see some glass weapons they look like they would bring a fortune and you go through all the trouble to steal them and get away only to find out you cant use them or they are an illusion and nothing more than a cardboard copy of the real thing sadly just like npcmobs loot also scales by your level in this game now
you can forget daedric armor or any decent armorweapons for a long time and it doesnt matter if you clear out what you think is the toughest dungeon you ever saw if you aint the right level yet you are going to get trash from the drops and trash from the chests and things you have to use lockpicks to openit almost feels like many mmorpgs where you have level restrictions on weapons and armorthe only open endedness of this game is where you explore
everything else is predetermined from the getgo to the end
now in everquest i enjoyed tweaking out my level  character in level  gear and then soloing through the game as far as i could
well you can forget that in oblivion youre only going to get and find stuff and fight stuff at your level periodim certainly glad that the store i buy my games from has a  day return policy because this one certainly went back before the  days were up
i know there are many out there that like this game mostly xboxers but the pc version was horribly designed and the design elements of the game do not allow roleplaying or godlike characters to be created through their adventure
sadly as you level up instead of things getting easier by your level everything gets harder because its always equal
 arrows to kill one goblin is rather rediculous when you could kill the same goblin with  to  arrows at a much lower level
stuff like that just makes this game a poor effort in the roleplaying minded aspects of itat first oblivion was a great game
the graphics are phenomenal the gameplay and customization are excellent and everything about the game is likable
i played elder scrolls and absolutely hated it however oblivion is an exceptional game i found myself addicted for  weeks straight
its certainly not everyones cup a tea but i cant see how anyone who likes actionadventurerpgs would not like oblivionwith that said i also had tremendous issues regarding this game
 hours into oblivion a friar npc was not following me anymore as he was suppose to be
i backtracked for about  mintutes or so and was easily able to find him
however the npc would not move one bit and after calling tech support i came to understand that there was a good chance of a corrupted save file
tech support was suppose to email though so that i could figure out how to send them a copy of my save file so they could rule out technical issues i asked how long and he replied  minutes once i hang up
well after  minutes and no email i decided to go ahead and start over
well another  hours in and i was having more serious problems
first off i would fall right through bridges and into the water secondly weaponsarmoritems wich were placed in storage disappeare and also i was being arrested when i had no bounty on my head etc
there was a whole slew of problems i had while playing oblivion
on top of those major issues mentioned there were several cases of glitches walking on air etc
after an exchange and another  hours i was having similar problems
normally i wouldnt have even started over the first time but it was a great game and i was enjoying it very much
but after  different games and  different discs i had enough
oblivion is no longer in my house and i certainly cant say its a spectacular game
and by no means do i have a crappy pc im running a p at  w  sdram and a nvidea  card running all a decent setting nothing too high for what i haveso while oblivion is a fantastic game i have to suggest to anyone buying to do so w caution
idk what my deal was and perhaps never will because of a half backside tech support who didnt seem to honestly care what my problem was
but the gameplay and game alone imo are worth at least buying and experiencing for youself
its truely a solid game and has sooo much to offer
just watch out for warning signs such as being arrested when you have no bounty on your head falling through bridges walking on air and items stashed away disappearingi went to  websites that were recommended for a fix
nothing worked
too bad
it looked like it would have been a promising gamethe first serious sam which was called serious sam the second encounter was a hoot because it was a first person shooter carried to a ludicrous extreme
you didnt have a dozen enemies you had hundreds and in a few cases thousands
the arenas were huge and looked pretty darn good
it was fast and intense even if it was mostly overkillthe game play is much worse every five seconds you stop with another conversation or  a cut scene
it also seems like some marketing maven decided cute was better you have to do things like protect the little blue people with big eyes
theres a big difference between being funny and stupidly juvenile
i kept feeling like i was playing a fisherprice game with gunsthe graphics didnt look good and the game engine seems to have some stability problems it crashed my computer autodetecting the video card
setting up the controls was also one of the most confusing dialogs ive seenpretty much this entire game is a miss
buy the first serious sam its much betterok the previous games were way better than thistheyve kept the humor of the game but as for the game play itself it was just flat out badi think what they did here was aimming this game at a younger audiancethe game desigeners made all the enemies look like they were cartoons like in one part there these giant mechanical spiders that screem and shoot acid balls at you
realy lame
and by hearing these this screem all the time will just make you want to put the game on mute
and theyve put way to many enemies in it i mean way to many even for the game itself
the game bogs down if it has to many programs all running at once
they made this game on impossable levels to play and if thats not bad enough they made a level setting called mentel witch i dont even know how anyone can get past the entire game with thatthey did have a couple of things that were good like in the early stage of the game you can get into this giant orb and run down a bunch of guys but thats it its nowhere to be found threw out the rest of the gameall in all you can beat the game but its realy streesfull
there will be times youll ask yourself can anyone beat this gamea dramatic difference between this one and the others in the series
though just about anything is better than gta i have to say that this was was less interesting than vice city
in this game there was more customization and bigger cities but that led to bigger glitches and more sluggish gameplay
aiming system and driving physics were all greatly altered from vice city to this one
and all for the worse
i had some strange glitches in which i would enter a building to either customize hair or change clothes whatever it was the character would never come out
some kind of strange glitch which forced me to reload a previous saveoverall i was highly dissapointed with the game when it was working and when it glitched
i say if you liked gta then play vice city but stop therei want to be nice to this game because there are soooo many terrible pc games out there however i just cant
i enjoyed the demo at first i was digging killing the zombies with the guns but then i ran out of ammo
at first i thought thats good because fps games tend to have too much available ammo where you can always use your best weapon but some good games will force you to use your other weapons which leads to gameplay variety
so i pick up my lead pipe to wail on these zombies meleestyle and what happens
the pipe is terrible
it takes foooorrreeeevvveeeerrrr for your character to swing the thing
now thats boring and consider i was playing john deere american farmer before that literally watching corn grow and was more entertained than this pipe swing
you could go make a pot of coffee drink  cups and then by the time you got back your guy would still be swinging
d  bottom line is any game that screws up on such a fundamental level of melee weapons isnt worth playing any longer
if you want a game like this play painkiller or condemned
the chronicles of riddick has much more interesting meleefist fighting action toothis is microsoft just trying to get more money for an ageing game
i love this game this is a fun game with a great story and you have to read the books to understand the full story
its the only game that does the whole thing well
people say the first game was nothing but a repeat of levels
true however it made the game have a more real feel to it
why would you build diffrent rooms everywhere on your space ship
or on a ring world for that matter
it was to the point hey this is a working ship and this is a working ring thing
what made the game was the enemy you fought and the story behind it
halo two was fun but the end killed the greatness it could have been
halo three better pick up where halo  left off
as much as i love this game this three pack will not become apart of my halo collection
i already own both games for xbox and  copies of the first halo on computer
i got the four books and the comic and both cds
i also can not wait for halo  and the halo moive
ok one thing about this three pack
 dollars
come on if i bought all three in their orginal case it would only come up too   tax
so why on earth would you buy this
by the orginal games it will be all three disk but with the whole box artwork
heck even if i bought all three and a computer copy of the game it would be  dollars cheaper
this would not be a good buy unless they lowered the pricei called xbox support last night and was talking to them about a problem i had
when they were troubleshooting they asked me to unplug every wire and tell them what i was unpluging
when i said i was unplugging the fan stand they said well theres your problem the xbox  is reading that as an extra power source and is thinking its a third party product that particular third party product is not authorized by microsoft and does void your warranty
i luckily got off with a warning maybe you wont do not buythis says its makes it more stable but i dont see how it rases it higher and if you tap the very top of the xbox  the unit will wobble slightly if not on a rock hard table the xbox  will fall over
my unit fell and broke the face plate
im gratefull the unit still runs or i would be sueing the maker
if there is a game in your unit when it falls the game is destoryedgames sucked dont believe the hype
i was looking ward  playing this collection only  b very disappointed
couldnt find  interesting thing about these game
wouldnt recommendthis game uses starforcethe suffering is one of my favorite gamesthis one goes to charitydo a google search of starforcethere is a site with a forum and a thread which contains this gameseveral had problems a few had big problemsi believe there is a patch i stopped reading as i already gave the game to charityjust wanted to update my review for those interested in the game or having problemsyoure a hunched over zombie
you move slow you slap people you thow your intestines and they explode you bowl your head and it explodes and you farttheres really no story to this game
blood guts and gore just dont make a good gamewalk slow slap at an enemy suck his brain repeat repeat repeatevery now and then is a cut scene for the poorly written plot the cheif of police is mad at you oh what a plotthough its first person everything is slower not because my pc is slow youre just walking through the entire game
slow action since you have to walk up to your enemiesyawnspend your  on any other game youre sure to have more fun and a more stimulating experience maybe with a plotbtw the copy protection doesnt slow down your pc
if you have the software to detect it and the type your intentions are less than noble why would anyone need to know what type and version of copy protection a game has
to copy it
boo spend the money well dont spend the money on this one but spend the money support the creatorsthis is one of the worst games i have ever played maybe the worst
even in really terrible games i can usually find something good to say about it but this one fails on every single level
play the demo before buying
if you enjoy it you have mental problemsthis game uses the invasive starforce drivers
this form of copy protection causes a lot of issues on your computer including shutting down cddvd drives and often times barring you from a game you legitimately own
i purchased this game and had multiple issues related to the driver
it locked me from playing and would reset my computer at boot up
finally managed in safe mode to figure out what was causing it and deleted the stupid thing
waste of money
legitimate game companies dont need to resort to cheap tricks like thati could hardly wait for this game to arrive only to find out that my computer doesnt meet the system requirements which were not laid out here on amazon
the game does not play with an intel chipset despite having d graphics abilities
how frustratingill wind up passing this along to a friend whose computer  although much older than mine  has the required video cardyou pay your money
you take your chances
if it runs on your computer consider yourself lucky
if it doesnt dont say you werent warned
my pc has run every major fps from doom to hl with no problem but cannot even launch this game
aspyrs tech support simply consists of telling you to download either a newer or older video driver
if that doesnt work then too bad or to use aspyrs support terminology resolved
seems resolved doesnt mean they got the game to run
it just means they stop trying
there are over  hits related to stubbs error messages on aspyrs own support site
guess theyre all resolved toogreat another game i have to give to charity
i wish i would have read jeremys review before purchasing haste makes wastei know people who have had starforce related issues
ive read forums where many have had problems with starforce and had more problens when trying to remove starforce
plus more drivers another way for viruses to get into my computermaybe ill learn to wait for reviews before purchasing try to instal it on two computers
no succesi read great things about this game and i believe them if only i could play this game
it is incompatible with vista
i have a new dell xps with vista and this game will not play
the company web site has no support or patches
the real problem is their anticopying software
you can blame windows but companies have to get with the st century and update their games as well
the only good news is it only cost me  eurosthe game loaded well needed to reboot  no big deal but it has a program protector  that destroys your computers driversso i did not complete the download processhad i know about the game protection system i would not have purchased the gamei dont doubt the people that rated this game higher than  stars enjoyed itbut they must be easily satisfied types with no desire to play a challenging or original game
i find most people like that enjoy easy to defeat enemies and lame aimy rating may seem harshbut trust me
download and play the demo first
you will get the idea very quickly
prey also made huge claims that it was going to be the game to beat
ha ha ha ha ha
too funnyif you have played hl doom  or fearyou will be biored with this lamerprey does offer  new concepts and  kind of new conceptgravity your character is an american indian and portalsamerican indian the main character is an american indianor native american
i really liked this
in real life i am  tall i lift weights and look like i just stepped out of a doom  marine platoon mission
i am sick of playing stereotypical blond haired crew cut muscle bound guys
i really enjoyed being an american indian
yiour character has a super powerhe goes into the spirit world which allows him to travel and do things his mortal body cannot do
nice touch
this was definitely a fresh new angle for gameplaygravity they threw the rules of gravity out the window
you can walk upside down side ways etc
this is very nice because you get lostconfused sometimes
it does mess with your middle ear a bit
lol however this does get old after the first  hours of gameplayportals enemies appear from portals
instead of enemies preplanted and waiting for you they pop out from portals
this is nice
you cannot always attack from behind and it is surprising when they swarm you
the problem isthere is just noit enough challenge to the fights or enough clever ai in the enemies to keep you hooked
some bob and jumpkind of reminds me of the old days of doom
yes
the enemies were that predictablenow to review the rest of the games featuresweapons lame uninspired and nothing that really gives you goose bumps
even the weapon sound effects were too quiet with no umppphhh behind themmusic ok not bad
then againnothing great
some old classic rock songs thrown in to give an earthy feelvoice acting down right horrible
no emotion no feeling no soul behind any of it
the grandfather was the only believable voice
very lame script too
down right awful altogethergraphics nothing new
not as beautiful as doom  fear or halflife gameplay ouch
talk about a yawn fest
i kept waiting for some challenging  visceral battles
nothing
everything was predictable and easy to beat
basically you spend your entire time winding your way through a space complex
predictable
you will find blocked paths and locked doors
predictable
creatures will try to stop you
predictable
as soon as you start walking on the upside down paths creature teleport in to attack youeverytime
predictabledear god it was predictable
weenies that cant beat hard games without trainers or cheat codes love this kind of game
it makes them feel like their gaming gods
real gamers will be bored to tears with this onenothing got my blood pumping nothing that made me cry out or grit my teeth
i doubt my pulse got above bpm
i never sweated a single battle or came close to dying
ughhh
the battles were too easyeven on the hardest setting
i finished the game within  hours
more of my money thrown out the windowsave your money
play the demo that is downloadable from the official site
play the demo twice
if you still have a cravingrent the gamethen if you still like itbuy the darn thing
i enjoyed this game at firstbut after hours  and  rolled byi knew this was going to be a stinkerwhy level up on this game
im a  level half orc warrior
im attempting to finish a mission where i need to kill from goblins
well i would have been better off doing trying to complete this game at level   as you level up so do all the ememies
so leveling up is pointless
you level up and the bosses get even tougher
this game had such promise but this really screws with the fundid not work when i got it
there were multiple scratches on it
however the company was great in giving me a refundthis is one of the greatest video games ever made
i dont particularly care for this genre of game but this will go down amongst my all time favorite games
all the raves of the other good reviews will give you advice on this games strengths of which there are manyhowever dont buy it on the   please save yourself the headaches and get it on a pc
ive had oblivion for a little over two months now and my xbox  can barely play this game
it is full of bugs
ive returned it twice and am on my third disk so i know its not an errors on the disk itself
its just tons and tons of software glitches on the import from pc to  which is funny since the  is just a pc in a pretty case
three of my close friends are all playing the  version as well and theyre all having the same problems im havingthere are plenty of downloadable features the orary the horse barding priate ship etc
 and these seem to have a negative effect on the software and cause a lot of trouble
however i didnt donwload any of this and my game is rife with bugs
if you go to bethesdas forums you can read tons and tons of posts discussing these problems you might even find me there
but ill sum them up for you the game freezes constantly
i think it has something to do with the dvd drive trying to load sounds and locking up unreadable disk errors are very common
the game will pause go black and give this type of errors
some times it even says to remove the disk and put in a game designed for the  strange loads
sometimes youll load saved files and appear in the world paralized and halfway inside of your avatarbethesda is no help with any of these problems
on the forums many people have posted their customer support replies and theyre all the most generic im not listening plug your ears and hum responses ive ever readas ive said this is one of the best games in a generation
but stick with the pc
you may be one of the fortunate ones with no bugs but if youre in my boat youll be spitting mad at dumpting  for a coaster
if id have bought the pc version id have beaten the stupid thing by nowtry before you buy
this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over againbewaredo not believe the glowing praise of corporate shills  the marketing of this game is based on deceptionfirst scroll up and look at the two pictures next to the game description see that detailed little city
in actuality when you play the game this city will be smaller than a postage stamp on your screen
wonders and buildings will appear on the map
sure they will but they will be a quarter the size of your units and so small as to lose all character
that is what has progressively happened to this series it has lost its flavor and become more bland and less grand
maybe the genre is just tired but more likely those who made this game have just run out of fresh ideas and are busy trying to address the micromanagement issues that have always been a problem with turnedbased games
here is a secret blockheads people will gladly micromanage a game if the payoff is goodbut that is not what we have here
there is simply no payoff for sitting through a game of civilization iv
so where has the payoff gonewonders are still there but they have become practically useless
instead of a couple dozen worldchanging wonders that really make a difference to you civilization think free granary in all cities double productionresearch where built we now have six dozen wonders that give benefits like  to great person build rate  health in city built provided availability of clams
gone are the animations where we see a little story about the importance of the wonder couched in its historical context now we have animations that show the wonder being constructed like a claymation tinker toy set
get a clue we dont build wonders for architectural aesthetics but for the benefits they providein a normal game you simply will not be attacked by other computer players
this is fine because should you dare stop building your national monument to aardvarks  city defense vs burrowing mammals and actually build military units the computer players will surge ahead of you in all other fields and still have time to raise a massive army
the military promotions that you are promised are useless as well because you will watch your welltrained iron age legionaries that took  ingame years to construct be wiped out by marauding cougarsa functioning religions system is overdue but is so poorly implemented and has such a tacked on feel that it will basically be ignored once the religions have been discovered and your culture has a least one of its own founding
in order not to offend anyones religious beliefs no religion offers benefits over any other so the only real effect of religion is that it makes people with the same religion friendlier diplomatically
since those with close borders will often share the same faith they wont attack each other which leads back to the whole issue of no wars
another hint to the designers you didnt have to use actual world religions you could have said animistic polytheistic monotheistic reformed fundamentalist meditative and so on then given benefits and detriments to those broad qualities of religions without offending anyone
it would also avoid the awkwardness of saladin appearing with a muslim crescent on his head while demanding i convert to his state religion buddhismlike most games that try to solve the micromanagement dilemma the answer for civilization iv is more automation
take a lesson from the disaster called master of orion  when you make the player ancillary to the decision making process in order to facilitate your poor game design you have failed and must start over
people dont want to play on autopilot they are willing to manage even the most complex tasks if the reward they get gives them a feeling of satisfactiona note to those who already bought this product if you are having trouble with this game just let the computer choose what you build what you research where you place cities and what improvements are built around your city you really are not necessary anymore you already wasted your  thats all that was required of youon paper this game sounds greatbut then you put it in the consoleits a train wreckwhat was atari  thinking being the  distributor 
my copy crashed several times by the rd stage it completely froze upusing george romeros name  try to sell a title could work if you put the time and quality to make a polished gameroad to fiddlers green is a very cheap looking tech demo titleby far one of the worst original xbox titles ever  be releasedim a huge george a romero fan and hated this titleit belongs wherever that stash of atari  et
games arebuy  your own risk  let me start off by saying that i am a huge fan of the george romero dead films with dawn of the dead being my favorite and i really enjoyed the recent land of the dead
when i heard that there was going to finally be a video game based on the dead films i was freaking out
and then to find out it was going to be a first person shooter was even better
my excitement towards this game let me overlook the fact that this game was being released quickly and would be released at a cheaper price than most new releases
well i should not have let my excitement get the better of me
this game is a huge disappointment
the graphics are okay but could be so much better than what they are
the movement of the character is awful and the hit detection when you shoot the zombies is bad
no matter where you shoot them it doesnt matter
even as a true fan of the romero films i cannot recommend this game
but i know that true fans such as myself will ignore the criticisms and still want to play this
so if you really have to rent it
in the end you will be glad that you didim a big big fan of horror and all the zombie movies from george a romero so i was very excited when i bought this videogame
its horrible its going to take you  or less minutes to realize that this game is very very bad its a first person shooter with nothing to offer at all the zombies dont die with a bullet in their heads i tought this was a george a romero zombie movie they are suposed to die with a bullet in their head and it doesnt matter where you shoot them they die with  bullets anywhere you shoot themstay away from this videogame believe methis is by far the worst game i have ever played
i read all the reviews first but being the romero fan that i am i bought it anyway
boy was that a mistake
i loved the movie land of the dead and was willing to accept the limitations of a movie tiein game
but thats one of three main problems with this game
it hardly ties in to the movie at allthe only resemblance to the movie is an appearance by a dennis hopper lookalike toward the end
you are supposedly cleaning out fiddlers green
could have fooled me
it looks nothing like the movie
your hero bears no relation to the movie at all
hes a john waynelooking redneck farmer
probably not your first choice for an avatar but you take what you get rightimagine about a dozen of the most generic shooter levels you can think of
then scramble them up in random order toss them together with a flimsy story and go
the results
awful
thats the second horrible thing about this game  the level design
to say generic is an insult to respectable generic cereal everywhere which i love to eat
you have your hospital sewer street etc
and dont even get me started about the random stacks of hay bales conveniently forming a maze
repetitive to say the leastbut by far the worst thing about the game is the glitchy controls and programming
it takes  hits sometimes  or  to kill a zombie
their heads may blow up at random but that seems to have nothing to do with where you shoot
they are repetitive and annoyingthe worst is how the enemies spawn
you always know when an enemy is near because the moment they spawn the screen jerks for a moment
there can be nothing onscreen but the screen jerks and that tells you a monster is coming
patheticthe only things the game got right was the limited ammo forcing you to conserve
you have to learn melee attacks in order to survive
this was the only satisfying thing hitting a zombie in the head with a golf club or pipei also liked one moment when you have to snipe to help a buddy
but between the boring monotonous levels those kind of moments are few and far betweenthe game is dark and bleak
which is fine for a horror game
only this one also adds in ugly level design and glitches for a truly joyless gaming experience
other people say this game is fun
i disagree
it is wretchedi spent a lot of money on it so i stuck with it
and when i wanted to quit i decided to finish anyway
but i sold it immediately afterward and im the kind of guy who never sells games
to say there is no replay value is an understatementi never tried the multiplayer
i dont think i would want to spring this game on my worst enemydont be taken in by the good reviewers here
they are still in denial trying to rationalize the money they wasted on this game
theyre not yet ready to face the truth which is a painful experience i knowplus the fact that this game keeps getting more and more expensive may make you think it is a collectors item
dont believe it
learn from my experience fellow zombie lover
just because its got romeros name on the front does not warrant your purchase trust meso if you like to spend lots of money and you like horror games minus the fun then by all means buy this
otherwise i would highly recommend purchasing the thing
it is a horror survival movie tiein game that they actually got right for a changethanks for readingi always loved pac man and bought this game for my ds
when i played it i knew i had wasted my money on a piece of garbage
i wish it would be better although some of it is in a diffrent launguage
i just asked my neighbor to tell me what it said
but i do not reccomend it to anyonei like the idea of playing a villian and playing with better graphics that wow has too offer
but the main and only two problems are the constant disconnects and  half the video screen which is barbled or tearing on my laptop
now i have two systems one is an alienware with a nvidia card and the laptop a dell xps with a ati mobility
i  made sure everything is upgraded and tweak too work with most games
but  there is nothing i can do if cov is having compatibilty issues with the ati mobility card as stated in their website still being worked on
the tech support technician states that the problem is with my system and and isp
i play other online games and i will definitly know if there is a problem with my isp not so i decided it is best to cancel my subscription since i cannot enjoy the game and have next to nil on getting any help from tech support
i do not know what high end system is needed or what else must be tweaked
all i can say cov is a nice concept and nice graphics but i guess it all depends on what high end pc system you are using
i wish you better luck in enjoying the gamethis is by far the worst adventure game i ever tried lame graphics no good story strange puzzles so silly sometimes so impossible to guess on other times like the maze puzzle in the middle of it it took only  hour and half to finish itafter resorting to a walkthrough to solve the maze the long dialogs cannot be skipped you are forced also to watch the complete list of credits when you start and when you finish the game with no way to stop itif the rating has a minus  i will rate it a minus  starsthis use to be a very good game full of depth
they just did a massive change to the game hoping to get some of the market share from wow
they tried to make it feel more star warsy
what they did was tear it apart
it is no longer an rpg
its also not a first person or third person shooter
it really is nothing at all now
for anyone that has ever played a decent shooter youd laugh at just how bad this is
to speed up combat they just sped up the game
animations look terrible now
crafting and entertaining basicly has been taken out
they went from some  professions to   if you take crafting and entertaining out
a major reason this game was so enjoyable was that you could do anything you want
now youre stuck into a profession darn near forever
you cant mix and match like you use toextthis game lost a lot of players after the combat upgrade a few months ago
and again they are leaving in droves
i see this game getting shut down by early next year
dont put a lot of time or any into this game its about to go down the drainits not just about the game changesthis should be a warning for all who choose to invest their time and money into this gamesony online entertainments treatment of their customers is the real issue heremost other publishers release a finishied game then need a few patches here and there to fix gameplay issuesthis is two years later and the issues that were problems still exsist with a new skin and targeting systemthis is something that required many months of beta testing not two weeks worth and pushing it out to paying customers and let them test itso be warned you may like it you may not
i personally dontbut save yourself the trouble of spending good money and try the free trial first
it will be worth it for the long run if you dont like itsony online entertainment makes great games when they are original such as everquest and even everquest   but every intellectual property they aquire from the matrix to star wars  they kill ithonestly how can you ruin a game based on something as immensely popular as star wars
especially so soon in the afterglow of the episode iii dvd releasesoe shows you how  through doing the exact opposite of what you are taught in every customer service class you will ever attend
lie to the customerssoe has lied constantly as it relates to changes being made
a recent lie was advertisements for the latest expansion to star wars galaxies  and promises of new items etc
for certain professions
 day after charging customers who preordered the expansion  charges fresh on the credit card bills  soe announced changes to the game which eliminated  professions and forced you into one of  professions which were broken horriblythis was actionable enough for a lawsuit that they were forced to give a refund to customers  but of course that took    weeks to process
dont listen to the customercustomer asks for a bug fix
offer him an expansion for the modest sum of 
want the bug fix bad enough
fork over the  or we wont make it
character bugged
spent  years building him up to the level hes at
delete him  we cant be bothered to fix him
call every nerf everything that changes in the game etc
to make it more star warsy
star warsy is a madeup term crafted in the soe spin department
this term was generated in order to say i was making things more star warsy instead of being forced to say i was just making  of the items youve aquired over the past year worthless
not only do they nerf the players to the point of unplayability  they leave the enemies stronger than everi lose fights to cavemen armed with sticks and wearing loin cloths even though i hit them  times with a lightsaber  barely leaving a scratch on themstay awaythe developers of the game scrapped the game system for the second time and put in this new unfun game system
the combat is way too fast
the combat is also very stupid looking
looks like your charcter is a hyperactive monkeythis game went from one of the best games that i have ever played to the worst game i have ever played
sony has the worst customer service anyone has ever seen
they treat their customers like pieces of dog poo
dont let them abuse you avoid this game like you avoid your ex girlfriendswgnge is a highly bugged extremely laggy fps first person shooter in which you can advance a character to level  but the game only provides true missions through level   after you hit level  you must buy the newest expansion in order to get any worthwhile missions that will advance your character to the  levelyou should also know that there are already consumer complaints aginst soe in all  states for the way they have run this game
for example expect no in game support form soe in this incredibly buggy game and no refunds if your game does not work
the only support you will get is a preformated computer response with an alleged human name attached to itthey have abandonded the orginal role playing aspect of the game dumbed the game down to an  year olds level and will force you to play the game in a linera fashion ie
keep repeating the same mission until you pass it
plus there is no galactic civil war you know the basis of star wars play ability in the game
even though this game takes place at the time of the destruction of the first death star there are litteraly thousands upon thousands of jedi in this game at a time that there was only three alive luke yoda  darth vaderlook for  bucks and one month free play go ahead and buy it for your  year old
if you are a star wars fan or looking for an adult level game please please do not waste your time
there are at least three brand new star wars fps you can buy
go buy one of them
if you want depth of game play this is not the game you are looking for move alongavoid this game like the plagueill even go as far as saying this game has driven me to the point of completely boycotting any sony andor lucas company permanentlytheres so much more i could say but honestly its simply not worth my time to tell you or your time to listenits simply that badi got this posting from a former guild of mine when i was doing swg
looks like the swg problems made the ny timesby seth schieselpublished december  for two and a half years emily e labeff chairwoman of the sociology department at midwestern state university in wichita falls tex spent  hours or more each week playing the online computer game star wars galaxies
not for research but for funlogging on to the game on weekends and many nights after class ms labeff directed athena wavingrider a powerful jedi she created through the far corners of the star wars universe fighting on behalf of the rebel alliance against the tyranny of the galactic empire
like millions of other online gamers ms labeff  discovered a camaraderie and friendship with other players that were far more important than the play itself  relationships that can be hard to replicate in real life
its replaced my television time and i dont go to the movies anymore she said chuckling
i dont keep my car as clean as i used to
but its not because of the game itself
its because of the people
she added we all had this wonderful second life together
and now its all gone at least in any form that ms labeff and thousands of other star wars galaxies veterans would recognizelast month lucasarts and sonys online game division which have jointly run star wars galaxies since its introduction in  suddenly turned the game upside down making the most sweeping changes ever made to a persistent online game
persistent means that the game world is constantly running and players may log in and out as they please
unsatisfied with the products merely moderate success the companies radically revamped the game in an attempt to appeal to a younger more triggerhappy audiencepreviously the game was unabashedly complicated appealing to mature reflexchallenged gamers with its strategic combat style and deep skill system which allowed players to carve out profitable powerful niches as entertainers architects and politicians
now the game has become selfconsciously simple with a basic pointandclick combat system that is meant to evoke the frenetic firefights of the star wars filmsto sony and lucasarts the changes are a necessary step to help the game appeal to a broader audience
the companies do not release subscriber figures but many gaming experts believe that before the changes star wars galaxies had about  subscribers each paying about  a month
but to thousands of players the shifts have meant the destruction of online communities that they might have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours constructing
now many galaxies players are canceling their accounts and migrating to other online games
they are swapping tales on refugee web sites with names like imperial crackdown imperialcrackdowncom
ms labeff for instance said that she had canceled all three of her galaxies accounts and had joined a new guild in world of warcraft another game with her old star wars friends
someone might wonder well its just a game whats the big deal
said robert kruck  an engineer for motorola who lives in schaumburg ill who said he had canceled seven of his eight galaxies accounts
but for many people it is much more than a game he said
it is a part of their lives where they have invested huge amounts of time building a community
and that community has been based on a sophisticated mature game
so now for them to take an adultlevel combat and economics simulation and turn it into a mindless game for yearolds is a violation of that community
for sony and lucasarts the idea has been to make the game more star warslike tying it more explicitly to the films
we really just needed to make the game a lot more accessible to a much broader player base said nancy macintyre the games senior director at lucasarts
there was lots of reading much too much in the game
there was a lot of wandering around learning about different abilities
we really needed to give people the experience of being han solo or luke skywalker rather than being uncle owen the moisture farmer
we wanted more instant gratification kill get treasure repeat
we needed to give people more of an opportunity to be a part of what they have seen in the movies rather than something they had created themselvesms
macintyre said galaxies had lost significantly more than the  to  percent of players who typically leave any online game every month
she said she expected the game to return to its previous subscriber levels in six months a process she hoped would be accelerated by the introduction of a new television infomercial hawking galaxies later this month
we knew we were taking a significant risk with our existing player base but we felt so strongly that we needed to make these changes for the sake of the games longterm future that we all held hands lucasarts and sony and went forward ms macintyre saidit may however be a rocky path because the revamped game is receiving mostly horrible reviews from players
on gamespotcom a leading game web site about half of the more than  players evaluating the game have rated it abysmal
some  percent have called it terrible and  percent have described it as merely bad
the game is described as perfect by about  percent and other by  percent
we just feel violated said carolyn r hocke  a marketing web technician for ministry medical group and st michaels hospital in stevens point wis ms hocke said she once had as many as  separate galaxies accounts but has canceled all but one in the last two weeks
for them to just come along and destroy our community has prompted a lot of deathinthefamilytype grieving she said
they went through the astonishment and denial then they went to the anger part of it and now they are going through the sad and helpless part of grieving
i work in the healthcare industry and its very similar
now then it looks like that smedly his very hell bent on staying the games exisiting courselooks like they would rather see the game stopped then attempt to save it or give into player pressure
there is a possible date of feb  when la and soe are going to meet and rather decide to keep this going or stop it totallyit is about time soe stop living there dream world and face up to reality
swg should not be turned into something it isnt
it was find under the orginal system
but to make sudden changes without player support is plain insane
they can make all the changes they want just dont except the general public to pay for crapas for the yay sayers the soe defenders go a head and defend this crapjust realize that swg days are now getting numberedthis card didnt let me put any memory at all on it
when i go into the card sellecter that card said  mb avalablethe card is worthlesswheres the option to give this product a zero
it only goes as low as one
so a one rating is what this product will getits horrible
it will save your gaming progress for only a few months and then suddenly all the data will disappear and all the hours of work you put into your games will be gone in an instantafter that happens you will no longer be able to save your game again
any playstation  game
the memory card just dies out of nowhere
junkthe card works in my ps which is at least better than the others here
the problem is that because ive saved more than mb to the card it no longer allows me to save
this means creating new files or updating old ones
im leaving the ps on until tomorrow just so i can save the progress i made tonighti havent gotten to the point of corrupt save files yet as far as i know
then again i havent tried to load everything on the card yet so there may be things that are corrupted
at this point i wouldnt be surpriseddont buy this card its a waste of your money
youre better off with a sony or a nyko
i have two nyko cards and have never had a problem with either of themfor my fw friends well folks you are prob thinking this is a good deal
it is not
i bought this from toys r us back in march  and it was incompatible with my pstwo slimline
tried it in another mine is an scph version   same result
finally tried it in a fat playstation  and it ran flawlessly
but that was only for a few days as i returned it
did not want to have something that did not work in the slim playstations
so do yourself a favorif u own a slim pstwo then this will probably not work
research before wasting your money
good luck seriusblacki spent  dollars for this card at target
i stupidly threw out the wrapping and slipi simultaneously purchased kingdom of hearts ii along with the card
playing that perfect game and then not being able to save was the most frustrating experiencethis card simply does not work
why it is being sold is beyond me
this item should have never been allowed on the market to begin withi bought two of these at my local walmart about a year or two ago thinking i was getting the best for my buck
i looked at the  mbs which were about ea
then i saw these
they had more than twice the space and only cost me about ea
i thought to myself wow what a great deal
now just a few weeks ago both of them simultaneously reformated for absolutely no reason
all my data was either corrupted deleted or fragmented
i had save files for over fifty games on both of these with lots of space to spare
it just so happens after they reformated they still have the same amount of space left
like all my data disappeared but was still there
a few days afterwards my friend who bought himself one of these memory cards about the same time i did had his reformat too
im not sure if this was just a factory defect or a conspiracy to make you buy more of them when your old ones died like the way soda companies do with adding salts so you drink more
either way i would recommend that no one buy one of these unless you have the money to get separate memory cards for backup or dont care about losing datagrandia may have the best combat system of any modern rpg aswell as a solid system for character development
in these respects grandia is at the top of its class and it makes the first half of the game a spectacular ride
as much fun as part one is the second disc is a huge disappointmentthe story is a horrific mess a little kid could craft a story with more compelling characters and narrative
it is a huge shame because the voice actors are the very best in the business but their talent cannot make up for the huge mess of a story
theres not a hint of intrigue or suspense and either the dialog was translated poorly or the writers were just terrible
the second disk brings nothing new to the system bring the story down even dumber and becomes an exercise in frustration instead of fun
there are no extra sidequests or bosses you already access the strongest spells halfway through the game and the most annoying enemies are the ones populating the entire final dungeonless than an hour from the final boss i would have thrown it out it was just so bad and that is where the game should be at its most exciting
if you are only a passing rpg fan you will hate this game and rpg fans will be dissapointed by what at first feels like a great ride that becomes a giant mess of a game
never before has my opinion of a game plummeted like it did while i played grandiai love the grandia serieslet me repeat that
i love the grandia series
ive played all of them so far and have never been disappointed until now
grandia has always offered a variety of unique gameplay opportunities and compelling storylines as well as characters
it wasnt everybodys cup of tea but thats okay
it was minegrandia iii is the worst of the series
let me explainthe good  the gameplay was still in the spirit of grandia
in other words the battle system was still based on the grandia engine
thats the saving grace of grandia iiithe bad  the story spoiler alert the story was very short and uncomplicated
it followed a very linear progression with no surprises or logic
the group is ripped off by a jerk and then treats the jerk like a trusted family member
he quickly becomes the main characters father figure
thats not the worst part of it all
there are some set boss battles which must be fought
this is the standard in all rpgs
grandia iiis boss fights do not match up with the story
there are several fights which you have to win just like in most rpgs
after the fight the boss doesnt even recognize or act like he just got beaten
after one battle the boss kidnaps one of the characters
it plays out as if the characters lost to the boss
theres no logic nor reason to it at all
this is what happens in most of the boss fights
after a lot of hard work the story progresses as if the boss actually won when in fact the boss lost
character design one dimensional
the characters appear to have been inspired by anime
theres nothing original nor unique
to make matters worse the voice acting is painful to hear
the voice actors hired sounds like they are reading from a script and nothing more
ive never heard i love you sound like i want to go get a cup of coffee before playing this game but well there you go
the big bad guy
spoiler alert  xorn
the one dimensional bad guy
the guy hates love
he repeats that a lot
he hates love
thats his motivation
he hates love
wowhe wants to kill love
thats as deep as it goes
the player never learns why he hates love
it is because he is the representation of hatred
did he get spurned by a rival godgoddess
thats never flushed out
he has only one dimension
he hates love
the soundtrack the games main theme is a bubblegum song by some japanese female band
it could easily be played on the disney channel by one of their generic cookie cutter groups
the song didnt inspire awe wonder excitement nor adventure
it had no place on an adventure rpg
the rest of the soundtrack was largely forgettable
grandia tended to have beautiful music
this one broke from that tradition and proceeded to be just plain awful
there is nothing about it that sticks outavoid this gamei received this game as a gift and it simply wasnt very much fun
gameplay is unrealistic and hyperactive
i honestly didnt bother learning much about the ingame goals or teamworkit just wasnt interesting or involving enough to dedicate the timei enjoy fps games and just beat cod and im working on bioshock and crysisnone of these are phenomenal when compared to hl but all are better than qwetthis is the final nail in ids coffin
quake is offically dead
how could the company that gave us catacombs wolfenstein d doom doom ii final doom quake hexen hexen ii and heretic give us such garbage over the last few years like quake  quake  quake  wtf
 doom  heretic ii and now this piece of trash
if you want to make these games make them but dont ruin them but slapping a quakedoom logo on them to sell them that only makes fans think you sold out and are now making horrid gameswhich you are
id have served their purpose now they have been bought out hopefully we will see some respect and dignity and most of all fun brought back to doom and maybe a real sequel to quake forget that this piece of garbage is a gta clone for a momentit doesnt even workit has frozen on me  times in a rowunable to get pat  of completion due to freezesinexcusable for a piece of trash that has been out this long to do thishell no the disc was all scratched up and had smudges onit did not work at all yet alone read iti swear the developers lost half their plans for this game in a fire or something
this is the worst game i have ever played
this game is more annoying to me that tmnt for nes wasaithe ai on this game though sometimes good is limited to about a  iq when fighting
though at first the ai seems great soon enough you realize that your homies are dumb
they will go running into a gun fight against  gang members with big weapons and they will die every time
when you throw a grenade they run straight into it
they will run right in front of you when you are shooting and dieplotthough at first the plot seemed good and even though the voice acting is superb you soon find through the missions the plot gets less and less deep
in fact some of the plot is missing
youll find yourself wondering if you just missed a whole cut scene but you didnt
also it gets very very simple
you can basically guess whats going to happen nextmissionsnot only are some missions near impossible because you will be up against  guys with rpgs but the game will throw such insane things at you that you cant possibly survive
like going into a mission or defending your turf
you will be doing fine then suddly when youre almost done  or  cars of guys will drive up and they will all jump out and shoot you full of holes with machine guns
you have  seconds to kill them all
you dont have enough time to regain health
some missions seem simple like hijack a truck and bring it back
simple except  gang cars will be shooting at you and blowing out your tires while trying to run you off the road
not only that sometimes the cops will join in too
one time i was run off the road and the truck was stuck
i couldnt move it
i couldnt do anything but wait and watch the timer reach glitchesthis game is full and packed to the brim with glitches and bugs
not only will it sometimes slow your game down so much you can barely move but will sometimes freeze the screen and you have to load from save
glitches go so far as falling through the highway and crashing your car in a ravine
not falling off the highway falling through it
ive gotten out of a car and appeared waist deep in concrete
ive had my guys decide not to get in a car
ive been unable to get out of the car
ive had a car impossibly flip over a small curb and start on fire and it wouldnt let me out
ive had the controls freeze up so i cant move while people are firing at me
ive had my car disappear when i get out and move the camera away to kill someone
ive had cops come bust me when i didnt do anything
ive had a guy hit me and my guy wouldnt get up then i was blown up by a grenade
i was hit with an rpg and then couldnt get up in time to be hit with another rpg and die
ive had enemies spawn right behind me and kill me
ive had people kill me with a machine gun or handgun from such a far distance i couldnt even see them
i would need a sniper rifle to kill them they were so far away
i had a guy shooting at me with a gun and taking half my life away
i shot back at him with the same gun and even though my sight was dead on i didnt hit him once
ive died when nothing was hurting me
ive had cars randomly appear and run me over killing me in a mission
ive had my character magically disappear a loading screen comes up then i appear somewhere completely different on the map and it wasnt a hospital or store
just a random place
ive had enemies im supposed to chase down disappear from the road right in front of me and appear somewhere completely different on the map i cant even get to
your homies have no accuracy but the gangs against you are dead on with the most inaccurate weaponssome glitches in this game were so bad i couldnt play it
some parts were so rediculously hard it took pure luck to beat it
im not bad at this game
ive had witnesses
im not the only one to say these things
im going to try and get my money back from thq
this game is badly developed and seems only half done
all the glitches i stated were playing the game normally and using cheats doesnt have any affect on it
ive tried boththis game isnt hard its badly designed
its nothing wrong with my  or the disc its the programming
ive done debugging on program code before so i know the difference between a hardware error and a software error
if you go to thqs website you cant get online support for this game
this game didnt have a website or any link on thq until a few days ago
this game had absolutely no quality assurance and this makes me afraid to purchase any thq game
this game has more glitches and problems that any other game i have ever played dating back to nes
i would not buy this game and dont recommend it
this game would be great if it werent littered with problems
its just a horrible halfway done rehash of a grand theft auto game
it is not worth even a dollar
this is a faulty productdont believe the hype
this game is not only derivitive of the grand theft auto series it is quite repetitive and boring
most of all there are too many glitches and bugs that wasnt fixed before it was even shipped
you will find yourself walking away from your car only to find it gone
then there are those ridiculous challenges where you are expected to go from point a to point b while being gunned down by several enemies from unrealistic angles
if you like your game with lots of swearing then this game is for you
but if you look more than lots of swearing then stay away from this highly overhyped rubbishthis game was a big mistake dont waste your time with this crap the graphics are filth and its so difficult almost impossible to beat cause the ai is foolish  and all the stages look the samelike cluttered garbageim just going to sum up how horrible this game is in a coulple of sentances
bad campaignbad guns and when your on live play you run all of the way across the map before you see someone and you usually get killed
the only thing that is remotly fun about this game are the vehicles
dont wast your money on this crappy gamei would like to begin and say battlefield bad company is one top favorite multiplayer games
i would come home from a day at work and would play with a friend online
we would have a competition to see who would get more kills
pure gaming bliss  i enjoyed that game so much that i tried to buy another game from the same series
big mistake  the only pleasure i could see someone having from this is either from unlocking achievements or flying the overpowered helicopter in multiplayer
the controls were horrible the weapons were worse and your ai squad were next to useless
the multiplayer servers are going offline for good on 
the only pleasure i have in playing this game is knowing that once i beat the game i wont ever play it again
yessi started playing but soon quit as the visuals were rather primitive
this game did not engage me at allits just that the product didnt work when you start the game it froze on the town menu you picked so it wouldnt even go into that town or any of the towns for you to play
so i couldnt even play the game
all of my other sims games play perfectly fine on my computer but not this one
so go figureeverybody loves this game and i cant figure out why
its almost impossible to get money you die far to easy and the missions are tedious hoo boy lets get a haircutgood times
i played true crime and it was soo much better than this
maybe i didnt play it long enough maybe i just suck royally at this game but i didnt think it owned up to its famegave this game about  hours of my time
it was  boring and i just didnt like the control setupi really really wish i could write a good review for this gameunfortunately i cant run it
reason why
i have a firewall on my computer system
advice from the company that makes it disable the firewall
sadly with an always on internet connection like many people have these days dsl cable modem etc today that is simply not an acceptable answerhopefully their next game wont have this fatal flaw
oh and just one star for me as well for not researching this game better before i bought it
theres plenty of blame to go aroundpurchased stubbszombie spellforce platinum and gothic goldi contacted aspyr due to a key bug in spellforce platinum and found outcustomer supportaspyr embedds starforce in their gamesi wont write another starforce review read stubbs or spellforce platinum on my view and others on starforcei already own gothic  great gameimo its better than gothic which i rate  starsget the original less potential problemsthis is a pc dvd rom
not a cd rom as it is marked in the picture
this was deceptive and we could not get it to interface with our pcthis game has got to have the worst graphics i have ever seen
ive seen n graphics better then this
its a very bad game and tries to be realistic but if repeating everything twice in the game is realistic then it wins that award
what do you mean your probably saying
well when one of your fellow squad members says something he constantly says it over and over
all you hear is enemie  clock
enemie  clock
got himgot him
dont even look at this game on the shelfits a bit shameful that i would be giving this game a onestar review since the bottom line is this  i played it several hours a day for almost two months and got a ton of enjoyment out of it
and it only cost me about twenty dollars
hows that for value
there were times i felt the game had been programmed by a twin version of myself who knew exactly the kind of game i would like
the point is this is great game and i really enjoyed almost all of it
i knew i would write this review and for a long time wavered between giving it one star or five stars
unfortunately im in a rotten mood just now so one star it isthe chief thing that eventually wound up getting my goat was the many interface issues
true the interface in many respects is much smoother than in similar games but there was some room for improvement
i compare this game not to similar titles such as imperium galactica ii and master of orion but to itself  what it could have been
seems like theres one major patch still to be issued only there wont be  the company is on to other things
admittedly there was nothing that really rankled you the first week of playing but if you play this game for weeks and weeks there are some things that are really gonna get on your nerves  the research completed screen keeps popping up and theres no way to get it not to
the writing here is so good that the first couple of times youre not going to have a problem but if youre playing the game through dozens of times that really grates
same thing goes for various announcements about mysterious forcefields political developments on other planets gossip from the other races etc
there should have been a way to not be bothered about this the way you can choose not to be bothered by found anomaly popups
all this seriously detracts from the replayability of the game
there was no need for this game to be d especially given  below
its essentially a d game  yet incredibly consumptive of your computers resources
there should have been an option to just play in d with those symbols for the ships and planets
in fact d just makes this game more confusing  when you zoom in to a planet for example you cant readily apprehend its class
the money in this game is all messed up
they dont give you enough at the beginning
theres a million things you need to do at the beginning and since the computer never wastes a move its never enough
minimally they should have given you more money on the easier levels
some of the research was bs
do you really need to be able to research alliances
good and evil
in battles youre reduced to nothing more than a spectator be it land battles or space battles
major drawback to this game
checkout imperium galactica ii for an example of how they might have factored in your generalship in land battles
your ability to built fleets is pathetic
you can only get about  serious ships together
why is this
its not like were going to run out of room
this is outer space
you should have been able to mount fleets of hundreds
pirates and minor races dont obey your guidance about difficulty levels
the screen keeps recentering on planets and ships without your being able to do anything about it
when youre playing with a huge or giganticsized galaxy this can get really disorienting
you cannot pause the tutorials to write something down or look at something carefully  you have to replay the whole thing
although the game has many difficulty levels there are not smooth gradations between them
i did like how in cakewalk your opponents are reduced to drooling idiots useful if youre just learning what is inarguably a complicated game
but as i got better i noticed that in moving from beginner to normal there was a jarring jump
fortunately in my experience the computer opponents never break alliances with you treacherously allowing you to plan out your overall grand strategy
one thing i wish the game had done was have it so that you could slide the difficulty during the game  i like to start out easy so that i can at least get a footing and have the assurance that im not going to be wiped off the map in one fell swoop then once ive got my civilization up and running go in for higher difficulty
you cant do this
if you choose easy the game is easy all the way to the bitter end
the campaign is a crock i think
ive never seen a walkthrough on the internet and its difficult to get through even if you choose cakewalk
two things im thinking of here  first most of the campaign settings can be got through by simply laying low and letting your allies do all the hard work
this was a letdown since to get through the level youre reduced to playing an ancillary role though youve got a right to expect to be front and center for any battles
the way to get through the grand battle apocalypse for example is to simply colonize the four planets closest to you then tech trade like made so that your allies have as much technology as possible
then theyll go in a take out the dread lords for you
if you get it into your head to enter the fray yourself the overwhelming military superiority of the dread lords is just crushing when you meet them
thus the campaign is doable but incredibly unsatisfying
in many of the missions youre actually marshaling all your resources just to hold your own against your allies altarians im thinking of you
who have the gall to build influence bases right next to your core planets
whose side are they on
although the doc smithstyle story is a perfectly serviceable setup for the game what actually happens at the end is a majorly unsatisfying downer
many planetary improvements if you actually sat down to do the math turn out to be a crock especially some of the banking ones
i dont think any game should do this  an improvement should be an improvement
population growth is also a crock  your planet cant have more than  million people or youll have approval problems
this is something i had to learn from a message board  the manual sure wont tell you
i dont know about you guys but my turn button is always stuck on skip and i have no idea what its doing
there should have been a way to turn that off
the game should have distinguished the races better
when you played with a different race it didnt really feel like it was a completely different game like it did in starcraft
in fact creating your own custom race was a bit of a dud since you can jigger any races specs to be exactly what you want anyhow
it was way too easy to win with an influence victory
autoexplore and autoinvestigate are buggy
they say theres nothing to explore but there clearly is
plus if you build several ships and instruct them to do this they dont go off in different directions  they merely follow each other in a lineof course i am open to reason
heres a brief list about what i thought was great about the game  there are a lot of cheat codes available if the game is too hard for you or if you are just learning
you can build and deploy your own custom ships
the writing eg the notification of completed research the diplomatic dispatches is the most funny ive ever seen in video game
very well done
you truly can win using vastly different strategies
this is something many similar games boast of but dont really deliver on
this game doesupdate  i admit i liked this game so much that i plopped down money forgalactic civilizations ii ultimate editionand was pleased to discover that many  if not most  of these interface issues have been fixed therein
if youre going to buy this game i definitely suggest you buy that one which also includes both expansion packsbeware
if you spend you hardearned money for this game you cannot patch it without giving out your personal information
and also typing in an incredibly long number which is all run together in a small font without making any mistakes
and the game needs patchingstardock has a long history of no respect for privacy and for going to ridiculous lengths to make sure you were as inconvenienced as possible after buying their games
theyve really gone overboard this time and the game is going back immediatelyi bought it because ive had one before and loved it
however this one just does not work
the left stick drifts down all the time
i tore it apart to see if i could fix it and no such luck
no tutorials on how to fix it
i feel sorry for anyone who purchases this product
one thing i can say was nice was the guy offered me anothermy money back but i dont feel like it was worth my time at  dollars
spend your money on an official controllerwhen i received the controller i installed the software and immediately my sound on my computer sounded horrible
i immediately uninstalled it and did system restore to get my sound back
 bucks wastednot only were these wires hard to fit into my inch panasonic tv they were even harder to pull out
when i tried to twist and pull off the monster cable the cable itself broke and even damaged my new hd television port
the cables were made very poorly though iam sure they work well based on other reviews
this was the biggest waste of money evergreat game terrible system
if you had to buy a x rip off piece of junk to play this version just avoid it and get the snes versioni can not get past a black window and the app crashes have tried everything i can think of to get the game to work
ex disable anti virus mode from  to windows  even reinstalled my graphics cards drivers with no luck i can easily run new games at high frame rates without issuesdont know how to play this game it comes witha small menu thats not helpfulit has an online menu of  pagesnot as good as silent hunter iiibig complaint about the lack of warning about wow used software on the sitewow already has burning crusade
you just need to activate it
they will not let you reuse an activation code that has previously been used on a different account
a used wow game is therefore worthlessamazon will refund your money most likely but one has to question the idiocy of selling a wow used product
most likely it is only because amazon has no way to make this kind of exception for used items on the site andor they do no foward looking investigation when selling used items
and because many sellersbuyers are unaware of blizzards activation policies until they contact them to get the required information
amazon should enhance the database to make exceptions for this type of used software item
activation codes are becoming extremely common and im betting this issue has been encountered many times alreadygame sucks soooooooooooo bad
oh my god i wanted to jump under a bus playing this game
its vanilla wow with new skinsjust to let newcomers to world of warcraft know you no longer need to buy the burning crusade expansion pack as now it is included free with any and all retail and downloaded copies of world of warcraft so there is no need to buy this expansion and honestly blizzard should just pull it from the market since it is now free p  the expansion itself is great though so dont get me wrong outland is pretty expecally when you are able to fly but since it is now free with any copy of world of warcraft it is not needed to buy and amazon really should just discontinue this productwhat can i say
this game is perfect if you have no girlfriendboyfriend job social life or basically any form of physical or social activity that differs you from that of a rusted lawn chair
this game does nothing but steal time away from you
if you have time to waste good youll be spending hours here
if you plan to leave the world of warcraft to showereatsleepuse the bathroom etcyou obviously dont belong there
this game does nothing but replace real life goals and accomplishments met through realife hardwork with digital goals that are met with the same amount of time applied
the difference being the accomplishments you wasted your time on in the game mean absolutely and i mean absolutely nothing
they have no value whatsover accept to other people like yourself trapped in the gamei got so tired of people talking about what they do in this game like its an actual accomplishment
you played since its release
who cares
you have tier whatever gear who cares
you have some magic mount no one else in the game has who cares
you have tons of fake game gold who cares
none of this stuff matters to people that live in the real world
do you think anyone cares that i killed king bowser back in 
or that i upgraded my standard blaster to a missle blaster in metroid in 
or how about the time i found the secret ring in sonic the hedge hog when i got my first sega
no one cares a bout what you accomplished in a game
its meaningless
it has no real world valueevery inch of this game is festered with morons that simply cant understand that
at first i thought it was mostly just ignorant kidsbut these are adults
yes grown adults
acting like they are children
some i even know of to have neglected their own children just to play the game
i brought the wow the first game because it was new and i enjoyed itbut it was short lived with all the drama
i brought the burning crusade because my guild annoyed me until i did i was the guild master
i had to always have the best armor and weapons to keep up with and lead these morons
it was a real pain in the behind
the game felt so much like a joball the expansion does is add more hours for you to waste getting better armor and more dungeons to drag yourself through for  exciting levels of doing the same quest over and over again
if you like living your life on par with that of a coat hanger or maybe a lawnmower in the dead of winter
than this game is perfect for you
however if you enjoy games that are fun and challenging and really exciting look away from this and never come backas i write this review the expansion has been live for  hours
half the servers are down and the server with all my characters on argent dawn cant stay up more than  seconds
when its up there are innumerable bugs like nonspawning mobs unattackable mobs ships disappearing dumping all of us in the sea off of auberdine
those servers that are able to stay up are so crowded that every mob that respawns is instantly attacked by half a dozen playersit took over  minutes just to install the expansion because there are two updates required after installing the software on the cds and the downloads are sloooowwwi dont think the people who gave this  stars actually played it in production
maybe they played the beta which was much more controlled and stable
your experience will not be so pleasant for several more days i suspectblizzard really screwed up on this release
i give them a dupdate  yesterday sunday was the first day since the release that i didnt see any problems with disconnects or broken mobs
thats six days of problems
i changed the title to mitigated disaster because they seem to have eventually fixed all the problemsi purchased this game for my niece since she is a huge fan of power puff girls
we played this game once and were really disappointed
why
simply put every single thing in it sucks like hell from graphic game play music replay value etc
worst of all however is that this game doesnt have wifi
we rather play mkds or dkrds
do not buy this game
you might regret you did
i sure did at leastthe graphics are okay but subpar compared to other fps shooters on the psthis game is over rated
crawling through grass and avoiding enemies is boring
whenever enemies see you which happens many times they will shoot and kill you
you will have to restart from your last save
i had to save the game every  minutes
i just wanted to shoot the enemy instead of hiding but i guess the point of this game is to not use your gunswhich is stupidi have been a big fan of all the heroes games
i came in at ii loved iii and thought there were some good improvements with ivand then came v i was really hoping for better graphics and it almost looks like a lot of detail was lost in making this a d game
the graphics actually look worse then the previous games
the creatures are less detailed and look more cartoon like
the towns look poor as well
i dont see any improvements in this new version
i only see a big disappointmenti love the homm series with the following exceptions playstation version and pc version there are some excellent reviews written on the game
i want to add my frustrations to the growing list of lack of description and maps the graphics are too nintendo like
homm was crisp and detailed enough for this style of game
the new graphics make me think im playing the gamecube and not my pc
the cut scene graphics are very stale
given the high horsepower requirements for this game and the animations in combat the cut scenes could have a bit more going on
example you hear the voices of the people talking but their mouths never move the game cheats
ok all strategy video games cheat as the computer doesnt have to follow all the same rules the player does
however they need to set some limits on things
for example the final scenario in campaign  you need to over throw the dark tower but first you must clear out a gateway
usually not a problem but this one is manned pretty well
obvious solution is to build a bigger army
i probably spent a game month building what i thought would be a devistating army
i faced the gate with  archangles lots of cavliers and knights and so on
the computer had  devils  sucubuss like createus and so on and so on
there is no way the computer could have generated that many units out of its town
i know in past version of homm unit stacks would increase over time but this seems to have increased exponentually
thus the scenario was made unplayable and needed to be restarted removal of the best parts of homm   they took out the caravan and free movement of units
i thought these were great features
now i need a hero to baby sit units being moved to the front line while my main heroes are battling it outi guess im missing the need to remake homm  again
ive stopped playing the game and probably wont pick it up again
it is not that repeat playable in its current configuration and offers no value for my moneyi am very dissapointed in this title
i will not buy another in this series and i urge noone else to either
however i am selling mine on here for  of the cost i paid for it today
perhaps someone with bad taste will appreciate this terrible gameits heroes trying to be world of warcrafti lost all faith in this series due to this bloody producti beg of you dont buy this dont contribute to disappointment in this worldquite a bit like homm with graphical and skill improvements
the feel of the game is alright and while not quite as enjoyable as no
 its still very entertaining
unlike most people i enjoyed no
 but this is still a good version of homm that you will probably enjoy if you liked the previous titledthe reason i give it  star overall is the copy protection
i own the box version of this game
 of the time i stick it in the drive it asks me to insert the regular disk and not the back up
i absolutely hate this crap  like that stardock garbage from a few years ago
ubisoft  if your idiot programmers cant come up with some better version of copy protection then you should stop making gamesthe splinter cell games have historically been the topoftheline tactical shooters
then they released double agent and ruined my entire perception of not on the game series but the company of ubisoft as a whole and the tom clancy games in particular
i have patched the game and updated every driver in my system but the game hangs and i have yet to be able to finish it or get past the point on the ocean liner
it is complete and utter waste of money
they have stopped patching the game at this point and are advertising the next splinter cell game already as if i want to play another game that is total garbage i cant even finish this one
i wont purchase another tom clancy licensed game ever and ubisoft will be very lucky if i ever purchase another game with thier name on it either
this was the most disappointing piece of software i have ever had the misfortune of spending money on
i doubt i would play the new splinter cell game if they gave it to me for freemy system exceeds the requirements of this game by more than two times over for the prcessor and four times for all other requirements
the game is on patch  now and still has all the flaws mentioned by other reviewers and more
game play is awkward noncustomisable and glitchy but as a big sc fan i can be forgiving of that
moreover there is no sliding scale of your covert or overt status
you are either green and invisible yellow and visible or red and under attack
environmental cues to your status are poorly thought out and lack both clarity and continuity
i can forgive even that
i can even forgive saving issues because i will play a level over again until it goes down perfectly so midlevel saves are of little consequence
however i can not accept bugs that effect game progress directly like the inability to use your safe cracking tool in the shanghai mission
you can enter into the tool when the safe unlock symbol shows up but can not control the tool and can only exit out again
this causes major loss of trust with both the nsa and jba because you cant steal documents or samples for the afore mentioned parties
there by not allowing you to complete the level or progress any further in the game
the tool functioned in the jba training mission but this level appears to have been dropped directly from the console code onto the pc code without the benefit of editing the control commandspc gamers are already getting the shaft with delayed release dates and exclusive contracts with consoles
when we pave the way with games like halo and far cry and tell control mashing monkeys what they should like sequels of those quality titles and games similar to these rarely come out again on the platform
if and when they do they are street dated behind the console releases often by months andor are glitchy and poorly converted
it is getting to the point where most pc games are not worth buying and the console system controllers havent improved enough to be worth using
i have been a pc gamer for over  years now  since wolenstein d and we are in gaming limbo
thank you ubisoft for wasting my moneyto sum it up in one word unplayable
even after the patch running a brand new  gts quad core and  gbs of mushkin  wish there was a negative ratingi dont know what planet d ackerman lives on
the game is far from solidyes i have a killer rig too and yes i get to see some pretty nice graphicsthat my friends is where it endsfalse advertising  unlocks dont work at allsave game corruptionscrash to desktop on many occasionsmultiplayer module is pointlessi managed to have a bit of fun in a few parts of the game but its not worthit if you have not bought it yetthis is just another example of the death of pc gaming
all the moneymaking is on the console side
this is a blatent grab for some extra cashfrom the pc owners
its so very obvious litte to no qa  beta testing wasdone on the pc versionwarm up and practice your mindless joystick twitching pc gamers its the futurethe splinter cell series double rocks
the double agent double sucks
just doesnt seem to have the continuity of past games
then again save games sometimes dont
makes it kind of hard to follow it when youre screaming about starting a whole section over again because it didnt save where you left offpretty much a lesson in how not to code a pc gamedisapointing the game is loaded with bugs already patched  its impossible to play  minutes or less without a crash running in dual core  gigs ram x the game have great graphics and no slowdowns but as the last reviewer i have the same opinion ubisoft just worried about cash and nothing more worst since the game get out they didnt worry at all in getting people testing the game and releasing the fixes needed
saving the game while playing is just waste of time the save seems not to be done 
the new presence system with yellowred light is stupid we can be face to face with guardsenemies and nothing happens if the led dont turn red 
stupid ai i was able to open safe box with enemy on the side blind 
well the game was maded for let them  and dont show respect for players mainly the fans like me
the game line isnt bad at all but the bugs kill all the fun
advice save the money or get it in next months when they are forced to sell it for seriously i tried to play this trash and now i am struggling in the street fight because every time i died i cannot quick load my gamebesides that this game is so damn buggy in every level and detail that it really hurt the splinter cell series and the graphic actually looks dated
after all i just want to say one thing to ubisoft f you for screwing my experience with sam fisherfirst of alli gotta say i loved the first  splinter cellstoday when i was just about to finish it i wanted to give this game  starswhy only 
because of the many bugseven after the  patch and a legit copy of the game i was shocked to discover
so many technical issues in some movies the sound wouldnt play sam passing through doors enemies getting stuck in invisible walls problems with the resolution with the vsynch and many others
also the noise and lightdarkness system is gone
now sams got some kinda incorporated gadget that turns green when you are invisible to enemies yellow when they can see you and red when they sound the alarm
spoiler alertbut after i disarmed the bomblast level instead of showing me the movie the screen froze
loaded the game many times many different settings no luck
i was unable to see the ending sceneand theres morei had  nsa trust which means you should play a bonus level
welli couldnt do that either
had to watch it on youtube
such a shamefrom  stars i would now give this game  stars but amazon only has a minimum of  okspoiler alert offalso as a funny thing i saw in the creditson youtube   of the production crew was chinese
this game is made in china
at least thats what the quality tells meanywayspros good storyline amazing sountracks pretty good graphics when theyre not failingcons tons of bugs very shorthas about  levels kinda easyso if you wanna annoy someone to death this would be the perfect toolpssorry for my bad englishi know this is a fairly old game but i run a lot of old games on my windows   bit machine
gt legends would install but when i tried to launch it the starforce protection window comes up and wants to install the starforce protection driver
windows  wont allow it because its not digitally signed
all attempts to uninstall and update the starforce driver failed the starforce companys own utilities just wont work in windows  i believe they transferred the ditribution rights to another company but the utilities are still the same and dont work
apparently no updates and patches are forthcoming
at one point after runnibg a utility to remove the driver it crashed my machine on the reboot the first problem of any kind ever with windows  and i had to use the resident repair utility to access the system restore function to correct it
i searched on line and from what i found nobody running windows  of any version  or  bit could get this program to run
oh and i did try several compatibility modes going back from xp sp all the way to windows me plus run as administratorone possible solution is microsoft does offer a free virtual machine of windows xp
you can download it and it installs within the windows  environment
you access the virtual machine through the start menu and it is exactly as the name implies a computer within a computer
this was done so users with windows  incompatible software that they still needed could still run it
file transfer and cross talk between the xp virtual machine and the windows  environment  isnt simple and makes you juump through hoops
the other downside of the xp virtual machine is that it isnt protected by whatever antivirus andor other securoty software you use on the machine it resides in
fortunately i had a  machine license for my security suite so was able to protect virtual machine with an unsed one
i have programs running on virtual machine and they work just like my old xp machine
if you go that route you will have to install your printer and whatever other peripherals you will use with it
limitations are only how much space is available on your hard drive
there are a few differences between the virtual xp machine and a regular xp operating system but the main things are relativeley the samei assume gt legends will install and run fine from xp virtual machine
i do have a couple other old games installed there
of course remember you will have to install any gaming controller software as well even if its already on the main computerim just frustrated enough right now over the whole starforce thing i dont know if i want to bother with the xp vm install
gt legends is a good enough game from what i hear i will probably cool off in a few days and try it
if i do i will edit this review to reflect thati also have and had issues with starforce copy protection
years ago when starforce first came out it received numerous complaints where it was crashing computers so badly they required complete fresh reinstallations of the operating system
in nongeel speak that means everything on the drive was lost because a repair reinstall wasnt possible
complaints of hardware failures became alarmingly frequent
most often it was cd rw drives and other optical drives that had write functions
it trashed a cddvd rw drive on my pc
how it does it and this is as simple an explanation as i can offer is if it thinks you are trying to copy what it protects it slows down the rw drive gradually until it runs so slowly it isnt recognized and fails
it doesnt matter what speed settings you use in any software that utilizes the drive
starforce overrode it
there was a huge backlash against starfprce and severral gaming companies quite publically announced they were cancelling all contracts with the company
there were calls for boycotts against any games using it
the twisted tale is still out there on the web if anybody is interested
there are list of starforce protected games available and yes gt legends is on them
supposedly later versions of starforce were not destructive to computers but the reputation of the drm program will never be good and it will never be fully trusted
just when the storm seemed to have passed it started coming out that there were issues with it leaving itself installed on computers and was still active even after the game or whatever it came on was uninstalled
bear in mind that nothing alerted the consumer of the secret files it installed and potential harm this malware could do
in the anger from that revelation the companmy released an uninstall utility to remove all traces from the computerthat was the origin of the removal utility i mentioned at the beginning of all this
according to the websitebut the removal utility is supposed to be run prior to using the update utility to install the latest dll that allows the game to complete the installation per the website
again neither worked and the uninstall tool made my computer very unhappyalso from the starforce website it appears they began an attempt to support windows  but as windows  became finalized and the various versions appeared they never followed throughin the end im not sure if this is the destructive version of starforce
i have dvdcd rw drives in both standard and bluray versions on my pc
im not sure i want to gamble them and even try to install the game
i wish retailers would list what copy protection games had although starforce is the only one i know of that has such a tarnished reputationin conclusion i gave it one star because it wouldnt install and came with the most potentially awful and dangerous drm program ever created
sure it didnt say it worked with windows  but i am a serious gamer
the games physically installed on my machine and those i have on my steam account number about  i have games as old as free space  red baron d planescape torment gti racing and a host of other golden oldies working on my  bit windows   core  ghz processor driven dual geforce gt  slied machine with  gb of ramthis game is really outdated
outdated graphics outdated cars and outdated physics besides the fact that it has starforce protection after trying this game and having to wipe my hdd to get rid of the starforce crap i will never buy one again that uses that protection and no im not trying to steal games or make bunches of copies my game was brand new and starforce messed up windows xp so bad i had to wipe my drive and start all over again from scratchother than the starforce junk i found the game to be mediocre at best with very poor graphics compared to modern games
it does not work well with anything other than a steering wheel for realism i mean and i wont go that expense for just a game
all in all im really dissapointed in this game so much for the good reviewsif youre looking for a new game to play go buy syberia instead
or syberia ii
or just put your money on the floor and set fire to it because thats effectively the same thing as spending it on paradisethe other reviews are spotonwhile the graphics particularly the prerendered backgrounds are luscious and the story is interesting the gameplay itself is terrible
playing in the third person as ann you are reduced to pixel hunting over and over again because of glitches sometimes you can find the hotspot sometimes not
even with the patch my game hangs freezes and crashes with depressing regularity
conversations are jerky and for some reason i repeat the same questions to certain characters endlessly
i never could play as the leopardbottom linewhile i loved benoit sokals earlier games this one is a dudimagine if kate walker syberia made it as a contestant on the bachelor tv show
here we have our main character is stranded in some village in africa and her only way to escape is to do whatever she can to get it on with the prince so hell let her go
she has to become the princes favorite concubine
and she is all to eager to do this
she doesnt even consider any other way
this idea topped off with numerous other concubines standing around half naked is just ridiculous
its like sokal had a childish porn fettish all the sudden
id rather not play an adventure game where my character is a hooker
this is definitely not a suitable game for kids
its demeaning and downright smutty
the gameplay wasnt even good anyway
i got stuck right away because i didnt know that i had to repeatedly go back and fourth talking between the same characters over and over to make a jar appear even though they werent saying anything important or useful
then when i looked through a walkthrough and found out what to do my next task was to get the princes current favorite concubine some cake
so i got her cake
but she wanted more
so i got her more cake
and the she wanted more but my cake getting utensil dissapeared from my inventory and thats when i shut the thing off for good
the palace you are in has scales that you have to balance out in order to get cake
if you are too heavy you dont get cake
thats the princes way of keeping his women skinny
cmon thats gotta be the stupidest idea for a story and for gameplay that ive ever seen
shame on everybody who took part in the creation of this game anyone that promoted or endorsed this gamei have a logitech momo racing wheel with two pedals and win   i got this game thinking that i would get a realistic experience as i could see these wonderful reviews
installed the game quite excited installed the patch that comes with the game
force feedback works great steering works great but  what i found is that this game and logitech momo racing do not seem to get along
 after a few car crashes the pedals just stop working no response at all
i need to exit the game and restart to make them work
 when stopped you change gears and then it goes back to neutral so it is tricky to get your car going and you lose precious seconds trying to get your car going
 accelerator pedal seems to add power exponentially and with a lag
so you push accelerator and it takes like  or  seconds to respond to what you did with accelerator
add the fact that exponential response means that you feel like rocket driving a bogus toyota prius in california remember that incident
 i change the controller configuration and save my profile
next time i start the game control configuration is not savedso the game is already hard
and this poor handling of the controls makes it completely frustrating
it is like having a car that is failingi have not had this problem with other car games
so if you have a logitech controller do not buy this gameif i get a way to solve this i may change this review
in the meantime it gets one stari spent about  hours on my own trying to get this to run and it made me update my video drivers my computer is very high performance and once this was all done my computer crashed and was left in such a poor state that i had to have a professional computer repair technician spend two hours to salvage the situation
i am currently back to where i was before able to use my computer and do everything i did before and the game actually runs but it runs so slow and sluggish that it is beyond pathetic
the technician said that my computer is fine and that nothing is wrong with the drivers or anything of that sort
in short he concluded that the game is worthless and that i should seek a refund from the manufacturer
it will run occasionally but when i click to give an order to a unit it freezes for  seconds unfreezes the order begins to be executed then it freezes again then it unfreezes then it crashes i dont know why i paid  dollars for thatalthough the first game was pretty damn good be careful buying this one
apparently for some reason ea has intentionally made this game incompatible with some nvidia geoforce graphics cards even if they meet the memory requirements
not sure why they did this and dont care either
there was no information about this in the description on amazon and nothing on the box that i received either
double check the web to see if it will work with your cardthis is not a new re game or a better version of re
this is re but it sucks on the ds
the graphics are horrible and the controls kinda uncomfortable cause im used to re on the ps
i only played it for about  minutes but decided to quit cause it sucked
a really dissapointment for the re series
just stick with the original ps versionthis is the samething like part one same characters only  stages i mean come on this game is not worth it
the customization sucks and the attacks are the same
if you just like this game for its girls and partial nudity then your a real idiot cause this game is not even worth quaters so this game is garbageyou all know why you picked up the game
lets not beat around the bush
here is the problem tho its hard as hell
to unlock things or characters
its not fun at all and should be for what the game is
looks great and thats about it
im a seasoned gamer i have played and beat many games in different groups of gaming
this game is really hard and will make you more angry than happy
rent before buying
terrible gamewhat the hell is this
this is nothing like the other splinter cell games
cant believe i wasted  on it
i mean i was so excited to get this and have fun because i played the first splinter cell on gamecube when i was a kid so i was excited to relive my childhood through another game
this is bull crap though
the game is horrible
it just throws you in and doesnt tell you how to use the controls or what your objective is
speaking of the controls there are to many and they are clunky and sensitive
do not buy this game if you are a fan of the splinter cell series this one is just badi bought this for my husbands birthday
we loved playing the splinter cell chaos theory because of the splitscreen coop missions where both of us could play together
i read many reviews online that the double agent game would have the same splitscreen coops and we were so excited
it came out on my husbands birthday so i had to preorder it and was happy when the back of the game said  players this was listed separate from the system link and xbox live  of players
we started to play the game and were so mad when we found out that they didnt include any coop splitscreen missions
it was the only reason we even bought the game
we are extremely disappointed it should not say  players because this indicates just like on all games that  players can play at the same time on the same system without using xbox live
its a total lie we are still so mad that we havent even played the gameif you look at the back of all xbox games they tell you how many people can play the game
players is always first and indicates how many people can play on a single console
then some games have number of players for system link online coop etcthis game said players 
however after spending  minutes trying to figure out how to have two or three people play on the same console i about went crazy
i went online and found it to be a misprint or misinterpretation or something by the creatorsthis is inexcusable
the only reason i bought the game was for multiplayer on the same console which the xbox serious lacks
and this one was a fraud
so it doesnt matter to me how good the single player is or how good the graphics are etc
ubisoft lied on the box and now i am stuck with a game that doesnt do what was advertised
i will be extremely wary of all ubisoft xbox games in the future
i just hope my review helps anybody else avoid this game who would buy it for the single console multiplayerafter conviction totally boring
what a waste of a good dvd
that being said i am surprised i got fisher as far as i got him given the fact that enemies would shoot through solid block walls and fisher was taking damage
shoot back
are you out of your cottonpicking mind
the enemy didnt take any damage not for anything
despite this i managed to get him to kinshasa or whatever that place is and he died numerous times while being shot through another solid wall
this game is truly the worst i have ever seen and i have seen some really bad ones
since its worth about  cents on a tradein i just dumped it in the dumpster
screw it
itll be a cold day at the equator before i get another new game
if i have to throw it away ill throw away as little  as possible thank youi bought it and hoped to have a lot of fun because i used to play this when i was younger
but when i got it it did not work i was very disipointedplaystation had a game just likes this and it was called goo goo soundy
that game never worked right and neither does dance factory
the dance routines it creates are simplistic and sometimes off the beatthe other reviews have discussed each major shortcoming of the game is detail so i will not repeat them
rent the game for a fun hour or so of arcade style playing but do not waste your money buying the gamesome of the ubisoft flight sims are wonderful  like il  or il sturmovic  this was a bit of a dissapointment  for one  i have  a fairly new dell dimension    to play this game i had to spend another  upgrading my video card wich was fine  then my saitek joy stick would not work as it was not supported  so i spent another  on the reccommend logitec the older flight sims are great simply as you plug in a joystick and can fly  not so with this game  you have to try to set each direction as well as down load pathes for the game and joy stick and after all that  does not work  the graphics are ok and i am sure the game might even be fun 
but not worth all the headache  extra expense and still a joy stick that does not let you fly  ubisoft used to care about what they put out  but nowadays expensive games  with bugs  patches and games that just do not workk this was my first wwii dogfight game and it stunk for the following reasons the game is repetitive fly around take pictures or shootbomb a target xbox live support for this game stinks
there is nobody to play against for this game
the players know it stinks and dont even bother to play anymore how many times can you hear the same crappy taunts from the ai
in this game the ai
stinks
your squad mates are just plain stupid
i found myself yelling at the tv the time restrictions on the various missions are ridiculously short
i found it close to impossible to complete missions
i eventually gave up on this game after spending countless hours attempting to master it
playing the same scenarios over and over againwhich leads to i have been through most of the game and i have not gotten even one of the  xbox  achievement points for all the time i waisted
the award system put in place is just as crappy as the gameit came in what looked like a real case but the disc had the telltale sign of being burned on the reflective side
when put into a computer i could see a reallooking iso file but several different s in working condition couldnt even recognize that a disc was in the drive
i believe its a fakei played this game at my friends house recently and i was very unimpressed
i was highly dissapointed that the mvp series wasnt making any more mlb games so i decided to try this one since i needed a new baseball game
ugh
how can anyone say these graphics are good
it looks like your playing on a gameboy
the entire gameplay feels choppy also
no where near as good as mvp   career mode does seem kind of cool so that is the only thing going for this game
overall i guess im going to stick with mvp  again and just update the rosters because mlb k sounds terrible also
please ea sports come backthis game is horrible
i played it at best buy and it sucked so bad i couldnt play it for that long
the graphics are horrible i mean the players dont look good
it looks like they have generic faces
the graphics are nowhere near major league baseball k or mvp  or 
the gameplay is the worst i have ever seen in a baseball game
dont buy this game
wait until mlb k comes out
it already looks like it has alot better graphics and gameplay plus it has the world baseball classicthe item pictured on amazon is not the item you may receive
i bought one and i got the psp essentials version which is an import version
pretty unhappy about this inaccuracy
ill be returning this itemi think that gameshark  is a waste of money
i have bought  of these in a  month period  bucks  each and both broke
anyway i think this is fun at first especially using the codes on my resident evil games
but if you use it too many times it will slowly stop working
i dont know why but i find it a rip off
and you cant even save the game with the codes still on there so when you want to play your game again the codes wont be there and youll have to take your game out put the game shark in choose the game and codes for that game then start your game again and after i bought the second one it damaged my system and i had to send it in to sony thank you gameshark sarcasmuse to be back in the day you could pop in some cheat codes and you were good to go what was even better was that people would dink around and find new codes by mistake and share them
it was nice you had a wide variety for any game you just copy the number and be set
now you cant enter in numbers you have to download cheats and only cheats that gameshark deems worthy to have
not only that but this item should provide the buyer with a pendrive
what do you get instead
a disk
the rest is up to you
im sick of great companies that use to do things perfectly getting in that lets renovate mood
seriously if you hit a bullseye why would you take out the dart and try again
get it right and improove and add not changebuy an older version if you can find it from back when the people who ran this company knew what they were doingthis gameshark works better than that crappy gba sp one but one problem you need a large screen tv cause the letters to punch in the codes are way too small to see i had to almost sit right up to the tv to see what im punching in gameshark used to be good starting out but now they plainly sucki recently got the gameshark for my playstation two placed it into my ps and started it up nothing happened
i was furious that is until i took the disc back out cleaned it placed it back in and tried again
it too a couple of times than started up and everything worked fine
that is until i turned it off and tried starting it up again
i had continious problems with this producti tried inputing cheats onto the gameshark but it doesnt work the cheats cannot be highlighted and whenever i tried starting the gameup it says that there are no cheats loaded
once again another frustrating thing about this product
it appears that you must input the game name exackly as it is displayed on the gameshark website for it to work
i found that some of the new inputed codes i put in do work but on a game that was already listed on the gameshark not inputed by myselfi have to continiously clean the gameshark disc a number of times before it will fianlly work
why cant they make this any easier
its like a chore to do anything with it
although the value is a little higher knowing that at least some of these cheats work
but trust me on this dont waste your time or money on this lame product
if gameshark wants to keep going they need to make there products betteris this game sexist
think about it
one or perhaps the only mario game in which a female character is the protagonist and its all about how women are drive by emotion in contrast to regular mario games in which men are driven by powerups lol
princess peach is limited to four emotions happiness anger sadness and calm
im a dude and usually dont hate on a game for these reasons but i found the premise clumsily packaged together
aside from the message this game sends this game plays like buttocks and it is annoying to have to switch emotions or vibes as the game puts it in order to slowly advance through the mediocre levels
maybe theres something cool in this game but i didnt get far enough to find itdidnt even start up on my computer
so i really dont know how this game is
both discs dont work
all my other games and music cds and movies work on this computeri recently got the game and all of the old stuff does not work
my pc is to new
ea should do a better job
its just roms on a dvd
if you have windows  youll be lucky if you even get generals to workwow i dont know what kind of crack reviewers are smoking but this game sucks big time
the graphics are fine  what sucks is the gameplay
imagine playing devil may cry or ninja gaiden or god of war with all of the fun taken out and youve got a perfect idea of what onimusha dawn of dreams is
no fast furious action
no rolling around the ground or jumping high
none of that
just standing still swinging a sword as if these are still the days of nes
geez
this game is so boring i dont see how anyone can play over  minutesthis game really sucked
just stick with the first  in the series
no wonder why this one was not included in the onimusha essentials collection
the game play is a little different and other characters are selectable this one should have been like the other  so please stay away from this one
if u have not played the first  now is the time get onimusha essentials
u will get your moneys worthi will have to agree the entire game was terrible and the controls fun excitement and depth was lostdo not buy this versioncumon people why pay full retail price for a game that you must pay a monthly fee for to download from steam to play and are required to download new content everytime you go online to connect
that stinx
if you dont see it then why are you in this country
to pay a full price for a box and then have to download and prove you own itas in liscense each and everytime you start the game is not only ridiculous but draconian and dictationial of peoples privacy
and since it is a single player game why not let it be played privately and leave the mmo b s for when you want to socialize and hack noggins
some of us also have dial up and refuse to leave it
lyour cred is charged every time the steamers think of a reasondumb or otherwise just like the frivolous banks thier searvice charges for a visit
i dont want to have this compliaction why not just pop in the lousy cd and play it
thats the way its always been
if you can for lenard skynard then why not halflifeand its episodic sqeequals
also i am sick of these stuipid computer gaming magazines who constantly review steam all praise the steam and that crapola and no other companies are mentioned
why mess with this headache when you could get paraiah for half price and just load it and play
same thing doctor and his reluctant girl friend with mordorian hairits a product of steam  i am only permited to play when steam decides i can
that means if your internet connection is ever severed or the server is down you cannot play this game  if you ever decided to cancel your internet service this video game goes along with it
also dont try to sell this thing or buy it used as steam wont allow any other user to play this its good to know a corporation is allowed to have so much authority and power over a product we buy with our own moneyafter hl i thought i would never be writing another review of a valve game again
a call from a friend changed all that
he is not very computer savvy and  needed help with the steam machine installation
i had helped him before with hl
after that traumatizing experience i thought we had both sworn off valve foreverwell here he was again
his excuse  pc games are being introduced far and few inbetween
he didnt want to wait until xmas for a new shooter to play
this is quite a good point and one that i have a feeling valve was quick to recognizeit took a couple hours but i managed to get things installed and running
we played the game for a couple more hours
let me say up front i did not see the game to completion
my friend said it took him another  hours at most to finish ithere is what i saw and my thoughts two hours of installation effort for  hours of fun
 a pop for this and each subsequent hl chapter
installation  are you kidding
in this post  era our government would be proud of how steam can intrude at will  on our privacy and have us volunteer to let them do it
basically a good game with a mundane story
graphics are  great but thats the highlight  a  stars before subtracting for steam
hl and this chapter are not in the same league as hl deus ex  system shock  jedi knight any far cry max payne  etc
etc
frankly doom  and quake  are just as good and a lot less trouble to installsummaryyou can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time
apparently valve has found its niche with the later
in their most audacious move yet  they have forgone releasing another full game or expansion pack for  and are instead releasing short portions called chapters of hl at  a pop
they are doing this and forcing you to get steamed for each
yet there are folks here giving this abortion  stars
pt barnum would have been proudas to my friend  the first time was a mistake the nd time is shame on you but if theres a rd  time hes mutton stewwhen you purchased your  ill bet one of your first thoughts was i wonder if they have any games that look like its  again
well the answer is a resounding yesfirst there was far cry
then far cryinstincts
then obviously there was the need for far cryinstinctspredator
there is actually nothing wrong with that name that couldnt be fixed by changing it to far cryyes this really is that same game from beforeno really im not kidding
anyway you played this game on your old xbox and the graphics have not changed at all
so you get to relive all that lowpolygon goodness not to mention sluggish and unresponsive control
i remember this game being a lot of fun on the original xboxwhat else oh yeah theres apparently two games on the disc the original and a new one which is very similar
apparently the games dont require you know all that much room on the disc
they made sure to retain all the same awkward character animations and interminable cut scenes because you dont mess with the what worksstay away from this game
leave it in the bargain bin dont consider buying it online
in the modern era of games this doesnt even show up on the radar as a possibility of something you should buy
i can name a few hundred games that are better than this one and thats just off the top of my head
i actually did put in a little time trying to play this before i traded it in but i cant tell you too much about it
as a matter of fact theres probably not too many people who could tell you as i couldnt imagine anyone suffering through the full campaigni bought this game for  dollars poped it in and was really hoping for some great changes to the game
let me tell you i was disappointed
first off the ep adds a very smally amount of new items clothes
it is extremely hard to even establish a business and even harder to make it sucessful
overall a waste of money
if you can figure it out you can have businesses downtown but you would need a good computer just to load it every day that you go to work
honestly its like have a job except you have to so much work that you forget to let your sims live and you lose a ton of money
trust me save your money unless its under  dollars buy something else
honestly i have used the business feature once and i have used  items from itwell what can i say amazon service was great but when i got this game and try it in my console it wont work
it says like version incompatiblity well i check out amazon specs and didnt find anything that might prevent for not playing this game
if only i knew regarding region games that can only work in other region i wouldnt spend time and money buying this game at amazonawful game poor graphics dont like it at allmy son hates it stay away from itawful game awful game awful gamenumber  platinum is out with all three gamesnumber  all over the internet ive heard and experienced that gold edtion is virtually unplayable due to a runtime error bug that crashes the whole computer if you try to play the orginal dow and there are no patches to fix thisforget gold and go for platinum and most importantly get the patchesi made a mistake by listening to the customer reviews saying this game was good
it wasnt
while it did have better onfoot action its driving was terrible
you almost cannot drive anywhere because there are so many cars and they are all going mph and if you try to speed out of nowhere dozens of cops stop at absolutely nothing to kill you for a speeding violationthe map is way too bigyou cannot tell what your health is untill you diethere is little selection of carsand the controls are just terribleif you have a choice between drivr and parallel lines there is no choicewild arms  feels more like a my first rpg than a continuation or sequel of anything
a stable of annoying and cliched characters and a plot that you can guess the turns before they even appear there is little to redeem the game from the lower depths of mediocrity
between the hastily assembled group of super kids and the plethora of evil adults instead of being a coming of age story it seems more like an angry fanfic experience from a twelve year old who has been sent to his room on punishment
and with lines like this anti tank chainsaw is made for close quarter combat with tanks and its the earthbound spirits of the undead we better be careful its easy to believe that this story was in fact written by a child
there are some smatterings of evolution and nanomachines mentioned in an attempt to sound pseudo scientific but its usually brought up as if im being given a science lesson and by the time they finish talking what small part of the plot that i actually did find interesting is forgotten
then there are the puzzles
normally i dont mind puzzles especially when theyre relevant to the story at hand
in wild arms i simply found them out of place and distracting
im in a secret military base why am i maneuvering spring boards to jump to a higher level
spring boards
that leads to top secret areas
yeah right
not to mention the numerous times when i was required to use the wonder staff and the wonder sword and the all so handy wonder pot
i simply wondered what they were doing in the gamethe villains and their plan to rule the world is so comical that it would do cobra commander proud and the heroes arent much better
jude and yulie are the poster children for goody two shoes
one wants to solve the worlds problems and the other just wants to help everyone
not only that jude earns everyones admiration for his ability to trust and see the good in people his desire to save the world and his conviction
he converts even the hardest villains with his innocence and goodwill and hope for the future
yulie was the typical good girl who wants to help and love everyone and with the strength of her friends and love on her side there isnt anything that she cant do
i dont think that ive ever encountered two more irritating characters and i didnt even have the option of switching either one out of my party
i was stuck with themthe game wasnt a complete disaster however the game play is actually interesting and somewhat enjoyable
the controls however were hit or miss
sometimes a command would execute flawlessly other times it seemed to hesitate
the most nerve wrecking however was attempting to use the aforementioned wonder items
a majority of the time i was required to shoot something whether it be a flame or a ball of light from the wonder item of the day and jude would slide all over the place making what should have been an easy task a chorethe graphics were well done and i liked the character design for raquel
it was refreshing to have a female video game character that wasnt scantily clad and flashing panty shots all of the time
interesting game play and nice graphics however were not enough to make up for the juvenile predictable story and the annoying characters
the whole children are the future theme was repeated so many times that i was slightly disappointed that the ending song wasnt the greatest love of all by whitney houstonthe series obviously has its number of dedicated fans but this game failed to make me one of them
if you dont mind playing out a mediocre story littered with lines from a care bears special in order to utilize a decent battle system go for it
some people actually enjoyed this game im just not one of themi was just getting the hang of it
spent hours into this game and i was making huge progress when it just crashes
i cant load my data
the game is completely useless
i understand some copies of the game are glitched but i wouldnt take a chance  horrible
ive never had a game just not work beforei am a true harvest moon fan and i love all the harvest moon games except this one because when your playing the game it periodicly freezes out of no where and if you have not saved the game you are basicly in trouble
it froze on me i dont know how many times and i thought it was my ds lite but then i found on here that other people said their game froze on them too
i couldnt even leave town untill i found everyone and it was a pain to play
i ended up returning it because it froze so much and i was told by the guy at the game store that he had a lot of complaints about this game because of its glitch of freezing
a few months later i was in another game store and seen this girl that was looking at it and she was literally about to buy it but i told her do buy it and she was like why and i told her that the game has glitches and it freezes on you from time to time and if you havent saved the game then you lose whatever you just did
i also told her it can screw up your ds and she thanked me and ended up getting monkey ball or something
bottom line do not get this gameharvest moon ds was the game that got me to dislike the new games after growing up with a love for friends of mineral town
i was very excited when it first arrived on the market and thought it would be fun having a new town and farm to play on a portable handheld
but unfortunately this game turned out to be absolutely terrible and a huge miss that just gave more evidence that harvest moon has fallen way downhill since its heyday on the nintendo  and playstationfirst of all the farming is basically torture
not only do you have to build your own barns but they can fall down and all of your animals can die
you have to be kidding me
there is absolutely no way playing with this system could be fun
it is just stressful and too much work for a game that used to be so relaxing to play on a calm day
i did enjoy the addition of having a cat and dog and i thought the layout and look to the farm was nice
really it all does look nice graphically wise
forever not valley looks rather cute and clear on the nintendo ds and i liked all of the graphic sprites
but this does not take away that the town has no substance whatsoever
the characters are absolutely boring compared to previous titles and i have no urge to be friends with any of these people besides that they look cute
they are one dimensional and if they appear to have conflicts in the beginning of the game they never come to surface or change
yawnas proof that characterization has gone down since the original games i will compare this game to harvest moon  and friends of mineral town
lumina is my favorite girl in this game and karen is my favorite in friends of mineral town and nintendo   karenthe most memorable heart event was saving the vineyard after your effort
karen comes over to your house to invite you over to see fairies kissing the fruit and begins to dance because she is just so overwhelmingly happy
it is one of the most beautiful things i have ever seen in a video game
not to mention karen was full of depth
her father was an abusive alcoholic the family business was poor until you help she longed to live in the city etcfriends of mineral town  karenthe most memorable heart event was when karen discovers that her father had bottles of wine stored for her as a baby
you must go to the neighbors vineyard to help her carry them back home
when you get back she gives you a bottle as a gift
while is not nearly as special as the previous i found it to be rather cute and unique
in this game karen is not nearly as feisty but enjoys wine is good talking with others and is a romanticforget me not valley  luminaall of her heart events consist of a dvd player
yes
a dvd player
how romantic
she is nice and sometimes she likes to plays the pianoa harvest moon game with no characterization just takes about half the fun out of the game
this combined with the boring and long tedious farming system makes this game a waste
please do not waste your time on this gamei have never played this game but a friend of mine bought it a few years ago and he loved it
until it froze on him he lost everything he had a really nice farm lots of animals just the perfect farm
and it froze on him
before that happened though his cat got stuckon his kitchen
he couldnt do anything to save his cat either 
when it froze on him he just tossed it in the trash
i wouldnt recommend buying this unless you feel like doing a lot of work and you want to risk losing all of your hard work
cause as far i as know its about every  out of  games has the freezing glitch thingi played nw and loved itnw has lots of good stuff but what high end system do i need
i met the min
requirements but the frame rate is so slow that i can gave after a few hours of trying to play
i have a nvidia geforce ultra   gigs of ram  ghz motherboard and  gig harddrive
i play a lot of online games like bf bf  eq wow etcso my pc meets the demands
why the slow or stop and go actiondo yourself a favor and do some research before buying this game
theres ton of people out there who cannot run nwn  on their computers properly ie
extremely slow frame rateeven if the recommended system requirement is exceeded
yes there are some people who can run this gameplayed it loved it but they are few
intalling the current patch does not help either
the game developer osidian made some of my favorite game eg
icewind dale kotor  planescape torment that ran well out of the box therefore this is both surprisng and disappointing
i am certain a proper patch will come out sometimes and i will adjust my review accordingly but until then spend your money on something elseupdate on my prior review aboveyes this game is patched version  and is playable now
ive played it twice
latest patch fixes lots of bugs but introduced some new bugs that obsidian acknowledged and said the it may be fixed in a future patch 
with all the patches this game is now passable to be called in the final stage of beta testing  yes it is released way too early just so most people can burn their money and feel pissed off over xmas
atari really blew it over this one and their stock value if you follow it relected this greedy  bonehead moveit is really unfortunate because it is a very good game but it could have and should have been an outstanding gamesome other reviewers have already nailed down whats good and bad
so all i will add is  make sure your game rig meets the recommended requirement especially for video card  not the minimum requirement
minimum requirement guarantees that you will have either slow frame rate or you have to tune down a bunch of eye candies  resolution   making the game looking not much better than nwn  
nwn  graphic is actually very decent perhaps its best to wait for a  couple months to buy this game  unless you are a diehard nwn fan
this game as is is nor worth over hopefully obsidian will learn from their mistake and redeem itself with some outstanding expansion to nwn  and may be even star wars  knight of the old republic to make up for this blunderi love shadow hearts  god they were amazing
i played part  while i was playing it
the grpahics went to hell
it was a down grade from ther others
the voice was amazing
the battle system was awesome
the story was just not there
the game drags on and on
it was badly written and design
i love  i still play them on my ps
i beat this game  times to see  endings
the second time
i had to force myself to play this
i just dont know why they did a crappy job on this
just badthis was bad on every levelshadow hearts  was golden
part  was bronze
this opinion is mine not othersunfortunately a fact of life for pc games is that they almost always use sophisticated and tempermental copy protection schemes which sometimes work with out a hitch and other times render the game unplayable or uninstallable
in my case the game constantly generates crc error reading from the dvd
since the errors are on random files and no other currently running games seem to have a problem with my dvd drive i can only conclude that the copy protection scheme securom is responsible
especially since ataris support forums show that a large number of people are have the same or similar issues with running the gameoh well maybe punishing ratings and plummiting sales will teach the distributors that it just isnt worth the loss of honest customers in the futurei usually do not take the advice of others when it comes to purchasing games because im the one whos playing it and everyone gets a different expierence out of any game whether it be a low budget title or a socalled blockbuster hit
ive read several reviews on this title and i have to say that this is one of the only times where i can sense that there is some real truth in the complaints about this game
why would i come to such a conclusion when i dont even own the game
well the reason is a lot easier to understand than you think
first of all id like to say that i own nwngold and the very last expansion pak
i enjoyed the series
but after reading on several websites and comparing and sorting out the honest reviews from garbagethose who praised the game simply to be included in the me too crowd i noticed a very disturbing trend that has been a plague on the entire gaming market for some time now
stagnation
as long as gamersincluding myself keep dishing out the big for so called graphic advancementsthe big companies will continue to throw as much unfinished testedresource killing tripe  us because they know that no matter whatif there is a major title on the boxpeople will buy itthese guys are smart because they know that the average gamertodays modern gamer does not want a storythey also know that mostnot allmodern gamers are easily distacted  and get extremely giddie over shiney thingsthey figure we all just want to be lead by the nose so we can get from pointa to pointbfinish the gameand rush to get online so they can give our opinion of the product
its calledpower selling and it really is an insult to those who are loyal to a certain franchise or genre and end up with the short end of the stick because johnny next door just got his first highend from his parents and has some how played the game with few or no bugs  as hell soon write in his next amazon reviewand has now become the voice of reason
oksureill buy thatand dont even get me started on the way consumers are getting yanked on the cost of upgrades and in some instancespurchasing a new pc in anticipation of thier favorite new game releases
so am i bitter
nojust a realist and an observer of the truth
so to the many honest reviews that were written on this site about this gamethe bad reviews were the only honest onesmy hat goes off to you and thanks for the warningill pass on this one until a gold platinum or any completely fixed version is released and only if it comes with a  price tag so that even if i find the storyline to be complete garbagei can put it on the shelf beside nwngold and not feel so bad for wasting the original nwn was buggy on release but this game is so buggy you may not even be able to install itwait a couple months or more for the game to be fixed is my recommendation
the recommended minimal requirements are no where even close to what youll actually need to run this game at an acceptable level so consider getting it after next years hardware upgradethe game will certainly be worth purchasing in a couple months but stay away for now and help force the devs to fix it
im shelving it and will update my review once its fixed enough to playi hope this works
amazon ate my last attempt at a review for this titlei had very high hopes for this game
neverwinter nights was and remains one of my favorite pc rpgs
it was incredibly rich detailed and deep
the editor provided days worth of fun customizingthis title however feels like a regression rather than a progression
and i cant for the life of me understand how they can release a title that demands so much more out of your hardware for a game that looks like it was released three years earlier than the originalbut thats not the part that bothered me graphics have never been a big selling point with me
theyre nice dont get me wrong but ill take a game with great play value and ugly visuals over a pretty trainwreckunfortunately this game has neither mainly because someone back at atari or bioware royally messed upheres the short version despite having more than double thats  of the system requirements for this game my machine was unable to produce more than  frame per secondlet me repeat that
 frame per second
for those of you who dont play enough to make the connection between playability and framespersecond fps is completely unplayable
imagine loading a game thats way too advanced for your machine and the graphics that would result when your computer tried to run it
thats the kind of performance i got out of nwn using a machine built in  attempting to display graphics that were out of date in  frankly thats jawdropping
how could they not realize they were putting out such a flawed product when the original was so great
maybe they got overconfident and stopped trying thinking they could just ride on nwns lapels for the rest of their careersand now i just know there are some folks out there dying to tear me down to size by commenting that there are a number of fixes for this terrible framerate since im far from the only person to experience it it seems an entire small community has sprung up around attempting to fix nwn
let me just head yall off at the pass there
ive tried them
all of them
every single possible fix i could find from modifying my graphics card settings to game settings to customwritten mods
the best i could achieve after setting every possible graphical option to minimum and increasing the performance of my card was fpsskip this title
get something that will run on your machine
given the resources this agedlooking ram monster seems to want youre better off waiting to play this title until sometime in  when ghz processors  gig video cards and  gigs of ram are standard pc optionsno activity with another being
you also have to find objects in the correct orderfrustrating
my wife and i really tried to like this but it was very tedious and slow
as for the gameplay and graphics youd think this game was made in the slousy manager mode
playing in manager mode is just a full screen graphic
quite honestly playing on my commodore  was more fun
i remember apple computer released a game in the s that had a manager mode that had graphics
and todays game makers cant achieve thisgraphics average
pitching is fairly accurate when your pitcher gets tired or rattled the aim gets shakey and harder to hit your mark i like that
this also allows for pitches to be balls which leads to the ever so rare base on ballshitting is done by pulling back on the r stick and releasing to swing
you cant aim where to swing
ultimately its too easyalso controls at times are way too confusing
i was batting one time bumped something 
and my right handed batter switched to a lefty
this game is a mess
not to mention after playing  games of a  game series while loading up game  it locked up on meboo hiss
and give us a manager mode with graphicsi have one word for this gamepathetic
the graphics are made for a ps not a ps
the players look deformed
did they even bother capturing player motion at all
there is a horrible lack of replay camera angles
they show a guy striking out with a portion of his head and i think you can see an elbow
when they show a replay of a homerun the guys swing is extremely overdone
he swings and is almost looking behind him at followthru
is he looking at the fans behind the plate or the ball leaving the yard
well he should be looking at the ball i would think
the only thing halfway decent in this game is the fielding
it seems to be solid and fluid
i couldnt even finish one game because i was so horrified at what i was seeing on screen
all i can say is thank god i kept mvp  because nothing seems to come close
the makers of this game need to take a long look at the recent competition and figure out what they are going to do to fix it
it is nothing but second rate garbage and they should consider firing themselves before bringing out another game like this
do not buy unless you are either blind or a complete moroni dont even know where to begin with this game
the manual for it is absolutely awful the main screen user interface is a joke fielding is a nightmare the pitcher will throw the ball into the stands even if you simply punch the corresponding button to speak nothing of setting the breakpoint on the pitch
this is prime example of a company that is trying to set its self apart by trying different controls and they succeed in never getting another cent from me ever
i guess im just out the money
dont ever buy games from kthe graphics are horrible
the faces of the players are smushed on their bodies to make it look like they just got ran over by a truck
the pitching is very confusing to figure out
it all depends on when you release the ball when the yellow circle is a certain size
its so stupid
i got mlb o the show and let me tell ya the graphics are awesome and everything is much better
save yourself from buying another crappy k baseball game and get sonys game
mlb  the show
youll thank me lateroften times i have been amazed to read  star reviews for truly awful games
i have always viewed them with suspicion but allowed for the possibility of some folks simply having different tastes
this is why i found the reviews for major league baseball k so facinating
this is a game that is defective and due to the defect freezes
so even if someone has very low standards they could not honestly give a defective game  stars
well take a look at the  star reviews here and you can finally see proof that there really are planted fake reviews
call me naive for needing this type of evidence but guess i am too much the optimist
now who do we think planted them
lollike the previous critics i waited for  months for this game
this has to be the worst game ever
i brought this game assuming that the graphics will be realistic
what a disapointment
not one player looks realistic
this garbage game will put out because there is no other baseball game available
all k was interested in was making 
do yourself a favor do not buy thislike all the others i bought this movie on the th and returned it on the th
the game froze up on me
worse the controls are so confusing that it gives me a headache
this one game may push back the advancement of the xbox  for at least a year
at least the people gave me a full refund
i used it to buy last years far superior original x box game
if you have last years k or mvp keep it
skip this piece of junk
i dont think i will buy a k game ever againthis game so does not live up to the hype
in fact the opposite
its missing a lot of subtle but good stuff from the previous total war games like being able to build more than one siege engine per turn this is a big problem since every turn in a siege you suffer attrition your spies are unable to open city gates the option for units to either be defensive or aggressive and fire at will option for javelin armed infantry like hillmen and legionnaires
there are also a lot of bugs
my archers that stood on the wall over the boiling oil died all at onceafter the oil was pored
also when my infantry scale walls the run back and forth if you click on a target thats too far away
if there was a game that could destroy a franchise it is this oneits as simple as that
i know therere good reviews all over for it but for me it didnt make the cut
it feels like it was made at the transition between dinky caesar citysim games and the first of the civilization series
maybe im not too tolerant of oldies i simply hadnt grown up with but this game seems overwhelmingly awful
battle controls are difficult and restrictive graphics are moderatelypleasing but unnecessary extravagant in the tactical map and very subpar in the info boxesthe game offers no tutorial crashes often has extremely few playable factions uninteresting play options and awkward turns
knights of honor very much like this game in design is way better
for whatever other elements youre seeking out of a medieval strategy game consult the other reviews  but for me use to higherend games  this barely kept my interest from the startany decent looking game with a somewhat usable interface that lets you shoot stuff and make a mess is going to be playable even entertaining for a few minutesresevoir dogs the game suceeded in keeping my interest for a few minutes for those reasonsthis game is so mediocre it falls face first into lousy and has no reason to exist aside from if we didnt make it somebody else would havebad design bad production values bad presentation
if the box didnt say resevoir dogs you wouldnt know what lameass game you were playingyeeshcant see the forest for the trees thats way forest lordsmy new name for it what ever it is
is so awful
the collectors can is just a way of saying were too lazy to patch our game so well just sell it in a can to you suckers who havent bothered to buy it yet
buy it in a can
to top this reciew off with a fuzzy beer head so ill actually get posted the only good part of this game is that it could have been so
adverb redundancy asside in fact quite fankly and so on you develope your insignificant little hapless adventurer in to a great warrioror mage if thats your schtick but the only develpoe ment is in the foarm of stat numbers which really amount to nothing at all
strength is for heavy wheapon wielding yet not damage bonusthough it says it is at extreme levels it in fact is not
the mein changes in the character creattion screen are in fact not implemented yet or ever
the dungeonsi havent found em havent quite frankly been invented yet
you talk to the reps they quite frankly get sick of your belly acheing and rave like the luneitics they are about how hard they worked on the game
i quite frankly dont carethe original dungeon lords was released a year before it was ready
now you get dlcollectors edition and i the dummy that i am decided to try it againthe game does not run on any laptopnotebook computers
it does not run on a third or more of desktop systems
instead it will flash for two seconds and then go back to windows without a word
the reason  they  only support a very small subset of video cards and no notebook cards at all
and you have to dig through the dreamcatcher web site to figure this out its nowhere in the documentation or readmeso maybe theyve improved it but now it doesnt work anyway
and once again it goes back  at least i only wasted a few minutes on it this time
dont buy this game under any circumstancesok my mistake
i thought since dw bradley wrote it it would be turn based
wrong
if you have poor handeye coordination like me forget it
otherwise it ran fine on win but crashed repeatedly on xp
go figure add a bit more content and charge  
i didnt see an expansion packi didnt see a dltalk about arrogance for goodwill purposes to those of us who purchased dl i bought it twice you would think the extra content would have been included in dldont buy this game  it just reinforces the notion that game companies can put out garbage and still make moneywe buyers have to draw the line somewherebuy dl patch it to  with the whopping mb patch  heck buy it used teach them a lesson  especially after this arrogant decisioni had great hopes when i began this game
it was advertised as an adventure game with puzzles to solve
not only were the puzzles so obscure but it was impossible to determine a sequence of events with which to proceed
i found myself going to the internet for hint after hint
another detriment to the game was the endless transporting from one area to another
to solve a puzzle you would have to go through three or four transports only to be forced to go to another area involving a lot of movement
truthfully i got to the point where i only wanted to game to endi have to say this was a totally unsatisfying game experience and would not recommend it to anyoneokami is a game that really stood out for me
there are many games i find to be mediocre true but it is a rare occasion when one becomes an irritant
okami is filled with so many annoyances that whatever thats good found in this game are completely undermined by these horrible factorsissun is a joke
whoever wrote the dialogues must be either  years old or misread their job descriptions into thinking that they were making a game for children only
i thought super mario galaxy had really really obnoxious dialogues but that game would be rated m for mature compared to this game
and i know e stands for everyone but as it currently stands it should have been given a c for childreni am sad to inform that i absolutely could not stand this game
after all i dont buy video games just to bash them
i buy them thinking it must be a good game for it to have such good reviews
so i really tried not to mind the  minute long introduction that was somehow unskippable
it was so long yet so deprived of any essence or meaningful lines that it could have been summarized into a sentence
a heroic wolf died saving a village and now the village is surrounded by evil once again
 minutes for this
now add an annoying bug companion to the formula who chirps and whines like crazy in every cut scene and lets give everyone annoying mumbling sound effects when they talkmy favorite part of the game was when i found a bunch of rabbits on the ground and picked one up like a mother lion picks up her cub
its really really sad that that was my favorite part of the gamethis product did not fulfill my expectationsappeared to be cunterfeit
the seller did quickly honor my request to return and amazon was great with printing a return label and refunding my money
the pictures and description in the listing led me to believe this was a legit copy
my disappointment was strictly with the items lack of authenticitygot to be the cheapest worst graphics i have ever seen in years
looks like scenery is painted on a flat piece of cardboard
the control is terrible
the bouncy bouncy motion is just too stupid for wordswhat a waste of timeive been playing the spyro games for a long time ever since the first game spyro the dragon was released for playstation
after playing the trilogy while growing up on the playstation one i than awaited for insomniac to make some new spyro gems for the playstation twohow disturbing this series has become since than
spyro enter the dragonfly and spyro a heros tail were alright although the first one of this whole new series did have a bunch of clicheacutes and the second one was frustrating this game is a failurewhat have they done to you spyro
now you are spyro baggins going off on your new little quest which is totally wrong
they reripped reburned the old awesome little spit of flame from the original series and made this cheapskate to earn some cash
spyro is now a disturbing little dragon and sparks is absolutely stupid
why are they trying to input famous voiceactors into this game
its not working
a while back after playing this game i got rid of it
for anybody who is new to spyro trust me dont play this game or the one after this eternal night
rather try to find a copy of the first game spyro the dragon and play itand even if they are continuing on with this new spyro especially with the new spyro game coming out this year and the movie spyro isnt going to get any better but the game play might
lets hope they dont stick with the boxedin world in this game
what a disappointmentthis game looked good
some of the reviews were great
i was hyped about the game the premise and what it promised to offer
however i could not get the thing to run
im very computer proficient and play a ton of computer games so troubleshooting is not something that really phases me
let me just say that i have never had the experience of  not being able to get a game to run or  having as many problems with tech support as i did with aspyrheres my experienceive loaded the game on  different computers with no success one of them a brand new alienware computerive even tried completely reinstalling windows xp and still the game would not run on a clean systeminitially tech support said they couldnt help me and pawned me off to their licensing companywho said that they dont do tech support and said i needed to talk with aspyraspyr said that i should just patch the product and it would work fine
when i said i already did that under multiple tries they said to try it again sighive read on some boards that xp service pack  can mess up the game
i suggested that to support but they flat out denied it
i then installed xp with sp onto a formatted computerand again the game would not runall in all i seriously doubt i would try another one of their games
even if it worked their support stinks to high heavenstay away
stay faaaaaar awayi bought this game several years ago but i only now got around to installing it and trying to play it
i have windows  os and it wont play on it
tried several things to get it to work including running it in compatibility mode for both windows xp and  but nothing helpedthese guys need to wise up and stop putting those drivers in their games
the only thing it hurts is legitimate owners
my last hard drive spellforce  decided my dvd burner was illegitimate and so started corrupting files wonderful
spent  bucks for something that ate my computerafter buying this game in spite of the bad reviews it was generating simply because the original was said to be so good i cannot even play the game because it did not come with a cd key
i am very dissapointed that people would have overlooked this very simple detail
do not buy this gameyes this game is unplayable unless you are hard core rts playerthat is because there is only one level of difficulty normal for skirmish and free style game modesyou cannot change the difficulty level for these types of games and since the normal level is so hard to beat then it is no fun to play the game and loose every timei am above average rts player who can beat every rts game on normal level but the normal level in this game is more like hard levelso if you are a very good rts player then go ahead and get this gamebut if you are an average player then you wouldnt be able to enjoy this gamecheat code are not available so you are stuck loosing every timeyou can play the campaign on easy but it is a boring campaign at least the first few missionsalso it does use starforce and it is not optionalwhen i installed the game it didnt give me the choice not to install starforceso do yourself a favor and get another gamelord of the rings middle earth  is a great game and war craft  tooget these games instead it is in the game listing as of boycott starforce it is mentioned in the forum as using starforce  causing problemsboycott starforce this is aspyr media also check out the bugspatch  system requirement complaintsjowood said future releases wont use starforcewhat future releases  which distributor i know of several gamesproducers that issued a remove starforce patch  one company said they would stop adding starforce after their latest game  i know of no company that pulled product removed starforce then ran more production without starforce included  someone can correct me if im in errorso i guess if this stays as is we either have to buy this game here with starforce or do withoutif i see updated info regarding this issue i will alter my reviewwhen this game is available without starforce i will purchase itwarning this game does not have the needed cd key in about half of it packages due to poor quality control
dont buylook either watch superman or play the part
the fact of the matter is games in general keep your brain from going doe
doe
despite the tired old stigma of theyre all just a big bunchopac man
so just play ultima or final fantasy its fun and they peek your interest and that alone can make one very acutenot obtuse furtherin the case of ultima or dd you learn a lot too
you dont need sudocu or crossword excersizes or whatever to charge your brain just something to peek your interest in a concrete topic
unlike my abstract scocial studies classes touted in dismissive bias by baby boomers
either read about the pilgrams or be onevoice recognition in this game needs some work
kind of bums your score when it doesnt recognize you voice on one word
my voice isnt really all that high either my boyfriend had no trouble
he has a really deep voiceaside from that this game is just okay at most
id say try out big brain academyfirstly the interface is a bit flawed
on many many occaisions i would say the correct answer the nintendo dsds lite has a mic that this game uses and it wouldnt register my answer being correct even though i was speaking the correct term
so actually i was correct but the game thought i was wrong and gave me a poor rating
this can be very frustrating and seems unfair when it displays the color blue for example and you clearly say blue and it doesnt even registersecondly it relies on how fast you can write with the stylus
a lot of people may be very quick to think the correct answer but may not be that good writing on the screen with the stylus which can be awkward since to play this game you have to hold the ds or ds lite turned on its side like an open book
it will give you a bad score just based on this even though you knew the answerthirdly the sayings that are on the screen during game play are strange and condescending
i think they are supposed to make the doctor virtual character seem powerful and superior but really a lot of what he says doesnt make much sense
there is no way to turn this off which can be a bit annoying because you have to sit through or click throw his sayings each time you playthis game should not rely so much on stylus and voice input and it should be redesigned to use the buttons more
as it is designed the buttons are virtually never even pressedthe game is more frustrating than fun not because i cant answer the exercises quickly and correctly most of the time but because the game doesnt recongize my correct input as correct the majority of the time
what good is thatthe premis of the game is emptyits supposed to exercise your brain but in reality playing super mario brothers or any other game probably exercises your brain just as much and is a whole lot more funi give it a thumbs downi bought this as quickly as i traded it
it was very obviousy meant for elementary school kids but i enjoy a lot of educational games
its biggest flaw is the main character instructor talks too much
theres no skipping or fast forwarding either
i got annoyed
i gave it awayi cant believe so many people like this game
it sucks
i played it once and that was enough
no goal no plot no story no purpose
just below level and not entertaining mini games
nobody i know played it more than twice
im amazed at these high reviewswhen are game makers going to get the memo that first person characters need to run
i fail to get sucked into this game  based on the fact that there are no shortcuts or faster ways to get from a to b game play is insanely slow
the puzzles are not quite cool or difficult enough to warrant walking and walking and walking and repeating and repeating anyway not that exciting
good thing seeing as a reviewer mentioned that this game cant be completedthis game is terrible
the ai in realistic mode the hardest mode is unrealistic
they can shoot you from an unlimited distance with perfect accuracy and  the moment youre in their site you can easily be one shotedthe graphics are excellent for  however there are glitches everywherethe most annoying glitch maybe not a glitch is when standing near ladders
when you stand near ladders you cannot shoot your weapon because it thinks youre gonna climb up or downother annoyances are not being able to jump after you run because you have a stamina dialon top of that sometimes you have to jump up a step meaning if your running from someone you better save your staminayou have a hide system that is terrible
the moment an enemy sees you youre pretty much targeted by over  enemies at onceif you dont have a barricade youre screwed during these timesthe saving system the worst
you literally have to go through many hardcore action sequences before you hit a save point however you can save anytime by going into the console and typing savegame quick and youll have a save spot
however you cannot have more than one manual save spot at a timethe most annoying is hide in grass while alerted it just doesnt work
you can move around duckedlaying frontwards on grass and they will still know where you are preciselyi got the game fro amazon i have a win   bt softwarethe game i got was for bt so it will not install on the pcso now i will have to send it back i guesswhere can i get the game in a bti love the sims
i love the sims
but i dont love this stuff pack
sixty items for twenty dollars is just not good value for money
there are plenty of fan sites that will let you download their very best items for  and plenty more fansites that have great downloads for freei dont blame the maxis people i blame ea
theyre getting greedy and its ruining a great franchise
milk the cash cow too often and it dries upi already made the decision not to buy these stuff packs as soon as i saw the family fun stuff pack ffsp come out  i knew right away it was a ripoff
it is an insult to our intelligence
however a girlfriend of mine thought it would be cute to purchase it for me since she knew i was into the sims  but she didnt know any better and surprised meafter installing it my preobservation proved true
here is the rundown of what the family fun stuff pack offers simmers  new music
if you run the game off the ffsp disk you can hear new musical scores at the loadup screen but not elsewhere
new clothes
there are three everyday outfits of hawaiian theme for each age group and gender to wear
nice hula shirts and cargo shorts
the kids get new pajamas
whoopee
new decorations
like ocean navigation
you get some nice looking sailing motiffe stuff to hang on the walls or place on an endtable
the best decoration in my opinion is the towel rack which i place in all my bathrooms
the wallpaper additions are for kids only medievaldragons and underwatersea life  new furniture
its all kid stuff dressers beds and lamps
anyone who uses the floor coverings under the rugs tab are creating a ridiculous room ill tell you that much
the main problem with this stuff pack sp  besides the fact that all the material should have been included in the open for business expansion pack ep and not sold separately  is that you are extremely limited with what you are given
in all reality you will make two bedrooms and use up  of the items to do so
then you will wonder why you dropped  on such a ripoff perpetrated by the maxis gangif the sims  wasnt such a solid game id recommend a boycott
maybe just boycott the sps and epsmy only recommendation is that you purchase zero expansions and stuffs for the sims  until the sims  is released a couple years from now
then when they offer the sims  complete edition  which will include all their ripoff expansions and stuffs  you can buy it for  guessing
otherwise if you dont like to spend money wisely this sp is for youim going to try to give a fair review of this pack for those of you considering it
but this is going to be hard so please bear with methis stuff pack released less then a month after open for business came out is minimal at best
i bought this going against the advice you see here by other reviewers
i was sorely lacking for some kids room ideas having done alien rooms and soccer rooms to the hilt
as a long time sims fan i generally dont like downloading objects from the internet fan sites as ive heard stories of viruses being in them and also them ruining your saved games
this stuff pack seemed to be a happy medium
i would be able to get new objects for my sims without introducing a entire new part of the game as in the previous expansionssomething about the best laid plans  they never work
i bought this today luckily at a less expensive price then amazon at target
i installed it and made a sea and castle theme room for my sims
that took all of  minutes
this is the problem with the pack
those rooms are neat and spiffy but to totally go through an expansion pack trying all the different options within  minutes means to me that its not worth the money
the clothing options for adults are limited to  outfits each in the hawaiian style
theres no new adult things just a few minimal decorating objects
this pack would have been better named kids fun stuff because its truly about the kidsmy opinion comes down to save your money
i know people are going to be miffed with this pack and probably sell it in amazoncom marketplace for alot less then its selling for now
if you must have this pack to complete your collection my advice is to waitif maxisea wants to release stuff collections like this one i would think a downloadable pack on the internet for about five dollars would be reasonable
 dollars for a pack like this just isnt fair to your die hard sims fan
considering that an average sims player forks over  for the original game  for each expansion this was an unfair move to capitalize on a weakness of the game
weakness being lack of good kids stuffjust my two cents ostuff packs
all they sound like to me is a way to make money for ea and maxispleasestick to the real stuff like expansion packs nightlife university open for business
pleasei would have of gave the game  stars but i cant do less than the damn game game brokenand i bought the game newi opened the pice of crap and the game was torn up and styim reviewing factions from the trilogy game set that i got
the trilogy comes with  gw games propheciesfactions and nightfalls
i can honestly see the variating differences in all the games
ill start by saying what most people already know
guild wars is a very pretty game
the game has great detail in terrain and character design
for the most part i believe that is one of the main reasons that it remains somewhat popular to this day
however the game play is not as beautiful as the graphics
guild wars factions of the  games o nthe trilogy i have is the ugliest game of them allaside from the starter mission the main missions take place in a chinese ghetto mostly
you will be in this ghetto about  of the game
unlike the previous game trying to navigate around in factions is a punishing task
many times you will find yourself running into dead ends or comming across mobs of goons that drop from seemingly out of no where
i really did not find this game satisfying at all
every corner you turned waited mobs of  goons waiting to attack youno thats not a rough estimate either
exploring is almost out the question even if you have a  star teamthe reward for fighting mob after mob just is not worth it
there were almost  quest that i had completed in the game that i did not even bother to go and collect the reward on because it was too difficult to return to the areas to collect them
i love games and ive played many in my lifetime but this was the first game where i completed portions of it and simply did not care to even pickup my reward
the design of factions makes playing it a chore
arent games supposed to be enjoyable
what is thisi also want to add that that factions does include a better story than the randomly confusing story of prohpecies that did not connect well nor have a true point in the end
this time the plot is pretty cut and dry
although the story doesnt compell you to beat the game it is better than the previous attempt at a solid storyalong side the story you have some new classesyou have assasin and ritualist
i play mainly an assassin and ive never been so furiated at gameplay controls and design
the assassin skills are chain skills meaning you need to use skills abc to unlock skill d the one that you only wanted to use in the first place
when you add this skill setting style to a limit of  skills at a time it gets old
what you will find are few basic skill sets that will work
eventually you will get tired of doing the same sequences over and over again
i played pvp on my assassin and every fight was the same
i have little chose in what moves i chose because the game limited what i could do
its like it was telling me how to play
it just made a class that could have been a lot of fun a chore to play
the designers could have done a better job with the assassin skill set as most skills are very similar just listed in different catagories
which makes chaining them even more of am annoyanceanother drawback to the game is the community of guild wars
factions has harder missions where henchman and heros will just not be enough
you have to use live players and in an online rpg game like guild wars most of the players are children that dont understand the concepts of teamwork
youll again be stuck looking for people to help you finish a mission you need to beat the game
it really wouldnt be so bad since guild wars is a highly sociable online rpg game there is always someone around
however the people that are around are not always the ideal people to mingle with
the community of guild wars is on a preteen level
there are many immature players that waist no opportunity to vent hateful and mindless message to any and every player they can find
youll be quickly tired of reading internet lingo spewed in the chat box every other second
youll also get tired watching every miserable teen vent their meaningless adolesent fury on any player who says something they dont like
saying hello might trigger an argument in this gameall things aside i did not find factions very enjoyable
the only reason i took the time out to beat it was due t o the fact i paid  for the game and get something out of it
factions was the nd guild wars game i played and beat and im not interested in continuing
playing redundant missions fighting mindless mobs over and over and over again being given missions with more text to read than the bible and  having to put up with a community that would best be suited for a middleschool does not interest me at all
the game is very limited and walks on rails as far as what you can do and what you can experiene in this game
some people may love this game and some like me may see it otherwisei did not bother to compare guild wars to games like warcraft because warcraft is an mmo
guild wars is basicly an online rpg that allows you to have the option of interacting with other players if you wish to do sothe bottom line is that if you love guild wars and enjoy the gameplay and community than factions should be just fine for you but if your looking for a game that has more depth to it and community that has at the very least passed puberty than guild wars really is not for youi thought i could save some money buy buying a used game but the access key that must be used to play the game has already been used and is non transferable so i basically got the physical game but i cannot play it because of the used access code
i got my game from wowhead and i dont understand why they even sell the game used if its not playable and non transferable
isnt that illegal to sell itjust a warningim sure the game itself is great but now i have to keep the game and repurchase another key from online a whole new game because my returning this would cost me more than what i paid for the game itself
so ill just keep the physical copy of it and reorder a new copy from online
but it did not save me moneydo not buy this game used from anyonecame in a yellow pouch with scratches all on it never would order this again the disk stopped working after  usethis game was terrible
it was so scratched up it would not even read in my play station
do not buy this it is terrible and i emphasize terriblei just played the demo to this game well actually i has to quit
i like violent video games and all most of the time
but this was ultra violent and ultra bloody
the gta games were violent but cartoonish  and they gave you something else to do car races etcthis game is a nonstop killing machine of blood bombs and guts
it takes quite a bit to turn my stomach and this game does ithate to pay three times once for the game once for the privilge of using a serverxboxs and once for registering to play on the games serveri never played or registered this so the game might be great but ill never knowive had six dw games since i started playing them way back about  years ago
this is probably the worst
of course because its empires it has no musou mode which is the best part of dw
because of that you cant really progress characters nearly as much such as getting awesome weapons and things
also the strategy of course isnt really strategy
you just pick which battles to fight
and the one aspect that makes it utterly boring is that there are not nearly enough people in each battle
i spend more time running trying to find enemies than fighting versus old dw xtreme legends where i would once in a while end up with  kills
dont buyi like shooters especially quirky ones
im even giving a lot of older games a try just to find a gem among the excrementthis appears to be more the excrement kind than the gem kind
i was unable to run it under windows  even in compatability mode for what its advertised
after quite a lengthy install did we really used to put up with three cds slowly being copied onto a hd
 i got a nonwindows error message upon starting
the miniature type said something about software being missing
windows own error alerts showed me that i was missing numerous components of the starforce drivers packageso i ran the program with administrator privileges mistake
it said i had to reboot to run the application
huh
i did and got the textbased startup screen windows is reading files rather than the familiar graphical one
i was then taken to a repair disk screen and pretty much dropped a deuce right there
i had moved recently and hadnt hooked up my dedicated backup disk fortunately i did have a restore point from the last windows updateafter rebooting i checked the web and found that starfrce is an infamous copyprotection scheme like securom which installs hidden drivers onto your system
wikipedia links to a site purported to be a removal tool but its heavily russian and casually translated into english and doesnt seem to have the actual tool
a google search came up with starforcecomsupportdrivers where i found sfremoveexe
this site like the russian site seems intent on forcing miniature text onto your browser
perhaps a normal vision user could see it but i had to use magnification
now im hoping that this tool has cleaned my system out
ubersoldier itself doesnt show up in programs and features for uninstallation and the program while it has some uninstall files doesnt actually uninstall itself
i used the macos approach just trashing the folder and hoping it hasnt left any droppings on my hd
sorry this review is so poooriented but thats how im feeling at the moment after flushing five bucks down the loo on this game
its experiences like this that make piracy seem ethical
i guess you might be able to enjoy this game if you  had a pc with a bit processor and a vintage graphics card  were using windows xp or   didnt mind clandestine software being forced onto your pc and d have a backup of your system just in case
for my own part ill avoid games by cdv and keep looking for good old games prey was very pleasing indeed and installed without hassles so good older games do exist
this just isnt one of themubersoldier comes with starforce
older versions of starforce will not work with newer windows
if you have windows xp the game will run fine
if you have windows  do not install the game or starforce may mess up your computersometimes starforce wont do any damage to your computer it may simply state that it wont work with a generic windows message
other times starforce may stop your computer from starting up correctly resulting in headaches trying to get the computer to work againbeware all games with starforce on themi had purchased a new computer barely  months ago
one of the reasons was to play silent hunter   it is an hp pavillion an with dual dvd drives
i like to make compilation cds from my cd collection and had made a couple after i purchased the computer
everything worked greatafter a couple of months got around to installing and playing silent hunter  which i love
a few days later tried installing another game on the regular dvd rom drive with no sucess
i was able to install the game with my writer drive which took an abnormally long time
at the time i thought it was just the gameanother week later i was making another compilation cd and it took literally almost  hours to burn the cd
now i was concerned
i went to work to try and find what was wrong
after about a month it became clear that it was starforce that was the problem
i cant tell you how angry i am
i feel like starforce should pay for new drives for my computerwithout thinking i purchased space rangers   played it one day and liked the game very much
after a couple of days i routinely check if starforce was on my computerhaving gone through the removal procedure previously with sucess and low and behold starforce was back
it is on space rangers 
i have learned my lesson
i no longer purchase a game until i know for sure it does not have starforce
not only has starforce hurt the games that have it but i feel starforce has hurt the industry as a wholeedited june th i have heard that there is or going to be a version that does not have starforce
if this is true then i would wholeheartedly recommend space rangers   please make sure you do not buy the version that has starforcenandreamfall is a starforce protected gamethose of you not familiar with starforce anticopy protection software should read the prince of persia the two thrones user reviews here at amazonthis program installs hidden drivers on your hard drive that are not removed when the game is removedthe starforce authors as well as many developers claim that starforce is a safe and effective means of copy protectionplease read the two thrones posts here at amazon and if in doubt of starforce on this game double check the starforce game list at a boycott starforce site  and or email aspyryour computer will thank youi bought this game originally looking for a long rpg or puzzle game and the name was the appeal
i am glad however that dreamfall the longest journey turned out to be one of the quickest easiest games ive ever playedthe game progressed in too many directions but drunkenly bounced me from one side to the other until i collapsed in some ridiculous ending
the only long part about this game is the list of holes in the storyline
i am convinced that this game could be fun for a preadolescent female but is waste of time for any adult or serious gamerstoryline original yet annoying and uninterestinggraphics parpuzzles easybattle system horrendousentertainment value my first experience with re was on my friends ps
it was awesome
since i didnt have a ps at the time i bought this pc version of the game
i thought i was getting a bargain till i actually played it on my pc
oh boy it has to be one of the worst translations from gamecubeps to pc ports ive ever played
if the letterbox view wasnt annoying enough in the gamecube and ps versions the fuzziness and controls are even more annoying in the pc version
if youre a resident evil fanatic i would recommend you save on a cheap used gamecube or ps and play the games on those consoles the way they were meant
i highly dont recommend this pc version of such an awesome gamei bought the pc version of re  thinking ill download the mouse patch and then everything will be fine
not
even with the mouse patch aiming is a supreme pain in the butt
the game does not interpret mouse movement well at all so your aiming sight moves way too fast
even with the mouse sensitivity turned all the way down the aiming sight moves too fast
not only does it move too fast it moves in stops and starts instead of smoothly
so dont think the mouse patch makes this game playablealso the graphics in the pc version are unbelievably bad
theyre worse that the original gamecube and ps  versions
ive heard there is a graphics patch you can download but with the mouse working so poorly in the game theres no point
my advice to all the re  fans out there is to get the wii version
it looks beautiful and with the added ease of aiming with the wiimote its much more enjoyable to play
yeah you wont be able to download all the characters mods but at least youll have a good time playing the game
seriously the wii version rocksthis is frankly the worst game i have ever played
anyone who gives this higher than  stars has either anever played the pc version bplayed with a usb game controller or conly played the console versions ps gamecube etc
this is a classic example of a console game that was ported by a lowbudget japanese company to the pc in order to bring in more dollars
there is absolutely no mouse support outside of a rd party mousehack which only makes aiming slightly better
when gamers like myself have to turn to other gamers to make the controls better it is a pathetic game to start withthe minimum system requirements are far to low to even come close to playing the game in the lowest detailresolution
even their recommended system requirements might not be able to play the game in full detailthe graphics are good but there is no woweffect when it comes to textures during normal gameplay
the cutscenes are poor x resolution with no lighting effects whatsoever and short vertical white lines randomly in the picture
think of a cutscene from a late s game to get the ideahere comes the worst part of it the control conversion
rather than saying press shift to dodge this boulder that will kill you the game uses the console text press the rd button
it took me  tries to figure out what    was on the keyboard
to me it would seem easy to rewrite the game code to say shift  enter instead of   
after  months of release delays i expect much betterin conclusion do not buy this game
obscure for  is far superior in graphics and gameplay  people can play
this game would be great on the ps but this shoddy pc version has really left a foul taste in my mouth
as of writing this review i have still not finished the game due to sheer frustration with the controlsfirst of all this game has no mouse control at allto fire your weapon you have to press shift and enter at the same time and you have to use another  buttons to line up your shotall other games do all this just using the mousethat aint all every action you take you have to use  or  buttons to do itit is not a free roaming gameyou are on a path if you try to walk off of it you cantvery linier game play and really bad controlsi just bought this game and am putting it up for saleit is obviousley a console game adapted to get the pc dollarsthis game is nonfunctional on the pc
the game package says peripherals supported windows compatible mouse and keyboard this is a flat out lieas you have probably learned from the other reviews it does not support mouse
not only that even the keyboard doesnt work
after playing the game for  minutes a menu  screen opened and i could not get out of it because there was no button on the keyboard mapped to close the menu
i would have had to drive to the local gamer store purchase a console controller in order to close that menu
the manual that comes with the pc game is actually the console manual thereby making it completely useless because all the instructions refer to how to make it work with your console
no mention anywhere of pc controls
all of the ingame menus and ques that come up refer to the standard console controller buttonswhich of course i dont have why would i
i own a pc
they didnt even take the time to map really obvious console controller buttons to really obvious keyboard buttons for example the numbered buttons on the console controller could have been easily mapped to the numbers on the keyboard  they did not do this
infact the very menu that i could not close had a note such as to close this menu hit console controller button  and yet hitting the keyboard button  did not do anything
this is a no brainer just map the console controller button  to keyboard button  it is unfathomable how anyone could be so lazy
if you dont mind going out and purchasing essentially a console controller in order to play this game on your pc then it may be a  star game instead of a  staruntil i bought this game ive never had to delete a game from my hard drive within  minutes or less of installing it
i now own a  coaster that is the best use for the game disk i can findi might not be as annoyed if they had at least said on the package game console controller required to play
though for a pc game there is no excuse not to have mouse support
if you are going to take the time to port a console game over to a pc at least take the time to make it work on a standard pc
i guarentee you  of people who exclusively ownplay games on a pc do not own console style controllers there is no need all pc games ever created except this one have mouse support
compared to console controllers the mouse system works x better for all types of games
if you have been playing on a pc all these years like some of us you would know thathorrible horrible horrible
i will never buy another title from this company or a console to pc game ever againi cant rate the game overall because after hours of dinking around with rd party patches which give you good graphics but absolutely p poor mouse control i deleted the cursed thing from my computer
the game plot etc
may be fantastic but if you have to f around with sloppy and an incomprehensible control system the entertainment value plummets
i even tried my controller which i hate and unless you have the exact controller they used to develop this game youre in for more frustration
besides controllers unquestionably lack in control and precision compared to a keyboardmouse in a fps
take the advise from the negative reviews and stay the hell away from the pc
version
go wii or cube or whatever except this pc slop
im going to buy the wii version
its cheap enough and the game does look like it might be interesting
a pox on ubi money grubbing scoundrels that they arewow they got me
shame on ubisoft and capcom for this piece of junk
with all the hype and movie and all i said wow what only 
i figured it would be one of those  games
this game in not meant to be played on pc
i can live with that
they did a good job with halo but these guys dont have a clue on how to bring a console game to pc
i saw ubisoft a name i could trust
this from the makers of farcry
well this is a farcry form any good game
some of my valusoft games are way better than this
this game is so bad that even with all the patches it is not going in my used game box
it is going where this evil resident belongs in the trash
and i was lucky enough to have a game pad
dont bother buying one for this game
then you will be out  for this
it is evil
it is not even worth the one star i gave itthis is the very last time i will ever purchase a playstation port over to the pc
if software is developed for the playstation it is quite simply made to be played on the playstation
everything about this port over is just absurd garbage from the first intro frame
one the screen is awkward
two the game will just randomly crash while on windows
however thirdly and worst of all the game controls lie to you on screen
if you are familiar with any of the games in this series there are moments when you will have to randomly press a sequence of buttons when prompted on screen
however in this weak and absurd port over the on screen signals have no relation to any actual keyboard or control function
instead of saying for example enter key
or something simple like that the pc version will spam 
or    
and the numeric keys on your keyboard actually have nothing to do with the actual controls that you need to use
turns out that  actually means the enter key such lies at such critical moments are simply intolerable
keep in mind that it will randomly generate a set of controls so youll have to translate andor figure out what the game actually means instead of simply playing the game
do not waste time or money on this pc port
if i even hope to have fun with re i will have to spend more money on the actual real playstation versiongrotesqueomg
this game is whack
the graphics are too dumb and it has a bad control
dont buy this
its a total waste of moneythere are alot of fake bootleg copys of nintendo ds and game boy advance games sold online
be careful when buying games online
also i am shocked that when people have posted warnings about this problem their reviews have been marked not helpful
thats crazy
how is informing and warning you of something not helpful i borrowed this from a friend of mine thinking it might be an updated version of the original ron boy was i wrong
all of the things i loved about the original rise of nations have been gutted and in its place an utterly generic rts game has been created just like so many games i barely remember playing since 
ya the visuals are kind of interesting and it has a warcraft iii kind of feel to it but the ai is absolutely pathetic in terms of strategy
the unit and building selection is pretty minimal as is the laughable tech treebottom line this game is made for the casual player who doesnt know what the acronym rts stands fori fully accept that this is not a bigtime game with millions of dollars of work into graphics and design and engine and such
i dont care
i dont care if a game has nearphotorealistic graphics if the game sucks it sucksand this one does indeed suck
i wouldnt bother mentioning graphics unless they were remarkable in some way
they are remarkable here in being virtually nonexistant
its  and in this year a similarscale game medieval ii total war and rome total war two years before had come huge gigabytes worth with d animations for all the units
way back in  and  the total war games had what this game has pixellated pictures of units on the field two dimensional and as highly detailed as duke nukem or doom villainsthis is only remarkable for how incredibly bad they are and in some cases they actually hurt the gameplay itself but even if the graphics were top of the line id still give this game its poor reviewfirst control
namely there is none it would seem
i almost never use tutorials finding i work better when put into a situation and let to press all the buttons myself
what a disaster it was here
even with complicated games like europa universalis i could recognize that although the buttons i was pressing were having effects i didnt understand enough to manage the game and had to go back to the tutorialswoe be to me for this game for the literal nonreaction i had from so much of the game had me thinking that the game was broken rather than that i was doing something wrong
even in the tutorial this was evidentthe first biggest problem with this moving your units
theres a menu on the bottom of the screen with a wide variety of actions you can have your unit do from charge to advance to retreat wheel leftright stagger formation take cover line formationblock formation etcetera
and less than half of them work at any given timethe advance button does absolutely nothing
in every simulation i was in even in the tutorial the advance button did nothing
the only way soldiers would move is by clicking on them so that a barelyvisible flag appeared over them then clicking somewhere on the field for them to move
before the tutorial this meant my first scenario on easy mode as general early saw commands given to me to support the confederate left under heavy attack and saw me watching my main brigades just stand there ducking and standing up again and again unable to advance charge retreat or do anything else but duck and standthe general command controls youd want for a strategy game upclose as this such as attack attackmove hold position stop etcetera are apparently nonexistent as i was given no clue in the tutorials whether i could do anything when an enemy came into range while i was still moving other than manually select them to stop and manually select them to fire
the quality of the graphics actually acts against the gameplay in this manner as you literally cannot tell what direction soldiers are firing in
i had a regiment of union soldiers placed at something like a  degee angle from a confederate regiment and had all the union soldiers shooting straight aheadmeaning that if they really were shooting where the game graphics showed then more than half of them werent even aiming at the confederates
theres no way to tell how many of the enemy are killed because the graphics are unclear as to which units of the enemys fallsequally confusing is the unit sizes
the game will register a unit as having something like  men in it while the graphics show pictures of barely  of them
when they come under fire you see several of the  men drop apparently bloodied while your losses reflect losses in the single digits  men to  for example
the depicted scale is not just off its disastrously off and makes it impossible to tell when a unit is suffering casualties too severe exacerbating the previous condition of not even being able to tell where they are shootingmaybe it is an ironic reflection of real life napoleonic tactics but in these cases the only sensible solution to get anything done is to fix bayonets and charge the enemy
i prefer to reconcile it to bad gameplayto the camera  the camera is slow and sluggish and if you have a wheelscroll button there camera wont zoom in to the units as with most all modern rts games but will simply drop to the ground level providing a view even worse than that of a soldier on foot
your soldiers tend to be either slightly offscreen or filling up the entire screen
the arrow keys on the keyboard rather than sliding the screen about will completely shift your view to other generals on the field
the problem they arent your generals
you do not and cannot command them
and there is no minimap to reorient your view back to yourself
its one thing to claim no minimap is realistic because generals couldnt see the entirety of the field in live action back then but generals also couldnt magically teleport over to their commanding officer with no way of teleporting back just as quicklythe level of detail in this small game is wonderous as each unit has its own name st massachussetts th virginia infantry etcetera and every general has a name of a real life counterpart and despite being titled take command nd manassas many scenarios are included for virtually all major battles of the warnone of which even matters if you cant even play the game properly without wild mass guessing and random lucka far more helpful realistic view of this style of war which is also fun and not so clumsy and difficult to handle has thus far been shown in total war games and modifications for it
the game empire total war with a mod called the blue and the gray and a mod called secession  civil war for the game medieval ii total war do a fabulous job of depicting american civil war combat in video games with all the problems of smoke visibility morale ammunition accuracy discipline and training and terrain to challenge the player withwow where do i even begincall of cthulu isa game that fails in so many ways
before i get to the technical issues i think it is best to start with the general game design
call of cthulu tries to be three things aa horror game ban fps and c a puzzle gameas a horror game it is a disappointing mixed bag
it can create a frightening unsettling atmosphere it can create a couple of gotcha popup scares but it cant really scare you in the more basic and fundamental way that amnesia doom  fear or silent hill could
most of time it just creates a sense of danger on the horizon that never really gets to you in the precise way that youd want it to be materialized
actually there is one part early in the game where the players worst fear does become materialized but this is never repeated for the rest of the gameas an fps it is both viscerally bloody and twitchy and not only that but your character moves so slow
i think this game probably has the slowest base run speed every implemented in a fps game
your run is really a walk
also your character can jump but  of the time he cannot make jumps that normal people would be able to make
this is frustrating at timesthe other aspects of the game were only partially broken but the puzzle aspect of this game is the first of the elements that are truly broken
all the puzzles in this game are completely counterintuitive and are impossible to solve without a strategy guide
even the lock puzzles are needlessly difficult
a game in my opinion is a failure if it requires a strategy guide in order to be beatenand probably the number one reason why this game sucks is because it has numerous glitches most of which have not been patched formally
there is one chapter in this game a dangerous voyage that is completely glitched and broken
and on the forums these glitches are pretty much impassible on modern computers
certain mission critical lights wont show up certain scene transitions crash the game etc
the ai doesnt move correctly
this chapter failed game testing in every single possible way
i cant believe this game even made it to retail or they even put it up for download with such numerous glitches most of which are fatal
i cant even complete the game because there were so many glitches on that chapter
after about the th crash i just gave the game upoh how i wish i could rate this game higher
the atmosphere is incredibly good
unfortunately that is the only thing good about it
otherwise its a trial and error save load save load loop of aggravation
wrong door load try again
not fast enough load try again
which of the three paths ahead leads to success
guess until you get it right and then move on
this is my pet peeve with all video games
when they rely on giving you unlimited continues and turn it into a guessing game that is less about skill and more about luck it completely drains engagement from the experience leaving you with no depth no suspension of disbelief and certainly no suspense
you go from tension to repetition and repetition kills tension
you get the feeling that youve done this before because you just have a dozen times over to finally move on
youre just struggling to give it the one and only solution in the one and only way that it will accept as correct to get to the next cut scene
there is enough of jumping through hoops in real life without having to turn a video game into work
it takes a lot of hard work to make a game that is openended the more it is the more it tends toward buggy behavior i encountered no bugs in the few hours i played the game but a lot of hard work is supposed to be what were buying instead of cut corners
there is a ton of potential here but it falls hopelessly shortthe healing system is unrealistic yet had some potential due to its depthyou try to take your time and enjoy it and instead of excitement you end up with grating mindnumbing boredomlovecrafts work deserves much better than this weak attempt at entertainmentagain a for atmosphere the dreary environments dark situations and great audio to matchstraight fs for everything elsegraphics are not as good as promoted
i should have expected since the only pictures i saw were art work and not game enviroment
all i can say to the developers and team that made it is take some pride in your work
i was think of upgrading my computer even more to see if that might improve my game play but after reading these reviews i have declined
the team and management developing this game have handed off another dissapointment to the startrek communitywhat excitement had i to be able to pilot the ships of star trek and to pick between the enterprise x the enterprise ncc the enterprise ncca the enterprise nccd the reliant the constitution etceteraand indeed i was having fun with the familiar sounds of people telling me things on board and piloting the ship in to lock phasers on a target and attackbut thats about where the fun endsthe way this game is built feels and looks like something ten years older than it should be even if the graphics are somewhat topnotch and nifty for   the menu is too simple to a degree that you cannot adjust many graphics options or controls
even worse you cant even see your controls
and trial and error never seems to work ingame unless you play through the dreadful tutorial which is overly slow and pointless just to teach you the most basic functions one at a time four or five things over a ten minute period just to learn to accelerate or decelerate without the mousei got so bored with the tutorial i gave up after exploring the first planet
then i skirmishedi had absolutely no idea what was happening or whyas the federation i could pick four ships maximum in my skirmish fleet but i could only command one at a time
no idea if i can have the other ships slaved to mine or if they have independent ai
im pretty sure they cant fight on their own because every time i played my other ships did absolutely nothing until i scrolled to them and manually moved them abouti dont even know exactly what to press to attack
im pretty sure its just to leftclick but ive had so many instances where i am literally meters away from an enemy ship smashing the leftclick mouse button feverishly and seeing absolutely nothing happen only to suddenly have my phasers open up on a completely different targetthe mere idea of playing with star trek ships was a worthy idea worth making a game out of
but they just seemingly intentionally sabotaged it with nonexistent control help and stilted clumsy movement completely arbitrary actions and a limit to only four sides federation klingon romulan borgbuggy interface lousy gameplay directingthough storedialogue somewhat decent and a patronizing ported from console feel this game is undebatably the worst title of any genre of games for the pc
yes as the horny juvenile highschooler pukes who wrote the dialgoue in the tv series enterprise this stinx like the spinx and is in fact for the immature at most
when as in music and other arts and entertainment games get real againand ms goes under i will be somewhat impressed at what is happening to pc games in general this is a travesty of a once great gaming device
thier is no graphics card worth this no pc upgrade worth this and stinky xboxy controls limited to up down and sideways
like need for speeds downgrade from car inerior view to no there is no bridge access
yeah you really feel like your in control
moron
what a stupefor some reason the game programmers felt it was necessary to have a high requirement for graphic cards
even though the box states only a  is needed the game wont run unless you have very specific graphic cards
these requirements are not printed anywhere unless you call bethesda directly and go through thier technical help desk
i even bought a topline agp graphic card  and the game doesnt accept it
there are not many video cards that the game does accept so if you are lucky to already have one then you are just lucky
if not then you either have to convince the store you bought it from to refund your money or go pay  for a video card that is on thier compatable list
bethesda also refuses to refund anyone for thier products and as we all know stores wont take back software that has already been openedthats right this game is funless
its a dumb boring oldfashioned arcadestyle shooter
the guy who modeled the ships did a great job but everything else is next to worthless
i kept waiting for a patch to fix many of the most annoying problems and when they finally issued a patch it too was worthless
oh the box art is nice so it makes for a nice shelf decoration but if your looking for a fun engaging replayable intelligent game forget about iti bought this game when it came out  thrilled to see another star trek game since the last good ones were bridge commander and klingon academy
i got the game and i was blown away how buggy it was right out of the box
the controls were crappy
menus were glitchy
even with patches the controls still sucked
the story line was pretty cool
i wont give any spoilers
the graphics were awesome
but i tried to play this game on a  system in  with windows  a quad core  computer and patches would not apply
the only  answer i got from bethesta was  the game doesnt support multi core 
yet   core prossesors were out at the time
load of crap
a typical response for a crappy game company that  hangs on by their elder scrolls series and trashed out the star trek  franchise with a release like this
stay away from this game
play bridge commander or klingon  academystart off with the positives
a short list good ship model detail  ok voice overs from actors
so much for the positives
now for the reality check this game is a total let down  only succeeds in sucking more life out of the star trek name
with a title that includes legacy i was stoked at the possiblity of a finely tuned technically detailed game that made you feel like you were commanding a starship that could level a planet
as doctor mccoy once stated what you get is a game that has all the fullfilment of a quarter driven video game that you might find in a bowling alley
controls for the game are the pits
there is no way to customize the keyboard controls so you are stuck using the asdew keys
for a lefty like me it really really sucks
the ships themselves do not move like ships in space
they are tethered to an invisible vertical axis like a stippers pole
forget about yaw pitch and roll if an enemy is directly overbelow you you are hosed as you can never point your ship straight up or down
phasers
they are weak
per the game phasers are used to take down shields and photon torps are used to damage the hull
what a joke
the list goes on with an impossible system target menu that has to be pulled up on the target screen while staying on the moving target
damage effects are better in the bridge commander game by far
example a destroyed ship has parts blowing up around the ship model but the ship model itself is untouched it is like an overlay of graphics on top of the untouched model
the only combat item i liked was that photon torps did not travel at a snails pace as they do in bridge commander
think you can have fun with the skirmish battles you pick for yourself
think again
you cannot chose what your opponents ships will be
the game choses that for you as well
dont waste you hard earned dollars on this game
i have more fun playing the old dungeon keeper  game at least it is enjoyable and gives a good laughthis game is a mess
it looks to have been designed for the xbox  and ported to the pc
playing with a keyboard and a mouse its next to impossible to get anything done
target lock doesnt workyou lock in a target and the game loses the target a couple of seconds later
getting a torpedo lock is next to impossibleyour ship must have to be lined up exactly with the target to get a lock and then the lock is lost before you can even fire
switching to an xbox controller is a slight improvement but not muchno save points except for between missions you cant choose the enemys ships during a skirmish controls cant be reassigned without hacking into files with a text editor space stations break up into a few huge spinning chunks when destroyed
graphics are adequate but not as good as they could be for a new releaseive uninstalled it from my pc and am waiting to see if bethesdamad dog finally puts out a patch that fixes the game
the  and  patches didnt do itreally save yourselves dont buy this game until you read that its patched and fixedyou can actually buy a used copy of this game for really cheap right now if you know where to look so i was tempted to check it out and i rented it as a free rental
i spent no money on this game but it is so bad that i regret that i actually wasted the  or  minutes that i spent putting the disc in my console and playing this drek for as long as i could stand
this game has gotten a lot of bad reviews and it earned em
another cheap movielicense game carried out as if nobody involved even cared about making a real game
i wouldnt own this game if it was free
dont waste your timethis game has good graphics good fighting moves but is not worth the cost your time or the time it took to make
after a while the missions and boss fights are too hard and there is no invincibility cheat so you just cant pass it which means if you see this game for sale online or at a store pass it up and if you dont like it return it or if you cant sell it or destroy it if you want toi knew that the previous uefa euro  was giving me a migraine with the glitches i was getting from playing the game but this far surpassed that
first when i tried starting a match the player i was controlling would freeze up and than i would hear goal and the other team instead of at least getting one point got four points in one second tell me how that works out because i dont know  another was when i was at the goal about to take the shot my player would end up at the other end of the field making the wrong goal and giving the other teams another goal can you say what the 
i didnt have this problem with the fifa  regular games those worked just fine with no problems so i really dont know what ea sports did with this one except give me and later on my friends headaches when i gave this stupid game to them
if i could the only thing good about this crappy game was the field graphics and character designs and thats probably the best you can get from this game
i dont really know if anyone else has had this problem i tried getting in touch with ea to see if my game was defective or anything i could do to fix these glitches but after being on hold for  minutes enough was enough
so all i can say is for a reasonable price and if you like soccer games this might be ok
for you if youre lucky enough not to end up with a crappy disc like i apparently must have gottenthis game was just a waste of money to me
i was hoping for a great ww game and what do i get
first of all the system requirements are misleading
you need well above the minimum requirements to run this and even then you might have some terribly long loading times
when i did get the game to run what was i treated to
huge maps and a tank
oh boy how wonderful
i remember this from a little game called call of duty united offensive
the tanks were the worst part of that game but the nontank maps were incredible
lesson
driving around in tanks or jeeps is boring
combat is fun
simple enough
i didnt even see any combat in this game just a bunch of people driving around
cod uo already did this and did it way better
never again will i buy a game from steamdo u need high internet speed to download this or can dialup do the jobcaveat emptor
the box and indeed this website are misleading this game is not designed for single player at all and there are no campaigns or storylines
what this game is is an online game which are sad sad shadows of the skill involved in a quality single player game that offers you the ability to practice by yourself  practicing is not the same as playing as there is no effective single player mode
you wont find any mention of practicing until you open the box whereupon all mention of singleplayer goes away to be replaced with online game and offline practiceapart from pretending it has a viable singleplayer mode when it doesnt its bugridden freezes up elements like the sniper scope dont work drive a tank and you cant command it it move while you shoot because you have to perform each function yourself youre supposed to be able to tell the crew go here or do that but it doesnt workvery disappointed
waste of this game was like the same as part but just some new stuff i gottan board of this game
gta is has the same stuff just beating up people shotting stealing cars and the police chaseing after you thats real old and boring so this game was just the same nonsensethis game was made just to get an easy buck
i am appalled that ea games even decided to make this game or warner bros games for that matter
dc obviously either didnt have a big part in working on this game or they were in bad need of cash
dont waste your money and dont be fooled by the apparently awesome case art which is the only cool part about the game
theres nothing but cheap graphics aggravating and horrible controls and game play
this is a disgrace to the superman legacy
i hope they dont decide to make a man of steel game and screw it upsuperman returns is based off the movie of the same name with a little bit of added goodies
the story is basically superman must take down lex luger while fighting off other villians of the superman universe interesting rightanyway you control superman obviously
you can jump high into the sky and fly as high and fast as you like but you can not just do a normal jump lame
moving on you can use heat vision super breath and freeze breath
you can throw enemies fly beat up more enemies throw cars fly yeah
thats the whole premise for the game
there are these mini games with that
mr xplyztk or whatever his name is basically all it is is racing around metropolis collecting  kittens uh huh and playing as bizaro for a limited amount of time to destroy metropolis it makes no sense nor is it really funwhile your fighting enemies the city of metropolis can take damage and lose health yeah the city you are in can actually be destroyed and guess what
once it loses all its health your game is over and you have to start over
thats real fun when a tree catches fire cars are being blown up citizens are being hurt and need to be brought to a nearby ambulance and you have to fight about  enemies who seem to all have kryptonite all at once
in otherwords this games difficulty is ridiculously hardas you progress through sr you can gain experience which lets you gain levels
when you go up a level you get stronger heat vision and all that stuff also you unlock different outfits which are all lackluster anyway and you probably could care less for themand the enemies you fight oh boy
first your fighting robots then robots and dragons then robots  dragons  some monsters
what the f whatever
it makes no sense i mean dragons
come onthe graphics are blarf besides the superman character model  the city of metropolis
besides those two everything else is just bad blurry and smudgey
terrible for a  releasemusic is terrible and so is the voice acting
the only cool thing is when youre flying for a bit and you break the sound barrier thats it
otherwise once again terrible for a  release even a gameto be honest i had higher hopes for this game but sadly it fell flat on its face
how can ea make such a smash hit like the godfather then make  release this vomit
not even worth a rentali bought this because it was on sale for  or something back when it was listed at like  man did i get screwed
its kinda fun to fly around and stuff for a little bit but the fighting is pretty lame
the way the whole game was set up seemed pretty lame
i didnt play it for more than maybe an hour or two
i wonder if gamestop would give me  for it on a trade that would be a good deal
im not a fan of gta and ive never played the spider man games so maybe its fun if you are a sandbox gamer looking for a cheap fixbut failed to deliver
superman is arguably one of the best comic book super heroes
i had such high hopes for superman returns
unfortunately this game is by far the worst game ive played on xbox   viva pinata and lego star wars are better than this game
in fact i can honestly say this is the worst game ive ever played
and i have a pretty sizeable game library  ill start with the good since there is so much wrong with this gamepros   breaking the sound barrier while flying
hands down this is the best part of the game
if you want to experience this download the demo on xbl huge open ended city
this city is designed to be seen from a distance
if you look closely youll notice the programmers used copy and past for a lot of buildings and textures easy xbox  achievement points
you can unlock all of the achievement points in about  hours of gameplay
even less than that if you dont go for the  hours of gameplay achievement ummm thats itcons   repetative
the bad guys in between bosses are all the same
theres no variety
the main bosses all have about  lines that they repeat over and over and over again
to quote will ferrell from zoolander theyre all the same
i feel like im taking crazy pills
  not fun
this is the greatest sin a video game can commit
the game started off fun but after  hours of playing im so frustrated i cant take it anymore
my wife even commented that its not even fun to watch  poor controls
the controls are great if youre just flying around exploring the city but once you get into a battle things quickly devolve
the lock on system is terrible
if you lock on to the wrong thing a pedestrian or car instead of the bad guy you cant just cycle through the available things to lock on like every other game where you can lock on to things you have to unlock get your curser right on the guy you want and try to lock on again
as bad guys are constantly moving this quickly becomes a game of trial and error
the super speed button is great when you start flying and want to go straight up
its also great for flying far above the city but trying to use it while close to the ground or during a battle is horrid
for these situations it needs to be more of a gradual speed up
youre going  mph one second and  the next
its very easy to fly right past your target and run into cars and buildings
thats another complaint
if youre superman the man of steel flying faster than the speed of sound and you run into a building that building wont stop you
you should fly right through that building not the case with this game
you simply leave a small dent in the building as you come to a complete stop
its the same story while running and being completely halted by cars  no story
in between fighting the same guys over and over you see clips from the movie
theyre not really from the movie its animated but the voice acting sounds like the stars from the movie did i mention how repetitive this game isto sum things up breaking the sound barrier is fun everything else about this game is not
now that superman returns is in the bargain bin it might be worth it if youre really hard up for quick easy achievement points
but those points come with a price it may be the longest  hours you spend in front of your tv
for the same monetary price id recommend lego star wars
its a lot more fun
the achievements take a lot longer and are a lot harder but it is a truly fun gamewell maybe  star is a little harsh but there is a definitive football game and that is pro evolution soccer winning eleven in the us
it is so much better than any other football game on the market that there is absolutely no point in purchasing anything else fifa includedpros of fifa  it has full licensing of several world leagues and a huge database of players also has a heavily licensed soudtrackcons of fifa  it is crp compared to pro evo in anything that actually matters for example gameplay realism skill etcplease dont line the evil empires ea pockets with more money for their garbage sports games that they release with a new number on the end every year buy pro evolution winning eleven for the real football experiencei bought this item because of all the positive reviews
but when i receive the item the headset doesnt work
it only produce a short static sound whenever i plug it but thats it no sounds and microphone doesnt worki sent a refund to amazon and send the package back
hoping to get the refund fast so i can buy the original headseti got this so i always dont need to wear my turtle beach
the headset looks nice but it never picks up my voice
i always have to talk so loud for it to hear me
every other headset iv owned heard everythingit worked very well for  minutes
it was very clear and crisp
ten minutes later and my friends could not hear me barely at all
i switched over to using the kinect as a microphone
at least i didnt spend a ton of moneyhave to raise my voice to a level i dont normally speak at for the mic to register im talking
cuts me off midsentence as i let my voice fall back to its normal level
unacceptable behaviorwhen the servers were up it was a epic gamemany years of funlots of friendsbut now the game is goneno online connectionall you can do is just enjoy the spectacular physics of the gamethis could have been a great game had they payed attention to making the driving dynamics tightersay like almost every other racing game out there
the slightest touch in any direction sends you careening off the road
the graphics is superb and the game fanfare seemed interesting from the reviews i read but i never got to find that out for myself cuz after driving the very first car i just couldnt bring myself to playing this game againseriously it was that badmy son loved this game  when it worked which was only for one week after many many hours of messing around with it troubleshooting etc
then it started locking up and now it wont run at all even after hours and hours of uninstallreinstall etc
and my sons computer is no slouch  dual core athlon  with gb memory and an ati hd  video card
according to the internet many people experience lockups freezes etc with this game
its just too buggy to pay real money for
like i said my son loved it when it worked but that only made it more disappointing when it started crashing
this game is so buggy atari has even released a seperate program meant to fix the issues every time they come up  unfortunately it was the use of that software that pushed it over the edge and now it wont start up at all
it seems to suffer badly from corrupted game files and atari doesnt seem to have a real fix for that
dont waste your money on this one  or at least wait until atari releases a stable version of it
i wish i could get atari to refund my money for nonfunctioning software but i somehow doubt they wouldif you want your xbox  to get the ring of death or whatever or freeze up while playing then by all means buy this game
i hop on xbox live and cant even play with my squadmates because the freezing is so bad
also disconnects and other lockup issues are crippling to this game
do not buy this
last game i will ever buy from segawow  at first i thought it was me 
the psp plays like a board game 
see the other reviews 
i thought i would have some control of tony montana 
like vic in grand theft auto or like godfather for psp mob wars 
but i was so wrong 
sure this game might play well on other platforms but for the psp 
dont waste your money 
you will be sorry
i have never been this down on a game  but i get more excited playing checkers and this game is close to playing electronic checkers and takes more time 
my regret was i should have waited for the reviews 
i have not read one good one for psp 
they should pay us to play iti am a huge fan of the scarface movie and al pacino movies in general
i remember scarface had resurfaced in popularity in new york during the time of this game and i bought it the week it came out
i kept seeing those commercials and reviews and the game looks like grand theft autoi figured with  gta games out on the psp that played very similarly to its console counterpart that scarface would be the same on the psp
the commercials never showed how the psp game looked they just showed gameplay from the consoles and mentioned also on the pspi went to purchase this game new opened it and popped it in
i saw nothing that resembled the gameplay on tv
its basically gang wars except you the player do nothing but press and click
no skill needed whatsoever just keep clicking away
the psp version of scarface has no cool movies or footage or gameplayits just playing risk the board game on your psp with a gang war twist
thats it
so if you want to play risk on your psp then maybe this game is what youre looking for
however chances are if youve looked here you want to play scarface
do not buy this game
save yourself from the boredom
i spent  bucks on this and only got about  backwithin the same week of purchase
this game isnt even worth a rent
in my opinion do not even waste your timeits funny that the most invincible super hero ever created has never translated well to the video game world
superman returns seems as if that may change but alas this is just another licensed mindless beat em up and yet another lame superman game
the game starts off promising enough you fly around metropolis and the city is gigantic
all at once memories of the spiderman  video game surface because you get the feeling that this could be the type of do anything anytime gaming that the aforementioned game was based on but this is not the case
as all kinds of chaos explode in the city the more the city gets damaged the more its own life bar is drained and once its drained all the way its game over
now its a nice change of pace that superman himself doesnt have a life bar but why are his powers heat vision super breath etc
still have to be so limited and only attained after completing boring repetitive objectives
the fighting system is boring and for metropolis being so big theres hardly anything really to do
theres a nice list of villains to take on including metallo bizarro mr mxyzptlk and of course lex luthor
after that it all goes even further downhill
the graphics are blocky and just plain ugly even for a ps game and the camera really does want to jerk around and work against you
yeah superman returns is a just plain bad licensed crud fest that had more than enough time to get the kinks worked out the game was originally slated to be released alongside the movies premiere in theaters this past summer but what else would you expect from ea
thanks again guysthis game is extremely bad
bad storyline and bad graphic
looks cheap and cheesy inspite of the effort to make it free roaming
you can get this game used for  or lessdont buy this product or any electronic devices online
there is the danger that you will get a defective one and it will be a great inconvenience to return
and thats what happend to me
you might think online shopping is cheap and convenient
but remember no business people would make it convenient for you when you are returning a productlet me begin by saying that i really wanted to like the psp
the good news is that the screen is beautiful
thats all the good news
now for the bad news and its pretty bad
i have  vision and i had to squint to see what i was doing half of the time in most of the games i bought when i got the psp
the only one that was remotely enjoyable in this respect was the gottlieb pinball collection a fantastic collection by the way
the controls are extremely awkward to navigate
they claim its like holding a playstation controller but its not even close
dont believe this hype
my hands would cramp after  minutes of play and then continue to ache for a few minutes after i put the thing down
the joystick is the worst offender
my thumb was killing me after playing xmen legends for a while
the wifi connectivity is a big joke
the interface for surfing the web is frustrating at best and mindbogglingly nonintuitive at worst
its like the guys at sony took their interface design cues from microsoft eeuch
now this is the capper that really ticked me off
in order to save my game i had to purchase a memory stick
those things are expensive
so now im already in the hole almost 
the nintendo ds is such a better machine
you dont have to buy separate memory sticks the screen is beautiful the games rock
buy a nintendo save a bundle of money and tell sony what you think of this crappy piece of machinery called the psp
one more thing i was going to rent a movie to watch on the psp but blockbuster was charging  to rent a umd movie
what in the world is sony thinking
if this is supposed to make the playstation  attractive its not working
i wouldnt touch the ps with a tenfoot pole after my experience with the pspthe point being about the psp has always been about hype
there is no fun games there is no new age technology its all words and lies that sony uses to market a product to be competitivei have to admit i was excited when i first owned the psp a week later i was bored to death i didnt know how anyone could enjoy such a consolefor your sake the console would only be enjoyable at  put into it but thats not enough because the console itself is losing its reputation and is unenjoyablei am glad to own a  over a psp which is equal if not the same price you pay for the psp consolethe psp could have been a really excellent system except for one thing
that stupid analog stick that is extremely easy to break hence breaking your fun of gaming also
all other sony products i ownedstill working ps are durable tough and resilient
the psps original design wasnt passed through qa enough to catch this fatal analog stick design flawmy best advice is to save your money for pspgo or vita those have durable designs unlike this old gen pspthere is a new version of the psp coming out on september th with more features and power for the same pricethere is simply no video signal in the red connector of the cable making the picture completely green and the cable totally useless
i tried the red audio connector in its place just to make sure it didnt get mixed up in manufacturing or something but it had no red video signal either
total wasteextremely thin very flimsy cable that was doa upon arrival
i dont know how you can screw up a simple cable connector but it was done
avoid if possibledont listen to people who give this above one star
i had asked for this game for christmas the same christmas i asked for an xbox  gears  fallout  halo  and so on and this was the one i was most excited to play
it was cool for the first  minuteswhere you are flying over the city taking pictures but a the point when you actually have to start doing quests the game gets so boring
first of all i dont even know where to go and i cant read the text on the screen
and the save system pisses me off the most
what is up with that
how come every other game in the world has checkpoints or a press startsave on their games but capcom decides not to on this one
come one
really
i mean with the impossible wtf boss battles and the crappy weapon systems that allow you to get mauled by zombies you die a lot and guess what
you have to start either the whole game over or that level overseriously the only thing good that this game gave me was like  achievements that added to my gamerscore
lets just say i threw this crap away on xmas morning and played fallout  instead which i enjoyed for several hoursand the gun system is just like the one in resident evil  ugggg come on capcomthis game is not worth the money
i was so disappointed with it i played it one time for maybe fifteen minutes and it was so boring
i would not advise anyone to buy this gameeveroh boy
dead rising  this game looks so fun doesnt it
going around in a mall killing a bunch of zombies its a nobrainer
the problem is in the execution
the game starts off great with you flying into a city thats been overtaken by zombies
youre a photojournalist and just want to cover the story
but you wind up having to fight off the zombies
very cool and the way they do objects here is a great idea
you can pick up say a soccer ball which awesomely bounces off multiple zombies injuring them
or break a potted plant over that zombies head
the problem is as fun as it sounds it just isnt fun when you actually do it
for one thing you have to go into an aim mode to use a gun or throw something
this would be ok except instead of fluidly going into aim mode in the direction youre facing like a good game would have you do you seem to move slightly to the left and then have to move your controller around to find the enemy again
unforgivable
as far as the graphics theyre very nice
however the text on the screen is very small
this might not be a problem if you have a newer tv with good clarity
mine is older and i had to get close to the tv to read the text
which brings me to the next issue with dead rising  it has a bunch of stories and quests and stuff
to me this doesnt make much sense
if i wanted stories and quests i could have played oblivion
its obvious they should have done quests in a simplified manner by pointing out where to go on the map with an arrow and having you fight through zombies to get there
that would have provided simple honest fun
instead they give you like a quest journal and a freakin map
i dont want to press an extra button to follow a map around in a game like this
they should leave the maps to silent hill or world of warcraftanother thing  they have voice acting in the cutscenes and then when you start playing the characters only talk in text
huh
this is  this is the powerful  and youre telling me were still using text instead of voice
it screams this was a rushed game
there are too many complications to getting into the zombiekilling fun
if they had simplified this game and improved the controls i would have liked it
but i got bored before  minutes of gameplayoh yeah how could i forget the save system
as you can see everyone hates the save system and for good reason
im not the kind of person who has to save whenever i want but in place of that i at least want a good checkpoint autosaving feature
instead when you die here you have to go way back before the part you were playing to the dialogue etc
before it
that is really annoying to me
every other game out there has a good checkpoint autosave system but this one
again it screams this game was rushedvery repetitive and very boring
i thought the graphics were subpar for an xbox  gamethloadingis game sounded like fun but turns out to be a hloadingorrible bore
it takes longer thloadingan an ayn rand novel to warm up
you spend about  minutes suffering thloadingroughloading teenage dialog before you get to swing a wrenchloading at a zombie
thloadinge save system is about  years behloadingind thloadinge state of thloadinge art
thloadinge fighloadingt system is nonexistant
if you like replaying  minutes of mashloadinging thloadinge x button in between a loading screen every  feet thloadingis mighloadingt be for youthe reviewers who give it  stars are probably working for the developers and trying to sell more games
dont fall for it this ones a  dollar turd
 things wrong with iti totally agreeyea i read many positive reviews here
im sure they were paidi have an enhanced def tv and you cant read the textor maybe you just need a  tv to read the directionswill the xbox be able to download a fix for this please
its unplayable at the momentterrible save system can bump you right back to the beginning after playing for hoursanother thing i noticed is that reviews that state the truth are rated bad so i know the paid pushers are at work herethis is probably one of the most brilliantly conceived but horribly designed games ive ever played
whoever created this game was either out of his mind or a masochist
ive been gaming for about  years now and i dont think ive ever been more frustrated by a game
try leading a bunch of survivors back to safety and then tell me about frustration
the save system is a joke
the game is challenging enough  the save system is overkillfor me  it was too frustrating
and it has nothing to do with skill
its luck
having the imbecile survivors live  is luck
sorry  passi like killing zombies as much as the next guy but this game just falters in two many areas mostly the fact that your mission instructions and other help from your allies come as text whose font is much to small to be read on a low def tv with a small screen which i happen to have
so you cant play this game to any sucess without the guide book and the guide book of course ruins the achievement of making it through the game on your own
and the save system absolutely sucks there is no excuse for itdont buy it rent iti played this game for about  hours straight and came across no save points
then these convicts driving around in a jeep w a rifle attached to it started chasing me around shooting at me and i died wtf
oh well no big deal i can just continue right
wrong
this game has no friggin continues and you have to start the game from the begining
dont buy it unless you plan on beating the game with  measley bars on your health meter
there are waayy too many zombies for this game to be fun
its a sea of zombies you cant even move let alone pick up a weapon and try to use it
good lucksave your   or  dollars this game just isnt worth itloadscreens every minuteterrible outdated graphics almost looks like original xbox gameunclear objective leaves you wondering what to do and whyboring and uninteresting characterslots of weapons to choose from to kill zombies but not enough the fun ones like various types of guns
just various random objects like park bench table leg flower pot etcits no wonder cheapskate microsoft gave dead rising  for free on games for gold because these dead rising games suck so bad that theyre literally not worth moneyi would have a hard time playing this game if someone paid me to do so thats how bad this game is
i wish i could get my  bucks back for this piece of garbagef   stars if i could rate it that lowif you are thinking about buying this game dont
its not even interestign or the least bit fun
the reviewers who give it  stars are probably working for the developers and tryign to sell more games
dont fall for it this ones a  dollar turd
 things wrong with it but ill give you text where is it i got a huge p tv and cant see itgraphix suk everything is square and right anglesweapons are weak and hard to aimcontrolls are slow which is unforgivable in this systembosses are impossible and you fight them over and over and overyou can be attacked while the game is loading screens but cant fight backhealth and saves are spaced way too sparcelyaim system is cluncky no just done very poorlycamera works so poorly why bother puting it in the gameshut off the fricking phone
of the few repetitive sounds that are actually in the game the most prevelent is an obnoxious phone that wont stop ringing until you answer it which keeps you from being able to do anything but run around like zombie baitone star is too many capcom should be ashamed and havok studios will never sell me another game as long as i live and i hope this pile of a game sinks them like the titanicthis game says its an actionadventure game but i say its adventure game emphasis on adventure
some people say that its short but its long
it is called dreamfall the longest journey for a reason
all ive done is talk to one person and talk to an other person walk over here walk over there blah blah blah
in a game you should be playing it not just mindlessly moving a joystick
this should have been either a book or a movie cuz this is not worth a penny to be video game
but if you like adventure games you should get this cuz thats all it isi guess i thought the the title puzzle world was all i needed when it comes to looking for a good brain game for psp
i was wrong the cheesy games to choose from are not what i expected when i recieved and opened this one i know thats all my fault
im just writing in to say research before you buythis game takes away everything a true ff title isit has a real mmo feel to it and if it wasnt for the title youd never know you were playing final fantasyif youre buying this because youre an ff addict dont botherbut if youre just looking for a decent rpg with an mmo feel go ahead and pick it upconclusion  its decent but gives real final fantasy titles a bad namefor those who know me they know it is a rare occurrence for me to be rendered speechless
but when i heard that ashe wants to commit acts of immorality dishonesty and treason i must say that speechless i was
i want to share this with you because if she is victorious in her quest to waste everyone elses time then her crown will be the funeral wreath of humanity
while she puts on a good dog and pony show she is capable of only two things namely whining and underhanded tricks
i apologize if the following points are hard to follow but theyre quite relevant to the gist of my argument
first ashes credos are based on biased statistics and faulty logic which in turn invalidate the conclusions she draws from them
and second she having recently learned a smattering of scientific terminology uses it to gain a virtual stranglehold on many facets of our educational system
all of this means of course that if we illustrate the virtues that she lacks  courage truthfulness courtesy honesty diligence chivalry loyalty and industry  then the sea of fanaticism on which she so heavily relies will begin to dry upthere are two things about ashes oped pieces that i find personally offensive thoroughly unethical and quite sad
one is that people who draw attention to ashes prolix recommendations are systematically labeled by ashes serfs as recalcitrant desperados or terms synonymous therewith
and the other is that as long as the beer keeps flowing and the paychecks keep coming ashes myrmidons dont really care that failure to recognize this salient point will result in her getting free reign to condone illegal activities
its that simple
it is hard to decide what is stronger in ashe her incredible stupidity as far as any real knowledge or ability is concerned or the brazen insolence of her behavior
leaving aside the behavior of other disaffected party animals ashe likes to quote all of the saccharine sticky moralisms about human rights and the evils of absenteeism
but as soon as we stop paying attention she invariably instructs her catspaws to combine in a rare mixture bestial cruelty and an inconceivable gift for lying
then when someone notices the pattern repeats from the beginning
though this game may seem perverse beyond belief to any sane individual it makes perfect sense in light of ashes vitriolic quipseven though supposedly distancing herself from the worst sorts of selfcentered crybabies there are ashe has really not changed her spots at all
do you understand the implications of what i have been telling you
are you awake
then you probably realize that any rational argument must acknowledge this
her gloomy machinations naturally do not
to end on a more positive note this review is written with the hope that readers will think for a minute about the situation at handthis game is just way to long and to boring
the battle system was horrid and the plot was  confusing
i actually gave up playing this game about halfway through because i was tired of playing it for months just to finish it
this game will take you about  months to beatthis was a horrible addition to the final fantasy series
i am sure you will play it anyway if you are a hardcore player but still not like it
i personally love battle scenes and this one doesnt have them the story was boring and the main character was not main at all just a wimp who went with the flow of the gamethis is a very bad game
no matter how bad a games story characters or settings are the entire game can always be salvaged by how fun it is to play
in other words its combat system
final fantasy  has the worst combat system ever
allow me to explainplease note that the combat system is not broken or unplayable in anyway
the problem here is that it is not fun
the way it works is that you input commands and the character executes them once his time meter is charged up
you can input multiple commands at once and sit back and watch them be executed at the appropriate time
the game essentially plays itselfthey basically tried to take the concept of turn based combat and do it in real time
the problem with that is that you are left running around doing nothing until your move is executed
this is tiresome not fun and quite honestly it didnt make me feel immersed in the game at all
the reason turned based combat is rarely done in real time is that it makes the player realize how much they are not participating in the actual battlereal time combat should never have to make you wait around for every action
the tales games along with the star ocean games are a shinning example of how real time combat should be handled
it allows for fast paced constant action while at the same time allowing for deep tactical moves and an insane amount of strategythere is a way to do the type of combat this game tried to do
valkyria chronicles is the main game that comes to mind
its pretty much a turned based strategy rpg with limitations and time periods for moves
that game managed to make it fun and deep where as this game does notstory wise the game is boring
characters are not memorable at alli will say that the open world is enormous and the amount of side quests are quite numerous
this is a good thing assuming the game is fun
which it is nothonestly i really tried to like this game but its simply too bland boring and it lacks the spark that makes other final fantasy games recognizablebuy final fantasy x instead
the combat is classic turn based and well done
the characters are memorable and interesting
and finally the story is far superior to this games forgettable onei honestly regret the  i spent on this game
they could have been put to much better useim a big fan of ff games
i had high hopes for this game
when this game came out
every one said this was trash
i didnt believe them
i was a ff freak
i bought this and wow
they were right
the battle system is a joke
i can go to a buffet and set my characters up to fight
and come back and i would have won the fight
the graphics are crappy then ff x in ff  they look like plastic people
the cg looked down graded
the voice acting was trash i hated vash voice and the other characters
i think they rushed this game to fastthe character look like a little boy toy modelthis game was badly designi think they rushed this game to make money from people no matter how bad this game is
they knew ff fans would buy this
if you compare ffx to ff  graphics cg
ff x looks a lot better than this game
ff  was so bad in many wayslack of balanceif one thing could be pointed at as the problem it is the lack of balancethe battle system was a good attempt and it sounded great on paper but it just didnt pan out
as has been mentioned the number of enemies and the speed of enemies took away from the battle
also the monotony of the enemies left me wanting
during one area of the game in the sandsea i had a chain of  i wasnt trying to get chain points either
no matter how good the battle system was designed  of the same enemy in a row gets boringthe license system seemed more like a dumbed down version of the sphere grid in ffx
i loved the sphere grid wasnt so fond of this system
obtaining the experience through battle to increase your abilities would have made this a success requiring abilities to also be bought made it a failure
at level  penelope had cleared the magick section of the grid although her highest level magick that was of use was curahardly an impressive skillthe storyline was like riding a snail
too many cutscenes and not enough interesting developments
the gil distribution was downright ridiculous
leveling up for hours exploring every nookandcranny of a dungeon and still not having enough money to improve your weaponsthere just wasnt a good balance
there needs to be a healthy dose of risk and reward to keep it interesting in past games leveling up was just as fun as progressing the storyit felt like a necessary chore in ffxii
for nearly every enemy i remember you got  license point per kill
by a rough estimation  enemies would need killed to clear one section of the licensing systemthe last rant was the character classes or lack of
any character can be anything you want and carry any weapon you want for a necessary price
while the openness can be good it makes for rather boring characters and the excitement of getting new skills for a class is completely lost
after all so what if vaan gets that new axe when basche is right behind note i mentioned a weaponthere are no special abilities unique to any character eitherbetween the lack of rewards gil ability increases with experience and monotony of battles i would not recommend this game
i put  hours into the game and completely lost interest midway through a hunt the minigames are bland and the rewards for completing a hunt are nothing to get excited about comparable to defeating a difficult enemy in previous ff games
i believe you can make a decision as to whether you will enjoy this game with a rental
naturally another person may like everything i ranted on above
like any ff game you hate the learning curve from the previous for a few hours and then become addictedi lost interest in the middle of the addictionstagethis installment of final fantasy is definitely story driven
sadly however the story is weak
six months after playing the game i cant even remember what those triangular spirits were about
thank goodness for the nice dialogue
without it the game would be untolerable
character interaction is minimal and there is no real team spiritthe main character vaan and his friend penelo seem to be nothing more than luggage
theres no point in them being in the game
i cant say thats a good thingthe evil guys and side characters are lame and their doings seem pointless
as with the main characters none are truly exploredtalking with the townspeople is utterly pointlessthe graphics are nice though nothing mindblowing
i didnt want to stop to view the scenery at any point
i have to applaud them for making the cities even a bit lively looking by adding a lot of silent characters
one point of complaint is the very lame spell effectsthe cgi scenes are nothing spectacular definitely a step back from ffx
this was the first installment in the series where i wasnt looking forward to seeing the cgi scenesthe voiceacting is good all the main characters give solid performances
but the marquis and alcid almost succeed in spoiling my respect towards the other performances
thank goodness they have so few lines
all in all the voice acting is one of the best aspects of the gamethe realtime battle system is a radical change from past games
its nice but doesnt make the battles less tedious or repetitive in the long run
the enemies are also mostly boringthe party ai doesnt really shine but thank goodness you can limit its stupidity with the gambit system
too bad that lots of the useful gambits appear only at the later stages of the gamethe license board works for someone who likes perfect customization but unfortunately i dont
i want characters who truly differ in their abilities
and talking about abilities i found all the skills and most of the power ups really lame and uselessthe summons called espers are stupidlooking and useless in combatthe maps are at times annoyingly large
the fact that there are no secrets or secret places and the randomized treasure add to the insult
many times the game devolved into a multiple hour running through empty fields between short cutscenesthe music is bad
nobue uematsu left them and they replaced him with some clueless punk
there is zero memorability and some themes are just annoying
its the worst ive heard in any rpg ive playedclosing commentswhen i started playing i was positively surprised by the good voiceacting the nice  and at times witty  dialogue and olden style of speaking used by some charactershowever it didnt take long to become annoyed by the pointless main character vaan the trite and stupid plot lack of character interaction huge and empty fieldsdungeons with random and often useless treasureall in all this game is about running hours and hours through fields fighting repetitive enemies so you could see a  minute stupid cut scene that advances the inane ploti liked the battle system and collecting weapons until i was looking for droppable weapons which takes ages to accomplishbesides that this game was fail i think but i understand some people like iti think its one of the worst games in the series
music was pretty horrible most of the time and the character depth was none and so few cutscenesseems like square is doing all those games that are so focused on graphics and battle mode
what i like most about ff is the characters music and storyline and this game failed in all of them i thinkthere was definetly fun parts to this game but there wasnt exension to it you found cool places and some things happened and then all of a sudden it was all over and you had  hours left only to fighti bought this for my xbox  back when i had the fat console brand new from walmart i maybe had it a month it was so noisy and was causing interference with my xboxs power so i took it off my xbox ran better after that then not long after that my xbox started acting weird the internal cooling fans would randomly speed up and shut its self off during a game sometimes the fans wouldnt work at all and it would freeze so i pulled out the power plug and noticed the connectors were melted as were the ones on the nyko cooling fan so i called microsoft and told them i was having problems with their power supply and they sent me another one shortly after that i got the notorious red ring of death microsoft sent me another one do not buy this it will destroy your console without a doubt you are guaranteeing yourself that your console will be fried after this if you buy this in my opinion it is also a fire hazarddo yourself a favor and just buy a little desk fan and put it next to the vent pulling the heat away it will work better and cheaperbut usually nyko makes very good products unfortunately this was not one of themalso if you have any sense at all dont tell microsoft you used this and it messed your console up you dont have to say it was rd party products that messed your console up just act like it was their fault unless you want to pay for a new consolethis intercooler fan can actually damage the  it melts to the console and drains power from it during usage as well
i recommend anyone to avoid purchasing this unitoverall i dont have a lot of beef with nyko but after buying this piece of crap i do
first off i see there are some people that say the new model the one in the box and not in the plastic is better
this however was not the case for me
the first version i bought starting having problems about  weeks after buying it
it would make this really annoying grinding noise
i would have to keep hitting the fan until it would stop
the newer version i also bought and had the same problem
the new version is better though
it lasted me  weeks instead of   real impressive
it did its job by keeping the system cool but the grinding noise it made just wasnt worth it
it was so loud that you could actually hear that noise on the second story of my house and my system is on the first floor
there are better options then this thing
you could go for the new mad catz fan which i heard good things about or the pelican fan stand
they may not be as powerful but they keep the system cool theyre not defective and they have an impressive warranty
the best part is if the pelican fan damages your system they will replace it for free while if this nyko one does they wont replace your system or the fan
i wonder why
so stay far awaymy  is still running extremely too hot with or without this thing
you cant even tell if this thing is running
microsoft needs to make a fan on the hard drive and on the bottom of the system not nykos fan stand that thing is worthless as well
i keep a small fan in front of my system in an enclosed area and it cools it down alot
or void the warranty and put a hydrocooling system into itive owned my new  for  days now and its overheating
im pretty sure that this intercooler causes the opposite of its advertised effectalright i am glad i read all of the reviews and saw that i wasnt the only one who was experiencing problems with thisi applaud nyko on making a big fat sack of cash off of a piece of plastic that needs no power supplyi have the first generation with no clip on the back to keep it nice and tight to the systembecause of this i have had to reach behind the system countless times in order to shove it in enough to power the  i have owned this for over a year and that was the main problemnow the unit makes a ton of noise like the fan bearings are starting to go
i took it off and it was very very hot
i took it back to target a year later and got store credit for it
thanks for nothing nykoi thought this was a necessary accessory because the  runs so hot unlike the ps
well i had one on my first two systems
both of those died and had the red ring of death
i have heard that this kills your system and it does
your  system is better without it
let the horrid cooling system do its job and not use this unless you like replacing your systemdo not get this fan
it will burn out your  and the warranty will not cover it
if you buy this you will get screwed
there is a kit that is out made by pelican
it costs about the same and comes with more stuff
it has all kinds of stuff in the kit including a fan that plugs into the usb port and not the power source
it will not burn out your system and works just the same to keep your  cool
do not buy this nyko junk fan
repeat
do not buy this nyko fanall i can say is i know  people with this device and these same  people had to send in their  for component failure
do not install this device or a surge protector on your xbox already has a surge protector as the loss is power draw will cause the failure
not sure why microsoft has not stopped this company from selling this damaging productmy first xbox  failed despite or because i had this thing strapped to the back sucking power away from the vital components inside the box
when i got my nd  in the mail i promptly hooked the nyko back up and immediately got the  red lights of death in other words the first time i turned a brand new  on with this nyko intercooler attached the thing died
i guess it wasnt permanent because when i took the nyko off and restarted the thing my xbox worked great and has been working just fine for almost a year now
important just put your xbox in a wellventilated area not in a corner and chances are good that it will work fine
you dont needwant this intercooler unless  you like a lot of extra noise
 you love dealing with nonnative english speakers at microsoft tech support and  you want to be without your xbox for up to a month while microsoft sends you a new onetrust me i may have been the first one i knew that this happened to but ive heard countless more horror stories since then
until nyko comes up with a new design better to stay away from this onethis part was supose to help with the over heat of the sistem but istead help it make  it worse since it burn the original  fansnow i will pay  to micrisoft to replace the fani not recomended this device at all
atleast you want to send you  to repair for extra 
that you can used to buy two new games there are way too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a   putting any kind of powerdrawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble  i own a lot of expensive electronics and id never do it in a million yearsinstead of taking such a chance go to your local retailer and buy a little fan  designed for placingclipping depending on how youve got your xbox set up on your desk at work etc
you can get one for  and dont have to worry about leeching power from your  just set it up beside the  so that air flows beneath and over topsince your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill you can shop for one thats quiet and fits your setup
my  actually runs quite cool although i do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifierps always always always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible
never put anything on top always place on a hard surface and always leave at least a few inches clearance all around
lastly always use a surge suppressorafter a year of use i appeared red lights
and i must say i care much because i knew what the fault could throw this consolei am one of the fortunate ones who has an xbox  that has worked beautifully from the day i got it
however with all of the other unlucky owners who have been having overheating problems with their systems i felt compelled to protect my   sure microsoft extended the warranty to  years but why be without my  for several weeks if it can be avoided
for a long time i sat and wondered if buying an external cooler was necessary
after playing through saints row and having the game freeze or stall on me several times i was convinced i should
so i bought myself this nyko intercooler thinking aside from spending  unnecessary bucks what can it hurt
apparently a lot
fortunately i realized this before it too late but this thing was doing more harm than good and for others who have purchased this it was too late and it killed their   apparently drawing power from the  makes it even more prone to overheatingtechnically it works
its easy to install and the fans increase airflow
but what difference does it make if the fans work if it overheats the  anyway
oh and if im not mistaken microsofts warranty doesnt cover damage done by this product because its an unlicensed product
superi should note that aside from the problems in saints row which ive found are from flaws in the games engine itself and not the actual hardware i had never had problems with my   but while the intercooler was attached i got the red ring of death  times which made my heart jump out of my chest but it was only momentary and started up fine on the next attempt each time
after hearing some very unhealthy noises this thing is loud and i was afraid my cd tray had been damaged or something  seriously it rivals the noise from the nearby landing planes i removed this piece of junk
now i cannot confirm this is what caused my dreaded rrod but guess what
yup no more errors
coincidence
i think notjust do yourself a favor and stay away from this thing which appears to do the exact opposite of what it intends to do
either find a licensed product or trust that your  will stay in good health
if it doesnt the warranty covers youi bought this cooling fan when i felt how hot the exhaust from my  is and after all the horror stories i heard about it overheating
however this device frankly sucks
let me count the ways bad fit
the device fits on the  very poorly
it barely squeezes in on the back and when you snug it on there youll find that your wireless network adapter hardly fits in place any more
mine kept coming unplugged as a result and losing my connection with live noise
this sucker is loud
i have a ton of cooling fans on my pc and this thing is much louder
in any intense moments in horror games i find my concentration straying from the sound design of the game and instead focusing on the fan humming along
once it gets a little loose you then start to hear it rattle and hum vibrations
as i just mentioned it vibrates like mad
you can hear it rattling around back there when it turns on and this cant be good for your  power drain
as some other reviews have noted since the power to the whole system is routed through here youre bound to lose some power to your system
this could have disastrous effects in the long run cheap clips
the clips that help it clasp onto the back of the  are very cheap and are very likely to break
mine have survived but my homeboys broke and the thing doesnt work at all anymoredoes the  overheat
you betcha
mine sits in an enclosed entertainment center and ive had it overheat when i shut the door to the  by accident
it completely shut down and the happy green power light turned into an angry blinking red
and yes that was with the intercooler on
the point is with all the negatives of the cooler it doesnt even help to keep your  cool when you need it tothis is a great idea for a very hot system but this device is awful
until someone comes up with a better design just keep your  ventilated and spare yourself the this thing is not only loud
it actually caused my  to malfunction
i have had my  for about  months now and i have never had a problem
all of the sudden one day my  shuts off and i get a ring of  red flashing lights
i almost had a heart attack
so i turn it back on and it works fine and about  or so minutes later it happens again
i turn it on the next day and  minutes into playing it happens again
so i take the intercooler off because it is really loud anyways and the problem never happens again
i play for hours
leave it on jsut to test it and not another problem
i will not be putting my intercooler back on
i think it is unnessecary for my  and if the noise is so loud i think it must be overheating the  rather than cooling it down
not to mention it is powered by the  so it makes it use more power than needed
i paid too much for my wonderful  to risk it breaking down because of this product
save you hard earned money and by some accessories or gamesyou pull air from the unit
with these you can call microsoft and sony it hurts you system dont buy itdo not buy because its badly than better solutions change the console for garanty that  not has problem with hot this adapter overhot de electric conectorfirst of all this will void whatever warranty you have with microsoft
its in many cases it has melted the plastic on the  around iti purchased a new xbox  never had any problems
i decided to buy this because i heard it is important to keep the console cool
well i didnt even play for half an hour after plugging this in and in the middle of a boat race in dead or alive extreme  the screen got all pixel like
i turned the console off and on and i had the three red lights
repeatedly tried to play and it wouldnt worki touched the back of the console and it actually felt hotter than usual
so i removed the piece of junk and still had the errors even after it was cool to the touch but after about  hours of not playing at all the errors were gone and have not come back sincei would give this  stars if i could
it does not in any way shape or form reduce heat
on the contrary the way it closes around the fans actually holds more heat inside probably because the fans spin slower than the xbox s own fans and by drawing power from the  power supply it generates more heat there tooi am lucky the damage was temporary
if you are reading this for the love of your console do not buyyoure on the right track if youre reading this now
the  overheats everyone knows that by now and if you want your investment to last a little while youre going to need to do something about it
the nyko intercooler is an amazing device and really does a great job at dissipating heat issues but dont buy this model
get the nyko intercooler ex
it should have been a nobrainer from the beginning that using plastic in the ac port was not a good idea
nyko has fixed the problem of melting with the ex model which actually has metal in the ac bypass
again should have been a nobrainer but as always money talks
the intercooler is an absolutely essential item ive noticed a remarkable improvement
after  hours i know every  owner is cringing right now any longer than  hours of use is xbox suicide of oblivion the framerate and loading was still perfect exactly as if i had just started the game and the console itself was only lukewarm to the touch
the intercooler works just not this model
look up the nyko intercooler ex and your worries of overheating issues will be gone
as well as melting concerns
again metal in the ex plastic in this onefirst of all its sad that someone would put out a product the  that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another  of the product cost on a little series of fanssecond i attached this
i plugged it in
it wouldnt even turn on
waste of money
do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area
if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a  clipon fan at itthis is a terrible porduct because its energy source is the xbox  which makes the  work more which over heats it but wait then the fan cools it
so you are really spending money on something that might break yuor system or might look funny on the back of the  and do nothingalthough the intercooler is a perfect idea there are allot of problems with it
the xbox  does get very hot because it has extremely powerful components
the intercooler does not work
if the intercooler fries your system which it probably will your warenty will voidi purchased this item to try and keep myself from ending up as one of the people who had their xbox burn out because of overheating
this intercooler however melts to your xbox and causes you to get red rings
when i took the intercooler off part of it was melted and the plugs where it plugged into the back of the xbox and where the plug went into the back of the intercooler were all browned out and burned
thank god it didnt do any damage to my xbox as my xbox worked fine after i took it off
also when it was working it was extremely noisy anyway
it also seems as though it wasnt really keeping the xbox that cool
just please do not buy this itemi bought this hoping to increase the lifespan on my   i hoped that cooling the  would be better for it in the long run
unfortunately i might have done the opposite
a red ring blinks around the power button every time i tried to turn it on and it turns out the culprit was the burned nyko intercooler
seriously
there were scorch marks along the inside of the power input
this thing is a fire hazard
please do not buy itthis thing will burn out your power supply and leave you xbox less if youre not careful
i was lucky enough to remove this trash before it did any real damagedo not purchasei dont go around giving star reviews in fact this is my firstthe game is garbage to the point of being unplayable fiber wire sometimes works sometimes doesnt gunplay controls feel terrible movement controls feel terrible disguising yourself with clothes is almost random
sometimes you get thru sometimes you get caught first second the ai is terrible theres not one aspect of the gameplay that was good i suspect many of the reviews here are sellers trying to get rid of their copy
as a buyer this was my worst game purchase decision in forever
avoidi have no idea where any of these other people are coming from
this game is horrid
the grahpics are awful it looks like xbox not  the ai is incredibly stupid
the dialogue is cheesy and ininspiring
and worst of all the game play is just terrible
actually running around and shooting is so incredibly boring i couldnt believe i paid this much for this game
i have tons of games probably close to thirty
this is the worst
that says a lot when half of my games are  and underi was reading that word review by dave jeanclerc and i strongly disagree with some of his points
ps
my review has nothing to do with the xbox  version which apparently is awesome
i have playing the ea football games since the mids and im sick of paying  for the same game every year
ea games owns the rights to the college and nfl teams so you wont see any football games by any other game companies most noteably sega who revolutionized football simulation games in the late sncaa football  is basically the same as ncaa football  and  and  and  and   each year ea adds a little tweak to the mix but overall its the same look the same feel the same moves the same everything
this year theyve changed the way you kick the ball and added more defensive audiblesthats it
there are a few other minor adjustments but none are worth noting imo
in fact the audibles they added are the exact same audibles you used to have on segas espn football you can call audibles for individual defensive players
thieves
everything else is the exact same as  and   the most disappointing thing graphically speaking is the crowdit still looks like flat rows of objects moving in unison just like it did on games made  years agoohone other big changethe improved momentum meter
if you thought it was ridiculous last year wait til you play ncaa   the momentum meter has such a strong influence on the game that if you make one offensive mistake in the beginning of the game youre doomedthats it
you cant win
for examplei played fsu vs um twice
the first time i made no st half errors and pounded the hurricanes   i played with the same exact settings in the same stadium again and purposely fumbled the opening kickoff giving the hurricanes the ball at my  yd
line and i lost the game   that fumble was my only mistake of the gamenessler herbstriet and corso are still making the same exact ingame comments they were saying in  and gimme a break
also the ai is still atrocious
defensively the computer controlled team is hapless
they blitz on every down
in fact ive lined up numerous times for a rd and long with  or  receivers and the defense continually loads  men in the boxthey dont even put enough dbs out there to stop me
its basically a game of long bombs
if you choose a team with good receivers you can easily throw for  yards a game by continually going deep
the safeties always blitz
the safeties only drop back into coverage if you have rd and  or th and 
so how does the computer couteract your deep balls
easywhen the momentum meter swings against your favor your receivers drop every ball you throw at them even if you hit them in the chest with the ball and when you finally decide to run the ball your running back fumbles the ball immediately
i played a game between usc and cal and i kept switching to play with the team that didnt have the momentum and i ended up turning the ball over on every possessionyou may be reading this and saying heythis guy has played this game a lot to figure all of this out
no not reallyits exactly how ive played the  and  game and the same glitches ive encountered in them too
ea has really dropped the ball again
you are paying  to get updated rosters and in typical ea fashion you dont even have names for any of the playersjust different skill levelsea games suck
their soccer games are horrible their basketball games are too slow and awkward and they dont update their football games
i guarantee you that madden  will be the same as madden just watchand by the wayea has gone allout on the xbox  editions of ncaa  ans madden im sure those versions will be stunning
the rest of us are paying the same price for last years gamean enormous disappointment
first the installer doesnt work properly and has to be patched then one finds that the game only runs in what could best be described as an outoffocus vga mode x
there seems to be no reason to the interface and control is essentially nonexistent
there are no instructions for operation of the interface and responses to the keyboard seem to be totally random
one would have hoped for something reasonable from lucas arts not a ghastly joke of a s game
there may be fun hidden somewhere here but it is completely concealed behind the horrible appearance and the lack of logic to the interface
be warned
save your money
avoid this onewell all i want to say is the game is pathetic
gameplay is the same as the playstation version
about  million glitches makes the game virtually unplayable not to mention the terrible graphics
theres virtually no story just a pile of levels stacked on top of each other rushed into the stores as soon as possible
if you own any other system get it for that onescoregraphics  gameplay  story  overall  this game is really hard to like
one of the mega issues with the gameplay is that it is very glitchy and you basiclly can get easily lost
none of the characters have a connection you can relate to
this wouldnt be a problem if the levels were not too short and the gameplay didnt feel like a bit pixle disaster
none of the cutscenes are funny which is unlikly from the other lego tell tale games
it doesnt make any scence watching the clips
in free play instead of limiting the players to  or  you can play the full cast once you unlocked them
sadly they dont seem to have any fun in them
you barly use the bottom screen on the dsds except for changing characters and rotating the camera which is hardly ajustable
this is the only game by far developed by tell tale that i say you should skip it and play the gamecube version
this one is better off forgotteni like to play franchise mode with the fantasy draft
i completed my draft and moved on to training camp
after completing the first quarterback challenge the game froze
i turned the system off tried again several times  the result
nothing but game freeze
did a google search and this seems to be a big problem for the xbox  and psp as well as the ps which i owni tried emailing ea but they want you to create a user account or else you cant reach them  why
i found a link to eas warranty site and they want you to send them back the game and a check for  to get a repairreplacement
are they nuts
to top it off during my search of madden  freeze i found message board postings indicating that when people did email ea the response from ea has it trying to blame the game system not the ea product
i then did a madden  bug search and discovered ea knowingly distributed the game with major bugs
if you dont believe me do the google search yourselfi printed off the google search results went back to the store where i bought madden explained the problem and got a full refund
it looks like an exclusive license with the nfl has made ea soft and this game worthlessi would not recommend this game
as a big believer in customer servicecompanies that stand behind their product i will never buy another ea title againi am not going to rehash what everyone else is saying other than this is a bad game
another ea blunder of late
thankfully i rented it with a few friends so we all saved our money
a new next generation platform costing more money for the game and it is nothing better than what you could have gotten several years ago
we saw it in madden we saw it in tiger woods golf and i fear we are going to continue to see it until their exclusive licenses expire and do not get renewedncaa football  was okay but i expect a lot more from this game
the  has so much power why did they not use it
i do believe even if you get this game at a flee market you are losing your moneythe gameplay sucks
teams bite on play action way to much
hard to find a play hard to invite a friend to play why cant i send a play invite from the  dashboard okay graphics try and make a comeback when the computer has already determained the outcome
i played it the other day and on the kick off my impact hb fumbled the ball ran back for td
next kick off the hb fumbled it again
ran back for touchdown
next play that i had i passed to the te on a angle pass interception ran back for td
the game will collect dust nowi am waiting for halo  to spend more money on gamesas was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for
they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus
this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most underused and least interesting character in the final fantasy series
its the creators way of telling us that they will never remake final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to mani changed my mind i didnt really like this game because its just a straightforward first person shooter
its like the same thing over and over again and i hate all things repetitive cough inuyasha cough
so basically its ok just not my kind of game
final fantasy  on the other hand is totally awesomei like being able to save frequently and often and you cant do either with this game
some people cant devote all day to play this game
i gave it away to a friend who can devote time to this game that i cant affordi waited almost a year for this game since  and  were the worst madden games up until  and i could not wait for the next generation madden footballhere are important facts the gameplay is ok but it looks the same as in previous madden games
you no longer can create your own plays thus you are basically limited to whatever playbook is available from ea
they changed the control buttons that had been used for years and most of us who have played the series were used to them
the game is not challenging memorizing or geting used to the control buttons isthe menus are confusing and there is a time when you can not change the game time duration which is frustatingdo not expect anything exciting from this game it is at most an avererage game but in my opinion is worth less than  dollarsi just bought this game for gamerscore and wow was it a bad game
i cant beleive that anyone would think that this game is fun
the game is very glitchy unbalanced and the graphics are terrible
do not buy this game unless you just want gamerscore from itmuch like another reviewer i readi wanted to like this game
brothers and sisters and needs me a football game like i need water air and baked lays potato chips
i needs to play me some football
i needs for my quarterbackmeto take my team to the super bowl and winwhat the f do you think youre doing ea
and who the f do you think you are to take my needs away
am i the crazy one heremaybe i ambut this s company called ea is making me that way
lets see heremadden    ball droppedbatman begins   ball dropped
shortly after consumers fell on the  ball and got the wind knocked out of them
madden  next gen madden
a really pretty lifelike ball was dropped
madden  after swearing to us that they wouldnt drop the ball this time they threw it to us when we werent looking and bloodied our noses with it
then they pointed and laughed and ran off with our womenread what bigg v tazzmanian said
he put it better than i ever couldits a subpar waste of cash
 stars because it plays a little bit better than madden will never touch ks nfl k
neveri buy madden every year and all the hype i had heard about  made me excited to get it
i was pissed at  for removing my favorite aspect of the game fantasy draft franchiseea screwed its customers once again and left out this feature
they replaced with some retarded mini games that will only interest stat junkies that want all the achievements they can get
the actual games hold no gameplay value and amount to about the same fun youd get by mashing buttons with your facesuperstar mode is back again sadly
its not a horrible idea but the camera angles are awful and they dont let you change it
i got tired of dealing with the game after about an hour and a half of searching for funthe one redeeming feature of the game should be the online play
people have been playing online for almost a decade now so youd figure a football game could do it pretty simply with all that practice right
no
this madden lags and disconnects even more than  didoverall  has nothing to offer the player
get some achievements get updated rosters and sit on your thumbif anyone needs a copy theyll find a used one at my local game storedue to madden footballs strong following they think they can take advantage of us by putting out subpar games at top notch prices
personally im getting tired of this
this game use to be great
now for the last two years it has been terrible at least compared to the years between  to  i was hoping ea wouldnt start cutting corners once they got that exclusive deal with the nfl
i thought they were better than that
i guess i was wrong
i didnt buy this game this year however i borrowed it
if this or the  version is the first madden you have played youll probably love it however if you remember the top notch games of the past youll be disappointed
this is a watered down version of past titles that has good graphics nothing more
i wont buy another until they up their standards againcons no fantasy draft you cant make up your own team i have experienced this game freezing up on me numerous times before finishing a game very frustrating
during franchise mode the draft and signing of free agents is hard to follow and poorly done which takes away from the overall franchise experience
you still cant change individual defensive players assignments
for example in the past you could change each defensive player on the field to blitz play deep zone cover the flat or quaterback sneak
not being able to do this takes away from being creative defensively
you have to just run the play as is
you can still do things such as spread out the line move all lbs and change cornerback coverage but it still isnt the same not as good
during superstar mode sometimes the camera angles doesnt allow you to see enough of the field to do what you need to do to be successful
the game play how the players move still isnt as good as it was on the old xbox
this is suppose to be a next generation systemgame that doesnt make sense
its better than last year though
madden still doesnt exist
how can you take madden out of madden football
that doesnt make sense
instead of listening to madden you have to listen to boring repetitve radio announcers
they again changed what buttons do
why do they have to keep changing what every button does
keep the sprint button the same each year keep how to do the hot routes the same each year
i have to relearn how to play the game each year because they change the buttons its annoying
its not like they added anything over the years in order to have to change buttons they took stuff away for crying out loud
there are other things about the game i do not like however the above things are the most important
im sure you can find your own problems especially if you are not new to madden footballpros
sad to say the pros of this game really arent pros at all
for example the new superstar mode really isnt new
its been on the old xbox version for two years now
its only new to this system because they stripped it from last years base title
this is an improvement over last years title in regards to game play
the players do move better and quicker
last years title was way too slow especially running
of course getting the update rosters and new hot rookies is a plus
this is probably the main reason people will end up buying this game any ways regardless of how subpar it is
i wont though nice graphics
to tell you the truth compared to the old title this is the only thing the newer version does better
in all other categories this title lacksbottom line its sad i have to get out my old xbox to play a really good football game
this is an improvement over last years game however that isnt saying much last year was that bad
this still isnt worth even close to  dollars
i guess you all can see that by looking at the  dollar used copies
in the past there is no way this would be selling this cheap so quickly
come on ea lets do better than thisthis was the first  i got
and i wish i didnt waste my moneymadden  you hear it and thinkfootball
so you get it cause hell we all like football
but what we dont like is a football game that really really really is not good at allso you want to know why it isnt good
lets go over it
you fumble the ball but you cant help it
it just happens
you get flagged for pass interference alot especially after nd half whod of guessed
i have instant replayed this flags over and over agian and none of my men where even around the catcher
when you run the ball and you try to go through a open hole your men block you and you cannot move until you get tackledannoying
very much so
the graphics are nice but players go through eachothers bodies alot
sadly other than the collge football game this is the only football game outprobably until which im not sure i will care about maddenso dont botherok i am getting sick and tired of these sports games
i mean they may be fun for you people but to me i think it is a waist of money
i mean come on
its the same game every year
they only add like new caricters and ups the graphics and adds a little something something to the game like a quest mode or something
come on people they are injoying taking your moneyi played an old one for the super nintendo and yup guess what its all the same
so stop waistiong your money and spend it on something else like your girl friend or wife
thats it i am out of here fomeyi knew coming in that this game wasnt going to be the madden of old
since getting the deal with the nfl ea sports has cut corners and produced shotty work
but i really wanted to play football on my fairly new xbox  so i went ahead and traded in nba live  for  to purchase this gamewhen i started the game things seems to be excellent
beautiful stadiums filled with fans that at most times are full d rendered
then the gameplay started
i experience horrid slowdown when picking plays
after it shows the players it lags horribly and feels like its going to quit
it think they tried to put too much on the screenthen the sound
the announcing i think is horrible
it sounds like hes speaking over a tin can and a piece of string
and you hear the same things over and over again
he counts down the yards starting at the   only one announcer makes it bland also
and you would think madden would announce on his own gamethen while playing my friend the first time i played the game froze at halftime
i was so angry that i spent money on this garbage i was ready to package it back up and go to ebgames and demand a refund
or maybe call ea sports and tell them how horrible their game is
what does it take to get a game that plays without major issues like thisdespite the freezing the gameplay is bad also
rb can run  yards without even a touch quarterbacks that cant run like delhomme can bust out a  yard run and tackling is near on impossible unless you are right on top of the guy and even then a little juke and you bounce off them
mostly the fun factor is lost when i cant even stop them
games are  or   that doesnt seem very realistic to me
when i play a sports game i want the whole package
i want to feel like its a real game on tv and im controlling my favorite team to victory
you dont get this here because the announcer is not realistic the scores the tackles etcmy suggestion if you dont mind slowdown freezes and bad overall gameplay then pick this up
but if you require better gameplay for  protest this game and make sure to tell ea your displeasure
this has to stop
i cant even play a football game because its madden or maddenea sports should be ashamed to release such trash and yet expect us to pay  for a game that freezes isnt the least bit realistic nor allows you to create and edit playersea sports will never get another dime of my money ever k games got it right unlike ea sportsea sports purveyors of mediocrity for many years now hit a new low
its inconceivable that someone actually greenlighted this game with such glaring errors
to me a glitch is something minor that doesnt affect gameplay
to have released this game as it iswell downright criminal if you ask me
but hey its only  of your hardearned dollars right
and whatever you do dont buy it from gamestop or eb games
no
as far as theyre concerned the game isnt defective
its a problem for ea sports they just want to take your money
well guess what
never buying another ea sports game and im damn sure never shopping at gamestop or eb games
why did i not shop amazon in the first placei got baldurs gate  in  boxset because it got some good reviews and because i rather liked the genre
i was very disappointed
i have a very highend custom built  gaming computer with a large lcd screen
all the latest hardware
windows  home premium
not sure what the problem was but i could barely make out the characters on the screen and some of the actions required during the tutorial at the beginning simply did not work
dumpster fodder
i paid for the games im not paying again to return themim giving  star because this is one of the cheapest packages i have ever bought it looks like a pirated copy
no wait a pirated copy would look better
all the disks came in a single case onve over the other which caused scratches in almost all of them on diskthe expansion came inside the box inside a white envelopeoh and all the cool covers on the disks
horrible black and white labelsi regret buying thisthe worst bug apparently is limited to importing characters from original dungeon siege  many truly folks including me cant even play the game because there is a limit to the number of characters and this bug prevents you from switching characters in your group
for example i tried to play a multiplayer party mode in which the limit was  characters
one early quest requires you to make a dwarf a member of your group
when you need to get your original party members back the only way to do that is to release this dwarf to the inn
when you do that the game quits and when you start again that character is gone from the game
there are many other problems related to this bug
this happened with both of my imported ds charactersi would normally expect a patch to resolve this problem from the developers but apparently the thinking is that this wont happen unless you import corrupted save files
my understanding is that they have not been able to figure out how these files get corrupted even though they have been trying a long time
so i will be pleasantly surprised if they do find a way to fix this problem but im not holding my breathin my opinion the quality of dungeon siege  and legends of aranna was much better than anything after that and broken world is aptly namedthis is a very frustrating game and once you figure out how to deal with the more buggy aspects it doesnt last very longto get it going at all be prepared to fight with their copy protection system
it wouldnt let me into the game saying something about software emulation until i shut down absolutely everything that was running on the computer before starting it
this means going into the task manager and killing processes like vptrayexe
i almost sent it back rather than going through this couple of hours fighting with it but i perservered on the promises of the gameonce you do get it going there are two options for resolution x and xnnn
if you use the higher resolution the mouse is never hits what youre trying to click on you have to move it around until you get it just at the right offset
this is particularly bad if youre trying to remove something as youll often end up removing things you want
this is better at x but theres still a strange offset and youll often find yourself clicking on something other than what youre aiming forthe game is fairly fun once you get past these problems
but it only lasts maybe  hours at the most and then theres nothing else to do
i guess you could replay it on the hard difficulty but thats itget this one when its  fixed and  is in the bargain bin for ten or twenty bucks
it wont be long before its therethese companies are just trying to make a buck on those who are careless with the screen
i have had my ds for over a year now and clean both top and bottom screens regularly with a soft lintfree cloth
sometimes i dampen it with just a small bit of glass cleaner if needed
i admit that there are a few very small light scratches on the bottom screen but only noticeable when my ds is off and im looking closely
save  with regular cleaning and careful usewhat a disaster
you apply the plastic protector to the video screen and then remove the sticky tabs from it
the sticky tabs are provided as a convenience for helping you place the protective screen
easy enough right
wrong
the tabs leave a film that you cant remove
as a result you cant see through the protective screen to the game screen
the manufacturer states that this product will prevent your ds screen from being damaged
they never said youd be able to see through it to the screenthese people are putting expensive stuff for old pelican codebreaker version  for playstation  thats kind of wrong they should of lower it down more about around  or  dollarswe have tested quite a number of sudoku handheld games both for the ds and psp
my boyfriend is a sudoku addict
i honestly have to say that sudoku mania is the worst of anything we have triedyou can chose a few options  the difficulty of the puzzle the number of items per grid x x and solving with numbers or symbols
you also choose the theme of your puzzle which change the look and feel of the game
then you launch into the automatically generated puzzlethe layout they chose to use is simply awful
the top display shows the puzzle
the bottom area has four tiny arrows that you can click on to move your selection cube up down left or right
you have to click precisely to move your cursor around
so youre watching the top screen and clicking in tiny spots on the bottom screen to position your cursor to the cube you want to work on
yes you can use the dpad as wellonce you select a spot you use the stylus to tap one number to put into that cube
you cant put in several numbers to indicate what you are currently working on
did the developers even play sudoku before developing this game
no other game misses this most basic technique of playing sudokuoh if you put an incorrect number in  where the number is already in a row or column  it flashes
so much for using your brain to solve the puzzle
not that you really can solve some of these puzzles  their autogenerator seems to have faults and not all games are intuitively solvableall of these issues would already have put this game at the bottom of the list but even their font choices are poor
looking at the grid some of the numbers look like other numbers
the contrast is poor so its hard to see any of them
again these are basic issues that really should have been fixed
its rather obvious that these guys were out to capitalize on the sukoku mania and figured that once someone bought the game because it said sudoku theyd be unable to return itwith all the other sudoku games out on the market theres really no reason to get this onerating this game is what we call broken
sudoku only works properly if each puzzle has a single unique solution and the player can find that solution based on the puzzle presented
sudoku mania is broken because its puzzles do not have unique solutions
to add insult to injury the interface is pretty awful tooi wanted to but avatar the burning earth but instead i bought this one by mistake
i dont like it at all its a bit hard and the moves powers are boringfighting games are one of my favorite genres
ive been playing them since fatal fury and the first street fighter ii in the early s and enjoy a bunch of different series
guilty gear samurai shodown virtua fighter king of fighters last blade capcom vs snk snk vs capcom blazblue dead or alive soulcalibur the list goes on
tekken was a series i was never that interested in
probably because in the late s i didnt have much interest in the original playstation but it never looked that good to me for some reason
fast forward to  and ive finally picked up a tekken game
granted the price had something to do with it just a fiver but i was ready to try a new fighting game series
well new to me at least
low and behold i hated it
im sure tekken purists will go ahead and vote no on this review which doesnt make sense since these are supposed to be for people who are deciding on if they should get something or not not people whove already played the game but i really didnt like anything about tekken  and dont get how anyone can call it the best fighting game on the pstekken  doesnt play like any other fighter ive played
from what i got in the  hours give or take i played it all comes down to how well you can juggle your opponent
characters get launched from attacks that shouldnt launch them up in the air even when theyre laying on the ground
there was a good number of times when i fought people online and i was knocked down only to be knocked back up when someone did a jumping kick over me
it wasnt anywhere near my character yet there they went up and away getting stuck in another juggle combo
you can argue that juggling is in a lot of fighting games especially guilty gear but at least there it makes sense
juggling seems to be the key to victory just like how the key to victory in soulcalibur is picking kilik or mitsurugi
throws are pretty broken too dealing as much damage as some combos
attacks are based on  main buttons square x circle and triangle with each representing either arm or leg
some characters have special moves like shooting with a gun or weird energy attacks but most of them stick to real moves
it was s a nice change of pace but everything here seemed very unresponsive to me
playing tekken  i never felt like i was getting any better even after spending time in practice modes with characters that are supposed to be newbie friendly
i felt more confident playing primal rage in the mids than i did playing tekken aside from the standard arcade mode complete with stupid huge demon boss that doesnt fit in with the setting theres a very terrible quest mode
think of how beat em up games were on the ps in the first couple of years of its lifespan
yeah remember the bouncer
this is like that
you pick a character and go through different maps beating up generic baddies while trying to stay awake through one of the most boring plots ever in a fighting game
controls here are atrocious since youre no longer going from side to side like in the regular fights but all over the map like a standard action game
but here your moves are carried over to this new mode and it doesnt work very well
the only pro is that this is where youll be getting a lot of the games trophies but if you ask me its not worth suffering through
online play isnt worth mentioning but ill do so anyway
get this the net code is worse than the original street fighter ivs
where you could hop in and play online in no time with regular sfiv here in tekken  a newer game youll be spending a lot of time staring at loadingsyncing screens
sometimes when i was finally ready for a match i didnt care any morethings dont get any better in the graphics department either
tekken  looked stunning in arcades but on consoles it looks like its from the last console generation
i actually said out loud this is a ps game
when my first match started up
textures animations everything is lackluster except for the cutscenes but who needs those in a fighting game
at least the voice acting is decent if a bit melodramatic what can you expect from something like this
i did like the music in some stages but nothing was very memorablewhile i dont feel like i listed enough reasons why i didnt like tekken  in all honesty the game just bored the hell out of me
id rather play any of the mortal kombat games before giving this another shot and i loathe the mk games
i dont feel like i was completely ripped off since i finally got to play a tekken game and see if i liked it or not and i at least got some easy trophies out of it im no trophy hound but i gotta say the ones here are stupideasy to get
ill gladly stick with guilty gear and street fighter over this any day
youd think with such a huge cast of characters i wouldve found more than just a boxing kangaroo that i liked
poor roger jr maybe you can make it in a better game sometimea horrid game poor graphics worst controls ever on a redundant soon dead over rated low sales console
save your cash
yes this game sucks on xbox toothis by far the worse fighting game ever
not only does the online element suck completely but the offline experience is extremely difficult unsatisfying and just plan ridiculous
as previous commenters have stressed it is fake looking and you will spend more time loading then you will fighting
now i am completely aware why sony and namco have launched such an extensive public relations campaign on playstation home simply because this is a terrible product
they are merely selling the name tekken and not a good game
i am trading this in with amazon and then using the money i can salvage to purchase something else
from this experience i pledge to never buy a single namco game ever again and have lost all respect for the tekken series
mind you i have been an admirer of the games since tekken  for playstation onei pre order this game as soon as the option was available here in amazon i did this because you would expect a great sequel to the previous tekken games
even if you werent into fighting games anyone who tried them always ended with a good comment about them
sadly tekken  broke that cycle for methe games takes a really long time to load which is kind of annoying since it does it for every single fight
if you choose to take on the campaign mode you will find a sad action game imitation
you get to fight along a course with guns and lots of enemies it doesnt sound so bad until you realize the controls are all messed up the graphics are lame and the story is even worse
after trying that for a few times i decided to go arcade only after a few fights i came to stand in front of a dinosaur boss
to make things more interesting they made the boss unpredictable unstoppable and with only one weak point your lucki can keep on going but my point is to warn people before they buy this game
you might end up liking it if you do contact me and ill give you mine but rent it before you buy itglhonestly i expected more from scamco
they pretty much made us wait over  years for the console release of this game and for what
they are just giving us a mediocre display of online netcode and graphics design
namco you really screwed this timei just bought this game today and i couldnt wait to get home to play it
what a disapointment and let down this game isi know fighting games shouldnt be easy but when are they going to release a fighting game that isnt fake
first of all when fighting the computer the ai characters block everything you dish outthe juggle combos are to much you cant even fall on the ground before getting half your life taken away from a juggle combomost of my favorite characters are now lame the last guy is a jokei had to stop playing before i smashed my controllerthe only good thing about this game is the graphics and sound other than that you might as well take the  and wipe with itthe game is so dumb
you are in a graveyard in your underpants and a giant red monster comes to steal your girlfriend
mr knight finds his armor laying next to the picnic
and then faces an endless amount of zombies
mr knights controls are about equal to me trying to order my  yr old sister around
the enemies are just big enough to be unable to jump over and the ending was too crude
dont buy itthis game sucked so badly its not even funny the grahpic was terrible the gameplay was terrible not alot of characters this was a pieace of s that needed to be flushed down the toilet but good thing i rented this game from block buster but wow this was horrible not even fun the graphic was so badly meesed up it was like a crocadile at a pieace of paper and spat it back out thats how bad it was budokai was better then this pieace of ho ha this was the worst game i evered playedthis game pales in comparison with the sudoku found in brain age
the only reason to play it on the ds instead of in a cheap paper book are the electronic features
but if the interface is awful why botherprosthe only nice feature this offers over pen and paper sudoku are  minimal improvements double clicking on a number will highlight all instances of that number on the grid
and when a number appears  times already on the grid not including the jotted notes then that number fades out and you cant input it anymore
ready for the bad parts
keep readingconsthe interface
here are the things i hate about it the total grid takes up about  of  nintendo ds screen
the upper screen mirrors the grid on the lower screen and at the same size
there is absolutely no function for the upper screen
all it really offers is a timer
too bad you cant turn it off to save power
the temporary numbers you use to indicate possible numbers is tiny
id say a  point font
if youre over  years old save your eyesight
now imagine that font with a dim screen since youre using an old ds model or saving power since the upper screen is sucking it all away  and imagine it while moving like in a subway or car the tiny temporary numbers dont disappear when you indicate the actual number you think fits in that cell
each cell holds up to  temporary numbers
so youll have to click on the tiny corners of the cell and manually delete them
no option to be alerted if you enter the wrong number in a cell
brain age has this option lousy music
guess this is a plus too since turning off the speaker saves battery power
more bad interface this happened to me one time i was resuming a saved game and made a mistake when i filled in the puzzle
i wanted to go back to where i last saved its not possible except by restarting the ds
i chose to return to the main menu hoping i could do it from there
and guess what
it didnt just delete my unsaved information but it tossed out my save tooi agree with the other people who gave this one poor marks
the game does not make good use of the dual screens at all
and sudoku is all thisgame doesi was spoiled because the first sudoku game i bought for ds was brainage  please note that sudoku is only a part of the brain age softwaresort of a bonus
anyway they designed it so you turn the ds  degrees and hold it like a book  the sudoku grid is nice and large andfills most of one screen
the grid navigation and number entry system are very intuitive
the only issue is there are a set number of puzzlesi wish the designers of brain age would put out a dedicated sudoku game with the same interface but one that generates new puzzlesid stay away from gridmaster
another option is  sudoku mania which is better and less expensivefirst of all im  sure my computer maxed out every requirement in this game but in the end my operating system is to far advanced for this sty europe bootlegit videogame i have wasted many hours finding a solution to this but a big troll in the face is all i see this is the last time im buying europe garbages onlinethe ai for this disgrace is bad not only by  or  or even  standards but even by atari  it is awfulno stratagy involved just a race to see how fast you can point and clickthe most obnoxious and useless game voice over ive ever heard the tough guy audio just never shuts upthe addon games to this that followed are equally as badthis is only for people that are easily mesmerized by loud noises and bright flashing colorsst i would like to say that this does have some fun aspects
explorationwithin a large map
some quests are fun to finish and you still feel somesense of accomplishment and reward
the graphics are beautiful if you canget them to run rightbut i would also like to say i am sick of game companies dumbing downtheir games so the console twitch gamers can play it as wellthe interface is overly simplistic that it takes away from any sort ofmeaningful inventory  stats usagei have a high end system running dual sli cards amd fx w  gtxcards gb fast ram i spent hours tweaking the ini files and cachesettings just to get this game to run with mid range settings
even thenthere is still some stuttering and lag not fps loss  cpu usagespikes  poor poor poor programmingsave games can get corrupted
horrid clipping into walls by actors
eventsyou did not trigger seem to happen anyway causing you to reload hours backto correct it
like the commenter above said combat is horridover all a frustrating game
you want to play it so bad but it just endsup making you want to cry and shelf it
maybe after several patches andwhen the new high end components become affordable it may be worthdusting offwhat can i say that has not already been said about this abortion of a releasei sincerely hope that this company goes bankrupt as i honestly hate spending my money on a game that as another reviewer stated was supposed to be oblivions match
simply stated that is a load of crap
my computer is well above the specs for recommended hardware for this game and i cannot play it for  minutes without going into an epileptic seizurethere are just too many buggs to list
strange lights flashing objects dissapearing and reappearing falling through the world camera angles sticking are just a fraction of the problems i encountered during the first  minutes of playingload times
this is a joke
i have way more graphics intensive programs and this thing takes at least  minutes to load
try to save once
if you are lucky enough not to crash you should go find something else to do for about  minutes perhaps go brush your teethworst of all go to the game developers website and look at the suggested tweaks
i dont know about you but when i play a game i want to relax and enjoy it
i certainly dont want to have to input countless lines of code and change advanced settings for hours just to get the thing to run
even after giving it an honest effort most of the tweaks did nothing to enhance to gameplay anywaysmy advice to anyone interested in buying this awful game is dont
buy oblivion if you already havent
this is absolutely the worst game i have ever purchased and i have had my share of bad ones
this on takes the cakewont work
no surprise
its from the same group that released stubbs the zombie
read those reviews
notice a patternsix other reviews so far and three call this a great game
your character will get stuck on the landscape
even jumping over a fence you can get caught on the air
your enemies on the other hand seem able to race right through walls and other obsticles to attack youi enjoy rpgs that actually let you role play
in gothic iii you can become evil or good enough that you can make some npc factions try to kill you on sight
thats fine but in order to finish the game you have to get into their lairs etc
you arent allowed to do this because youve built up too much hatred with them so you cant finish the gamei also enjoy the feeling of making an rpg character my own and truly unique by leveling up the skills i wish as i go
however in this game you really cant tell what skills are needed in order to get to the uberskills you might want to reach in the futurehorrible voice actinga couple of the reviewers have said the graphics are better than oblivion
im not sure how they can tell
to keep gothic iii from crashing you have to lower all the graphics settings significantlya major online reviewer couldnt even get the game to recognize the presence of his mouse  so he had to run the game keyboard onlyi had huge hopes for this game
i really wanted it to blow oblivion out of the water
not only does it fail to do that its an utter mess
i hope they put out some major patches to fix the most obvious flaws but does a game this bad ever become even a good game with patches
ive never seen itdont even buy this game when you see it in the discount bargan bingothic  is aspyrs failed attempt to create something like bethesda softworks elder scrolls iii morrowind
epic fail
instead they created a clunky resource hog that makes something that should be fun incredibly aggravating
i was running the game on an older pc that was capable of running bethesda softworks oblivion
the result gothic  ran like a yugo on one good cylinder a sign of poor coding
moreover its characters are dull and uninspired even its introduction scenes are bland
aspyr should have never released this monstrositybottom line gothic  is a waste of my money
i am sorry i purchased it
aspyr has proven to be a poser
if you are interested in openended fantasy adventure go with bethesda softworks elder scrolls iii morrowind or oblivioni liked gothic  and  i like this one too except i cant complete the game because people important to the main missions can drop right off the map and you cant find them anymore
once i was looking for some runes and the orc who had what i was looking for just disappeared and was nowhere to be found thus i could not comlete the missioni would recommend playing this game anyway because it is so much fun but be prepared to get buggy because all the bugs will drive you crazyit could have been a great game
instead it is just a colossal failureat first i was worried about the drm issues prior to release
i didnt like the the fact that you had a limited number of installs
this would be my first goround with drm
nonetheless i bought the game anyways because it still looked awesome
key word word is looked
the game is far from it
this abolished my concerns with the drm
i dont plan on reinstalling after im done with this gamei dont know why they have you waste time evoling a race if it only lasts  hours then youre in space for a majority of the game
the creature creation part doesnt feel like theres a point when your modifications dont actually balance into battles andor social interactionsi guess i was hoping for something more along the lines of civ  i should have waited to read some of the reviews firstafter years of hype the product doesnt live up to expectations
unfortunately they spent way way way too much time working on all the creature creation options and vehicle options etc
and forgot that there was supposed to be an actual game
it almost feels like the game part was slapped on last minute because the ideas used for the game portion are so unoriginal and have almost no new ideas explored at allin answer to some other critics i own the game and paid full price for it
my  and  year old like the creation aspect and that is fine but that is about all the fun there is to be hadthis also explains why they dont want a real demo out
if you saw it youd never buy it at  or  a popfinally the drm is inexcusable
they already limit what you can do online because only one license can have an account and be logged in at one time
why was there the need to put the three install limit into the system too
my recommendation is to avoid this and spend the money elsewhere
at the very least wait until it is under  andor they remove the drm from the product
i personally wish id waited tooi am going to make this as balanced and as objective as possible
this is my experience with spore  i purchased the game
money changed hands i took possession of a sealed box with the game inside it  i took the box home  my wife sees the box and she says did you check the reviews
i did read the prerelease reviews i say
go to amazon now and read the postrelease reviews she says  i read the reviews
they say that i cant run the game on more than  computers  i think about it
hmm i say to myself
if i buy a dvd i think i can play it on any player in my house
i can even lend it to my friends and they can play it on any of their dvd players or on an xbox or a ps or a ps all available for purchase at amazoncom by the way
same with a book
i can read it in the bedroom in the kitchen take it to the beach lend it to my friends even sell it  i count the computers in the house
i have  computers  very well i say to myself
i must take it back to the seller and get my money back  i do that get my money back  i would have kept the product and installed it absent the computer restrictionsnow just to make this very clear
i did experience the product
in the same way lets say you experience some camembert cheese by smelling it without necessarily ingesting any
or you would experience a bag of bananas
you can see if they are rotten without having open the bag  so you could write a review of camembert it stinks or of brand x of bananas they are rotten without necessarily digesting or touching the productthis game was supposed to be the sim gameprobably of the decade evolving from a single microbe to interplanetary space traveli wanted this game because it was supposed to be something more than your average sim
instead its a bunch of average sims slapped together dumbed down and graphically enhanced
it would be nice if creature designs mattered more outside of cosmetic appeal as well just for the drm i cant count how many times ive uninstalledinstalled some of my favorite gameswant to play diablo
load it up and go
sick of it after a few months
save the hard drive space
reformat
there goes an install
new computer
there goes an install
 installs is laughable at best
the hassle to get new activation keys in not worth the hasslei like that i can still fire up my old games now
if i look back at spore  years from now and feel like loading it up chances are im screwed dont waste your money on this longterm rental as someone else called itthis drm isnt going to stop game piracy and ea knows it
the securom drm contained in spore is for implementing eas new stand alone pc game subscription business model
you pay for the game but dont own it in any way shape or form
you relinquish your right to make a backup copy install it as many times as you wish on your pcs and resell it
if you do some research online you will see that this is all part of eas new business model along with microtransactions and ingame advertising
as bad as this may sound for the future of pc gaming all hope is not lost
as consumers we have the power to flex our muscle and tighten our grip on our walletsea killed this game with really bad drm
really
 installs
ea has to realize that people who pay for their games shouldnt be punished
because people who just get it from elsewhere does not have to deal with any kind of drm
dont buy this game until they fix the drm issuesnot only did they saddle this game with some of the worst copy protection measures ive ever heard of but their only response so far has been to insult people who dont like itwow ea
who do you think you are
anyone who gives ea any money ever again is a masochist because theyll just keep doing this stuff over and over again
send a clear message to this backwards company
put them out of business
who needs them anywaydraconian drm
 installs and youre done
how many times have you installed simcity on your pc in all the years youve owned it
ive lost count but its certainly more than do not rent this over hyped game that falls short of any expectations you may have for itbuy sword of the stars instead it has the space stage thats the real meat of spores strategy gameplay and has no drmthe game can be quite fun
for a short whilelike another reviewer complained it doesnt matter if your creature has fifty legs or half of one evolution pretty much plays absolutely no role in crafting your creature at all
its entirely a creationist game as your creature doesnt at all evolve but is changed to your specifications
that is you can start with a two legged mammallooking thing with claws for lips and if you dont like it you can completely change it to be a legless worm with eight eyes and wings and if you dont like that you can make a velociraptor with huge kneecaps and beefy arms
so long as you unlock more parts to create with you have absolutely free reign to mold your creature like clayso the game clearly espouts creationismthe cell stage is simple but its quite fun with your quest to eat little bits of plant or meat while avoiding larger cells and you can gradually evolve to put on spikes to poke the crap out of enemies or poison sacks or electric butts to kill your foes while the gigantic spiked amoeba that ate you every time you zipped past will soon become your primary source of foodnext the creature stage
this is one of the most fun stages as it consists of you controlling one of your creatures hunting for food either befriending other creatures by dancing singing and posing for them or murdering them in front of their children then eating their children in front of their womenif the creature stage had blood it would be a damn awesome experience
it can be a sheerly brutal play with great pleasure to be had in hunting species down to extinction or chasing an enemy away from its nest while cracking all their eggs and murdering their children when they try to come close
its also the only stage where you can do as much of the creature craftingcreationising as you can
my recommendation is to explore all you can find all the parts you can and pick what you like because you cannot evolve anymore past this stagetribal stage completely changes the gameplay to something like a simplistic rts where you hunt nonsentient creatures or gather fruits and plants and bring them back to camp where food can be spent on musical instruments weapons or children
the objective is to befriend and ally tribes or destroy their village hut
this stage is hell to go through and is exacerbated by poor controls an even poorer camera constant raids on your food supply by tiny creatures that will literally camp on your food pile and suck as much as they cancivilization stage is just a big mess of things thrown together as filler
you have to waste time designing each and every building and vehicle from scratch using the same system as designing your creature and the vehicle can be as overburdened with crap as you want so long as all the right stats are in place
this stage exacerbates all the poor control and camera problems in the previous stage and all the gameplay consists of literal feng shui as you must precisely place homes factories and entertainment centers to get the most happiness and productivity out of your city
if youre on an island dont even bother building too many military vehiclesthere is absolutely no way to get them over water not even by transportall the work in this stage is eventually rendered useless by the use of kiddie nuclear weapons in particular the icbm which destroys all cities that dont belong to you and automatically moves you to the space stagespace stage is the next awesome phase borrowing heavily from the creature phase with regards to controls and camera and lets you explore the entire galaxy available at hand
and since youre on your own theres no need to micromanage a city full of idiots with shoddy controlsso the pros freerange creature creation though its very much impossible to make something humanlike bloodless murderous fun in creature stage and cell stage being an obnoxious empire in the space stage low system requirements and small game size while graphics and collision detection are still topnotchcons insanely boring tribal and civilization stages insanely pointless civilization stage i beat this stage with nothing but military cities no economy limited number of parts makes you roam around a huge map for hours looking for thirty different variations of deformedtoe feet blatantly promoting creationism thus allowing absolutely no role for evolution and no purpose for any of the random appendages put on your creature save for the stats they grant camera controls are among the worst controllablecamera controls in any game ive ever played game controls postcell stage become sloppy and incoherent causing such chestnuts in the creature stage as trying to mate with another one of my kind only to end up running past them and spinning in circles too many things to handle in the tribal stage with not enough creatures to carry out all these tasks allies in every stage are completely useless for everything except not trying to kill you definitely biased towards murderous carnivores as its easily up to  or  times harder to impress and ally with another nesttribe than it is to simply butcher them all and eat their corpses in front of their children drm
 taken from the classaction lawsuit claim regarding securom drmi bought this game tonight at best buy and then came here to see if it was cheaper
i would have ignored  or   star reviews but  was too many to ignore
it seems it is not just a drm issue but the game itself isnt even worth 
i appreciate the heads up amazoncom mob
on my way to return it now  use of securom should be indicated in game description as it is a piece of software that is installed on your computer with the game
if i had known the game would come with securom i wouldnt have ordered it
i dont want to pay  to lease a game
i can do that at the local game store for 
if i had known that this was a lease i wouldnt have ordered it
securom installed with your game is malware that doesnt uninstall when you uninstall the game
you can remove securom either by a reinstalling windows or b following the directions here   some users report conflicts between secureom and other programs
sorry ea no game should be designed to leave malware behind on my computer after the game has been uninstalled
for people who say that reviews should only be of the game i think reviews should be of any piece of software that is on the accompanying disk and installed on your computer
that a piece of malware is quietly being installed on my computer is information important enough to me that my order will be returned unopened
judging from reviews most other people feel the same way
for ea concerned about piracy many other companies have ip protection that does not involve either a leasing the game or b installing unremovable malware
some even have you typing in little codes found on your cd case
you should look into iti want to love it but i just cant
ea games seems to want to do everything they can to screw over the people who give them money and thats just unacceptable
plus its not even linux compatible
this highly anticipated game is now nothing more than a jokeif it wasnt for the drm i would give it high scores
however it is asking to much to have only  installs
i would wait until ea gets it through their thick heads to remove the install limits before buying iti feel very very bad for the people who spent so much time and effort devloping this game only to have it come out as a rental basically
when you buy this game you only by it for a limited amount of times
in addition to that you get lovely additional software that comes with their protection which can very well screw up your computer
this game was highly anticipated and its a shame that it ended up being this way immediately on release
ea needs to change its way fast and other game developers need to understand that limiting a customer to rules of a purchase of a game is not going to fly
you better believe itas someone who occationally likes to install older games and play them again i seriously doubt id be able to do that with the digital rights management
id love to know the information that money side of ea has that points to making a drm like this
i mean even though people hate it and stop buying games because of it it must make sense to them
obviously if it didnt make the profit graph go up they would stop
so for people saying it isnt working i highly doubt that
sad thing is we the honest gamers sufferive been paying for and playing ea games for over two decades now
im sick and tired of the larger publishers forcing these draconian measures to combat piracy on lawful paying customers
there has to be a better way
see stardocks gamers bill of rights please
no spore for this gameri bought the game and the drm is causing problems on my machine
it wont let me install the game
what are you doing ea
drm free games install easy
i buy all my games and never have pirated anyconcerned customer concerned futurein no uncertain terms will i accept this kind of license from any company claiming to sell a game
you are basically paying money for an extremely flawed and one sided license
this game isnt for sale its not even for rent its basically up to eas discretion for how long they want to keep it alivewhen ea was done with several games they just shut down the activation servers and screw all the people that purchased the game forever
these conditions are reprehensible
ea will never have the option of my business ever againno matter how much fun the game might be a three installation limit is a big nogo for me
i could possibly live with the activation assuming it was reliable but i will never purchase a game that can only be installed three times
and calling some ea outsourced flunky to convince them to let me install it beyond the install limit doesnt cut it eitherall these  star reviews cant be wrong and they are not
most drm is livable ea has exceeded the threshold and the shareholders deserve to suffer for iti was planning on purchasing this game until i noticed all the talk on amazon about drm and required online activation
there isnt much chance of being able to play this game considering i am deployed overseas and have no access to personal internet
what happened to the good old days of being able to buy a game install it and simply being able to play it
i guess those days are gone
it doesnt seem to make much sense either considering all these supposed precautions dont really stop pirates
hell i could probably head down to one of the markets and just buy a cracked version that probably doesnt require the online activation to play
all these hackers and black market sellers are probably making more money due to all these annoying precautions game companies are now taking which seem only to really keep the honest buyer from enjoying the gamecurrently i rate this game bad been following and think the game itself looks like it has great potential
here is why i rate so lowcons
ability to play the only way for me to access the demos or whatever you want to call them is to lower my security settings on my system
here is my issue with this i did that for mass effect giving the benefit of the doubt after it crashed my computer and left files i couldnt remove it was easier to wipe my system and lose everything
to me that seems like malware
 activation limit i upgrade computers and have several of them at my house i just cut down to  and am looking to buy another by this my game will be useles before long
i play baldurs gate the original and fallout still these are some of my favorites
ive reloaded numerous times i fail to see how this helps fight piracy also
if i own a copy of a game im allowed a backup copy and i belive im also allowed to get that game as a rom even and play on an emulator
how does  activations limit pirating if i pirated an ran out of three activations id just pirate another this is more of a resell to paying customers package
eas buisness practices with there security
they dont label it on there packaging nor put a disclaimer that this sofware will harm your system and bypass your admin rights to your computer
also ive heard not sure but gamers tried a petition to ask ea not to put this drm on game those people were temporarily banned from the forums and those petitions were deleted not a very customer friendly conceptpros
the concept of the game i love these types of games and this is the most indept game ive seen
i think if the game works right it would provide hours of play
the graphics are outstanding
one drm feature was taken away which is the ten day actiavtion by internet which is great being military we dont see internet in all our locations so this is a nice step in the right direction to not alienate those that are away from the comfort of homeafter all is said and done i currently give the game one star for its inability to be played if ea takes a more customer friendly approach and i have no fears of crashing my system then i will boost my rating to reflect improvements but fo now it stays a  they actually were useful to me anyway
i had intended to purchase spore not realizing it used securom
i purchased bioshock which used securom and to this day the disc is nothing more than expensive coaster because ive never been able to get its nullbyted registry entries to work correctly in xp bit prolike i said i imagine most if not all of the  stars below and possibly mine as well will get removed but it saved me money at any rate
i really want to play spore but with this restrictive garbage included i doubt ill actually be able to and im not willing to gamble another  to find outim not even going to touch on the drm subject
there are plenty of other reviews to readi had been unsure about buying the game for a long time
my gut instinct just knew it was going to be a huge let down
however i started playing with the creature creator and found it fun so decided to shell out the 
a day later im already regretting itim a fan of the sims black  white and elderscrolls
i love games with plenty of room for different types of game play
i was stoked about the evolution concept and creating a creature that was adapt at the environment
the reality is no matter what your design you are a land based creature and two legs will get you just as far as four
really your evolution doesnt matter
at the end of every evolution stage you can completely redesign you creature so all those improvements you may have done a few stages ago can be deleted
not very evolution like
the amoeba stage is fun in a pac man sort of way but the onto land stage is rather boring
just run around either killing or performing the exact same  actions over and over until you get enough dna to move on
in the end the first  stages are virtually pointless because as you move onto civilization your evolution doesnt matter any more
stage  doesnt get any better
again you either kill things or perform the exact same  actions over and over until all the other villages are conquered
the last stages are a little better but really by the time i got there i didnt care any moreif you are an artist type and love to designbuild this might be a great game for you
the design part doesnt make up for the horrible game play
with that on top of the drm i wouldnt recommend this game to anyonei first heard of this game in a video showing will wright doing a walk through at a developers conference
words cannot describe how excited i was by the concept of this game
ive waiting years for its release but now it seems electronic arts has dropped the ball big time they have enforced a heavyhanded implementation of drm which only allows the game to be installed three times and it must connect to the internet to verify your install the game has been paired down from its original scope in order to milk players into buying multiple expansion packsthe drm is a real shame because it only serves to inconvenience the honest
it seems that pirates have been enjoying the game without drm while honest paying gamers are suffering with the drm taking over their system
what good is drm if the game was pirated before it even was available for purchasepreorder canceled
this is unacceptableso i was going to buy this game but apparently we are all crooksno one wants to buy something and feel like you have stolen itcustomer is always right
that is a rule i have always heard in retailapparently in the video game world of retail that doesnt matterthe drm for the game utilizes securom which is essentially a virus that installs itself without warning when you install the game
there is no way to completely remove it without reformatting and it is constantly running in the background if not removed
sucking up computer resourcesit also is overpriced
this is actually a rental not a bought game because it only lets you install  times
if you install over  times then you must call ea customer support and beg them to let you play the game you bought
did i mention the call is not free
if you live outside the us it will be a very expensive calldo not buy this and if you do buy it keep in mind that you are renting it
not buying it
whats really ironic about this is the drm hasnt even stopped the pirates as it was pirated a few weeks ago
and the pirated version doesnt have securom or install limits which makes it a better version
ea shouldnt treat its consumers like trashthanks ea you have saved me money that otherwise wouldve been yours if you had the slightest realization that there actually are people out there with integrity
ive never considered getting a cracked version of any software but i cant say im not going to look into it at this pointmaybe the pirates have the right ideamerely adding fuel to the fire so read past reviews to see why drm is not the way of the future and why everyone should think seriously before adding this game to thier cart
heres a hint ea i might actually want to upgrade my computer sometime in the next five years
of course this wont stop it from selling out the wazoo like all sims games and it wont stop ea from trumpeting all of the extra copies that people are going to be inevitably buying just so they can play the game they already boughteither way this game will be joining mass effect and bioshock on my do not purchase listid like to review the gameplay itself here and avoid any discussion of the drm which others have commented on
my opinion is that this game is not worth purchasing
its a computer game that just isnt fun
some might find actually find it annoying
and i suppose there might be some  year olds that like it
heres whywhile spore is completely innovative with graphics and sound the game itself is repetitive boring and intellectually insulting
it has a user interface that is very difficult to use which begins at the first stage and never stops
input and actions feel sluggish and nonprecise compared to controlling characters in gta or wowif i were to design spore there would be some major changes
the gameplay itself would be procedural not just the graphics and sound
do i think it should be a multiplayer game
yes
should there be a continued focus on the characters you create
yes
unfortunately you lose control of your beloved creation as the game progresses
tearsthe results of your efforts are so linear and useless the product might as well be a movie or a cartoon on saturday morning where the funny brocooli guy dances for the meateating coffee table and they make friends
its more fun to watch with your hands relaxed than click the user interface the coffee table wasnt planning on dancing since its a singer primarily but the broccoliguy wins him over by clicking at the right moment
yuck
is anyone laughingi have derived more pleasure from brian enos music in spore than any other aspect
while i had high hopes for spore it seems we have a flop here
this should have become an avatarmaker for the sims and been parked in a warehouse with other software xfilesall that work over  years all that hype such amazing graphics and such beautiful music all for a dinky kids game
i could seriously use a fun game here with a far deeper sense on strategy and possibilities beyond silly animated shapesaside from this whole drm thing the game is just bad
its like the sims but trying to hard
there are better games out nowea limits how many times you can install this gameif you install this game more than  times ever anywhere over any period of time you must contact ea and provide them with a proof of purchase and explain why you needed to install this game more than  timesthey do not have to give you the ability to install the game a th or more time
they can simply say no and youll have to buy another copyi will not buy a product with such security measures as it punishes too many innocent peoplewhen i first saw the hourlong preview of spore way back when it really seemed like the game everyone was going to wait for and want
its utter failure seems like proof to me that you should never again preorder a game even if it comes from the messiah of developersas you probably know the game takes place in the form of five different stages
they slowly move up in levels of complexity until you reach the space stage which has been considered the talking point of the game
all of these other stages really seem oversimplistic
the city game only has one land vehicle air vehicle and water vehicle used for both working and attacking
there are no nonvehicle unitsthe creature and tribal stages involve the classic video game goodevil choice make friends or kill everyone
its like even will wright cant escape the paradigmthe essential problem here is that while all of us were amazed by the procedural generation of creatures thats really all there is that makes the game special
the gameplay is a poorly thought out design by people who are used to the sims and probably received much less focus overallthe game will be fun for a short while which sort of makes it deserving of a  but since it uses drm i will be onestarring itcame to this site to do a quick oneclick buy
was shocked to see all the single star reviews
after dealing with some of blizzards highhanded antics in wow i swore off any gamegame company that has bs limitations
i pay my money the game is mine to do as i will
i wont copy it for friends or sell it or do anything to cost the company a dime but the software is mine to do with as i pleaseour house has  laptops  xp screamer pcs i handbuilt and a macif i own the game i should be able to install it on anything i wantno way in hell am i shelling out   let alone  i like collector editions to effectively rent software
as for calling the company and throwing myself on their tender mercies  fuggitaboutdit
my experience with that sort of thing has always been a purgatorian wait on the  number followed by arguing with a young moron whos obviusly annoyed at me interupting their day of texting friends with my insipid requests for customer serviceif they pop the top on the installs and get shed of the malware installs ill buy this puppy
short of that when the urge strikes to create a spacefaring civilization ill dust off my copies of moo and moo  i know theyll always workcontrary to the manual you cannot have more than one account per game key code so forget about sharing your game with anyone in your family
that is ridiculous enough but there is no option to even create a second account on the same machine even if you have another code
people with more than one pc are no better off they will need to buy two copies unless only one person plays on both
oh and you can only install it  times
ever
if i were will wright i would quit eamaxis and start a new privately owned company
i smell class action on this one epsecially with the manual providing false informationi had no idea this game was crippled by threeactivation drm when i bought it at target today
what a horrific thing to do to such a promising product
ea you deserve to be hit with a class action lawsuit and boycotts because of this customer abuseim beginning to really hate ea and i spend thousands of dollars a year on gamesunfortunately amazon will not allow me to cancel this order so it will need to be a return later
aggressive drm  should not be tolerated and the best way to make an active stance is to cancel existing orders and let the community know whysee those older star reviews from  two years before the game was released
well they had a reason to be excited
spore was supposed to be a revolutionary experience combining multiple genres while concentrating on evolution and geneticsfast forward two years and here we have the finished product ready to be installed on our hard drivesfirst of all the game incorporates a draconian drm system that requires you to activate over the internet and limits you to a grand total of  activations
if you reach that limit then youll have to call ea in order to add one extra activation
thats not as simple as it sounds since when you reach that point ea will assume that you the paying customer are a filthy pirating thief
you will need to provide proof of purchase reasons why the limit was reached etc etc it has all happened before with another recent ea product mass effect
ea of course is not obligated to grant you that extra activation or even provide that service
in a couple of years they might very well even shut down the general activation servers because its not financially feasible to keep them running
what you will be left with is a nice colorful  coaster
and you will be required to pay for another copylicense if you want to continue playingthis basically means that you are actually renting the game instead of owning it
the game will stop to function in the future
thats inevitable because even if ea keeps the activation servers going there is going to be a time when ea will simply cease to exist because of financial issues or federal laws like most businesses eventually dosecond the game was dumbed down to oblivion
evolution doesnt even matter anymore
for example you can add as many legs to a creature as you want but the multilegged creature wont be any faster than a singlelegged one with higher leg stats
this gameplay element makes creating your creatures entirely pointless cosmetic only because everything is based on stats and brings you about the same amount of excitement as dressing up a plastic dolllooks cute quirky and fun
shame i wont be buying it until ea wakes up and figures out that punishing paying customers and rewarding piracy isnt really a good business strategy
durh
doesnt help that they are being very belligerent and arrogant about it basically telling paying customers tough poopies if you dont like drm
what you think doesnt really matter
just keep giving us moneyi waited half a decade for this
go back and watch the  spore videos to see what the game could have and should have been
its been reduced to a collection of mini games and frankly the tribal mini game stage is terrible
furthermore creature creation has been nerfed to where its stylistic as opposed to utilitarianoh and the drm was the final straw
lost two stars for that oneea is waging war on their customers with spores activation system
take a stand and dont support thisthe drm
seriously
unlike many other people i found this game quite enjoyable admittedly there are many points where it gets monotonous bland a waste of your creativity but i still enjoyed it when i played it
uh when it didnt crash for no apparent reason and lose all my progress because it doesnt autosave and i hadnt the forethought to save manually that ishowever i did not enjoy it when i ran out of installs
at that point ea told me i couldnt play the game id purchased anymoreim still blown away by that responseoh ea lemme tell you something
you think you put your hardcore drm on us innocent pc game buyers treat us all like thieves and forget the fact that some of us are pc builders that do reinstall our os allot when upgrading hardware or doing a normal windows reformat and think were gonna take this crap then you ea are sadly mistakeni bought this game and regret it by far why
because the drm is really that bad
i thought we were in a day in age as to when you spend your hard earned money on something it is actually yours
not to distribute but to use as long as you want solely for yourself
evidently ea doesnt believe in that
eas days are numbered they just dont know it yet
whatever you do dont buy this game
heyhey nono eas drmhasgottogonow on to the game itselfthe game is actually quite good
its very charming and a lot of fun
the variety of games the online aspect and creature creation tools are very well done and there is a lot of attention to detail in all aspects such as graphics animation sounds
the game play unfortunately is a bit too simplistic and that hurts it after a few runs
it left me pining for something with more depth
the designers chose a tradeoff between offering more variety at the cost of depth
i suspect they also wanted to make the game more accessible for people who are not what i would term hard core gamers and thats totally coolas a game its a solid  stars
as a product it should get  stars
if ea wants to employ draconian copy protection measures theyre really there to prevent you from reselling the game the should give their customers full disclosure
in my opinion this is not how an ethical company should do business
thumbs down to ea for a horrible product good job to will wrights crew for making a charming albeit simplistic gameafter reading these reviews and having had bad experiences with drm in the past im not going to botheri think what ill now do for gaming is pick up a couple of wiis to go with my new hdtvs
at least that way i dont have to put up with drm headaches
those who say drm wasnt a problem thats great
ive spoken with a few people who are happy
they do exist
unfortunately its not commonmy next computer will become a ubuntu linux system with windows games under wine and native games like ut and  rtcw for commercial purchases
nexuiz bos warzone  and others will be games im moving to
but mainly im switching to console gaming after this yes this was the last straw and im tired of itsadly i was expecting quite a bit and didnt hear anything about drm until now
but again after being burned time and time again im done with drm vendors
go pedal your wares elsewhereon and ubuntu is replacing vista here
drm concerns and stability issues again to name a couple of issues
and yes im highly skilled with over  years experience
i also have several microsoft certifications including the msce so im not speaking from ignorance i came to amazon to buy it but clearly the drm is repulsive and malware in nature
i will not buy it
i would have purchased two copies one for me and one for a friend
say good bye to my  eaive been a big maxiswil wright fan since the beginning
i love games like sim city the sims and i was really looking forward to that sort of game being combined with genetics and a spacefaring game like master of orion
the trouble is spore is just not that gamefirst off spore is really not an openended sandbox like game like its predecessors
in fact the first couple stages of the game offer the player relatively few choices and the end result feels canned and predetermined
as if that wasnt bad enough the game feels like a game for little kids
cutsiepoo graphics simplistic arcadelike controls and gameplay make for a game i wouldnt touch with a  pole
well they tried something different i give them credit for that
but this game certainly isnt for menow about the copy protection thing that has caused a big uproar here on amazon im not sure people understand the tradeoff here
i dont like copy protection any better than the next guy
the companies that trust me like galactic civilizations i make it a point to give my loyalty to
but honestly i dont really think spores copy protection scheme is all that bad
take games like sim city and the sims for example
for those games you need to always carry the cddvd around and plug it into the machine every time you want to play
have a half dozen games you like to play from time to time
then youll be lugging around a half dozen dvds with you too
spore once registered requires no dvdcd to play
to me that is a major advantage and makes it no different to all kinds of other computer programs microsoft office microsoft windows adobe photoshop etc
so i dont understand the uproar
i can only assume that people dont really understand itto call spore an eagerly awaited title would be an understatement
you cant go to an internet forum anymore without finding at least  thread dedicated to it
i finally broke down and bought a dvdrom drive in order to play it i know  years later but i dont have time to play pc games like i used toit amazing to hear the almost universal dissatisfaction with the game not because of the game itself which actually does live up to some of the hype but because game companies dont trust their consumers anymoreive said it before and ill say it again imposing some kind of ludicrous  strikes and you cant install policy is not going to stop dishonest people its going to make the honest ones reconsider buying from ea in the first place
not only is it an insult its also a very bad business strategythe first alarm was the creature creator
both the fact that they charged for it and the fact that it revealed one of the potentially interesting parts of the game to be incredibly dull and pointless
i agree with an earlier review  its disappointing that most of the creature creation is purely cosmetic and not functionalthis is my second and last runin with securerom
the first was with bioshock  it completely prevented me from running that game on my pc even after a reinstall
technical support was nonexistentagain with this game i could not play it on my newer computer
i had to install on an older computer and even then i had to use a pristine clean windows installsummary game is a bit disappointing to be fair i havent reached the last level yet the drm is inexcusable
i probably will put the game aside for a while because its too slow on the one computer that it will run on
i may have to get a cracked version just to run it on my newer computeranother ea debacle
amazing that companies wont learn
much like securerom punkbuster and the other attempts at restricting our ability to use our games spore comes loaded with digital restriction managementcan you imagine buying a kitchen knife and being told you can only cut three things with it
buying a mobile phone an being told you can only use it three times before it stops working
ea has applied these draconian restrictions to an otherwise enjoyable gamemaking it utterly rubbish and worthless
they restrict the numbers of times the game can be installed toget thisthree
now knowing how windows xp and even vista need to be rebuilt regularly to clean out the trash accumulated over time an average user can burn through the three installs in a year or two
then get this you have to call ea to get permission to install the very game you purchasedwhen did purchasing become rentingoh and forget about longterm gaming
spore relies on ea to maintain activation servers
if you cant reach the activation servers goodbye game
if ea shuts down their activation serverslike yahoo and msn have with their own drm infested products your  disappears into the windsave your money
we waited two years for this
and ea slaps us in the face with drm
besides the drm this game is known to cause system stability issues crashes and otherwise ruin your gaming experiencei recently bought the game
but because i like to tinker with my computer a lot i often reinstall windows
this is a common thing to do and this is what they do at geeksquad if you have a serious compouter problemi just found out that if i reinstall windows on this computer the same computer not different computers that spore will stop working after three times
so since i reinstall windows at least once every  months i have effectively paid  dollars to rent this game for six monthsi still play the sims  and all its expansion packs after many years and over  reinstalls of windows xp
but with this game i will be cut off from the product i purchased after  monthsdo not purchase this game unless you are sure that you will not need to reinstall windows due to a virus or hardware upgrade or even upgrading from xp to vista
it will be rendered unusablethank you guys i was going to buy this game but instead i learned so much about drm after doing  days research i decided to skip buying this game at least until they patch out the drmso i sum my voice to the protestby the way i own simcity  and the original the sims i love both games and still play them from time to time thats why i thought that i would enjoy spore but i will not support drm sorryi have many ea games i am still playing nba live k daily and i am disappointed to see that they have stooped to this level
activation was a main hate of people when xp came out and for some unknown reason it looks like ea has followed suitdont these company realised that drm annoys legitimate usersall it does is make people want to rage against the machine and use an illegal copy
i am sure that some trusty hacker out there is already coming up with a solution to fool the program
i do hope so because i dont know if i would ever buy another ea game if this isnt stoppedi never liked this gameactually i hated itcome on you play with ugly looking monsters etc so i decided to skip this ugly gamebut what happened is i got that friend who keeps saying how revolutionary this game is well its indeed  its a revolutionary when it comes to drmyou can only install the game  times ever  what about people who format there pcs every a while
for example i have laptopdesktop at home and another desktop in my office so if i install the game  times then thats it i cant install it again if any of my pcs broke downalso you must have online connection to active it  the game install a virus on your pc that checks your pc for pirated games which slow down your pc and you can not remove itwhat the hell eai really wanted to like this game after the years of buildup will wrights history of innovative design and the infamous gdc demo of spore look it up on youtube if you want to see what i thought they were going to publish from a tech demo years ago
what got delivered was a severely simplified collection of minigames slapped together with some overly cute animations shallow play badly thoughtout and misbalanced endgame space phase with one of the worst and most personally offensive copy protection schemes wrapped around it
in interviews postrelease wright has basically confirmed that what was wanted by the publisher note not by the customer was a simple game for casul gamers that would have superior sales eg
sims  unfortunately what they wound up with was a game thats too simple even for hardcore sims fans in the early phases and perplexingly difficult in the last phase even for hardcore players not because the game is actually more difficult but because its very poorly thought outok drm scheme first since thats what people are up in arms about and what some star reviewers are apparently confused by
this version of securom limits you to  activations after which you can maybe possibly get more if you call ea support toll call with long wait times and poor response with a convincing explanation after which they may or may not honor your purchase
in many cases the answer is not judging by previous titles that use this limited activations scheme bioshock mass effect and the customer nightmares that ensured
an activation by the way is not the same as an installation installations are a subset
an activation includes a fresh os install major hardware change minor hardware change such as plugging in a usb device nobody can actually tell you what constitutes an activationfurthermore securom while not as overtly offensive as starforce does in fact install registry entries and administratorlevel monitoring software in your system without your knowledge and it cannot be removed without either a drive wipe or a multistep command line process that i would not recommend to a casual user
it gets installed as soon as you start up spore for the first time and you dont get told this
it is therefore part of the product and is a legitimate topic to discuss in a review for everyone who thinks you shouldnt rate the game low because of the drmthe gameplay itself is charming and amusing the first time you play it i suppose
the first time i played it not trying to powergame through i made it to the space stage within a few hours without even trying to
this was the point that i looked back at the gameplay and wanted to know is that it
and it pretty much wasfor those people who are offended by the idea that the game espouses evolution dont bother
there is no actual evolution in this game
there is absolutely no natural progression from one form to the next
as long as you have the parts available you can change from a sixwinged butterfly thingy to a gazelle with nine eyes to a landgoing slug that spits poison
your environment doesnt force any changes on you whatsoeverthe first four phases of the game cell animal tribe civilization are incredibly simplistic versions of other genre games and are over before you know it
at the end of each one when i was suddenly winning without knowing how it actually felt more like i had finished one phase of a tutorial for a bigger more interesting game that i never got
in the cell game its move eat avoid win
in the animal game its eat attack using the  keys impress also using the  keys win
in tribal well things get slightly more complex as you have to pick out clothing and huts but its still get food impress or kill win
in civilization you think finally heres where thingsget interesting but only in that instead of fightingimpressing you now have the choice of buying with trade killing with military or converting with religious combined with a minicity builder game that plays more like connect four than sim citythe space phase is fairly difficult but this is only because of logical inconsistencies and missing systems in the game
without going too indepth here are some of the highlights your empire can afford to terraform planets bribe empires and the like but cant build a second ship to help you out
your empire also cannot send out a few guys with guns to hunt down diseased animals and have to commandeer your ship its only ship to fly around the planet zapping sick deer with a laser
your cities have autodefense turrets that dont fire on the enemy
your empire is incapable of setting up regular shipments of spice apparently the only commodity anyone wants and require you to move it around yourself in between shooting sick deer pirates unmolested by planetary defense turrets and paying for city upgrades
what dont planets have tax bases to put up their own houses
no apparently its up to you the commander of the only ship in the empire to put up condos for your hapless peoplei wont even go into the bugs involved in basic installation of the game authentication errors buggy sporepedia c drive overflow even if you install in a different drivepartition everything goes into the my documents folder which is in c by default one account per installation this was supposed to be allowed and even says so in the basic editions manual but apparently they considered this to be a typo even with the change account buttons present in the ui and other numerous technical problems
you can go check the ea forums for some of those before they get deleted or locked downin conclusion i have to say that you should not buy this product due to its poor shallow gameplay insidious and anticonsumer drm and most of all install limit
but the real question is not why would you need to install more than  times we know the answers to that and they are totally legitimate
the question is why you would want to install it even oncei came here today because i was seriously thinking of buying this innovative game
it took me about  secondsthe time required to read a couple of explanations of the drm nonsenseto change my mind
good bye sporewow i cant believe i bought this was a pile of trash
will wright can save his snarky comments about his game  maybe if he saves them up he can post them on the walls of his new cardboard box to remind him of the epic failure that is  sporei went from the beginning of the game to the end in like  hoursnone of it was really interesting  and for something so long in development it makes me wonder if the creators didnt just drink and play hackey sack all day instead of working on this
its like a  year old made the game and then the ea staff put flashy graphics on it
dumbenjoy my  the next time you come out with something that might interest me ill wait  months to see if its a steaming pile like this one isthanks for nothingi guess all it takes to sell millions of copies of an expensive game is a huge ad budget and a gimmicky idea
then hold your product in development for several years to build up anticipation and slap some nasty copyright software onto it so that people think that youve developed something worth protectingtoo bad they didnt spend as much time trying to make a game worth stealing as they spent on protecting what they madethis product is fort knox with a pile of pig crap in it
sure glad that pig crap is hard to get tospore is like a delicious sandwich wrapped in broken glassits not worth getting past the flawed packaging to get thewonderful contentno internet access
sucks to be youdont live in the us
sucks againthese people seriously seem to be driving peoplewho want to buy their product to piracy plain and simple
incredibly worthless and complex drm that ruins thepoint of owning the game
content has been dumbed down to sims  levelswhere you can do no wrong and requires no skills to doanything meaningfulthe game is too simple
they took a great idea and dumbed it down to expand their customer base
and most importantly the game is full of bugs and glitches that make this game almost unplayable
for example two of my saves have somehow been corrupted and ive lost about  hours of gameplay
ea claims its not a bug that its somehow my fault
yet if you check out the spore forums you can see that people are experiencing the same thing
i wouldnt touch this game until theyve released at least  patchesplayed the game at a friends house really cool stuff but i refuse to pay for it until the rootkits and malware invasions of privacy that is securom is removed for goodi was excited by this game until i actually played it
i got this as a download as a christmas gift and was surprised that i was limited to only a few months of being able to download it or i could pay an additional fee for a longer download window
luckily i didnt waste money on that additional time
the first stage is like pacman the second stage really isnt much better the third stage is a boring rts game with no strategy and finally the fourth stage has some neat ideas but its essentially like playing a very dumbed down version of civilizationtheres no real creature interactions and most disappointingly of all there is nothing even remotely resembling evolutionary mechanisms
overall really boring really disappointing and really overhypeddrm makes buying this game the equivalent to a rental but without the rental priceonce this game gets below  it might be worth putting up with it but until then nothe game is so so i found it fun when i played it but after i got used to it and found myself not playing it anymore i wanted to sell iti didnow i am going to get low ratings and or put some poor buyer through uneccissary crap because i have to get a return and they dont get to play the game unless i give my ea account username and password
ea should be ashamed
i sould be able to resell a game i buy from them
i will never buy another game from anyone game company that tries to use drm or this rediculas registeration stuntthe game itself is fun but playing it will make me madd nowif i ever play it at all againa digital rights management that allows a total of three installations
well you can install the game but you cant play it until you activate it online and you can only do this three times
after that the game is worthless
even if you change anything in your computer like say adding a new video card to improve your system performance this thing will demand to be activated again
id actually prefer securom over this or to register online every ten days that was the original plan
i will be returning this game and if i see the ea games logo on a game from now on i will not be purchasing it
i hope electronic arts rotsplain and simple
i will not buy this game as long as the drm is part of the deal
i am not a criminal
i will not be treated like one to play a gamei want to throw my hat in with the other folks who are upset about drmive followed spore throughout its development and not only that but ive followed maxis for odd years since i was 
and played everything from simcity to simant to the sims
after seeing the spore reviews and what they had accomplished again making a fantastic software toy i knew i wanted to experience itunfortunately it has drm copy protection which i would not have realized had i not visited this specific page and seen the hoopla
i was hoping that after the mass effect debacle with drm they would certainly not include it in spore
sadly it is included and yes we will continue to be ticked offi want us to send a clear message to ea
we do not support draconian to borrow from another reviewer copy protection
it ruined mass effect for me when i had to install it multiple times due to hardware issues
before that i didnt know or care what drm was but when it became a huge problem and i had to meander through extremely slow ea tech support i found out drms features and i swore id never buy another game from ea
i have relented and purchased other ea games since on consoles but i will not buy a game with drm copy protectionwhich sucks
a lot
spore is something i really want to try and its killing me since ive been with maxis forever but drm is a dealbreaker
sorry maxis but your parent companys copy protection is too much for me to abidethe drm is so stupid its a shame because this could have been a fun game
we need to make sure ea knows that the terms of their ridiculous drm is not acceptable
the game you pay  for has no resale value because its useless to anyone else you are just renting the gamethis a review of spore keep readingwill write has quit ea
lt id like to congratulated him
im sure he turned down lots of money and the security of having a job at the evil megacorporation
sadly he must leave maxis behind the company he cofounded
he has a new company that he founded before leaving ea the stupid fun club
he joins ron carmel  kyle gabler as brave individuals who refuse to submit to the beast
im sure his decision has a lot to do with the egest that ea pumped into his creation spore
but hes being cautious and has announced his intention to keep a working relationship with ea
visit his new site lt and show your support
personally i will be supporting him by buying anything he does without eas involvementso to summarize my perfect reviewspore is infected with drm its creator quit his jobim a software engineer by profession and i have no choice to upgrade and reformat my computer several times a year which means id hit my x install count in a few months easyim curious what makes companies think they have the right to limit software installs
eula
fine
but from the looks of the review count this one is getting i can only imagine they are losing a whole helluva lot more revenue from legitimate purchasers than the whole of the pirates out therei do have a question for ea though  when your game disc becomes a coaster are you going to limit the number of drinks the buyer can set on it before disabling that feature as welli was looking forward to this game for years but choose to not purchase it as a means of supporting the protesters
drm is an invasion of privacy and a violation of consumer rights
if the drm is removed or if spore is released for consoles then i may purchase iti too was excited about spore until i heard about the drm
thats a dealbreakeranother potential buyer turned away because of this
piracy is a big issue that does need a different approach i believe but this is definitely a one step forward two giant leaps backwards approach towards solving the problemthis product sets a dangerous precedent for broken unusable software
installing drm protection makes this game a rental not a purchase
with all the updates that modern computers go through this game will need to be adjusted repeatedly every time windows os is updatedits well within a publishers rights to attempt to protect their intellectual property from piracy but you have to look at the method being usedsecurom potentially opens a paying customers computer to being damaged
there is no reason for a game publisher to put their paying audience at risk simply because they want to protect their rightstheres an old saying  the right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose
by engaging securom ea is extending their right into space where they have no business being ie
telling me how many times i can install a game that i bought
tell ea and securom that you arent going to play their game and go buy something else
you might want to look at galactic civilizations ii a game with absolutely no drm at all and yet it sells hundreds of thousands of copiesi figured it would be fun for me and perfect for my non hard core gaming wife
then i heard about the horrid drm
ea lost a sale i wont pirate it because i dont believe in pirating gamesbut i wont buy iteverim not buying any more games with digital rights management or drm
ive had nothing but problems with securom
we need to stop buying things that have copy protection
then the companies will stop using it
simpleafter installing spore i was surprised to find that i can only install the application three times
i am a software developer so i quite often have windows issues that require i reinstall the operating system
further i like to swap between my desktop and my laptop to play games
this really sucks ea
if they would allow me a refund i would use it
oh the game play is a little dissapointing and a little to easy to beat
to much empahasis on design and not enough on actual gameplayhuge shame i had such high anticipation for this game
i was screwed with mass effect having been given no notice about this  activation limit i had hoped there would be some common sense from ea
glad i kept a careful eye on the forums in time to cancel my preorder
sorry maxis your a good company stuck with a lousy publisheri dont understand how all the five star reviews were written months before the game actually came out
one review was written  months ago
is it me or are the reviews highly suspect
the game came out sept  so having a five star review from so long ago is an indication of gross corporate manipulation
buy at your own riskthere is no point in renting this game from ea
they allow you to play for only as long as they deem necessary on whatever computers they let you play it on
sorry charlie i have a main computer game box a travel laptop and this type of game would have been nice for business trips and my kid has his own as does my wife
generally anybody that wants to play a game just takes the disk to their computer and plays
no chance with spore the only alternative is to get an undrmd version and if it gets to that point why bother
whats next madden will only let you play it on a single xboxs without calling ea with your mothers maiden namethe same thing happened a few years ago with tax software i switched and have never gone back
that is years of profit the nondrmd guys have been getting and will continue to get for as long as i use tax softwaredont mess with the customers we have long memories and never forgive being treated like criminals
there is always a competitor that will treat customers with respectthis game is destined for the bargain bin and then ea will stop supporting it and you wont be able to install it on a new computer
so dont bother with itthis game and all other ea games coming out from here on out come with at crappy drm securom that will screw up your system and limit the amount of times you can install the game
so if you get a new hard drive video card or any other device then you will be in trouble
let ea know how stupid they arei am up to the civilization stage right now
this game sounded so cool when i heard about it
the notion of evolution is so complex and could make for a really smart engaging game
unfortunately this game is just too simple and is comprised of monotonous mouse clicks and very little thinking
i dont see how it is replayable for an adult
you can just do the same thing everytime
i think kids however would enjoy this gameive played an aggressive game
im not sure what the herbivorefriendly gameplay is like but when you do combat you run around and click a button to attack enemies who are lower ranked than you
if they are higher ranked you avoid them
it actually reminded me slightly of world of warcraft you run around with the camera behind you and click buttons for corresponding attacks
the grind of killing x number of enemies is the worst part of wow and is featured in this game in an even more boring less thoughtrequired way
for all the talk of the great graphics in spore from people i have to say i dont see it
the landscapes are the same all over and not very detailedwhen it comes to evolving calling it evolution is deceiving
evolving means existing characteristics should change a little to give you more abilities based on the abilities you need
in this game you can scrap everything about your creature and start from scratch everytime it evolves
theres not any strategy planning ahead needed
it can have six legs or two doesnt matter
it just comes down to the stats associated with each attribute
evolution if i understand science should arise out of outside forces changes in the geography weather enemies species etc
you can just do whatever you want in this game willy nilly with no consequencein tribal mode you just collect food make babies and then attack neighboring tribes
it really requires zero thought
your enemies arent very bright and theres not much you need to keep track of other than foodi think the overall concept for the game is great but the execution just isnt there
i think will wright and ea focus too much on making simple games that anyone can play without much of a learning curve
this is a problem
a game that requires no learning curve requires no thought and will get old quickly
a game like civilization  is probably downright overwhelming for a new player but i dont think youll find a more addictive replayable game
will wright and ea seem to want their games to be easy simple as brick breaker  well im not paying  to play brick breaker and unless im waiting in a doctors office playing on my phone im not going to replay brick breaker for weeks months or years
spore is stale within a day
the sims was another great concept and was an alright game but lacked the depth and complexity to make it a truly great game
simcity could have so many layers and levels of engagement
i dont know why ea and will wright are so reluctant to make these games all they could beoh and about the drm issue everyone whines about you can download this game illegally and be playing within a couple hours depending on your download speeds
theres no point in trying to prevent piracy
you can get the sims  and simcity  illegally too
i promise
these companies just shoot themselves in the footmy husband  kids were looking forward to getting spore as a christmas present
unfortunately due to the invasive nature of the latest securom we wont be buying
i see no point in being required to connect to the internet to play a computer game that isnt played online besides the kids gaming computer is not connected to the internetim not at all happy that ea continues to force this drm on us when according to articles it hasnt done much to stop the software pirates
all it does is punish the paying customer
so ill find my family a game that isnt so draconian with its copyright protection software
the same goes for sims  ive been a long time sims fan but if it has this garbage on it im not touching iti received this game as a gift
i was excited by all the hype of course as i am an avid fan of the sims simcity and civilization
yet when playing this game it fails so badly that i feel like my gifter was ripped off
i dont have the heart to tell her though
basically the game touches on a fantastic concept evolving from a singlecelled organism into a mighty interplanetary race or civilization of a species that you created
while i dont believe in evolution theory at all the game concept was presented in a sound enough manner that the game should have been totally fun
customization for example is my middle nameplaying the game it bites
there is no truly evolutionary concept here as your creatures are in no way evolving to their surroundings
now this surprisingly enables some freedom in customization which i appreciated but eventually the decisions i made were meaningless as the attributes i gave to my species were just for craps and giggles and not any utilitarian purpose which is at the core of evolution theorygranted i did not expect this game to be charles darwins video game version of the origin of the species but when customizing your creatures is more for appearances well that is only half the fun not a lot of challenge thoughthe developmental aspects of the game  progressing from the bottom of the food chain so to speak to the civilization and intergalactic phase  is pretty cool though the five stages are really not about much except your willingness to see them through
that is sure you can customize your creations to look and act how you want them to but at some point you will want to start over as it were and recolonize
in doing so you will face the same limitations to customization none of which applying to true evolutionary models and meaningless applicationbesides all that the graphics are pretty decent in a cartoony way
they aid in your understanding of what is going on and sometimes there are cool things to watch  for example the combat scenarios and the starship configurations
but nevertheless there is no sense of a meaningful end  the means are just too watered down to garner significance in your creationslastly the drm registration deal
let me just say this from my experience i have had to install every game that i own at least three times in my life between hard drive crashes space considerations errors in installation the game not working right the first time around and some incidental thing that is bound to happen it is exceedingly unfair and burdenful if that is even a word to expect customers to go through the bureaucracy of trying to install their game for a gasp
fourth time because of this stupid drm system
the worst part of it all is the price factor  you might have to pay another license fee on top of the one you are spending right now to get the game in the first place to install it again
and if you mess up or something stupid happens you get to contact ea again and explain your situationin the end spore is not worth your time or investment as ea is looking to protect against piracy in a rather unusual way and the game is not even that spectacular
in the long run the games that you already have are worth playing some more sims civ simcity etc
crazy how the older appears to better no
thats what happens when a strong company like ea wants to bilk its audience customers for all they are worth simply because they expect fan loyalty to allow them to do this
i say pass on spore both for quality and integrity issues
buy a better game for  the pricei was looking forward to this game being released
but thanks to all the information here in the reviews and elsewhere i will not be buying this game
the drm is a dealkiller for me
i play games over and over and play games that are  years old regularly
i am running into more games that i cant play my legally bought copies of anymore because of exactly this kind of drm
dont fall for it
the only way to play spore in the future will be with an illegal copy
because the copy protection will cease to be supported or the next os you use will rightfully block itbeen playing spore all day
the game is fun as hell and offers an interesting perspective of creation vs evolution
characters created can vary from being cute lil fuzzy dudes youd find on a saturday morning cartoon to monstrosities that put the creatures in the mist to shame
its a shame that you cant actually own this game
its one hell of an expensive rental and thats it
youre going to spend around  for a game that you dont even own
i cant in good conscience recommend anyone buying this game other then to try it out
youll get hooked but then oppsie you dont really own the game
its a damn shame how ea ruined this fantastic game by tying it the the albatross known as drm
digital restrictions managment as id like to call it
the sad part is its mostly intelligent people who shop here at amazon and we already know how diseased this game is with performance stealing viruslike drm
if you dont mind infecting your computer with drm and spend a good chunk of money on what is essentially a rental then buy this game
but if you want to see corrupt anticonsumer practices like infecting good software with drm that could potentially harm your machine then avoid this game and wait till ea releases a drmfree version
if enough people avoid this game and let it be known that we paying customers are not criminals that want to have our computers infected with viruslike drm  then hopefully when sims  comes out i could buy it with out infecting my computer
now if you can excuse me i have to uninstall this game and hopefully get rid of the drm infectionthis might not be a bad game but i will not buy something i can only install  times
would you buy a cd you can only put in your cd player  timesgood the graphics are great and the game is very originalbad the gameplay isnt really that great and youre paying a lot of money for not really owning the game
even if you enjoy this game it just doesnt make any sense to buy it because of drm
if you do install it despite of the warnings you will have a less secure and less stable computer
might as well wait for either the console version or ea reversing their positionto be reasonable i dont mind as much if ea checks for ownership when youre downloading new stuff such as updates or new content but this is just ridiculousmy oh mywhere to start
well i think i will skip the horrendous drm and go straight to the content
this game was supposed to be  original
visionary
enlightening
yes we all saw the trailers for the past  years and oohed and awed at the marvelous ingenuity of will wrights masterpieceor is it
after playing a few stages into the game it suddenly dawned on me that my thought processes swirling around in my brain became less and less complex
in short you dont have to actually think when you are playing this game
it is almost akin to playing one of reflexives simplified casual games for the masses read sheeple
the problem with that is it leaves most hardcore players like myself disappointed and feeling ripped off
im what you would call a veteran gamer
my top tier games are fallout planescape fear red alert world in conflictyou know games where you actually have to possess some residue of brain activity to progress in the game
not so with spore
i found myself quoting mae west after the first stageis that all
pretty bacterial graphics that go snap crackle popbut devoid of depth and substance
a great epic evolving storyline
forget itpart of the problem i suspect is that will wright has gotten too comfortable with the suits at ea
he will make millions regardless so there is less incentive for him to innovate vista anyone
by the second stage of the game i actually found myself wondering why the appeal of casual games was so widespread
it is because you dont have to think for yourself
its a wham bam thank you mam ideology
all in the space of about  minutes to an hour the first bacterial stage took less time than this to finishand the drm
i for one am somewhat relieved our new draconian reptilian masters are so obviously detectable without ever buying anything
just go to amazon and search for drm and youd come up with spore bioshock or mass effect
their blatantly galactically obvious attempt at subduing all of us is apparent even to  year olds who when seeing securom on the box or anywhere in the amazon reviews may send them screaming from the storesite
it is good that securom is now a recognized name albeit negative in the biz
sort of akin to antichrist
not everyone knows the history behind the wordbut everyone knows it aint goodthis game has interesting artwork but it really is not very accurate to call this a gamecalling it a toybox is about rightoverall it provided me of about  hours of timewasting style gameplay that i usually get from free flash game sitesi am very disappointed at having to pay  bucks for this gameim not buying this game until the drm copy protection is removed
i have played it on a freinds computer and would like to buy it
i do not pirate games i have never downloaded one online
i cannot understand though how ea punishes people like me who actually pay for their games by making it inconvenient to enjoy the game for years with this schemei will buy the sims when it comes out supposedly wont have this copy protection
i would buy spore and red alert  but only if they remove this overly aggressive copy protectionafter all the hype spores only purpose is to play dress up the doll and give that doll limited choices and minigames to play through
the only reason this game isnt a complete bust is because my  year old cousin likes to play this game when she comes over and its clean for heri had been looking forward to this game but the drm limits you to three installs so its really just a rental
i refuse to try to get through to ea on the telephone to beg them to let me install a game i paid  forgood luck with that suckers
im gonna have to pass until this issue is fixedi have tried to play this game
the most i have managed to play was maybe two hours and then the game will crash and all progress is lost
this happend to me  times in one daythe loading process is very slow and i have never seen a do you want to continue were the game crashed message
very frustratingthe new parts that you can use to upgrade your creature can get very monotonous many parts have the same characteristics and only a very slightly difference en in appereancegraphics quality seems to be  or  years old
very frustrating after all the expectationthe game is son unreliable to play that is not even good to give to someone as a giftdont buy this terrible gamei have been looking forward to this game for years and i would have bought it even with the mediocre gameplay simply because i understand how people can be disappointed in a game after hearing so much hype
however like so many others i will not submit to these asinine drm schemes anymore
im done
i was done after trying to help a friend get bioshock installed and running last yearim not going to go pirate spore but i can certainly understand why some people would  its just less hassle
ea and all other publishers that insist on these insane drm schemes need to wake up and smell the coffee
people are just getting tired of dealing with it and it is really starting to hurt the pc gaming scene
i dont mind having to have an original disc in the drive to play  that is the accepted standard in my mind
why go any further than thatyou know what its bad enough to be treated like a child when i install the stupid thing
but the other users on my xp machine you know when you switch to different people on your computer cant use the online at all
what in the world
the drm ruins the gamei would have given it  stars for being a subaverage game
but the drm just kicked it down to  you spend around  minutes playing a little pointless minigame then you get on land where you wander around without a real sense of directionthe game tries to be an rts and rpg at the same time and brutally fails at bothit really should say on the pagethis game had alot of potential
its too bad its been drm crippled and dumbed downyou get to create monsters and do simple missions
big whoop
i get more action out of a zynga gamethis game has harshstrict drm that is invasive to your computer
its a serious turn off to deal with it just to try to play a dang video game
especially the fact that you can only install the game a few times
what the hell is that
like someone else said you dont buy this game you rent it  and it leaves software on your machine that you cant uninstall through conventional meanswait to buy this for whenif they release a version without all the hassle to ownok i must mention the drm stuff is crap
this will be the last game i buy from ea until this is stoppedbeyond that the game itself is pretty lame and lacking
nothing you really do seems to effect the creature you create beyond the way you make it look and that gets kind of boring after the first  times you do it
i do not know perhaps i am missing something but spending hours on end pulling tugging pushing on body parts to change then and paint a creature just isnt that exciting to me
i was expecting more involvement from the creatures in the world around you
here all you do is befriend them which consist of you pushing a sing charm or pose button to mimic the other creature until it likes you
there is no other real interaction beyond that
on the other hand if you choose not to befriend them then you can kill off another species which is almost as lame a befriending them with its interaction
this game is pretty lacking in general when it comes to the level of interaction with the worldworlds
even within you own species there is little to no interaction
i just dont get it
again the only real point i see to the game at all is designing and painting a creature and the novelty of that wears of after the couple of hourssave your money on this one and just download the creature creator if your so hell bent on making your own little creature as this game is pretty much a waste of moneygame looks incredibly fun
i was very excited to purchase it
unfortunately this is the latest in a series of games that ea is ruining with an insidious piece of drm software that limits you to three installations and screws up your computerpirates will steal ea
you cannot prevent it
what you can prevent however is alienating potential customers by treating them like crooks and shackling your games with tyrannical programs
and i will not buy this game until this game is rereleased without the drmlunacynot a great game too much of a mishmosh of different ideas  that get old quickly
think mini gameson the plus side it is will wright the concept and graphics are very interesting
cool random moments of strangeness
its something differentnewon the negative side its an ea game drm  you dont completely own the game you payed for  you may need to ask for eas permission to install the game
not much replay value
if you dont like some tedious aspects of realtime strategy games then this game will have even less replay valuein summary  ea put their miserable stink on spore buyer beware
would have been a great  game supported by ingame advertising or somethingtheres nothing else to say about drm that hasnt already been said
i hate it dont want it and will refuse to buy any game that has this level of invasive consumer hurting malwarei should mention that i dont own this game i played it at a friends house
i will not buy a copy because  the game play is pretty boring  the concept has been dumbeddown to the level where this is a game for  year olds and  the draconian drmnow on to the review
im always loved maxis games and own all of the sim city games going back to the original for nintendo
i also own the sims the sims ii and enjoyed them quite a bit
so i was really looking forward to this game and have tracked its progress for nearly two yearsi was excited about the concept and watching as my genetic children grew to take over the universesadly most of what was most exciting about that original concept has been stripped from the game
now as other have mentioned adding more legs doesnt increase speed more than a better  foot
many of the genetic options are selfexcluding because why would you pick an inferior body part even if it looked cool knowing it would make your creatures ultimately inferiorthe game play is tiresome and monotonous
i got bored at the begining and then the space stage is nearly unplayable
it is so boring i find myself wishing it were more like stelcond a game that is almost  years old
seriously if they wanted to add rts elements to the game they should have made it more challenging and less user intensive to manage every little thingthis game is a big piece of fail on so many levels
hate it because of the drm or hate it because it is dumbeddown or hate it because it isnt very fun to playwhy ea and other game companies believe that treating all their customers like criminals and installing lowlevel nanny programs that are hard to install in their customers pcs is beyond me
the people who steal games will steal games this only serves to annoy and drive away legitimate honest customers
like me
sorry ea would have liked to play spore but there are plenty of other games out there that dont treat me like a criminal or limit my resale options
thanks but no thankswhy would you buy a game for  that you can install on your computer for a total of  times
then if you reach that limit you have to call ea and they decide if you will get activation or not
i dont know about you but i like going back and playing games that i enjoyed from years ago
would this game still work or do i have to pay for another copy of the gamedrm system wasnt created to stop pirating it was created for renting games to customers
remember ea isnt obligated to grant you any extra activations or support activations years down the road so if you want to play that game down the road tough luck
drm is the down fall of pc gamingspore is a great example of what happens when game developers and publishers start overhyping a game too early in the development cycle
a lot of people saw the videos and gameplay movies from various outlets for the past couple of years and to say that the final product has been streamlined is a large understatementdespite how the game is being marketed you do not actually take a singlecelled spore and follow it through evolution to an intergalactic species
you actually play five separate simple minigames each preceded by a creative design stage
you design a cellular creature then play a pacmanflw game
you design a creature then play a hybrid rhythmevasion game
you design another creature then play a sims social game
you design buildings and vehicles then play a very simplistic realtime strategy game
finally you design a spaceship and play a very bad space action game
each of these minigames are very repetitive and boringif you allow your game to connect to the sporepedia your universe will be stocked with random creatures and tribes that other users have made
this aspect is pretty neat
it can be fun to see your buddys eightlegged walrusarous trying to eat your little guys
unfortunately thats about the extent of the multiplayer since you dont actually get to visit other peoples games
you just share assetsalthough we were told that spore would be a sandbox of cool usercreated content ea apparently forgot to add the sand
at no point are you afforded the opportunity to fool around and experiment
you are herded through the games activities and there is no room for deviationto add insult to injury ea decided to add some of the most draconian and userunfriendly drm ever seen in a pc game
you only get three installs over the lifetime of the product
three
as it stands right now the torrents are filled with illegal copies of this game so this drm will only impact legitimate users
great job eawhen i purchased a new laptop for my wife a few months ago i knew she was very interested in this game so i made sure that i bought one that would run itafter looking into it more i realized the drm problem and explained it to her to make sure she still wanted it
even to someone who doesnt think about things like drm the idea of limiting the number of times you can install a cd that you bought turned her away from the gamesorry ea you lost another customer
all we wanted to do was give you some hard earned money and enjoy your game but we refuse to be treated as criminals in the processby the way kudos to amazon for keeping these up and showing ea what their customers really think i definitely will keep shopping at amazonthe game has been just released
but i am not going to buy it
i used to a have a standing preorder but not anymore that has been long canceled
i gave ea a chance to mend its ways but it failed
here is whythis is a warning review
warning of the dangers of the harbored digital rights management drm subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game
this type of drm securom xx with limited installations is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games bioshock  mass effect
so my review is based on firsthand experience of a core aspect of the gameapparently ea would rather keep its customers in the dark
that is why in the past month ea forums got censored wikipedia entries selectively edited and amazon reviews repeatedly deleted
what is worse amazon possibly without knowing it is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoopwarelimited installs
yes limited installs
we only get to ride this shiny pony for laps
the official announcement mentions on  different computers but avoids to clarify what a different computer makes will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token
what about attaching a new harddrive internal or external or adding a new user account
all the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from bioshock or mass effect  and ea has intentionally left this area dark graymoreover in order to enforce the limited installations exactly like bioshock there will be irremovable folders placed in our systems root that will effectively revoke our administrator rights to our own pcs
short of reformatting there is no deleting them even if logged in as administratorsis ea trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where pc gaming will be a continuouslybilled service such as directpay tv and not a productis ea trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the payperplay cliff where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and yearsis the company trying to turn our pc systems that we bought and paid for into their proprietary consoles hence monstrosities such as securom that offer zero antipiracy protectionaccording to statements by their own spokespersons such as john riccitiello ceo of ea the answer to all of the above question is yes
however i want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game
the game has enough troubles as it isis it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics
how about its instability and bugs
how about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a  months
you see how this is goingin the end after all is said with spore it boils down to this who will actually be owning my copy
are we to pay  only torent this from its publisher be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in dangerand what makes this even harder to understand will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy
of course not
they did not work for similarly drmplagued bioshock or mass effect why should they start working nowso one has to ask what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product
will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expiresis this the solution that ea executives came up against piracy since they cannot stop piracy lets make all our paying customers pay twice to make up for their million dollar bonuses
no thanks
no game is worth such harassmenti dont understand where ea went wrong
it was once the underdog and now is the overlord after ea closed the chicago site for a cheaper indiachina location i will be all too happy to see them go under
why
because the main reason for games is to relieve me of daily stress and not be the cause of ittoo bad i will miss out on a great game and ea will miss out on some cashdrm notthis game is way too easy and way too simple and way too boring
its for babies or soccer momsthe only way companies like ea are going to be made to understand that this kind of draconian drm is unacceptable is if people simply refuse to buy games that include it
 installs for  its the most expensive video game rental ive ever seen
not only that but this insane copy protection scheme did nothing to prevent the game from being cracked before it was even released in this country
in other words the only people this scheme is punishing are legitimate buyers while the pirates get to play the game hassle free
if like me you think thats absurd refrain from buying this game until ea comes to their senseslook even if this game didnt have the securom and install limits which reduce your purchase to a mere rental the fact is it isnt fun
i unknowingly installed this on my laptop on day one excited about all the promises made to me by ea
i thought this would be on the verge of an mmo with other people to interact with and the ability to create planets and customize terrain plants animals and the weather
boy was i wrong
you get  skimpy minigames that could have been put into separate flash web based games
instead you rent them for  bucks
absolutely horrible value and without a doubt the biggest disappointment i have ever had with any purchase ever
i plan on throwing it out as soon as im done grimacing with disgust at the packaging
ea said one thing and delivered another and ill never forget that
i am not buying any ea games ever again until they remove securom and the limited installsdrm with activation limits has nothing at all to do with piracy
the game was already pirated days ago before it was released in the uk or america
they are using limited activations to prevent second hand sales and to limit the lifetime of the game
you will perpetually require an activation server to be running all the time if you want to install this game in a few years time
the drm is also the beginnings of forcing games to become a rental revenue model as per the wishes of electronic arts own ceo john riccitiello who wants us all to buy bare bones games in the future and pay for all the content as extras
see securom has already been prosecuted for using similar drm technology in the music industry
the drm that ea is using in spore is unlawfulyou can read the ftc ruling here spore was suppose to be about evolving your creature not putting a million legs on it for the hell of it
i dont want to design my creature by slapping stuff on it
i want to design it by evolving it a specific way to get that trait
disappointedand lets not even talk about the drm  drm is too much to pay when the game is only a rental after the drm
 would be an acceptable pricetwo years ago when i looked at this game i thought it would be a decent fun game and it would be worth paying  dollars for
unfortunately it isnt decent it isnt fun and its really not even paying  bucks for
thats how bad it is
to sum up what this game is its just a bunch of depthless minigames that take about thirty minutes each to beat until that is you get to the space stage
the first phase cell phase is the only semifun one of course its probably the most dumbed down of all phases
this phase only takes a few minutes to beat
the creature phase can take a long time depending on whether you befriend or attack everything
this phase is aggravating and boringthe tribal phase is so easy that it can only take you around  minutes to beat
in this phase youre pretty much forced to ally with the other tribes as using warfare takes forever and gets you nowhere
once you get past the tribal phase its time for the civilization phase which is more or less the same as the tribal phase only its a lot easier to kill everyone
in this phase your people develope so quickly its unrealistic they get vehicles right after the tribal phase and soon after develope ships and warplanes
ultimately this phase is the second most frustratingthe space phase is the last and worst phase
if you dont ally with at least one major empire youre screwed for lack of a better word
of course youre forced to go stop ecodisasters and stop pirates and for whatever reason they cant do it themselves
the best items cost a ridiculous amount of sporebucksthe currency in spore and it can take hours to get enough money just to get the planet buster and you can only use it once before you buy another oneafter a while youll get used to killing pirates and stopping ecodisasters and defeating the groxthe cheesy borglike ratvillains of the game
your main goal later on is to get to the center of the universe
youll find that most of the races in the universe sound the same and that some even look the same that being said it makes it feel like theres no variety in races which there isnt much of
its almost painful to reach the center of the universe
you have to not only defeat the grox but you have to beat the other hostile empires
this took me around  days for me to do and that was to only get near the center of the universe
thats  days wastedto sum it all up this game is a dumbeddown boring piece of trash that was so overhyped that in order to avoid a tide of hate mail places like gamespot gave it a positive review to save their buttsi beg fellow gamers to either not buy this game or pirate it
the game is not worth  or even  dollars and the fact that theres a draconian drm attached makes it even worse you can only install the game  times on a computer
that means that if your computer loses all of its data  times or you want to install it on  computers youll have to call ea customer support in order to get an extra install
ea games treats its customers like criminals
theyve tightened their grip so much that this game is becoming the most pirated game of all time
id bet if nasa knew that this game would be this bad they wouldnt shown iti say it again do not buy this game
dont waste your time money or sanity trying to play or buy this game and if you absolutely must have it then pirate it
they thoroughly deserve it
its pretty much a bunch of stupid minigames with a draconian drm attachedsupporting this game is like supporting the idea that ea thinks youre stupid
i have heard that will wright and ea said they did not want a   rated quality game like half life but a  rated game like the sims
so basically they assume you want dumbed down content
theyre saying youre stupidinstalled on my toshiba satellite a  runs fine on medium graphic settings
i really wish i had a better laptop
i gave up on pc games a few years ago and play almost exclusivly on the xbox  but this is good enough to kill time out and aboutthis is a fun game
although i wish this was more like a mmo and not just single player
or at least give the option to play single player or mmo that would be awesome
i understand to set up and maintain those servers cost alot but this is ea maby in the future few months later
updated to version  auto update
game files now corrupt
uninstalled reinstalled followed steps from spore website and spore msg boards to fix no luck
game is ruined on my hard drive cant play anymore
been going around in circles trying to get this to work with no luck
no tech support from spore
i gave up on it now have a game i cant play
windows vista premiumfew years later  i have bought over the past couple of years  new more powerful laptops and the game still wont run
on the newer laptop the game wont up from one civilization to another
also appears ea has giving up on the game
login servers no longer respond
dead links on spore website
complete failure after just  years
all these bad reviews cant be wrongi never write a review without extensive first hand knowledge and use of a product but im making a special exemption for spore
this game went from one of the titles i anticipated most on pc to a title that im avoiding altogether
why
digital rights management aka drm
specifically the type of drm that electronic arts has decided to include with this gamethe drm known as securom will only punish actual customers by enforcing a totalitarian online verification
why
because this so called antipiracy drm was already cracked days before the game even hit store shelves
proof positive that enforcing this type of rigid drm only affects legitimate customersin addition to verifying your copy of the game every time you take it online youll also be limited to  installs
thats  installations over the entire life of the game
anything over that and youll be on the phone calling ea begging for a new code
thanks but no thankslike most here
its this simple
this game will not be a purchase at all with the drm it has in it
i was so set to buy it too but i will not knowing that ea decided to go with the worst of the worst for copy protectionas it has been put this game is for rentfor drm in the form of the horrendous securom absolutely ruined the game and they lost  sales to my familyi will not purchase any game with securom or any game with an installation limit
it doesnt matter
if i legally purchase the game i can legally install it one million times if i so chooseall game reviews need a new section called drm
it can go with grapicsgameplysoundoriginality
but the thing isa perfect  in the other categories and a  in drm means a  overallthis game is a dud
a zero
i hope it is the most pirated game ever and ea loses their arse on it
they deserve nothing less than a fiascothis could have been a great game but was really hurt by an absolutely ridiculous drm scheme not to mention it doesnt come close to living up to the hype that surrounded itthe most important thing to look at here is i have no intention of shelling out  for what is basically a rental
if the activation servers have a problem or if i upgrade my computer to much or reformat it im in troublei am glad we are sending a message to ea and letting them know were not going to take this
we gamers deserve a company that doesnt treat us like thieves
hopefully the awareness we are raising about this drm issue will let them know how serious we are about thisi looked forward to this game for a long long time
lots of my friends did as well
were not going to support ea however by buying it while they continue to treat us like thisthis game requires an internet connection to play
unfortunately my computer doesnt have one
another  coasterwhen i start the game a window pops up and it says the game cannot start
the game needs access to the internet to verify ownership of this game
please ensure that your computer is online and try againi played with the creature creator a bit and had a good time
i long ago preordered spore and have not had time to look further into the game as it approaches release
when i finally did a few days ago i discovered that they are implementing the absurd securom drmi have no interest in paying full price for a game that i will be severely restricted from being able to play at a later point
presuming installation is flawless the current restriction to three installs is something any user will exceed long before their interest in the game doesin my situation i would be installing it on my desktop and my laptop
i would only ever be playing one of these systems at a time so there would be no violation of the ridiculous eula most products have
only one instance would ever be operated simultaneously and only by me the owner well renter as ea and securom would have it
this would mean that as soon as i ever had to reinstall an os on my desktop or laptop id be screwed out of the game unless i wanted to buy it again for full price and what happens if you want to enjoy the game a few years down the road and reinstall itthink about that for a minute
even if you never upgrade your hardware or buy a new computer or use a different computer  how often presuming youre using windows of course do you reinstall your operating system
and each time you have to reinstall the game
if youre an xp user youll probably install the game
then youll upgrade to vista
thatll be another install
two down one to go
then you may need to reinstall vista from scratch for any number of miserable reasons
and that will be your third strike
you better hope that you never ever need to change or adjust that system for any reason if you like sporeimagine applying this to other products
what if you could only watch purchased dvds on one specific dvd player and once youve played it on that system you could never play them on another one
no lending them to your friends
no buying a new player
no watching it on your payer in different rooms
no selling your used dvds
and if your player dies and you buy a new one youll have to repurchase the movie
wouldnt that be silly
perfectly good content that you have physically sitting in your hand that you paid handily for and have every right to own and use only you dont own it and cant use iti only wish i had known this sooner
it is already in the process of being shipped so i cant cancel the order
once it arrives you better believe im going to hand it right back to the ups driver and tell him i refuse to accept deliverythis is truly unfortunate
im a fan of will wright even if some of his more recent games have not been geared toward the traditional simulation or sim city fan and have been aimed more at the decorate a bedroom and play house crowd
id love to give wright my support
but ea is making that impossible with this ridiculous scheme
im not a thief
dont treat me like onei have been looking forward to the release of spore for years now
since i discovered ea has implemented drm on this game i refuse to buy it
i hope that ea will realize the mistake they made and rethink their actions for future releases
i cannot buy drm software because i regularly format my hdd because of work and schoolplease dont fall for eas greed
if we pay for a game we should be use it however we want to and reinstall it as many times as we would likethe game would have been fun for me but finding out about its crazy drm has really put a damper on the fun
i am someone who upgrades computer hardware often and in the course of things end up reinstalling my os now and then
if i am limited to  installs what do i do then
call and beg to play each time
somehow i dont think it will be a easy process and like others have said what happens when the product doesnt become a viable thing to support anymore
they will say too bad and want you to buy the greatest hits version they just came out withfor those of you whining about how its unfair for those of us who have not purchased the game and reviewing it for drm have you never heard of peaceful protest
customers refused to tolerate drm on music and it is slowly going away in thanks to sites like amazon who offer drm free downloads for reasonable prices
if customers refuse to purchase a product due to drm then so be it it is our right to do so
i preordered the expanded version of spore and was looking forward to it but cancelled due to the drm flack for the record i read about the drm saga elsewhere about a month ago and cancelled my preorder
i wonder how many sales ea is missing out on due to this problem
from the looks of it i would say they are losing out on a significant amount of money now and every time they release an expansion pack for the game
hope it hits the bottom line hard
maybe they will rethink the drm next time outprocolor graphicsinteresting charactersfast shipping from amazonconsecurity feature
i do not have internet and if i buy the game i should be able to own it not rent it
the game is dumbed down way too much in almost all aspects
it strives to be an rts but fails civ builder but fails etc
etc
it needs to make up its mind what it wants to be in each stage and expand upon it
right now its like just a sample flavor of what that genre is but leaves you desiring a whole lot more
evolution is pointless
also you should see the other animals evolve with you but at each stage they do not carry overid avoid this software like the plague until two things happen the rerelease the software with a patch that eliminates the drm feature the software is discounted to  or lessi was very excited over this game and preordered well before release
the drm policy and limit of  activations kills it though
at this price i dont deserve to be treated like a software pirate
i understand ea wants to limit piracy which can take away a major amount of their profit margin but the drm on this game is just ridiculousi really wanted to buy this game but since hearing about the evil drm in it ive decided against
a shame too since it looks like it would be a really great game
too bad ea had to ruin it with this
their doing the same with the the upcoming red alert  although that game lets you activate  times rather then  no thanks eait is a sad day for gamers everywhere when a company can deny you ownership of a product you have legally purchased just because some arbitrary number of installs has been reached
this isnt just about piracy or me not being able to sharing my cool new game with friends and family this is about every upgrade every new computer purchase i make bringing this game one install closer to an inaccessible piece of drm garbage
it is no longer my property at this point and what was once a highly anticipated game is now nothing but a vehicle for corporate oppressionthis is removed from my preorder list
i refuse to support ea and their draconian software piracy policiessame to valve and take   i do not pirate software and i will stand to be counted by these companiesi may not have purchased this game but after not only looking up videos of the creature creator and seeing gameplay vids in action i have decided that this game is not worth my buying considering it does not live up to the expectation that games like sim city and the sims left me long ago however there is one other problem that many talked about and that was the digital rights management that was implemented in this game
i cannot understand how the creator will wright allowed the limitation to his fans by going along with the three install limit but the biggest issue for me was the simple fact that securom was being used which does not have a good reputation and does not uninstall as well as limiting people to one account only i cannot fully endorse this game because i do not see the genius of will wright with this game i see lost potential in this game and i cannot support something that doesnt live up to its potential any more
i reccommend that people do their research before sinking their money in this gamethe drm scheme is simply unacceptable
it does not stop piracy at all and in fact seems to encourage it en mass
end result is it only tells legitimate consumers that you are sheep and we can fleece you
moreover you will not resale the tile and get any money back
this is simply about control of a product after the initial sale and dont believe otherwiseyou are a renter or a short term subscriber at best only
you did not think you really purchased anything did youi loved simcity and simearth but this title has been picked apart to be monetized as much as possible as well as dumbed down for casual and add people
it is not the magnum opus of wil that we all thought we were getting it is simply a revenue stream builder for the ea portfoliothis is a game rental with a  price tag
 activations is an insult to gamers
the forced online activation was bad enough and relies on existing servers to actually exist and be supported in the future to be able to install your game assuming you have installs left
any promises made my any company to remove these kinds of features in the future or unreliable at best and completely unenforceable
dont buy this game
dont reward this kind of behaviori just got through a massive headache dealing with drm for adobe photoshop cs
ive dealt with massive headaches from drm from civ gold
all of this is on a very high end vista pc
thanks but no thanks
i was excited about the concept of this game for many months
that is until i found out about the drm it uses
i will not buy software with drm ever again particularly if they limit the installs to something ridiculous like update   i just learned that ea limits purchasers to one account per household even though the manual states that multiple accounts may be used per installation
what does that mean
well say you have  people in your house that want to play spore on  different accounts
no problem according to ea games just pony up  for  licensesbut im so tired of ea games treating me like a torrenting pirate
im not too cheap to plunk down  on a title i like
i do however object to a single player game that needs to phone the publishers servers if i install iti upgrade my system at least once a year
will your drm get bent out of shape about that
some of your titles like the sims  are reinstalled for troubleshooting purposes
i know this because ea tech support never met a the sims  problem they couldnt blame on the customer and fix by telling them to completely uninstall and reinstall the productthis never ending cycle of publishers implementing newer nastier drm doesnt phase the pirates
it makes your paying customers wonder why they should continue to pay to have extraneous spyware drm looking over their shouldersome people will become customers of torrent sites instead
and some people will simply talk with their walletsso no soup for you ea
youve made what should have been an enjoyable title stink
challenge everythingi got this game and installed it in great anticipation of its gameplay hype
right off the bat i was getting an error where i had to go in and change the games config file so that it would work
sighi worked my way to the space age and thought that it was a decent enough game
the very first stage where youre floating around eating things to promote your creatures growth was really fun
i only saved the game once in the civilization stage because i had to go do something and come back to the gamei finally get to the space age and the game crashes
i thought it was only because i had been playing the game straight through and it bugged out for some reason
its no big deal right
games always crash
well i log back in to find out the game doesnt have an autosave feature
wowwhat progressively modern game does not have autosave these days
ok i can deal with playing from the civilization stage againas soon as i get into the space stage i savethen whamanother crash
i tried playing the space age many many times and every time about  min into the game it crashes
so i have this game i cant even playlater on i call up my brother to tell him what i thought about the game
he tells me that he cant play it
surely he must be doing something wrong right
nope see he cant get the internet right now where he livesat all
so because of something entirely out of his hands he cant play sporeall because ea came up with this great idea that you have to register onlineon top of all of this business ive read about a number of people who are having even worse drm issues
so if you buy this game its really a roll of the dice
i can play the game fine up to the space agewho knowswow
im so glad i read these reviews before buying this
freaking ea man they dont care about the customer and it seems they delight in tormenting the player
draconian
their system sounds downright satanic
poor will wright
what could have been a legacy and legend in gaming is destroyed by corperate stupidity
heed the warnings of the victims of eas evil
boycott this crap
ive been waiting forever for a game like this and ea killed it before its timeboycott ea
shut them down now before they destroy gaming foreverdrm is ruining media for legitimate customers
when will ea realize this
i along with thousands of others will not buy this game until the drm issue is resolved
by then i am sure there will be better games out anywayspore  starsfirstly im not going to even mention the drm stuff the game just isnt all that great by itself so the drm is nasty but its just icing on the cake and its a rotten worm infested cake at that
the game just takes a great concept user designed content that can interact within the game environment and places it in a horribly executed game world
its almost as if will wright worked on the creature creator and then had some intern to develop the rest of the game an intern who had a love for spinning out clones of older gamesthe first mode is an arcade cell stage
as a small cell you go through finding new evolution pieces for your cell  can be found and use these to make your cell as powerful as you can
in order to advance out of this stage you must eat your way to evolutionary development to do this you can choose three different paths herbivore carnivore or omnivore
to be honest as simple as this mode was it was the most fun out of all the modes of game play available
the reason for this is that the choices you made in regards to where you placed evolution pieces like spikes affect game play because each of the pieces can make your creature more powerful the evolution pieces are not just cosmetic but affect the game world
however the game play quickly becomes boring given the lack of choices for what you can use to enhance your creature leave you waiting to eat enough to get out of the levelthe second mode gives you the ability to control your creature on land as opposed to in the water
you start off with a very minimalistic selection of body parts to use to help design your creature
the thing is they price the evolutionary pieces by dna cost and different skill levels are granted for the higher costing pieces
so if you buy a pair of wings from the lowest category it only gives you glide  while if you spend more and buy the more expensive piece you get glide 
the thing is no matter how you design your creature youre limited to a system thats just about throwing expensive appendages on your critter to get the skills at high levels and not about designing a creature that is best fit in terms of design for the environment
given two creatures of different sizes isnt it safe to assume the big creature would be harder to get lift from a tiny pair of wings if you dont scale them
in spore it doesnt matter since its just a skills game the creature creator is just a fancy way of displaying skill pieces not about crafting a well optimized creaturethis is only worsened by the repetitiveness of the second mode in the second mode you either kill species or make friends with species to get more dna points to evolve
so youll be going from camp to camp doing this over and over again with no alterations in the game play besides this to get out of this stage
as you get more dna and reach checkpoints youre also given the ability to add others of your species into your party but besides that not much else changes
one thing to note about evolving your creature in order to find new pieces to evolve your creature you have to either socialize with other species kill alpha members of species or find pieces on the ground
this is actually one of the few good ideas i think was implemented in this game mode every time you play through you have access to different evolutionary benefits
however when youre just throwing the best pieces together finding some low ranked jaw unless cosmetics are your thing isnt going to help you much so youll have to kill quite a few tribes in order to get decently ranked onesthe third mode places you at the level of a tribe
all the evolutionary work you just did up until now no longer comes into play at all
your tribe is a generic tribe just dressed the way you design in the creature creator and no longer does it matter if you put on the best pieces because they no longer affect anything
the instant i played this i felt as if i were playing a really nerfed version of starcraft mixed with age of empires
you create baby units which grow into adults but are unusable until such zerg eggs from starcraft and gather resources by hunting beasts farming or fishing age of empires
you can place a set number of buildings which cost food money which have technologies such as stone axes or throwing spears to help you build your army
so you build a baby it becomes an adult you have it click on the house and boom you have an axe man
problem is its so simplified and there are only a few types of units that it becomes a thoughtless process which is tedious at best
the maximum units allowed grows with each tribe killed or befriended but it also makes the other tribes grow by exactly the same amount as you did
so instead of a v war you have a v war  it feels exactly the same with a little more fighting
it just feels like a fisherprice real time strategy game for the modei was planning on reviewing the other pieces of the game but i seriously havent found the game to be all that great so far so i dont think ill be spending any more time on it for the foreseeable future
the game definitely delivered something entirely different than people came to expect was being released  its just not all that much fun
if you like watered down games with a cosmetic user created addition then you may like this game but so far i find it to be trivial at best
the creature creator mind you is really cool and the game could definitely been something much greater through the use of species if everything didnt feel so cookie cutter the same all the tribes and species and how they are setup and the evolutionary designs would affect game play besides stat ratings and skills than this would have lived up at least to some of the hypehopefully the ideas behind the creature creator and on the fly design will be implemented in other games to come which perhaps will use the ideas to create a better user experience
if youre going to create a game you have to understand one fundamental thing you have to make it fun
no amount of advertising will help you sell more when word of mouth advertising is butchering you on review sites left and rightone of my friends picked up a copy of spore
i had not really intended to buy any games at the present due to the lack of time to play them with some others on the horizon when i will have time
anyway i got to sit down and play my friends copy on his computer if you must know for a bit
i wont be picking up a copy at initial retail price and here is whyso the game is fun at first
i had a blast with the creature creator and creating things in this game is one of its highlights
the graphics are very pleasing and the creatures themselves are the best part of the game
as others have said the hype and promises of this game over the last few years set up for a big disappointment
i guess i was just hoping for something different
certain stages of the game are too quick
perhaps patches in the future likely purchased addons from looking at the sims will make spore what it should have been from day  but as of now this game just isnt worth full retail price
i bet id get about  gaming days out of it before i was bored
maybe a month of real timethe game of spore would get a  out of  alone
not the best game of the year but definitely not the worst
then again i wasnt a huge fan of the sims either so maybe diehard sims fans will get more enjoymentthere are a multitude of professional review sites that mirror what i am saying
spore could have been and may be in the future a revolutionary game
as it is now it fell shortonto the package as a wholea quick net search will show many articles at reputable sites about the drm in this game
it is exactly the same as mass effect which i experienced first hand and not just on a friends computer
securom installs itself without any warning on the box eula or install prompts
whats more is that it wont uninstall when you uninstall the game
you need to net search to figure out how to get rid of it
securom is there to gather info about your computer to look for hardware changes and then decrement your install limitin addition to the required spyware you have a  activation limit
this may seem okay until you actually look at what triggers an activation
things verified by users and ea themselves that trigger installs include
any hardware change inside your computer
usb hardware changes
change your printer or get external hdtoo bad
formatting your disk
so if securom itself causes issues with old versions of securom which it has been known to do and you need to reinstall windows on the exact same hardware then you use up an activation
putting a copy on your laptop to play on the road
getting a new pcuninstalling the game will not give you activations back like when you deauthorize itunes on a pc
as you can see it can be easy for users to eat up those installs
in the world of pcs you never know when you may get a virus have a hardware failure or just want to upgrade your systemif you do use up the  activations you can call ea and get more
while this may be okay if you get free long distance if you dont or live overseas then expect to pay the full price of the game again just to be able to reinstall
as of now there are no international activation lineslastly spore is a game that people of all ages could enjoy
the issue is that your activation code is locked to an account
so if you install it on your computer all users of that computer need to log into the same account for the online content
people do not get their own world for creature creationso ea locks your key to your account and then limits the number of times you can reactivate the product
they claim on their site that you can install it on multiple computers and not need the cdthey fail to tell you that you cant have multiple accounts
you think they could at least give  per activation
whats more is that the manual itself says you can have as many user worlds as you like but then ea just released that this was a typoanyway spore went from a very promising game that could have been revolutionary enough to revive the dying pc gaming market
instead it came up short of its expectations and threw in spyware and unnecessary limitations that really do affect the end user
if you are the type that never reinstalls old games and does not care about extra processes on your computer gathering info and sending it to some company then by all means enjoy spore
if you are like me though and frequently upgrade hardware play old games every so often and just plain dont like extra unneeded things running on your pc then look elsewherei came to purchase spore today but thanks to the drm warnings i decided to preorder the force unleashed instead
i still havent purchased bioshock or mass effect for the same reasons
it is a shame as all three of these games look great but i just dont want the hasslei purchased homm v a while back which has something similar spyware and thats been just a pain
ps
ive owned  enjoyed all the maxis games from way back  including robosport
what a darn shame im going to miss this onerating   just from videos and reading other reviews about the gameoverall   due to eas choice of using drmso i get three installsthats not so baduntil you consider that i upgrade my computer every year so ill have used all three of my installs in just  years time
bah
humbug
ill just wait for the ps or wii version which wont have that ridiculous limitation
and if its never released on console
oh wellim not throwing away three hours of wages on a ticking game with a builtin expirationpasswell came here to buy  copies of the game
you know like a normal noncriminal willing to pay for the game consumer
sorry to see that if i gave ea  and then updated my aging computer in the next month or  i would have used up  of the game i purchasedit just doesnt make any sense to purchase a game that is going to self destruct in the long run
i purchased  copies of the retail world of warcraft  years ago and have since purchased x monthly subscriptions each month as well as x expansions a collectors edition of the last expansion a second account retail version  third monthly fee and have on reserve  copies and a ces edition of the upcoming expansioni hope ea sees the difference
blizzard puts a reasonable  key   account and no fuss thereafter system in place and they have earned  off of me as  household
that doesnt include the monthly fees ive paid which come to about  by my estimate
its not only the initial  investment they are down from me
they are also down any future expansions that they might put out
im only  customer who has bought at least  copy of every battlefield xxxx game ea has put out as well as the expansions
never again ea
sorry to see this happen to a company i willingly supported but i wont be labeled a thief just for being their customerso my gf and i can play this game at home without overlapping our gamessave
yes said ealo and behold
noooo
not only did ea just rent me a crappy game they also decided to change their minds lie
about the ability to have parallel accounts in the gamewhat a bunch of bs
i hate eai was gonna buy this but now i wont
the drm madness has to be stopped
i want full ownership of my games
the funny thing is that the drm was never intended to fight piracy but to prevent second hand sales
now people are boycotting the game and not buying it pirates are happy with their drmless game downloads and legal owners are forced to look to the pirates to unlock their legal game copies
good job ea you are just causing what you tried to prevent
it is really lame to try to screw your customers like that eafirst of all ive played various parts of spore and loved them
but i cant give this game five stars nor four nor three nor two
not at all
why
because of securomea weve been putting up with this crap since bon voyage and its time for it to end
were tired of you treating us like were going to pirate the game
this stuff isnt going to stop piracy
its going to drive people who would normally buy the game honestly to piracy
this game is going to sell like hotcakes and youre more than likely going to have these  and counting
reviews removed and ignore them
whywhy do you feel it necessary to persecute your entire range of potential customers with this horrible spyware known as securom
because some people are going to pirate it
youre giving the pirates exactly what they want and screwing the honest consumer over
i for one refuse to pay  for a game that i only get to install three times
heck i refuse to pay any money for a game installs spyware to monitor my system
ea take a look at stardock or at the very least valve
stardock releases all of their games  drm free and has been widely praised for it
steam sucked at the beginning but its awesome now and doesnt spy on youso please guys
i was so looking forward to this game but i refuse to buy it until you begin releasing drmfree versions or better yet providing a patch to completely uninstall securom from a users system and sever its ties to any of your games
i will never buy another one of your spywareladen products again but ill be first in line for drmfree
come on guys
for once listen to your fansupdate from january  i bought the game a couple weeks ago on steam
its a very good game so far ive just started the civilization stage
i highly recommend picking it up on steam as its a good game
my onestar review for the securominfected retail version still standsavoid installing this on a computer
the software limits you to  installations before you have to repurchase the game and installing the game installs what is basically spywaremalware securom which is known to damage computers allow hacker access prevent other games from properly working disable your cdrom from working and disable your antivirus softwareyears of development were spent on this
i mourn for the future of pc gaming
ridiculous copy protection  epic fail by the wayi bought  stylus packages until in desperation on an airplane trip i pulled out my pointed plastic pen
imagine my surprise when i discovered a regular plastic pen remove the ink cartridge for safety has better control than a tiny stylus
we all have spare plastic tipped pens laying aroundi really wanted to give this game an opportunity to please me and for the first two minutes it was mildly amusinglike all other xbox  exclusive games it eventually proved to be another unfinished piece of highly detailed garbagethe game is obviously not finished because of how pathetic the plot line is
according to the back of the case and not any of the characters within the game you choose a good side or an evil side to go on a quest to obtain the stone of union
initially you can only choose one character every playable character in the game only has the ability to play in their own very brief story mode
there are seven playable characters who each lack the ability to earn any kind of empathy from the player
the story line apparently wants you to empathise with them howeverwhile playing youll notice that your character has a variety of moves that improve in combo length and strength as you gain experience and level up
youll also notice that these complex combonation attacks dont do very much to your enemies since they magically become invincible while theyre reeling back in pain from your initial attacks
while your more powerful enemies leave themselves open to attack by preparing a strong charge attack you cannot hurt them in any way since its more important to microsoft game studios that you regret investing sixty dollars into their companymany people will notice how this game functions like a very popular game legacy known as dynasty warriors
indeed it is somewhat like dynasty warriors in how you hack and slash through hordes of enemies charging an eventual high power attack while doing so moving closer and closer to a high profile enemy who youll have to chop away at in order to defeat
a big difference is that this is  and if youre going to rip off dynasty warriors then you may as well rip off the most current version of it and learn from the mistakes of previous versions
this game is as slow and dull as dynasty warriors  is to someone whos played dynasty warriors the characters become more and more idiotic as you play one in particular is beyond the definition of idiot
eventually youll play as a female magician who shoots small jets of water at her enemies and those jets of water kill your enemies
she wont shoot them directly at the enemy if the enemy is slightly left or right of her line of sight shell instead shoot directly at the ground
someone at microsoft game studios made that decision that you should be playing a sixty dollar game where a character in that game responds to the attack button by shooting at the damn ground while enemies are directly in front of her preparing their attacksin this game if a boulder comes rolling down a hill misses you and comes to rest at the bottom of the hill its still considered a fast rolling boulder to the game
walk into it and you fly back in pain as though youve just been struckin this game if youre in the middle of a horde of enemies slashing away and a cutscene occurs you stop but your enemies dont
you will watch yourself standing there like a dumbass for a few seconds before the  crunches numbers trying to load up the five second cutscene and then see your character getting smacked back and forth by the enemies that were surrounding your characterin this game you can find and equip all the defense boosting acccessories you want and still get killed in at the most five hits by one of the signature enemies
combine that reality with the fact that they can declare themselves invincible simply by preparing a laggy charge attack and then add in the fact that youll play some levels for an hour only to get slaughtered so easily and youll realize why this game can be very irratating indeedanother obvious way to tell that this game is unfinished is the fact that throughout the game you encounter characters with unique abilities and pathetic input into the sorry excuse for a story line
most of these characters are not playable though you know that they were originally intended to be
obviously microsoft decided to wrap this one up early while assuming that the quality of the cutscenes will over shadow the lack of quality in the actual game playthis like all other xbox  exclusive games ive ever purchased is going right back to the gamestop i bought it from
i dont ask for refunds or tradeins i just give it back to themim begging microsoft to finish their games from now on i really honestly want the xbox  to do well in the video game marketthe original game was simply much better for one reason the camerathe zoom feature in this game is terrible either a sky view or a view so close up you cant control your unitsthat single feature ruins the gameanother quick note the new units have no descriptions whatsoever
they are just not therethis game is overhyped
been playing rts since dune  age of empires starcraft etc
its been such a long time since a good rts came out was expecting this game to be the game of all timebought a super gaming computer even a nd monitor got the game installed it played for  minutes then the dvd is now used for wall decoration and the dvd box is used as a window stopperthe good   i now have a very powerful computer
the dvd box was the perfect size to be used for my window stopper
very sturdy madethe bad 
 identical races
zoom in is pointless in actual playing only good for seeing how powerful your computer is
story well never got into it
the gameplay was so boring couldnt even keep my attention span over  minutes
didnt even want to bother selling it back to a local retailer dont want other gamers to get buy this junk
typical bad rts  no strategy at all
build up the units attack destroy all
forget micormanage forget counterunit a bigger army always winsruns slow on a dual core with  gb of ram and  mb of video ram
it takes extremely poor programming to get this kind of a cry game
many other games run much faster while displaying many more polygons
the game play its self of course is nothing new
same old starcraft knock off
unit interaction is cumbersome considering most units are not visible if you zoom out enough to see their full firing range
changing screen resolution does not help
i would go with warcraft  over this anyday
now if only i could return this piece of  games are fun
i will not recommend rd party d games
only good games are by nintendord party game look terrible the characters look like big blocks
the sony psp is light years ahead of this ds
nintendo has a history of selling outdated hardware and making a profit on the consoles
sony has a history of selling cutting edge hardware and making a loss on a console with the hope of making a profit from the gamesthe graphics in the ds sucks badly
as a grown man i cannot see myself playing this
this is great for kids who dont care for graphics but not for grown people
i hope the ds will be much better than this ds that i wasted money onthe nintendo ds is the most overhypped thing since boy bands
i cant believe this thing is selling
it has no good games i know all of you who read this will protest
i dont really care what you have to say its your money waste it
but facts are facts and the ds is not a good system due largely to its childcentric poor software
you might say it has great games yea great games like mario mariokart marioworld and mario tennis oh wait they are all the same crappy games that were on the nes  years ago
except for crap games like brain age yea lets do basic math that stupid cooking game with the girl from friends and the one that helps you quit smokinghow does a video game help you quit smoking whats next heroin and crack all the worlds drug problems can be cured by the ds who needs rehab just buy a ds
but what do i know if dlist stars like carrie underwood liv tyler and ugly betty play it how can you go wrong
unless you are under fifteen years old dont buy the ds or the wii for that matter
grow up and buy a  psp or psits an okay ds but it s kind of plain
i recamen the the smaller ds
join me on youtube by the name of rnelsonhere we go again
another nintendo hand held with another upgrade in less than two years time
its almost a fine way of admitting they never get anything done right the first time around
with a laundry list of rehashed titles horrible graphics limited use of its dual screen and stylus gimmicks this makes the ds hands down the worst milking of any hand held since the gameboy micro slimed its way onto the marketnot to mention the game library is nothing but the same old titles reworked and rehashed for a fanbase thats too loyal to see how dull these games have become
mario metroid zelda starfoxsurprise surprise its the usual suspects
too bad rd party support is awful as usualnintendo knows how to scam the consumer and the ds lite is proof
in another two years youll be buying a better version of the lite as wellthis game is one word abysmal
where to begin first the game is filled with bugs
it randomly crashes during missions or on the campaign map making saving every  seconds mandatory
it has all kinds of random bugs like if say for example you are playing imperial guard and youre in the middle of a mission and you have  leman russ tanks built
if you save the game and quit and load it later one of your two tanks will become unrepairable forcing you to wait  for it to die before you can do anything with it
and of course with the new  tank cap for imperial guard you cant prebuild a backup you have to wait for it to die then build a new one afterwardsthe ai is also pathetic
on easy the ai is so pathetic it is not even in the slightest way fun
you could beat the entire game on easy with  squads of imperial guard infantry
on normal though it starts to get interesting
i always wondered why if you knockout the computers power supply and listening posts how it still manages to build a bloodthirster a couple defilers and  squads of infantry over and over and over again
it never ceases to amaze me how the computer simply builds with no need for resources
on top of the fact that the computer cheats to compete what makes it more interesting is that because the ai programmers were so inept in creating a fair competetive ai they simply make all the missions  to  at least against you
the computer on some missions has as many as  bases
on one particular mission that i am on the computer has  bases and continually rushes me with  wraithlords and more infantry squads than i can pick out on the screen
it is so far beyond annoying that i have been unable after  hours to beat the mission at allthe new races are decent
the necrons are so easy to win with its boring
the tau on the otherhand are weaker than they should be
they get annihilated in ranged combat by the necrons and even the orcs can go toe to toe with the tau at range
overall this game is a pathetic followup to a great original
if the devs had spent a little more time bug testing and balancing it would be great but as it is the missions are a chore more than they are any funi really wanted to  enjoy this gameas i have the first two persona games as well as nocturne and devil summonerbut persona  goes way past the line of good tasteto summon your persona other self or ego players will put a gun calledan evoker to their head and pull the triggeratlusthis is  bullt
the fact that these characters are teenagers and also that adolescents are among the highest rate of suicide victimsmakes me want to vomitwhen i think that you are making money off thisthere was absolutely no reason to put something so carelessidiotic and in such bad taste in a a gamethis was all done in the name of the almighty dollarwho needs any form of integrity when we can make a quick buckits also not as if this is displayed once in the gamebut everytime a character wants to transform into a personawe get to see a nice scene of kids blowing their brains outwhat class atlusi hope you sleep well at nightwhat a wonderful thing for the youth to be exposed tono doubt this game will also be played by those under even those who are of age and olderthis is an unhealthy thing to be desensitized withto all the developers at atlus and all the people that say there is nothing wrong with that aspect of the gamewhy dont you show this to some families who have lost loved ones to suicidespecifically by using a gunsee how creativeartistic or fun they think it isthis game should be recalled and that ignorantinsensitive and immature aspect be removedi hope these jokers get suedand whatever money they made from this game gets donated to teen suicide preventiongrow up americaalsoplot twist ikutsuki was evil and he was using sees to help him conquer the world
the final boss is nyx
this game was pretty awful
it was just full of grinding and nothing but that
stay away from it and play better games
saved  hours of your lifebut buy and race no upgrades or anything like the real gtbut im stuck with it now will make a great dust collectorto me this is the worst game that gran turismo has ever released
i have the full version game but it just sucks bad
i was looking for a game that i can customize the car itself
a few people recommended this one but it seems like you can only do this after you have completed the game and not before
after i complete the game i probably will never play it again i hate when games places so many restrictions on them and its really stupid to do that
i was actually wanted to see the cars damaged if they were wrecked but i guess the game doesnt have this feature because i have not seen it
also the game will not connect online or to the serversthank god i didnt pay for this piece of junk
it came bundled with the playstation
ive tried to get into it a couple of times because it gets such good reviews but the long boring cutscenes and campy characters repulse me
its just not funi got this game when it first came out i played it for two weeks
now this is my personal opinion of the game it was very hard for me to get into mgs nothing interested me about the game
i just didnt like itthe game was begged by my friends as a must have i never got into it and felt like it was based around extremely linear and directed gameplay with no real freedom and too much cinema
its main focus was for solid to be a hero and be badass it did it in a good fashion and i reward for the efforts into character design and voice acting was above parthe game could have shined maybe but i was left waiting to play more than actually playing action scenes are short non existent most of the game as youll be mostly undetected
each time you are allowed to play its only for  minutes tops then back to cinematic performances which just go on forever and if the gameplay was at least interesting then i surely wouldnt have an issue with the game at all
but it wasnt and quite possibly more boring than anything ive ever played beforealthough i didnt find this outing nearly as infuriating as the original white metal gear solid for ps since its much more userfriendly  you can pause most cutscenes save where you want etc
 i still had several problems with it
this really isnt a game so much as a movie where youre occasionally allowed to push buttons
the cutscenes and other mandatory dialogue take up so much time that theres little time left for your playing
whenever you do play it feels like the only point of doing so is to get to the next briefing
your character for all his arcane military prowess seems unable to climb over the hood of a normal car or climb a foothigh pile of rubble
it doesnt go over well especially if youre watching someone else play the game
sneaking around on the battlefield
brother
sneaking around in the fox headquarters may have been one thing but i wasnt buying this for a second
the boss monsters are boring and repetitive
unarmed combat was idiotic  theres no aiming system
itll have you kicking a bookshelf whilst your mortal enemy stands by looking at you
the game wont let you use your weapons in certain sequences merely because doing so would make the sequence too easy to beat  i wish the game would stop making me crouch by default
i cant count how many times thats messed me up
warning  in this game smoke stops bullets
with the original metal gear solid konami stumbled upon something profound in video games  stealth is fun
but they seem to have lost sight of that with this outing  here stealth is a lot less important
in fact its most efficient to simply run through every scenario which youll discover before long
the plot was absurdly convoluted
did we really need all those details
yeah we get it
naomi is a spy
we have to kill soandso
we have to retrieve this or that package
fine
can we play now
do we really need all those extra names and dates
youll notice that if you simply skip all that it doesnt make a fig of difference to your enjoyment
i found the biggest problem was that this game didnt have much zazz much sizzle
with other video games i find myself playing them compulsively every day until i finish them
with this one i found myself able to leave it for a week or two before coming back to it this should be accounted a defectin sum this could have been fun but was just confusing
there were a good mix of challenges thoughi had high hopes for mgs
nextgen platform  the writers probably learned from the previous games  lots of hype and lovely hidef gameplay footage
it bode well until i put the disc in and it took  minutes to install the game instead of just running it off the disc
during the install the screen is filled with preachy healthandsafety warnings like dont play when youre tired and dont sit too close and stuff like that
oh oh
thats a really bad omen right up fronttoo many reviews are gushing over the graphics and sound and i think theyve fallen somewhat for the hype because if you analyse the game for what it is its just not that good
so rather than gush and fawn im going to try to tell you what i found and what i think its faults are
if youve read any of my other reviews youll know that i detest dark games poor control systems and game programmers who think theyre being clever
mgs exhibits two of these so if you dont like to read honest reviews you should probably skip the rest of thisso the faults in mgs
well  where to starti guess the most obvious place is the control system
its truly the worst control system since  well  mgs mgs and hitman
its awful
other reviews claim a one hour learning curve
one hour
in what gaming universe is that acceptable
first impressions last
if it takes an hour to figure out the controls and in mgs it certainly does then a lot of people like me are just going to switch off
how are konami going to hook new players to the genre if the game is so difficult to get intomgs is largely a sneakandshoot game but once again konami chose to make it thirdperson
ie
you spend the entire time looking over the top of your own character
this makes it just impossible to move around properly because youre constantly fighting the camera and movement controls
its like the original tomb raider in terms of the camera getting stuck on scenery and obliterating your view of the action at some critical moment
ive never understood thirdperson camera
its a waste of time in racing games because it makes the cars uncontrollable and its a crime to employ it in what should be a firstperson perspective game
how am i supposed to sneak examine explore and shoot when the camera is above and behind methe answer in mgs is supposed to be the threat ring
its an animestyle halo that surrounds snake and has bumps in it where the enemy are
it is described briefly in the game manual but its never really introduced or explained ingame so its just sort of there
it seems like a lot of trouble to go to for something that could have been solved by simply using firstperson mode
then you wouldnt need a threat ring  youd be able to peek around corners or use the audio to hear people around youspeaking of the camera controls there isnt one invertlook option but three
so if youre used to playing upisdown on your vertical control you have to change it in three places in mgs
why
why not have a single invert look optioni think one of the biggest crimes in mgs is the sheer amount of gameplay interruption
its like watching tivo and having someone else with the remote constantly pausing live tv or skipping fowardsfor example  weapon pickups happen when you run over something but it pauses the game to give you a very nice but totally irrelevant info screen on what you just ran over
so the programmers spent the time to interfere with the flow of the game but didnt spend the time autoequipping the weapon
no  once youve picked something up you have to pause go to the inventory screen equip or swap weapons then back out and back into the gameplay
it ruins the flow of playits
like
trying
to
read
a game
review
one
word
at
a timewhilst talking weapons its worth talking about the targetting  aiming system
third person mode is once again totally useless
you might as well have a nerf gun for all the good it does
so you have to go into firstperson mode to aim but this requires two controls to be activated  r to activate the weapon then triangle to go into first person mode
why
why not just go into firstperson mode when you activate the weapononce in firstperson mode its impossible to move around and your turn speed is like having your feet nailed to the ground
i timed it  it takes a good  seconds to do a  so theres no quickly turning around to pick off the bad guy behind you  youll be dead long before you can even see him
plus if you waiver even slightly on the r button it flicks back out into thirdperson view where the turn speed is much quicker
so you end up popping out of first person into third person mode the turn accelerates and then youve overshot where you wanted to aim
sigh
why
what purpose does this meddlesome control system serve
this is another place the camera control just fails miserably
someone is behind you so you need to turn around to shoot at them
snake spins around the camera tries to follow but gets stuck on scenery and is now facing snake from the front
now youre facing the enemy but you cant see him because the camera is stuckthen theres the rest of the interference problemsid hoped with mgs that they would have gone away from the  storycutscene  gameplay split but sadly not
in the opening  minutes of gameplay i must have spent  minutes watching cut scenes and having control taken away from me for a bruckheimeresque slowmotion shot of something completely irrelevant
once again  stuff designed to destroy the flow of playing the game
youre just getting into the swing of things when pow  control taken away arty shot of tank approaching  pow control given back
i could see the darned tank without the cut scene  it was right in front of me
or worse youll be running towards an objective and pow  you drop out of game mode for a cut scene of someone making you eggs for breakfast
jeez
it made me throw the controller at one point and just stand up and shout oh come on
hideo kojima  the games inventor and chief designer  has understood that videogames are a great medium but he does concentrate too much on the video and not enough on the game
for example  put mgs in start a new game and a stopwatch and time it you wont be able to actually engage an enemy for over  minutesspeaking of what the
moments when you start the game youll sit through a weird tv game show clip where a woman chooses the wrong answer followed by an advert i think for womens perfume advertised by gunladen women squirming underwater with an octopus with a skull for a head
in pink water
i kid you not
i have absolutely no clue what that was all about
i seriously thought i might have had the wrong game disc in at that point  i ejected it and checkedoh and speaking of loading  if the game is installed on the hard drive shouldnt there be zero load screens
after all drakes fortune paradise city and gta manage to let you freeroam massive environments with no load screens
not in mgs though
every time you get into a tight crawlspace or have to open a door you drop out of the game into a loading screen
worse you then need to hit start to get back into the game
its bad enough they have load screens on a nextgen game but to make you have to hit a button to get back ingame is just criminal
again  interrupting the flow of the gamethen theres your assistant otacon
he just will not shut up
he yaps and complains and  my god  the boy has verbal diarrhea
you can probably ignore  of what he says  it has no relevance to your gameplay
problem is that a lot of the time  you guessed it  youll drop out of gameplay to hear him blather on about something
its like the programmers didnt know the ps supports bluetooth headsets
you know what  if otacon is talking into your earpiece in the game which he clearly does because snake always stops squats and jams a finger in one ear why not have him talk into your headset whilst youre playing
that would have been a good idea and so much more intuitiveother things that are problematic
well  the yourenotquitedead problem
when you get hit sufficiently hard which you will because the control system will fight you all the way to the ground you lie there with the breeze wafting your cape around  or your hair  or something else
for all intents and purposes the game would have you believe youre dead
only youre not  youre still alive but theres no prompt to tell you this
the programmers filled the game with meddlesome icons popups info screens and pauses for everything from picking up an ipod to changing weapons but they didnt have the courtesy to tell you that you arent actually dead
of course by the time you figure this out you actually will be dead because someone will have found you and shot youso what about the graphics
well on my inch screen through a full hd projector it looks nice and polished
it runs in p full hd as best i can gather
correction from earlier assertion that it ran at pthe graphics are good enough but theyre not really nextgen more like warmedover ps graphics with some neat touches
theres a fair amount of aliasing jaggies especially when the game engine tries to render lines  power lines ropes that sort of thing
this sort of stuff just shouldnt be present
draw distance is good but not brilliant
theres a fair amount of popup and fadein for smaller items
for example when you get the inevitable cut scene of a tank rolling up watch the flare launchers on its flanks
they wink in at a ridiculously short rangethere are other problems too  its all in the details
the enemy soldiers feet are about  sizes too small for the rest of their body
the specular highlights change badly on some of the vehicles when they transition from low to high detail models
the dust and smoke effects whilst clever seem to use only three texture maps so the repeat in them is very noticable
one neat feature that is done well though is the octocamo  where you can lie on the floor or press up against a wall and your suit behaves like a chameleon suit and takes on the texture of whatever youre next to
its quite entertaining to see snake running around the battlefield wearing a chintzy wall coveringthe motion capture isnt up to much though with jerks and pops between the various characters predefined routines
stand up
pop
aim
judder
fire
pop
squat down
its really very irritating
the enemy troops patrolling motion capture makes it look like theyre walking on tiptoes and theres another obvious pop in the motion capture loop after each leftright step
tiptoe left
tiptoe right
pop
tiptoe left etc etc
its one of those things you wont notice at first but once youve seen it your eye will be drawn to it all the timein fact  it looks like they didnt do any new motion capture for a lot of mgs but reused the stuff from mgs
i put mgs in to check it out and sure enough the enemy troop movements are identical to the point where you cant tell them apart
so  four and half years to wait for the new game and they reused the old motion capture
classyas i said above the dust and dirt effects are nice and the modelling of the environments has been really well done but youll come away from it feeling somehow empty
occasionally youll walk around a corner to see the culling routines pop a whole street in
why
why are these problems in this game
did they just not do any qa on itits not that it isnt impressive to look at  it is  but it just doesnt have that xfactor
so i would consider the graphics somewhat below par for a next gen platformlets go with the audio then
weeellll lets not
theres a lovely dolby digital logo at the beginning of the game but the audio separation isnt up to much
the soundstage is mostly middle speaker with the occasional lefttoright effect
barely anything comes out of the side or rear speakers
im so used to playing games where i can locate enemies by sound alone that mgs was once again a total letdown in the audio department
again  the threat ring seems to be compensation for something that wasnt done right the first time around
the weapons sound effects are pretty weak  hardly any bass content
so firing the m is like firing a childs pop gun
mortar rounds landing close to you shake the camera but not your room  they should be fullbass wellstereoseparated sound effects but theyre not
the best audio in the game is all the speech but theres just too much of itso  mgs
you can tell im not impressed
its basically mgs and mgs in terms of playability and longevity sprinkled with sortofnextgen graphics and s audio
i suppose if youre a mgs fan then this game will leave you shaking with joy but for everyone whos not in that club this seems to be addressing a very niche marketpersonally i just couldnt handle the sheer amount of irrelevant story and gameplay interruption
its so unintuitive and meddlesome compared to resistancefall of man or call of duty  that you will just end up screaming at your psadd to this the curious lack of of save points
youll spend a lot of time carefully working your way towards an objective only to have the controls and camera ambush you at some inopportune moment resulting in your death
incidentally otacon still has his lisp when you die  thnake
thnake
noooooo
at this point youll be transported back a good  minutes of gameplay and cut scenes for a doover
really really bad designi really wanted to like this game
i thought with as much hype as its had and the glowing reviews in everything from playstation magazine to edge that it would be a game of the year contender
after the first bunch of failures it took me  attempts to get out of the intro scene because of the movement and camera controls i walked away to cool my anger
i came back after a couple of hours to give it a second go but then things were even worse
i managed to progress beyond the opening scene at last into what appeared to be a bombedout middle eastern town
at that point the sheer volume of cut scenes control and otacon interruption just made my blood boil
then i was presented with a cut scene of a soldier defacating into a barrel oddly with some of the finest sound effects in the game followed by a cutscene of his naked buttocks running away
that pushed me over the edge
game over for me
what relevance is that to the gamethat brings up an interesting point
didnt we do away with the infinite pockets syndrome in the s
you know  where you can carry a seemingly endless number of guns and ammo
apparently snake can carry this barrel with him everywhere along with all his guns but you never see any of them
they just appear in his hands by magic
shouldnt you only be able to carry a couple of weapons
drakes fortune for example  two guns  a pistol in a holster and a larger gun on your back
thats an example of a problem with the previous games that i would have expected to have been addressed by nowafter barely an hour of wrestling with it i just had to give up
as a gamer i just dont have the time of day for things designed this poorly
ive returned the game for store crediti wish i could tell you i was an xbox fanboy who was bashing this game just for the sake of it but im not
i hate the xbox  im a total ps devotee so its difficult for me when i come across quality problems like those i find in mgs
i so hoped the games for the ps would be better than thisi dont understand how people can proclaim this game a masterpiece or awesome or any of the other accolades bestowed upon it
look at it in the cold harsh light of day and youll find a soso game riddled with problemsive been gaming since elite came out on the bbc micro computer in  so im no stranger to any type of game but its not often that one comes out that just leaves me thinking what the hell
my advice  dont fall for the advertising hype
if youre not into the previous mgs titles then youre just not welcome at this party as the comments at the end of this review will attest where fervent mgs fans will no doubt proclaim me to be the antichrist for not liking their game
pick up call of duty  instead  youll actually enjoy playing that instead of wanting to throw your ps through a window
if you must play mgs then rent it first to see if its your cup of tea
because if its not youll feel totally robbedone last thing  for all those who think that this wraps up the mgs storyline think again
mgs is being talked about now possibly as a prequel
if they dont fix these problems in that game im sure ill be reviewing it just the same in  years timemgs offered about  minutes of actual playtime in the three hours i played it before returning it
the rest of the time i watched boring cinematics that had too much unnecessary information
the gameplay of this title was fairly boring with several of the levels being less than  minute long before another extremely long cutscenecutscenes aside this game really had nothing to offer me by way of gameplay
sneaking is really not necessary in this game as blasting your way through the few enemies you find is far easier than trying to run around themultimately this game is geared toward extremely hardcore metal gear fans
if you arent one of those then i would suggest disregarding the hype and picking up another titlethis game is one of the worst ever
for one you play as an old man and you have to sneak around enemies and stuff which is boring and lame
and the storyline is completely lame as the cutscenes are way tldw
dont buy this godawful excuse for a gamenow if you want a good sneaking game play sneak kingi was never really a big fan of mgs played through  and  back then on the ps and ps
i thought they were okay and worth playing but mgs is just boring as hell
i played through the first  hours and couldnt continue because the gameplay was awful
some of the scenes were lame why was one of the teammates farting and getting diarrhea
you are expected to sneak around and be stealthy in the middle of a warzone
i tried shooting my way through but that didnt work all the time
the cutscenes were too long
i had no idea what they were talking about and when i did it was not interesting
the weapons and gears didnt have any specific purpose except just sleep silence or hardkilling
the controls were very hard to use
i kept mixing up the movements
it was difficult to switch and use the weapons and gears
fps view was not as easy to use as real fps shooters
the camera was the worst
it just spins around everywhere since it is so close to snake not much overhead like the old mgs
the graphic was average nothing too spectacular but i guess thats because mgs is an old game
it doesnt look as good as killzone crysis socom or red dead
i guess standard for games are much higher today
mgs use to be the king of stealthy game as i remember it but a lot have changed since then
i really wish it was better game so i can play through and move on to mgs when it comes outthis is the game which destroyed my faith in gaming review websitesfirst the good it has sharp and detailed graphics and wellanimated cutscenesthe bad gameplay is pretty terrible
yes there is a cqc mechanic
however the level design is such that you arent forced to use it
i ended up running and gunning the entire way through as that was simply the quickest way to make it
the shooter portions are pretty bad
aiming is difficult and movement is choppythe cutscenes take way too long and not only that waste a lot of time on stupid angsty japanese anime cliches about darkness
also strip out the cutscenes and the game portion is very short
about  hours or soboss fights are similarly annoying as they rely mostly on the bad shooter aspects of the gamei literally fell asleep playing this game
i cannot believe the number of s that this game received from review sites
mgs  was a much better game all around it is ridiculoushello folksi am shocked to see the high scoresthis game truly sucks
lousy single player and even lousier multiplayerlinear game flow silly and boring story loose controls and very boring play make this game a one star
i am glad i sold it and the game guide
oh and no coop eitherthe mp was boring slowmoving not inspiringnot funif you want fun mp action with destructable environment fantastic sound dynamicsrealism and the best looking visuals in a game head over to battlefield bad company
that has no coop in sp either but the mp is great funjohnthe game is nice to look at but it is not extraordinary
its on par with most next generation games
the problem with it is that there are far too many cut scenes and they are far too long
i found myself annoyed waiting for them to end and wondering if gameplay would suffer by skipping them
and when you do get to play the gameplay and the controls are tedious
it is not very natural or intuitive
call of duty  modern warfare is a better choice if you like to actually play a great combat game
i even preferred uncharted drakes fortune as an example of an intuitive rd person shooteri have tried playing all the metal gear games and just couldnt get into the gameplay just wasnt for me and the way i like to playthis game is all show
graphics more graphics all cut scenes
i sold my copy after  days
i could not get into this boring crap
its so slow and dull
after playing fun games that are actually games
not a rendered freaking movies
you will be bored with this game if you like action
i cant believe people like this game so much
its like playing a boring rpg 
what a waste
this game is worth  at most
its mostly just cut scenes of boring complex story
what a borei think this may be the most overrated video game of all time
the action is dull
you basically just walk around and shoot people then try to hide when the alarm goes off and get to the next check point
the cutscenes are cool but way too long
i got through most of the game and got near the end that i was so disgusted with this game that i couldnt even finish it
grand theft auto  is a much better game than this for the psi bought this game thinking it would be good
i liked  and  but after that the game play got very complicated
this game is so complicated to play
im not one to spend hours on ps but you have to for this one just to learn how to shoot and use your suit right
i got to the point to when i said forget this and i traded it in
it took  minutes to start playing the game
really  minutes
i timed it
other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and yes the game play is hard to use
i dont want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly
here simple this button is shoot this button is change weapons this button is targeting
why be more complicated than that
 and  controls were the best
they have lost me here completelygood enough to be movie and not gameoffline game is all about the movies that they keep on playing you keep on watchig for hours the story while you play only for few secondsi cant say i minded it since i enjoyed watching the hd movies on my hdtv system
however its sooo booringonline its a big chock so stupid lame and zero funslow graphics and maps are so poorit takes so much time to train and customize your player and when you start playing you discover its so lame especially if you played earlier call of duty  and  socom and other online gamesso if you want to demonstrate your hdtv system this game is okay to purchase
however if you into online gaming this game sucksi somehow managed to push myself through  chapters of this game
how
i have no idea
i will say that the thought of playing it once more feels like going to the dentist
this is easily the worst final fantasy ever and also just a plain bad game regardless of the final fantasy titleheres whats good in this game  graphics voice acting some of the musicwhats bad
everything else
it is not fun the story is not interesting there is no sense of a world since you just appear in new areas magically and nothing is connected the battle system is for a  year old and beyond boring the characters are lame the lack of anything to do other than walk forward in a line and fight is pathetic and the upgrade system is completely worthless
you can beat this game without upgrading  item at all without a problemive been a fan of final fantasy since the beginning
nintendo  final fantasy
boom
sadly when i returned to console gaming i find that final fantasy  and  are terrible in terms of gaming and immersion
i can understand why the new generation loves games like these
simple beautiful and take hardly any effort
if you press the x button and move your character forward you can beat final fantasy x and  blind folded
but for those who have experienced the rewarding mechanics the other final fantasies offered exploration immersion freedom of movement leveling up at your own leisure finding hidden people places or things etc a game like this is nothing but patronizing at best
i bought this game because of the final fantasy i grew up with
sadly this does not live up to the original rpg legacy    gave us
honestly youre better off youtubing the game to see all the cut scenes at once rather than wasting your time moving your character through pointless battle scenes
youll get all of the beauty and save hours not grinding through trivial battles where the game basically does everything for you
ill be taking this game back to gamestop next chance i get
sorry this game sucks from an rpg stance
its just a moviei play a lot of rpgs
this is in general jrpg wrpg all types all walks have for about  yearsi have to say that this one may border on one of the worst ive ever played
now i have to commend the presentation the aesthetics the art the music the visuals on the whole
its also a very smooth kinetic title
its pretty spiffy to play throughthe problem is just how vapid it is
were talking just ridiculous levels of nongame
this is from the team that put out ffx while outside of being very goofy and girlpower happy had some fantastic gameplay systems associated with it
ffxiii does not
the entire progression for all of the title sans chapter  is walking down a hallway from a to b this may not sound like the pits but once you tie that in with no deviations it really gratesthere are no towns no real subquests or elements several key character points are actually abandoned because there is no way to present or address them due to the limitations of the design
now thats bad but you can still make up for that as an onrails experience well it doesnt
the combat engine can from start to finish barring the last couple dozen hunts be breezed through by mashing x and rarely doing a class swap in order to defend or heal upeverything is automated all ability selection bad ai  team mates if they took away that random class juggle the game wouldnt be a gameusually rpgs make up for lack of action or input with micromanagement or planning or strategy there is none of that
the character development here is done through a crystalarium sp board which is completely linear and weapon upgrading which is also completely linear
there is no thought no deviation you grind and you grind more and you mash xbad enough yet
well you get no choice over your party character classes or anything else for the first  hours of the gamejust unrealthats the gameplay now the story is a whole nother trainwreck
basically just prepare to hear
falcie
lcie
focusrepeated ad nauseum for the  hours the main quest takes because between hours  and  there is no narrative progression
its a lot of jargon a lot of dwelling on the same points a lot of awkward grunts and sighs and a dash of dtier anime charmone single character has dialogue that isnt so completely banal that itd make a high school av club moan
and thats sazh sazh is a character still rooted in the s as far as black characters go but he is still a big improvement on say the likes of barret from final fantasy vii
kudos japanthe game actually tries to present itself like a big character drama and also a big story sweeping two vast worlds but fails rather spectacularly in both with a vastly underdeveloped cast and world designs that have no lore history or general consequence to them and act more as a general potluck of random themes and designs sort of akin to a themed mario worldthe worst part of all of this is that any little bit of story or context or sense you wish to gleen from the game has to be read through a haphazardly written datalog in the menus
if you expect the game to actually tell its story through actual sequencing and design then guess againits not the worst game ever made its easy to cut through as it puts absolutely no strain or resistance on the player and it looks gorgeous while being cut through
i can think of bigger crimes than merely being a design train wreck there are titles that are technical and design train wrecksstill worst in series avoid
my suggestion would be to scope out resonance of fate which is a challenging mechanically innovative title with some good charm
probably the best jrpg this generation after demons soulsat some point during the long development the developers must have realized hey we really have a piece of turd here but since they already made commitments to investors and know that the final fantasy name will sell a million units they grind on and released it
easily one of the two worst games ive ever played
this game is painful to play
for an rpg you expect to have exploration character customization dialogue options fun combat and a good story
this game has none of those
it funnels you on a straight linear path with no dialogue options and little customization the combat always loops the same annoying theme music and the story is the most painful part of all
que stereotypical jrpg characters young boy struggling with selfesteem blonde hair blue eyed iron willed lead character stereotypical jrpg representation of goofy loud black guy with a chocobo that nests in his giant afro and of course the catgirl high pitched high energy highly annoying tweenie
the high production cg cutscenes were so painfully bland and cheesy that i immediately skipped through them whenever they popped up
and they pop up often
run down linear path cut scene take another step cutscene kill one enemy cutscenewhat happened to all the exploration and fun of the past final fantasy games
when at first i heard that this game was linear i thought linear
what do you mean linear
how can an rpg be linear
its literally one straight narrow road
kudos to the developers for wanting to do something different but they went too far off the deep end
i dont know what could have possessed the developers to make such huge critical conceptual flaws
i will never again buy a game with the names motomu toriyama director or yoshinori kitase producer on itsave yourselves from this garbage
i tried chugging away and kept hoping the torture would stop but after six long horrible hours i couldnt take it anymore
some reviewers said that after  hours it becomes ok why would i play through  hours of torture just so the game can be mediocre at the very end
the bigwigs in square enix keep talking about the games success and perfection
they must be living in their own fantasy world where they believe if they keep putting out this kind of garbage and basking in the glory of their previous success that theyll still be able to rake it in
developers are only as good as their last game and this game deserves a 
forget the  i lost on this game i want the six hours of my life back
for every person i steer away from this game i will come that much closer to washing myself of the stench of this turdthink i sound angry at this game
well its actually that badavoid at all costs there is no redeeming value and there is no type of gamer who could enjoy this gameff is without a doubt a tragedy
it is the only final fantasy ive played that i just lost interest in halfway through
the game is linear and i dont just mean the storyline
you literally walk down a path the whole time
you walk from point a to b then you have a boring boss battle or a cut scene
this repeats over and over again
the normal enemy battles were a pain
first of all normal battles took forever as my characters attacks barely scratched the surface of the enemys large amount of hp or defense
it took like  minutes to end these boring battles
yes they were boring you could only control one character
the other  were ai
basically all you do is change paradigms and mash the x button while the ai fought the battle for you
why would i want to play a game that plays itself for me
its like buying a crossword puzzle book with all the words written in
it got to the point that i would avoid enemies all together because of how much of a hassle everything was
i dont know why the creators just didnt make ff a movie instead of a game
you barely interact at all
the characters were very cliche for final fantasy if that makes sense
theyre just rip offs from previous final fantasy characters
they didnt act like normal people
it kind of kept me from empathizing with their ridiculous personalities
for example this one kid is angry at the character snow because his mom died in a battle she had no business fighting in like it was snows fault
the kids stupid mom who was his sole provider volunteered with the stupid line moms are tough and then got killed like  mins later
it was the kids moms fault 
id smack this kid if he were real
square enix knows that most of us hate this game and whats their excuse for this pile of you know what game
westerners just do not understand eastern culture
thats just their way of not admitting that they know this game is terribleso in conclusion this game is terrible
the only good thing about this game is its graphics
anyone who likes this game has never played previous titles such as ffvi ffvii ffx etc
if you think this game deserves  or  out  stars i suggests you play ffvii or ffvi
then try to play ff again
youll see how ff is a step in the wrong direction
i do not recommend this game
dont buy itthe first final fantasy game i ever played was xii on the ps
i loved it
the characters were probably the best of any game ive ever played and the gameplay kept my mind as well as my fingers busy for  hours
constantly arranging and rearranging my gambits leveling up my weapons and abilities going to one fantastic environment after another  that was a fantastic game
so i was pretty interested in xiii
my god what a complete failure
the graphics are fantastic no doubt about that
square enix really should have made this a movie instead of a game because thats the only good thing about it
the characters are a gigantic step backwards from those in xii  theyre onedimensional somewhat annoying and i couldnt care less about any of themand then theres the gameplay
it deserves its own paragraph
heres what you do  you press x to initiate autobattle
the game chooses if youll cast a spell or use a weapon end executes the attack
you just sit and watch
if your health gets low you can switch to a different paradigm l and down arrow twice where one member of your party is a medic
then its back to hitting x at the appropriate time
once your health is back up you return to your offensive paradigm l and up arrow twice and resume hitting x  thats it
it requires no thought whatsoever and offers no challenge
id compare the experience to working in a factory where you do some menial task over and over and over until it absolutely sucks the life out of you
and to add to the monotony before every battle a special effect appears announcing that youre in battle mode and afterwards you have to flip through not one but two screens telling you your stats and what spoils you gained in the battle
none of this serves any purpose whatsoever an increases the level of tedium to an even higher leveltheres nothing in the way of leveling up either you just go to the main menu choose crystarium and hold down the x button as your crystal points are automatically applied to the various skills
all you do is watch a little light go around in a circleoverall this is textbook example of trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear
the graphics are great but they cant cover up the most utterly brain dead gameplay ive ever experienced in my  years of gaming
it was so bad it actually destroyed my enthusiasm for gaming for two weeks after i quit playing itrigidly linear
embarrassing in a modern game
no choices to be made no variation possible
the story is terrible too
this experience was like being forced to push a button over and over to watch an extremely long and poorly written movie
dont buy
pleaseits hard to start on this game but the main issue i have is the lack of story and what little there is to it is very difficult to understand and get into
the gfeidolon fights later in the game are way to difficult with the only two people available at that part of the game
way to much upgrading you have to do for each class for every character
if the party leader gets koed then you start over from the last checkpoint or replay the fight
the only upside to ff is the graphics and that it
this is not a final fantasy in my book and it just uninterestingwhat was squareenix thinking when they decided to sit down and create this rpg
i can understand  maybe  hours of tutorial linear crap but  hours worth
they should have made it more open and indepth from the startbefore i start talking about ff id like to take a moment to look back on its predecessor
for those of you who remember ff had a lot of high expectations promise and hype
it had been the longest wait since the last numbered singleplayer final fantasy ffx in  and ff in 
during the first few weeks many people played it and many people professional reviewers and normal players alike gave it plenty of praiseand then we collectively hit the  hour mark and watched the game fall off a cliff
we watched as interesting plot threads dissolved into nothingness
we watched as dungeons started stretching on endlessly at a snails pace
we watched with horror i might add as we collectively realized that with the gambits ff essentially played itselfi was one of those people
i had written an early review of ff just a week after the game came out about  hours in
and i had given the game endless praise
 out of  i said
 hours later i realized that i had made a huge mistake
consider this my formal recantation of my ff review
not to be confused with the informal recantations id been giving in the last four years
to make up for that i promised myself i wouldnt give ff a review until after i had finished the game for fear of making the same mistake for fear of playing the game for  hours and giving it endless praise only to watch the game fall apart afterwards and force me to eat my words againso thats what ive been doing these last  weeks
playing ff for the right to review it
and now lets see where it takes ussoundtracklets start with the easy stuff
i agree with the uematsu fanboys on this one
final fantasy music just hasnt been good since uematsu became less involved
and ff is no exception
its almost like the composer of ff masashi hamauzu for those who care was afraid of making his music actually good afraid to make it anything more than ambient background noise for fear of people actually noticing that yes there is in fact music in this game
to be fair its a problem that plagues most modern video games
there are two tests for video game music
the first test is if a piece makes you want to pause the game and just listen to the music for a moment
ff fails in this regard
most of the pieces are just not very memorable and very few of them stand out
sure there are a few gems
but a few gems in an otherwise bland and flavorless soundtrack does not make for a good video game soundtrackthe second test of course is if a few years from now listening to the soundtrack will make me reminisce about the game and make me want to play it again
unfortunately i dont have a time machine and my promise for not reviewing the game until i finish doesnt apply to waiting a few years for nostalgia to kick in
that and this only works if i have fond memories of the game to begin with
graphicsif you were to tell me ff has good graphics i would probably believe you
if you were to tell me ff has bad graphics i would probably believe you too
to be fair i havent bothered looking at ff screenshots sidebyside with ffs so i dont know how much better it actually is
if it werent for hd technology i dont know if these eyes could even tell the differencewhat i do know is that when you play the game with its realtime rendered graphics and you hit a cutscene and see what prerendered graphics can do the difference is jarring
are ffs graphics good
sure
but theyre obviously not good enough to make square not load the disc with prerendered cutscenesstorylineff started off fantastically
right from the beginning the game puts you in the middle of the action and very quickly sets up a handful of promising characterbased plot threads
the game quickly introduces you to the main characters and then sets up the main plot thread that pulls the whole game along
and at the end of all that you say wow that was a great opening sequence
and the game was only just beginning
footnote this is a reference to my experiences with another jrpg which shall not be named where i said wow that was a great opening sequence
wait thats the end of disc  already
and then the game falls apart
i have to give ff credit here
it took ff a good  hours to fall apart
ff managed to fall apart in only the problem is that ffs storyline is incredibly slow
no thats not the right word
slow implies that the plot is actually going somewhere
ffs plot went nowhere
the problem is that after the great opening sequence nothing happens
after the opening sequence i crawled through hours of dungeons fought dozens of battles and sat through pointlessly boring cutscenes waiting for something to happenbut wait you say thats anticipation
the game is generating anticipation of the story
thats a good thingno anticipation is when youre wondering whats going to happen next
ffs story is when im wondering if anythings going to happen at allsome of you will be quick to point out that much of ffs story is told through flashbacks and its the flashbacks that i should be paying attention to for the story
except with a few very rare exceptions a story cannot be told entirely in flashbacks
it just doesnt work
flashbacks are retrospective in nature and events in flashbacks feel more like backstory and setup for the present thread rather than like something thats actually happening
in ff the flashbacks end up hurting the story rather than helping it
rather than enhance the story with interesting background information or a parallel plot thread the flashbacks make a slow uneventful story even slower and less eventfulit wasnt until the  hour mark when something finally happened
i remember this because when youre playing a game where nothing happens you remember when something finally happens
unfortunately my joy was shortlived
a few minutes later the game brings you back to hours of nothingnesssure from then on stuff started to happen
but it didnt help
the events in the story if it can be called that dont pull you along but rather come out of nowhere and go nowhere
rather than being driven the story wanders
literally wanders
over  of the story is your party wandering around with no real purposeand all those characterbased plot threads that were that were set up in the opening sequence
none of them are developed in any way and most of them are unceremoniously dropped on the floor
the one characterbased thread that is finally revisited was then immediately ended with a young boy crying to his nearest motherfigure
literally
its almost as though the writers just wanted to end that particular plot thread because they felt it would distract us from the main plot thread
but its like chehkov said
if you hang a gun on the wall in the first act then by the end of the third act the gun needs to be fired
if the writers had no intention of developing and properly concluding those characterbased plot threads why include them at allin fact i daresay ff has the worst storyline ever of any ff game ive played
even ff whose storyline consisted entirely of a series of loosely connected quests had a better story than ff
mainly because a series of loosely connected quests is something
even ffta whose story is hated by pretty much every final fantasy fan in existence had a better story than ff
because in ffta stuff happens
in ff nothing happens
you know how they say seinfeld is a show about nothing
no seinfeld is about something
ff is about nothing at all
and unless that particular something is like stabbing yourself in the face as far as stories go something is always better than nothingand whats up with the names
characters named lightning snow and hope
regions named cocoon and pulse
crystarium
and what the hell kind of names are falcie and lciegameplay  combatsome people say ff has a new combat system thats more actionoriented
its not
its just a minor variation on atb
hell they still call them atb gauges
yes it is a lot more fastpaced than the atb of your snessuper famicom and ps days
but ffx was even fasterpaced and ffx was straight up atb
to be fair in ffx you had to control three party members but in ff you only control one
if they made you control all three party members ffs combat may have turned into an exercise in insanityspeaking of which in ff you only control the party leader
the other two members of your active party are controlled by an ai script
except that  of the time the correct thing to do with the party leader is to select autobattle and let the ai pick the moves
so really the ai ends up doing everything
remember ff
remember how people complained that the gambits basically put the game on autopilot and was very noninteractive
yeah as it turns out since you cant customize the ai ff is even more automated
at least it hides it well
the game designers did try to add an extra dimension to the game with roles and paradigms
except that roles are just character classes and paradigms are just the roles your party is currently using
nothing new here
sure you can change paradigms midbattle called a paradigm shift apparently but changing character classes is as old as the original nes ff and changing character classes midbattle is as old as ffx
so really paradigm shifts are nothing new eitherbut ive always said that innovation is overrated that good execution trumps good concept
so rather than debating whether roles and paradigms are innovative they arent lets talk about what they add to the gameplay
before paradigm shifts if you need to attack you press attack over and over again
if you need to heal you cast heal over and over again
in ff with paradigm shifts if you need to attack you instead switch to the offensive paradigm and press autobattle over and over again and watch as the ai picks offensive skills for you
if you need to heal you switch to the healing paradigm and press autobattle over and over again and watch as the ai picks healing spells and heals your party for you
hmmm im trying to see the difference here
other than the superficial difference
and then theres the chain gauge
basically as you attack an enemy you increase the chain gauge
when its full the enemy becomes staggered and takes much more damage than before
i imagine they designed this also to add an extra dimension to the combat
except that it didnt
actually it did the opposite
rather than making battles more varied and more interesting it made them all play the same
every boss fight pretty much requires the same strategy
you focusfire on them until they become staggered at which point their defenses drop and you can actually damage them
compare to chrono trigger and ffx for examples of boss fights that have a variety of strategies without resorting to a gimmick like the chain gaugefortunately or unfortunately ffs combat is the least offensive part of its gameplay
its just more of the same
straight up jrpg combat has become stagnant and its really difficult to change things up without venturing into action rpg or strategy rpg territory
i can name exactly zero games that have managed to pull this off successfully
gameplay  character growthwhoever invented the sphere grid in ffx must have thought they came up with the best thing since sliced chocobo
sliced chocobo that sounds so awful and morbid
after all ffs license board is just a variant on sphere grid and similarly ffs crystarium is also just a variant on sphere grid
who can blame them
linear stat growth is just so cliche nowffs crystarium is essentially instead of one sphere grid each character has multiple sphere grids one for each role they have
this means you can either focus on one role and specialize in it or you can spread your crystal points around and level up each role evenly and become a jackofalltrades
basically character customizability and multiple strategiesor at least thats what the game promisedin actuality the crystarium is very limited
as you fight battles one of the roles on a character will fill up and youll be forced whether you like it or not to start spending crystal points on a different role
or you could just save up those points but as it turns out it doesnt really matter
apparently the game is tuned just so that right when you fill up all of your crystariums you get to a boss fight and beating that boss expands your crystarium
so unless youre skipping battles all the time what actually happens is that youll end up leveling up all your roles evenly and fully anyway just because of the way the game is structurednot only that but the combat with its paradigm shifts make you want to level up in every available role
a character who can only apply buffs or a character who can only heal is too inflexible to survive in combat
in order to get through battles without tearing your hair out youll need to use multiple roles per character
and so single role characters simply do not work
although theres probably already a single role challenge out there already
at about the  hour mark the crystarium opens up dramatically and all roles become available to all characters
so now you would expect that the promise of choosing your roles and customizing your characters to be fulfilled
except as it turns out nonstarting roles are so prohibitively expensive that until near the end of the game its much cheaper to keep on leveling up your starting roles
not only that but your characters are generally so far behind with their nonstarting roles that ignoring highly specialized strategies its not worth leveling up nonstarting roles anywayso there you have it
ffs crystarium promised customizable characters and failed to deliver on that promise
even ffs license board for all the ridicule it endured was more customizable than this
ffs crystarium only provides the illusion of choice making you go through the motions of directing the characters growth only to have them end up going down the paths the game predetermined for themgameplay  overalljrpgs are linear
that is a given
anyone who knows anything about jrpgs knows that they are linear
complaining about a jrpg being linear is like complaining that a cupcake is smaller than a regular cake
cue relevant penny arcade comic
that said ff is incredibly linear even by jrpg standards
ff is so linear it makes ffx look like oblivion by comparisonyou know how people say in jrpgs youre essentially walking a straight line from beginning to end
usually they mean it metaphorically
but in ff youre literally walking a straight line from beginning to endthe game consists entirely of dungeon crawling
no exploration
no side quests
no towns to interact with not in the traditional rpg sense of town anyway
its just dungeon crawling
and the dungeons themselves are linear
they are straight line paths from beginning to end the only branches being obvious alcoves with items for you to grab
those dont count as branches anywayto be fair this gets better at around the  hour mark
you get to a region that you can actually explore
you get some side quests to doalas the region is full of monsters that are way too powerful for you to handle until the end of the game
and because of the way the crystarium is structured you cant become powerful enough to handle them until the end of the game
and all of the side quests are monster hunts which this particular gamer finds particularly boring
and still no townsbut my biggest gripe is that the dungeons are just too long and drawn out
in general i dont have a problem with long dungeons
but having long dungeons at the expense of an already slow story making me crawl through a seemingly endless dungeon when im already waiting for something to happen is just asking for complete and utter boredom
and it takes hours to crawl through these dungeons
theres no good reason for a dungeon crawl to take that longits a common problem among modern games
game designers try drag out their games to take as long as possible focusing on hour counts instead of actual entertainment
it doesnt help that many vocal game critics cite low hour counts as a flaw for some games
and since ffs game designers realized they didnt have enough story to fill out a  hour game they compensated by making the dungeons drag on foreverolder games dont seem to have this problem
if ff had been made in  it would have been less than  hours long and still would have had all the same content
and i wouldnt have complainedconclusionff bored me to tears
about halfway through i started looking forward to the end of the game hoping beyond hope that the game would be over soon
not because i wanted to know how the story ended but because i wanted ff to finally be over so i could do something i actually enjoyed
like write a review that thoroughly trashes every aspect of ff
only my promise to finish the game kept me going
because really none of you ff fanboys would accept my review of ff as a bad game unless i had actually finished the gamethat and i didnt want to break my streak of having finished every numbered singleplayer final fantasy game
it was the same reason i went back and finished ff
let me make this perfectly clear ff is a bad game
and i dont just mean bad for a ff game
i mean bad
the music is bland the combat is uninteresting the character growth system is a failure the story is too slow and the dungeons are too long
and my spoon is too big
the game is terrible in pretty much every way by any reasonable standard for games in generalstill ff was merely boring
it could be worse
at least they didnt make me actively hate the game
at least they didnt make it a grindfest
at least they didnt make the computer opponent cheat
oh wait the final boss cheats what with him having a skill that can randomly and instantly kill your entire party without warningi have never been so let down for a video game before
i had such huge expectations for this game
ill try and not repeat what others have said
this game is so bad it makes x look good
xii was  times better then x  seems like ps developers are focusing to much on graphics instead of game play
this games sucks
bring me back vi and viideal breakers
no towns
no world map
not being able to control each character
vanilles sounds
lack of equipment
linear exploring
story
kidishloved
graphicsthe game is great enjoyable and really beautiful however it came with a card to register the game and in square enix word those codes were disabled and will not be enabled again nor replaced to fit their new formatthe excellent graphics experimental music and surprisingly good voice talent dont compensate for the game actively wrestling away exploration experimentation investigation or really any kind of variable gameplay from youthe storys a sham
characters are poorly written willing to drop three minute speeches about promises or friendship hammering in the most obvious of story points while pretending to have anything close to believable emotions
it is embarrassing to be within earshotto sum it up the games technicolor stupidity will give you a headachewhether youre a fan or not this is unequivocally the absolute worst single player final fantasy  worst single player jrpg  you could possibly imagineall this game accomplished was to show us that the crystal dynamics engine can be pretty
it was a  tech demo
the story is quite good  however the absolutely stale and aggravating game progression disheartening battle system which relies entirely upon rapid paradigm shifts and undeserved trust in your ai partners miserable voice acting excluding lightning snow and hope and overall offensive packaging of this game will leave you gnashing your teeth and forsaking the entirety of japanthe battle system is atrocious
the only times it truly shines are in boss fights and more often than not you are too busy trying not to get utterly destroyed to appreciate how well it actually does work in those rare occasionsthe summons are entirely pointless and were only put in the game arbitrarily because most ff games have summons  eidolons have been in the game before
you can only use one eidolon in a battle and probably only once
only the party leader can use their eidolon
eidolons really dont do much damage eitherthere are no towns
theres one big town aka planet like coruscant but even within that town you dont ever experience a traditional rpg experience where you go in inns and shoppes and whatnot
you do all your shopping through computer terminalsthe upgrades are a very poorly explained system and frankly just annoying
the characters are all jrpg cookie cutter archetypes with bad costumes tossed on them  one of them completely bleeding with racial stereotypesby the end of the game if you suffer long enough to make it to orphans cradle youll hate it
youll fight only massive groups of enemies each of which can easily kill your entire party on its own
assuming you care enough to make it through the last chapter youll get a disappointing endingeven though its maybe  bucks dont waste your money
please dontif youre considering purchasing this game by now youve probably heard the term linear used to describe it
please allow me to clarify when those reviews say that final fantasy is linear they dont mean that the story doesnt allow for much exploration or freelancing
they dont mean that there isnt a vast world for you to explore
by linear they mean that literally you walk in a straight line only stopping every few minutes to fight groups of monsters
those fights by the way essentially consist of hitting x repeatedly for a minute or two
then youll sit through a long cutscene
then youll walk some more before diving right into another cutscene
lather rinse and repeat for oh forty hours or so which is when supposedly you actually do get to explore but the odds of me ever reaching that point are dropping with every boring levela chimpanzee could be taught to play this gamerather than spend  on this game heres what i suggest doing instead go rent that final fantasy movie they released a few years back
that movie like this game had some very nice computer animation
put the movie in your dvd player and hit play
while watching it pause the movie every two minutes and tap the x button on your controller twenty times
then resume the movie
continue doing this until the credits rollnever before have i played a more disappointing game than final fantasy xiiias a relative new player in the final fantasy rpgs i came into this with high hopes
a visual stunner but it is dragged into the mud by poor storylining characterizations that repeat themselves too often and a general emo style of looking at life
gameplay itself is easy but leveling and altering the weapons and gear way too tedius
the game is bogged down by its leveling system that bores you too death by grinding
the graphics are second to none voice acting decent vanille voice and speeches are by far the most reviled but it all wasted on a story that tries to hard to make you care about immature attitudes
not worth  the effort the devopers put into iti like to actually play video games interact with them via a controller with final fantasy  you can start up the game and do other things im playing final fantasy  as i write this in fact
wow i am able to be much more productive at doing other things with this video game
i cooked dinner and they even will fight without you you just have to occasionally toss your team mates a potion so they dont die and youll get a  star rating on your fighting skillsthey should have made this game in a similar style of ff that game had a good balance between game play and videos but this one has just been totally taken over by videos to the point where i just do other things until its time to fight something
just boringtried this final fantasy game after hearing all the hype
i will say to you that this game is overrated for sure and boring
the game play is downright awful and i am not sure what people see in this gameonce again squaresoft has screwed up another ff game
lets face it the best ones are   and  international edition
thats it
i cant believe how they changed things so much in this game
if it aint broke dont fix it
it was so good back then and now its utter garbage
squaresoft needs to just go back get the same game engine get a better story line and dont ever leave out summoning aeons
also leave the linear gaming out of it
in the meantime get demons souls for the ps
its more challenging you have more control over what you do and where you can go its free to play online and its addictive but again challenging and hardonly for true gamerspeace outwhen you see this game in stores be sure to check out the backcover notice the blatant lack of info about the gameplay
its a movie
there is now a moviegame bad enough to compare to heavy rain and its final fantasy xiii  this is an interactive moviethe standard final fantasy game  fight  watch boring cutscene  fight  watch boring cutscene over and over and over on a never ending cycle of repeat forever
all while on the bayonetta system where the game mocks and laughs at you during cutscenes hah you wish you could do this ingamelightning
haha female maincharacters when will developers learn that woman cant do anything other than whip of marella a good meal  stick to the androgynous guy maincharactersif there was an award for the most boring game squareenixs final fantasy xiii would win said award and accept it with a  minute unskippable cutsceneif you want to play a real game that includes rpgs play bad company marella gives this game a solid  out of where should i even begin with final fantasy xiiiwell perhaps lets start with the final fantasy series in general im not a fan and i wont try to hide that
i did thoroughly enjoy final fantasys iv and ix and i can at least appreciate vii and vi but for the most part the series has either left little to no emotional impact on me iiii v and xii or left me seething viii x and x
that all said no matter what my take on each entry was i could at least say this they felt like video gamessadly the same cannot be said for final fantasy xiiifinal fantasy xii decided to speed things up be removing turn based combat and xiii took things one step further by nearly eliminating the player
in combat you only control one of the three members of your party and in the instances when you have access to all six main characters i have no idea what the three not participating are doing as i fight for my life if this leader character is killed sorry knocked out
because giant electrified mech mounted buzzsaws would only give you a concussion you lose even if the rest of the party is still standing
all of this removes so much player agency its depressing
all the time spent leveling characters up and you dont get to use those snazzy new powers yourself the computer does
you dont swing that fancy new gunblade or cast that nifty new spell the ai does
of course the ai party members are stunningly competent and almost always buffdebuffheal whenever it would be needed which alongside their tendency read all the time to attack of their own accord makes it so that at least half the time the game is attacking andor playing itself crippling difficulty outside of a few select boss battles
even worse the overall design hurts as well by raising some rather barbed questions that lay fault over both narrativesetting and gameplay
why is it that soldiers wielding jet packs and sniper rifles get up close to fight
why is a man in a gravity powered duster wait what
more powerful than power armor using soldiers and war mechs
why cant characters do the things they do in cut scenes and occasionally vise versa
all of this wouldnt be so terrible or at least less noticeable if combat wasnt so repetitive essentially boiling down to one of the same few partially interchangeable stratagems
even the much touted paradigm shifts just come down switching between all out offense tanking and healingmaking matters worse is the linearity in leveling up
the crystarium is just a straight path twisted into a spiral with a few meaningless off shoots that are nearly impossible to miss
theres no decision making no picking between abilities no customization
even after the game allows you to level a character in multiple paradigms its a pointless matter
for example why would i bother leveling hope a mage like character in the commando read fighter tree when his commando powers max out a lesser degree than the three thats right three other commandos i had all of whom were almost maxed out in those trees by the time hope had access to them and all of whom i had access to at any point in the game you will never be without a proper party setup
leveling characters outside of their initial paradigm decks offers too little reward or even point to actually be bothered with and the game can be completed to full without even really bothering
of course given the strict no frills linear approach to the crystarium theres no fun to be had so the process of leveling up becomes tedious busy work
weapon upgrading is also a chore as the game literally doesnt explain it
no tutorial datalog or even an adequate description in the manual
of course once the process is demystified by going on a wiki in my case it too renders itself partially inconsequential
theres no way to tell what at level a weapon maxes out at or when and thus no way to tell if your new weapon is worse than your current one or if you just wasted several hours upgrading the old one well no way to tell without a strategy guide in one hand
it becomes very infuriating very quicklyand yes the world map is also very linear so much so that it becomes restrictive and even nonsensical why is a forest or an open plain this empty and so much like a hallway
things do open up slightly some twenty hours in but not by much and if i may be blunt why should i have to wait  hours for a game to expand or even get good as so many fans have told me
why ant the game be good and openly presented from the onset
even traditional old platformers such as mario or castlevania werent this claustrophobictraditionally in a final fantasy title narrative is important nearly as much as leveling is which somewhat explains the deficiencies in plot and setting
nothing makes even the remotest sense and very little is explained in the game itself
too often the player is forced to read datalog entries to explain basic things including villain motivation protagonist motivation mythos technology locations history plot points basic setting concepts what just happened etc and many times these datalog explanations dont really help
for example the falcie the god like antagonists are said to be beyond human understanding and can only communicate to humans in hazy dreamlike imagesexcept for their leader
why can he talk and not the others
how can he
how is that the falcie are said to not be able to take action against humanity but their leader can start invasions and they all have the ability to brand humans as slaves to carry out missions
those plot points the ones about talking and falcie not harming humanity are only in the datalogs and honestly just punch even bigger holes in the story and setting and the setting is so poorly presented that not only is it difficult to care about but its nearly impossible to tell where any location is in relation to any other
its not as if this story couldnt have worked
god like figures made to serve man but who strive only to seek their maker and can only work to achieve that goal by enslaving humans to complete magical quests that achieve their goals for them
that sounds brilliant
too bad the writing is so inept the plot dies a new death every five or so minutes and thus cannot sustain such a premiseconsidered on all levels final fantasy xiii doesnt even feel like a game but rather a very very poorly written thought out and explained movie that occasionally lets you putter around with the menu options
yes the game is pretty and the music lovely but its wasted on something so emotionally hollow narratively dead and player restrictive star out of fivethis game has dumb stories written all over it to the point that i am playing it just to laugh at the retarded cut scenes involving dumb characters that talk about nonsense and argue with one another every  minuteslightning is rude and mean and ditches weaker allies all the time for no reason and i cannot believe anyone can like this character she has no soul
hope is a little b if ive ever seen one and i cannot believe the unrealistic grudge he has on another character who is one of the nicest personalities in the whole game
oh and he likes to mumble about things like there is no hope for us no pun intended or only thing awaiting us is quick death what the hell
really this kid is messed up on so many levels and his mom must have not liked him either because she abandoned him to go join a dumb fight that ended up killing hervanille is apparently a kid as she is referred that way by another character many times but she looks adult and acts like a  year old would
she is brainless and i believe she suffers from a congenital defect that has impaired her intelligence level quite a bitall these characters have no real objectives bicker all the time just so that they can have cutscenes every  minutes and they change their views goals and whatever all the time that it is best to disregard anything that come out of their stupid mouths because they dont make much senselightning is like i am going to save serah and then when snow says i am going to save serah she is like thats impossible
and then when lightning is left with hope she is like snow is going to save serahwhat the hell is going onvanille is like lets go hope you have something to say to snow
so they follow snow and then when they meet him neither of them mention why they are here so snow disregards them
and as soon as snow leaves hope is like i has something to tell snow
grrrr and vanille is like oh yeah
you need to tell him
and same thing repeats about  timessnow tells hopes mother are you sure you want to fight
mom ignores hope and is like hell yeah lets go fight and dies
and then tells snow please take care of him and snow is left puzzled save who
really
obviously her son you idiot and when hope reveals his grudge snow is shocked omg now it all makes sense to meso in a nutshell horrible story matched by an equally unappealing gameplay involving hours of a very narrow linear path following involving different but equally dumb charactersediti forgot to mention what is actually good about this shining piece of turd graphically and aesthetically simply a stunning work of art some memorable tunes snow and fang were somewhat likeablelets put this very simple the game is so boring it feels like its never ever going to end don t believe any review above  stars or any game sites that give high ratings to this crap i still remember reading the review at gamespot a part that read the following the game gets intesting for a while after  hours are you for real no one in a normal state of mind  besides me  would dare to buy a game that gets interesting only for a while and on top of that only after the first  hours time of your life that you wont get backthe game is boring right after the first hour and you start fearing for the worst but you keep your hope up and keep on playing thats when it gets worst after about  hours or so you start really wishing the game ends no matter what it takes then at the famous  hour mark where the game gets exciting you notice its still the same and nothing has happened this is no exageration the game ends around  or so hours better start to think about buying a turbo controller so you dont have to press so much the x button cause thats all you do in this games it came to the point that i was begging my friend to trade it for a scratched lego indiana jones game that belonged to his litlle brother and he hasnt talked to me sincethe story is so cheesy and overdramatic extremelly overdramatic  more than me i would say  that everytime i hear the characters talk or see a cutscene coming up i mute my tvi have honestly thrown up twice just of hearing all the la cie fal cie cacoon sanctum crap im going crazy there are no beautiful towns at all or shops or anything at all just walking and walking and more walking and to nowhere which is more anoying 
there are no beasts or monsters probably only like  or  in some cutscenes its only robotsthere is no socializing with other people or even your own crew at all there is no need to buy items plus if you wanted you cant cause all items are to expensiveyou cant get gil from battles or chests very very very very rare to get money here in this game  enemies drop items that are useless and worth like  gil and and the least expensive usable item costs there is no leveling upcant control all characters just the leader and if he dies game over cant pass to the next alive everyone else is on auto pilot  including you i guess cause all there is time to do is autobattle pressing x eliminating any chance to create any strategy plus there is no no need for oneno rare and exciting weapons or items to findboring as hell storyline is dumb and hard to follow
fighting system is the worst i have played
would not recommend to anyonesquare enix has gone downhill and never looked back was indeed the biggest disappointmenti will keep this short and simplefirst of all the story is too linear
i thought it was okay as long as story is good but it isnt it is overall very cliche and the story does not feel complete at all turns out square enix seems to be taking the advantage of the existing fan base and plans to squeeze out more money from the players by making a sequelsecond character development this is the first ff game that i cannot find a lovable character
the characters personalities felt vague i cant help but think that square enix spent too much time on the graphic and totally forgot to take care character development this also apply to story as wellthird battle system too simple even a  year old can beat the game without a sweat
if i were to play a game for  hours and its story sucks characters are dull the gameplay experience better be good and square enix failed againsome of you may think giving it a  star is too harsh but this is how disappointed i am i will not buying another ff game again sighmpst rpgs come from japan and while japanese rpgs are good i wish theyd stop cluttering up the entire screen during battles with a menue system
for example this game final fantasy  uggghhh
im sick and tired of fighting in the menue system and having to constantly access it in order to do something
it takes away the fun of playing the game
the japanese need to learn from western type rpgs and not over complicate the game play as games like fable and mass effect have already figured out and are now doingok now let me put the brakes on the bitchin for a moment does this mean that i hate final fantasy
no
i own  of these games with ff being my personal favorite out of the series
does this mean that i think the gameplay should be dumbed down
no
i dont think the gameplay should be dumbed down to just simple button mashing so that a person with the attention span of a pineapple can enjoy playing it
what i do mean is this i just wish that what i see on screen isnt blocked by too much words  numbers
visually i wanna appreciate what i see on screen without words and numbers getting in the way
i also didint like the fact that i have to spend hours and hours leveling up the characters upgrading weapons  assembling them together with dumb items to make them stronger and getting eidolons those mighty pokemon type giant magical thingamajiggys that look really cool and are supposed to help you out in battle but in truth are useless and weak as wet cardboard
the camera in ff also moved around way too much during battle i had no significant control over it and i hated this while i was playing the game
oh and if anyone is wondering yes i did beat the game and also all  of the marks or super bosses if you wanna call them thisare jrpgs a dying breed
no i dont think so
but i do think that the problem with most jrpgs is that what was fresh and exciting when they all first came out  or  years ago has now been eclips by other rpg advancements in a gaming industry that quickly evolves
instead of keeping pace or leading the pack jrpgs seems all too happy to just continue to say if it aint broke why fix it
and linger in the shadows of other games such as mmorpgs fps and platformers
western rpg game developers tend to blend fps elements into their games but at least you have to give credit to wrpgs for doing this
it all may not be perfect yet but theyre on to somethingi have played many squaresoft games i started with chrono trigger in snes then moved back in time to final fantasy vi then final fantasy v and iv later vii on psone and chrono cross the iii combo in gameboy advance and the last one i played was the final fantasy iii remake for ds
one of my little plans in life was to win every offline final fantasy game so far from i to vii it is donebecause i dont have as many available time as before it was very difficult for me to continue with the viii which i started for psone and left after a mission to some island that was many years agobuti decided to start from the newest and go back to viii again for this endeavor i purchased a ps with my brothers and final fantasy xiii what happened between vii and xiii
this isnt final fantasy
viii was becoming boring and without excitement but i thought that was corrected in ix and onwards how mistaken i wasfinal fantasy xiii is boring the linear argument is real the characters arent likable the story doesnt have any appeal
they should have named this game something like interactive movie in a setting that looks like pandora from avatar with d characters that have d personality thats one dimension less than the snes d characters who felt as real people you may have wished to know in some gamesone thing i can positively comment on are the graphics they are gorgeous and look like places i have visited
the music is repetitive i left the game at the chapter when sazh and vanille are together and the weather changes from rainy to sunnymy objective of playing all the offline final fantasy games is now pointless
i should start collecting coins or something
oh and my brothers seem to have bought a ps for a fraction of the price hehebetween the butchered battle system and making the game accessible to the addfps crowd the game is all style and no substancethe story is not intriguing the battle system is tedious and exploration hardly existssave your money because unless all you care about is graphics there isnt much to like hereits funny i used to be this hardcore square fanboy and ive now watched the final fantasy series spiral all the way down the toiletsquareenix was more focused on sales rather than making a good game and it showsi dont understand why it took so long to release this game when there isnt that much to it
besides the graphics which are pretty amazing there isnt much to enjoydont eat this tripe thats sold to you as steakthis game has chosen to take away everything that has defined it for the last  years which is the role playing
this is no longer an rpg
its just a turn based arcade fighting game
the story is typical cheesy anime jrpg stuff its weak compared to previous ff games
people are being taken over by some sort of magical force and turned into zombies or something but its mostly incoherent
i dont mean cool george romero or resident evil zombies either
you basically cannot explore at all
you cannot even fight as more than one character or organize your party when in combat
the music falls flat compared to ffx which had the best soundtrack and i still listen to
imagine if a grand theft auto game took out the ability to freely roam the city or experience the game how you want
that is pretty much what square enix did to this gamewhat were they thinking
this isnt a final fantasy game
its a bad movie where you press the x button over and over again during battle scenes
that is all
there is no exploring
no shops
no fun
just running forward pressing x over and over and over again watching a boring and lengthy cutscene and then running forward and pressing xthis is quite literally the worst game ive ever played
i usually try harder with these reviews but the people at square didnt try at all to make a game so why should i make any real effort to review it
if youre tempted by its low price dont be  it isnt worth it
i promise you as a fan of earlier final fantasy games you will be disappointed
and when i tell you all the game is is running forward and pressing x and then watching a boring cutscene it is the truthavoid this game like the plague
i wont even sell it used as i want no one to have to suffer through this title
i am genuinely surprised by how bad this title was and would be interested in knowing what in the world the developers were thinkingarguments have raged for decades about which final fantasy game is the best in the series
square must have been tired of this debate because they put in what must have been an extraordinary effort to create the very worst game in the series and a serious contender for the very worst video game of all time
truly my command of the english language is simply not up to the task of conveying how awful an atrocity this game isits not merely slapped together
it is clear that considerable time and talent was harnessed to shape this foul turd
it manages to distill the very essence of terrible from every jrpg trope while simultaneously eliminating every positive aspect and charm that is normally implicit in the genrethe irony is that ff games started out as the openworld free roaming game
they are now as linear as it gets with only rail shooters giving you less freedom
this game furthers that sad trendthis game gives the illusion of freedom in how you build characters
unfortunately its only the freedom to choose wrong
it would have been better if they just gave you rigid classes so you knew what they wantedthe grind on this game is ridiculous
ff games have always had a grind in them but its usually something extra to get ridiculously powerful and twoshot the end boss or something
here its a necessary part of gameplayunless perhaps you know the exact arbitrary build required in order to get through everything in the game ahead of timeplot  having a contrived and overly complicated plot is standard for these types of games but at least you usually end up caring or having sympathy for the protagonist or their world
here i didnt care
all of the protagonists were so whiny and the supporting characters so dumb i couldnt find myself caring about anyone or anything in this gamecharactersok its a jrpg so its a given that youre going to have a group of annoying dimensional characters with some overly overly pronounced character trait spelled out in story neon lights that will go through horribly contrived and artificial character development steps if they even do develop to becomeslightly less annoying dimensional characters
theyve managed to actually make this character development step into a game mechanic in this game final fantasys usual lb sledge of subtlety has been upgraded to a lb sledge of subtlety
note i have to say step because an arc would imply something smooth and potentially organicunlike most jrpgs the characters are entirely devoid of any form of charm or charisma
theres not even a single likable character in the bunch
this is the only final fantasy game since the characters have had personalities ff
where i loath each and every single charactergameplay  the illusion of choicethe battle system seems like an interesting idea and credit where credit is due im glad they do try to innovate the approach to combat
the downside is this ones junk
you only have direct control over one character and even then youre usually too busy juggling paradigms to assign their moves directly
therefore most of what your character does is autopilot and everything your allies do is autopilot
allies are supposed to gang up on the enemy you are currently attacking but it frequently bugs out so they start attacking a different enemy or will even sit there the entire battle without using a single abilityso the one thing you do have fine control over is the paradigm basically a set of premade you can organize ability roles for the party
you can choose which roles to have which party members specialize in and form a group to your liking
sounds neatbut its too good to be true
if you dont level your characters up just right in a very specific way youll end up having to do several hours of grinding
at too many points in the game youll end up fighting some boss with a predetermined set of characters requiring a set of roles that you may or may not have upgraded for them
whats that you were using that character as a commando
well guess what were going to toss you into the battle where they are absolutely required to be a sentinel
whats that
youve been using that character as a ravager
well the one ability at the end of the enhancer path is a requirement for this battlelooks like youre going to have to go grind for  hours and unlock that ability if you want to progressif youve managed to avoid this piece of trash then kudos to you
i recommend you continue to avoid itafter spending some quite some time with this game i find it to be one of the worst japanese rpgs i have played in a while
for those interested its very much a turn based game but you get  or more moves per character that take up so much of your atb bar
once you get  or  atb slots you can hit enemies with a long range elemental spell and then follow up with a meele attack or two
finding the best way to stagger causes enemy to take more damage an enemy is quite unique and despite how fluid and action heavy the combat looks its still the classic turn based game you knowthe story is very well put together allowing you to pick exactly how deep or not you want to explore the games world and mythos
you can progress along and just watch things unfold or there are also texts to read that clue you into the story on a deeper levelthe leveling up system is similar to the sphere grid from ff x  but a bit easier to manage the same can be said for the pary ai system which plays like a simplified version of the gambits system from ff xii 
with different sets that you can switch between on the fly during battle paradigm shiftthe games locations seem linear but progression is still at your own pace enemies do respawn so you can level grind as you see fit and while the maps are so far straight paths the enviroments do not look it you dont feel like your walking in a tunnelthe voice overs are stale and mostly emotionless though each person will likely love or hate particular ones and the slight changes to the soundtrack are mostly for the better
you wont be listening to my hands when you first power up the gamethe characters are vacant espers lightning is like a mix of cloud and squalls best qualities imobut with no real reason for the player to get attached to hergraphically the game is astounding you have never seen better graphics from the facial animations to the clothing textures its all top notch
this game easily puts the other rpgs this gen to shame japanese or western
for those wanting direct examples ffxiii on ps easily look better then mass effect  dragon age origins and fallout when i couldnt skip over the opening cinematic when my roommate kept using the second controller to make me jump to my death when my roommate kept using the second controller to shoot me with my meteorites when i couldnt adjust the camera to keep track of mario i shut this thing off and went back to sea monsters
also there were way too many jitneys in this gamethis game got boring within  minutes of playing it
mario is starting to grow stale unfortunately
could have been betterwhen i got the game it was all scratched up and when i tried to play it wouldnt even load the st world the seller said it was tested and gauranteed but it definately didnt seem like thatwas the casemany associate the mario games with fun
i associate the name mario for one mediocre platformer from the ss and a load of marketing hype and crazed fanboystheres no real story the weak and uninteresting main character has no personality the platforming has been done better before all the innovations  most of them eonold rehashes  feel forced no sense of completion can be gained and the fun the game radiates seems falsei suggest playing spyro the dragon for ps insteadi dont see what all the hype is about
this game is so generic and people only like it because its mario
if you took the exact same game and gave it a different title with a slightly different main character everyone would hate itpeople who love this game need to seek psychiatric treatment because they are not in love with the game but only the concept of mario and thus their childhood
if you look at the game itself it has aweful graphics the controls are horrible and all you do is jump from platform to platform yawn
people need to grow up get a grip on reality and think outside the 
boxmy family and i are super smash bros addicts
we played the n version almost daily and when melee appeared we happily switched to it
so needless to say when brawl came out i snapped it up
i even bought a wii for its sakei am so foolish for not renting it firstsomething struck me as odd about it from day one but i still played it religiously seeking to amass the entire roster and earn every trophy sticker and level
for a while this manic pursuit hid many of its glaring flaws from me
but i finally realized when i earned jigglypuff that this was not the game that i had fallen in love with in middle schoolfirst of all dont play this with the wiimote
you need to move precisely and for that you should get a gamecube controllerstory mode outright stinks
its a platformer straight and simpleand what a sucky platformer it is
not since bit adventure games have i died more times because of surprising death traps hidden just off screen or characterkilling abysses that magically appear at the worst moments
the story is all kinds of goofy and far too long
its only fun if you play with a friend
as far as being introduced to all of the characters in the gameits a good idea
but other than that why would you want to play itonline mode also stinks
you have to play with anonymous random players and you cant play with friends unless you have their codes
also if youre playing in random online matches you cant sit with your buddy in the same room and play in a random online match together
what
why
you can do this when youre connected with a friend but its just not the same thingthere are now so many items that it is crowded and overly complicated
some items are so small that you have no idea what you have grabbed until you chunk it at someone
these are problems i never would have foreseen
smash balls are irritating merely a way to disrupt game play
the appearance of one starts everyone on a wild chase across the level until one annoying sod grabs it and then starts nabbing cheap kosits hard for me not to compare the rest of this game to melee because melee did it so right
my family have played melee for seven years
all other games were beaten and set aside to gather dust we played this one every day
so please excuse me as i contrast and comparebrawl is a great deal like melee but has some small differences that make a big impact on how the game is played
in melee every character played differently and had to be learned and it was difficult to kill a good player by button mashing
but in brawl they all play the same way
you can button mash very successfully
i knew something was wrong when i could switch around from character to character and regardless of who the character was play them all equally wellalso for some reason it seems like the heavy hitters dont do a lot of damage like they should like bowser king dedede donkey kongall characters i prefer
take bowser
a wellplaced headbutt in melee and i could kill somebody pretty quickly
now it takes two or three good headbutts to finally kill somebody
whether this is because the levels are higher and wider or the moves are weaker im not certain
theyve also neutered some of the more powerful moves like jigglypuffs rest and rolloutin fact just the way theyve knocked off jigglypuff as a power player really irritates me
i used to play her all of the time to freak people out because in melee it was very difficult to control her and use her powerful moves
if you mastered the moves you could be terrifying
i can only imagine that the games developers had friends who were good with jigglypuff because now she is basically useless
rest is just a good way to have a smash attack centered on your fat fluffy head
rollout is like being lightly tapped by an old woman
and sing doesnt put anyone to sleep longer than two seconds
why did they even bother to put her on the rosterone of my pet peeves is the way you fall in brawl you float gently down to earth like a fairy angel
in melee every character had a certain weightgravity and fell in different realistic ways
this does affect how you fighthow quickly you can jump back into battle and how easily others can aim for you
jigglypuffs slow falls in melee made her an excellent target for links arrows and samuss rockets fox who practically smashes into the ground in one second is another storynow lets talk about the levels
you remember the ice climber level from melee
you know that one you didnt play because you have to think about jumping up to the next level every five seconds
what made them think we needed more levels like that
in brawl several of the levels are just fricking annoying
you often have to concentrate more on dealing with the problems that the level gives you rather than fighting other characters
for example in one level all of your directional buttons are switched around so that you have to play with opposite buttons
i cannot stress enough how unbelievably annoying this is
several levels have so much going on at one time that its mindboggling
not to say that environmental peril cant be funit is
and yes some of the levels got the right balance of environmental peril and character play rightbut very few
the pirate ship pictochat and the wario level are hilarious and awesome for example
nothing like chucking your enemy into a bomb on the pirate shiplong story short brawl is easier to pick up by new players plays more like a fluffy arcade game and seems to be geared for little kids who arent used to disappointment
this can be good and it can be bad and obviously if youve never played the other games in the franchise you may not give a care
but for an old melee player this feels like nothing short of a tragedy
i suppose its all right in the end my family and i still go to melee over brawlwhen i first got this game i probably would have rated it higher
its got an allstar nintendo cast with a couple of special guests from thirdparty titles and an interesting adventure modemy problem with this game and i realize im in a small minority here is that the controls are just plain terrible and ruin the overall experience
i managed to get through a lot of subspace emissary or whatever its called and unlocked most if not all of the characters but the game does not allow the save data to be backed up and when my wii broke down for some unexplainable reason those morons at nintendo repair erased all the data when they fixed te console
having to unlock everything again is not fun
its the opposite of fun
its a crapfest with lousy controls that can make simple tasks like hitting switches and even jumping from on platform to another a frustrating chore
i dont know who thought requiring analog controls for sidescrollers was a good idea but that person should be banned from having any input for game design
the dpad can be used for moving but only when using the wii remote alone which has more limited buttons with a classic controller and gamecube controller which only works with older wiis its control stick only while the dpads are used for taunting and if you can somehow pull it off changing samus lookthe occasional autoscrolling in the adventure mode that i originally saw in super mario bros  also adds to the frustrationnow i get what some of you might be thinking this guy sucks at video games and is blaming the games for his problems i need only wait for some comments to confirm this
if you dont find the controls terrible then youll probably love this game but that doesnt mean everyone has toand in case youre wondering if this is some sort of sony fanboy rant i dont care for playstation allstars battle royale either that game is little more than a pisspoor clone albeit with different characters that blatantly reminds the player of the premium addon content he or she didnt buy on the selection screensi may edit my review from time to time but im not changing my mind no matter how much flaming backlash i geti couldnt get into this game
the peak of the series was the gamecube edition
this just seems like a copy and paste job by nintendothis game is crap compared to melee
i hope they take away that  i suck at this game so every time i respawn i respawn with a super move that i experienced with players that sucked
theres a reason the recent evo fighting game tourney had ssbm and not brawlwell good things first i loved the controllers which were the most feared aspect of the whole game cause i for my opinion hate the control for the wii improved graphics not much thoughnow the bad things online is terrible i knew this was not going to end good cause its nintendo they dont know how to make good online games online is going to start to be chargedthis came from the president of nintendo
this is probably not going to be as much as xbox but still feels terrible single mode was badly planned out same as melee just a plain dissapointmentif anyone has different opinions that might be cause the wii has no games
and i own one
it was the worse  dollars i ever spend
all i wanted was paper mariodisapointment as well and thisi now use my ps all the time cause that has great and fun lasting gamessorry nintendoisnt going to win any awards any time soon
this concept of arcade has been done so many times its gotten very old
its graphics are poor its excitement level last for all of about  minutes
save your money
however mario galaxy was great get that one insteadgraphic superiority cant suplant the better storyline and gameplay options of the original
bottomline not allowing a variety or character classes to choose from such as shadow marshal or field agent kills this game in my opinion
youre forced to play a character with next to no depth in a scenario that pales in comparison to the original
i traded in this game with no hesitation after a single play through whereas i have played the original again recently and in my opinion is still far superior even with the numerous glitches
unless youre a teenager or have the mentality of one ignore this sequal and hope they get it right in the third installment though that is probably unlikely seeing as how i have yet to see any critics or players have the same issues that i have with killzone   this title is dead to mei went to various ps sites and this was in many as a top  ps game
why
this game totally sucks
a complete ripoffcopy of pss black just not as fun entertaining or original
let me describe
in killzone  you play a soldier that runs down corridors and bad guys with red eyes shoot at you
then you shoot them and they die
so then you go down another long corridor or up a ladder and at the end of the corridor or ladder there is surprise more bad guys with red eyes shooting at you
so you throw a couple hand grenades and kill them or shoot them
then they die or red splatters fill the screen and my soldier dies
then i shoot crates and get more grenades
sigh
this game is unoriginal monotonous tedioustotal garbage and i question why people and ps sites recommend itthere is nothing new about this shooter that entices me to buy it
i played the demo as soon as it came out and wasnt impressed
after its release i bought it because of all the reviews by users came pouring in
i made the mistake of listening to brainwashed ps lovers who said the demo doesnt do the game justice and it is so much better in every wayi think that people that purchased a ps thinking it would be king of consoles embrace this game because it is an exclusive
if your not a blind fanboy and have more than one system  i have an xboxpswii and pc you will see that there really isnt a lot new or special on this one
i think ps fanboys are really struggling to convince themselves they own the best system
cod and cod waw far surpass this sorry game
 the controls are terrible boring story boring characters terrible premise
 very generic and calculated game you constantly feel this has been done before
 graphics are good but not as impressive as a playstation fan wants you to believe the textures are terriblewait until this is dirt cheap or buy something better like codafter reading all the great reviews i was very much looking forward to this game
however after playing it around  to  hours i am left with much disappointment
if you want a great first person shooter for your ps go with modern warfare  or resistance   if you want a game that looks good but plays terrible killzone  is your game
overall i really regret buying killzone  and cant see how this game got all the good reviews
i am guessing it is because it is a playstation exclusiveprosgraphics are pretty good though not any more impressive than resistance  or modern warfare lots of effort has been put in cinematicsconscontrol feel is terrible
the reaction of your characters movement lags aiming is slow and imprecise
it feels like my character is trying to walk on ice without slippinglots of  second pauses throughout the game ruin the feel of the gamegame feels like it is running in slow motion
i havent checked the frames per second but i wouldnt be surprised if the frames per second drop to under your guy is very short but isnt
during all the cutscenes it is obvious you are as tall as anyone else but when playing the game you are literally two feet shorter than everyone elsecharacters are a joke
main character has no personality
everyone else is a caricaturehuge disappointment
hearing the massive hype i fell for this games ruse and bought it  average graphics slow framerate and terrible story without anything interesting gameplaywise to make up for it
most certainly a flop
dont waste your timei bought this game to play bot matches online with my friends  but then the day after release sony deactivated this feature
even though it says you can play bots on the box you cant anymore unless you want to play all by yourselflamei would return it if i couldthis is the least inspired of all the zelda games
its as if the developers decided hey we got a great formula here that just prints out cash for us so they just plug in x variable into the zelda formula and outputs y results which then bags them instant 
the player goes from minigame to puzzle to fetch quest to puzzle another minigame over and over again
some gamers like this formula but how many fetch quests can you really dothe biggest crime this game commits is its repetitive tasks
i spent a good amount of time collecting small pieces of crystal shards to form a nice big gem only to have it yanked away and then have to find more pieces again
why
it breaks the contract between the player and the game
if the player has to do certain repetitive tasks then the developers have to reward the player in some way not make the player start all over again
it feels like ive wasted my time and effort
if you like fetch quests this is the game for you
but if you like doing repetitive tasks then maybe you should gold farm in wow and get actual cash in return for your effort
if i kill  wolves i should level up and not have to kill another  squids just because its the next thing to doin contrast wind waker felt like a breath of fresh air it had a wonderfully new vibe a narrative that guides the story along as well as innovative gameplay
what does tp have
wolf formso you can sniff the ground to do more fetch quests
the wolf form and twilight realm reeks of a cheap gimmick to fit the zelda formula for new gameplay
the first few dungeonspuzzles are ok but soon they become bland
for some reason people hate the ww cel shaded link what do they want marcus link fenix
wws link fits the fresh new world hes not just another bland space marine
tp feels like the same bland link with bland dungeons and bland worldplaying this game felt like i was holding my breath the entire time
i kept thinking to myself itll get better ill turn around the corner and itll be fun again all i need to do is solve this puzzle and then itll be fun but no the usual zelda charm remains however
the game is polished to a sheen and the art direction is beautiful
but i cant keep holding my breath waiting for something that will never comeif youre a zelda fan then youll like this game otherwise skip it
the developers are banking on their tried and true zelda formula to bring in the big bucks
what is a zelda game with uninspired gameplay and bland dungeons
hopefully the next zelda wii game skyward sword will learn from tps mistakes and give the faithful zelda fans what they deserve  an inspired gameworld and fresh innovative gameplayi ordered the wrong game for wii i dont have a wii so i gave it to a friend
they said it played very goodi just finished this game a moment ago and boy all i can say is booooooooring
what was with that ending
hyrule castle and final fight
too short and rushed
like the latter half of the game as a wholethe ending of wind waker was legendary
i yawned once i finished twilight princesslisten this game had a wonderfull beginning
i liked the cutscenes and the first time i transformed into a wolf i was in awe
but then i hated how weak and rushed the plot became
why the hell did those orcs just drop the kids somewhere
and around the time ilia got her memory back the plot fizzled completely
also the plot in this game was too little about triforce history the worldland of hyrule etc
they were touched really superficiallythe plot and dialogue were extremely inferior compared to wind wakertwilight princess was boring choppy and jumpy after a great beginningand the dungeons
something was severely lacking
in the beginning they were ok though nothing great but then they got horrible
like the city in the sky and twilight realm
horriblei guess they went for quantity not quality
the dungeons were boring and repetitive the puzzles old and they lacked any atmospherealso if i remember correctly in wind waker you had to use many of the items you had acquired in different places
not herethis game was also way too easy
im not a good player honestly but i never once died during the game
as a matter of fact i was near perfect health nearly all the time
once you got the master sword you just needed to swing the nunchuk and the enemies would vanish
i mean id want standard enemies that would be at least as tough as ganon was in the final swordfightthe bosses were also very easy and somehow lamer than in wind wakeri liked the wii controls and they were well planned and easy to use
but i have one complaint
circling behind an enemys back really didnt work that well
first you had to sidestep and then roll
but guess what most of the time the roll sidestep brought you around the enemy to where you started
it was irritating though not by any means impossible to hit the enemies in the backoh and why did most of the characters have to look so retarded
they showed with some models that they could make neat looking ones as wellriding on the horse was the greatest part of this gameyou should really buy wind waker instead of this
people complain about the graphics but theyre quite nice once you get used to them
and did i mention that the dialogue and plot are awesome
the triforce hunt is the only annoying and tedious part of that game
tp felt the same all the time after the beginning
just scores of poorly designed dungeons and a choppy and weak plotthe wii version of twilight princess absolutely must never be played by anyone who has experienced the smooth easy and fluent controls of the gamecube version
the wii version will make you so mad and frustrated once you find out how much you were lied to by the frauds at ign and game trailers who constantly raved about its perfect controls and exciting gameplay
please
in this version of the game there is a floating fairy that corresponds to the position of the wii mote with the tv and sensor bar and you are required to keep this fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else link will walk off in another direction constantly falling off annoying small and big ledges causing you to lose your balance and slowing you down immensely
your wrist will very quickly become strained from having to aim the wii mote dead center in the middle of the screen continually during gameplay
sometimes in the heat of the moment if you accidentally aim the fairy too high too low too far to the left or too far to the right of the screen you have to struggle for a few seconds to get the fairy pointing back to where you want it to be because theres a major lag when it goes to one of the ends of the screen
this major flaw ruined the game
the fairy ruined this game
the game became unplayable because of this major flaw and i refused to play past the first dungeon because of this major flaw with the controls
the game is unplayablethe frauds on youtube constantly boasted about how perfect this game was making statements about how wonderful the wii mote controls are and how good it feels to swing the sword around
total bs
total bs
you dont swing the sword around at all
all you do is flick your wrist around and link moves the sword in correspondence to a predetermined set of directions
you cant aim where the sword goes it goes either in an upwarddownward slice a horizontal leftright slash or a forward stab
and nothing more
you cant move the sword around like a virtual reality game as it was advertised to be you cant move the sword in any direction you want the sword goes in a limited predetermined set of directionsthe shield was even worse remember windwaker ocarina of time majoras mask you held a button when you wanted the shield and let go of the button when you didnt want the shield
this added an element of challenge and fun to the zelda franchise
when nintendo designed twilight princess they decided to remove all elements of challenge and fun from the game in both the gamecube and wii versions
in the gamecube version when you pressed the l button to target an enemy the shield will be constantly in use and you will never ever get hit by an enemy making it the easiest zelda during the time with no challenge no fun no strategy
the wii version my goodness its the exact same problem except that when you need to hit an enemy with the shield you had to punch at the screen with the nunchuk in hand and the annoying wire connecting the nunchuk to the wii mote would flicker about when doing this
thats a good reason not to advertise the wii mote as a wireless controller because its not wireless when you have to connect the nunchuk to itthe annoying challenge when fishing in ocarina of time from having to hold down on both the r and the a buttons has become even worse in this game
imagine those same issues except you have to cast with the wii mote by flinging it in a throwing motion across the screen than when a fish bites having to pull up for long minutes hurting your wrist as the wii mote vibrates with its built in rumble feature
bad enough
how about this you have to rotate the nunchuk in a circular motion hurting your other arm simply to reel the fish in
this doesnt feel like real fishing stop lying to yourselves
this was by no means a successful execution of a fishing simulationhorse back riding was destroyed by the wii mote and nunchuk since you have to keep the on screen fairy dead center in the middle of the screen or else the horse like link will also move in another direction slowing you down where it takes forever for her to regain momentum and balance after running you into obstacles and cliffs
just flick your wrist to make link slash at enemies making the onscreen fairy move all about causing you to lose balance just so you can fight the only three boar riding moblin archers in all of hyrule fieldsame thing when controlling the wolf
controlling the wolf is even more annoying having to flick your wrist with the wii mote to make him attack in the direction corresponding to the onscreen fairy
in the gamecube version the wolf is very well balanced and doesnt usually fall off annoying cliffs if you dont move perfectly
in this version its much worse because you have to keep the fairy dead center in the middle of the screen while moving the wolf making him jump from cliff to cliff or when flicking your wrist to attack enemies
all of this makes the wolf controls needlessly challenging in the wii versionthis is awful this was the worst experience ive ever had playing zelda
bottom line all the same problems that are present in the gamecube version with the lack of challenge really easy to kill enemies and bosses are in this version but this version is much worse because of the controls of the wii mote and nunchuk
i only bought the nintendo wii just to see if the wii version of this game was superior to the gamecube version as i was lead to believe it was more challenging
the only challenge came from the atrocious controls of the wii mote and nunchukyes because metroid is one of nintendos most longrunning and successful gaming franchises metroid prime  had no choice but to be created and released
but you know its certainly nowhere near a classic because its basically a watered down less interesting sequel but with slightly improved graphics and sweetlooking explosions
actually the explosions arent necessarily better than the first two prime games but i found myself admiring them more this time around perhaps because i was bored out of my mind in so many other waysremember the original metroid on the nes metroid  return of samus on the game boy and super metroid on the super nes
these games were released a long time ago and what made them so fantastic was how the gameplay emphasis on each of them was on explorationin metroid prime  you predictably go through one hallway after another shooting whatever you see
while its somewhat fun the lack of exploring hurts the game a lot and prevents it from having much in the way of replay value
i also hate how it takes such a long time to defeat some of the bosses in the game
it was never like that in the past playing the d metroid games i mean
are you kidding me
 minutes to completely eliminate one boss battle
why in the heck does it take so darn long
this complaint holds true with the previous two prime games as well
thats a major unforgiveable problemalso and this is a pretty big complaint the regular enemies you encounter while going through these numerous oneway hallways are usually small horribly animated and just boring to watchfight
nothing compared to the enemies in the first two prime games
were talking dreadfully boring enemies to the point you sometimes find yourself just preferring to run past them and not waste a single moment fighting them
im extremely disappointed here
it makes me think the third installment in the series is an obvious milk job by nintendobesides the first hour of the gameplay being extremely tedious and boring because youre doing nothing but talking to soldiers like its a borderline rpg game exploring generic computer rooms that weve seen to death in thousands of other video games and admiring constant bluegrayish colors throughout every single wall located on every single hallway yes thats sarcasm the game eventually changes so youre exploring different areas of land by way of your spaceship
too bad each of these lands ends up missing the mark and looking rather dull compared to the previous metroid prime games
actually its more like a poor imitation of previous effortsthats not quite the biggest issue i have with the exploration feature however
the biggest problem is that the game is nothing more than a lengthy series of miniature and narrow hallways constantly taking you to even more miniature and narrow hallways
youre probably wondering why i keep saying narrow and its because for the most part the hallways are exceptionally tiny and uninteresting
its like so much effort was put into the background graphics which are overrated by the way the game doesnt look that great that the development team thought they could get away with slacking off on the level design
i dont think so if a games not fun to play its not worth my time
basically no matter where your ship goes small hallways will definitely be in store for you
the areas that are actually fairly beautiful are usually either too short so you never feel obligated to stop and take notice or appear like an obvious rehash of the places you were already fascinated by in prime  and ice missiles are a really bad idea
yes you can freeze the lava and make a walkable platform for yourself
who cares
these arent the kind of improvements that take advantage of the wiis capabilities
its not the kind of improvements to shell out money for either
grappling doors and enemies isnt very fun either
in fact you might even say its downright cheap
while grappling an enemy most likely another enemy from offscreen will shoot laser balls at samus and drain a good deal of your health
meanwhile you cant do a darn thing about it because youre stuck in the grappling position with the first enemy
oh sure this entire process only takes a few seconds by either letting go of the grapple or going through with it and removing the enemies shields but several of the space creatures in the game are frantic laser ballshooting maniacs so it only take a few seconds to empty good chunks of your life energy
this means you need total preparation to deal with these tough enemy situations but unfortunately the unfair and relentless nature of their ways makes it a needlessly tough tasklock onto enemies fire repeatedly until they die rinse and repeat
its predictable and boring now
this is exactly what youll be doing the entire way through
youll most likely be doing it while being forced to deal with unavoidable laser ball blasts by the space creatures
i prefer the d games where you actually had to aim and practice your skills to eliminate the bad guys
with enough practice youd actually be able to master the games
this is probably not entirely this games fault but d games in general
ugh enough is enoughspeaking of the wii whos bright idea was it to make the game so you actually have to turn and pull on the wii remote to do certain commands involving opening doors and whatnot
yes im referring to grappling again
no you dont have to do these commands for every door you walk through just specific ones
its still a terrible idea and its more annoying than anything elsespeaking of doors why in the world does it take  seconds to load a door
are you kidding me
this game was released in  not  so its absolutely pathetic that we have to sit there and wait for the doors to open especially when this wasnt even a problem in the first two prime games
ridiculous
also while waiting for a door to open up make sure youve taken care of all the enemies in the room and i mean all of them
they will find a way to sneak back into the picture and blast samus from behind
such a dreadful gameplay flawanother enormous gameplay problem are the puzzles that require the gamer to deal with infinitely spawning enemies while trying to accomplish a task
many times after spending more than  minutes trying to finish a task and being unable to do so thanks to the enemies being a frequent problem with their recurring ways  i just shut the game off and say im done with this bs
i strongly dislike the way the puzzles are designed in this game
i cant tell you how many times i was almost finished and an enemy became a distraction and i either couldnt finish the puzzle or died
frustration to the highest extentthe one positive is that hypermode is pretty awesome
no it doesnt actually speed up the gameplay like i originally thought when i first read about it
instead hypermode is the name of a really powerful laser beamtype weapon that blasts the living heck out of anything that moves
its pretty awesome
however theres a certain degree of complexity involved in using it properly thats a bit overbearing and therefore annoying
its only a slight learning curve admittedly because once you figure it out youll be fine after that so i cant complain about it too much
i can however complain about something else that being when you immediately enter a room and become overwhelmed by enemies and therefore become corrupted right away and you have zero time to react and therefore you die immediately
cheap uncalled for and severely flawedthe first three metroid games ever made for the nes game boy and super nes were really different from each other and thats another thing that made each of them appealing to gamers everywhere
alright so the first two metroid games arent that much different besides the obvious color and graphic differences but certainly super metroid is a drastic step in a significantly different directionthe first three metroid prime games however are all basically the same
its really not like nintendo to ever milk a series with the exception of mario perhaps but for some reason theyre letting it happen with the metroid prime series
its probably time they stopped working on making metroid games and focused on another creation because innovative gaming in the metroid series is probably now a thing of the pasti have played video games for over  years and have loved every minute
i have played the past two metroid games and they were great
this onewhile the wii bells and whistles make gameplay really coolthe makers just made boss battles and minibattles completely tedius rather than innovative
you must hit a specific place at a specific time with a specific weapon consistantly correct for up to  minutes at a time or else the boss suddenly regains all past power and health and you must start again from the beginning
this is the only way they get anything over  hours of gameplay out of the thing
this is a growing trend amoung those creaters that just dont care about much other than getting our money
we dont really want to add any more rooms to the game so lets just make the normal  minute boss battle last  hoursnot out of anything new just out of tedius hit this spot hit the spot next to it hit a different spot oopshalf a second late start againgreat game system great franchise bad game bad developersthe game is next to impossible to play with the wii remote and nunchuk
it would be nice if you had the option to use a controllerbored with too much time on my hands and not seeing many good games out there lately i thought id try another amazon downloadable game where the fun is always nonrefundable and all sales are final
i mean you dont even have the satisfaction of being able to break a dvd in half or throw it in the fireplace
anywaythe pattern here in downloadable games that are cheap is that they must have failed in the open market
i mean check out the ironclads game that i reviewed
i am the only one who bought it
i reviewed it and shot it down
now its listed on this site still but not for sale
crikeythe positive  rather timely story line if i do say so myself
drug kingpins running the ops out basically in the open with littleno fear of the law
sounds like the news to me
nice selection of firearms and lots of cheats that work that keep you alive and fully loaded while you shoot awaythe negative the missions in this game are timed
insanely timed at that
you cant even get past the tutorial because the live fire course they have is time
no matter what firearms i used certain targets would require multiple hits and i was always told that i was too slow and the tutorial would recue for another tryso i restarted the game and skipped the tutorial and tried the first mission but its the same thing
the mission is timed and theres no real direction of which pathway to go
i mean its like a combination of myst  jeopardy more than a shootemup
i mean it has the potential
itd be tolerable if only it werent timed
i dont know  you but i dont enjoy running through a mission x until i have where all the bad guys are memorized just to complete iton timemaybe the game is just too challenging for me
maybe im challenged
well they got my money and i have no fun to show for itjust for fun i downloaded necrovision lost company
maybe that game will have some redeeming qualities
dont hold your breath kidseveryone has different skills at video games
i am not very good
i found it too difficult and therefore more frustrating than fun
it would have been fun for me if it had two lower difficulty levels easy and very easythis could have been a great game but it just places too much emphasis on gore
i dont really need a chainsaw weapon to have fun and the gore really ruins the fun of this game
this could have been the next halo but the designers lost their way when they pandered to the small percentage of gamers who feel they need graphic violence to have funlet me list the reasons that this game sucks  no knife
grenade sucks  you know why
reload sucks  you know why
run sucks  the screen gets blurry and you cant turn worth a darn
level restart after every kill  split screen battles restart after every killdumb
you can only split screen  no quad screen
only  players at a time online
maps too small  see  player online only
guy takes up  the screen  terrible
weapon selection sucks  the guns it has are good but there arent enoughi never played the campaign mode because my friends  blew up before we got that far
i got a picture of it on my phone if you want to see itoh you probably have on of your own or twothis is possilby the most boring game ive played in a while
it sucks people all you do basically is run and hide for cover while you use all of your ammo to kill one enemy the locust horde you shoot these things at least  times before they actually die
the night i bought this i played for and hour trying to get into it but it was just boring i was so excited to play it because everyone had been pumping it up and giving it great reviews but to my dissapointment it was really bad
what is wrong with these games now a days
theyre all the same nothing is stand out or extremely original
graw exceeds way above this game and gear of war won game of the year
i have no idea how the graphics are nice but overall the gameplay is dull and its just a boring game after one night i took it to the neighborhood eb games and traded it for store credit that was the fastest ive ever gotten rid of a game if your gonna buy it wait until its  dollars then it might be worth iti dont like the graphics so much publicity but the game doesnt have any great the movements are very slowly and complicate i prefer ghost reconthe playability is horrible
i played it on novice level and got my butt kicked
i then played a showdown round against my dog and he beat me  to 
i can not believe that the game industry would allow such a stupid unplayable piece of crap like this into the consumer sales
that is just making us taxpayers waste our already wasted money on this garbage
the graphics are nice though
i really do wish they would make it for xbox  though the  is soooooooo much more powerful than the basic xboxi could not make it through  minutes of play on this game ever for the  dollars it was not worth it
i have been playing computer games since the early s and this has got to be one of the worse  games i have ever played
beware this onea friend of mine gave me this game for freethat was still too much to pay for this boring shooter
feels like playing tribes only not as fun
how on earth did the halo franchise get so popularthe campaign to start is confusing
even when you get the hang of it it sucks
online is stupid
you dont know when a grenade is near and it is overpowered
for gunfight it is dull and simple
if u shoot first you one the fight
if you have a rocket launcher you won the game same with sword
save your money and buy a better gamei was so excited about getting this game like a lot of other people since i purchased my xbox  short while after release i waited for this game
talk about let down this is just a nicer looking halo this is most overrated pos
i have ever played
nothing about this game is fun at all
this game is a ripoff of a great game unreal tournament
even down to some of the guns and even some the rides are almost the same
dont get this or any of the halo games because its a bad ripoff of unreal tournament
i dont know what is worse this game or eti played this game before its called unreal tournament  and the graphics were better back then this game is all hype 
it brings nothing new to the xbox  
i mean nothing
graphics a weak  not even hd they are upscaled
the multiplayer sucks big time its so hard to find a match that you want to play horrible over all game if this game was not called halo it would get no love at all
bungie sat on their hands and brought nothing to the table gears of war raised the bar so high that they cannot even compete at least unreal  is coming which will be what halo should have beenbuy it in the used bin because a lot of people will be trading this  dog  in because it has fleashalo  and halo  are icons of the video game industryrightfully sobut halo   and all after it just dont have the same playful and lighthearted feel of the first  two halo gameshardcore fans may enjoy it otherwise steer clear and play halo  or halo  againi will never understand why there is so much hype for halo the first one was a subaverage game the second one was garbage and surprise surprise the third one sucks as well  the game is boring and slow paced the graphics are nothing to write home about and there seems to be very little change in the gameplay from the first two in the series
if people are so desperate for a decent fps either get bioshock or wait for unreal tournament   buyers beware this game is trashnot what its made out to be alot of stupid funny bad guys to me its stupid i prey for all halo playerssimply just not my kind of game
too cartoonish and graphis arent much betterthumbs down on this one
thank youthis game is sooo boring and the same as halo  and   i think this game si like doom with a new skini honestly thought that halo  would make me a believer but it didnt
i played the first one and hated it
played the second one and hated it then i played the third installment and hated it even more
the campaign sucks
it is incredibly easy to pass and online sucks even more
i really dont see what people talk about
i dont see the magic
the guns feel weak and toy like
perhaps what annoys me the most are the  year old kids that skip school to play
rented and try it out
you might like it more than i didill first start off with my history with halo back in november  i was first in line at the local walmart awaiting the xbox launch i froze my panties off that night only to get home with numb fingers to play halo and after  minutes i turned off my new xbox and felt cheated the game sucked
then some years latter halo  came out i decided ill give it another shot no waiting this time the game was available and i had my xbox which had seen little play other than for max payne and dd heroes it was relatively unused and again  minutes and again i felt cheated the game once again sucked
now the  came along i got to camp indoors for its launch for my local walmart had become a supercenter and was open  hours so i waited warmly inside this time no halo it was call of duty  a much better game but far from great and now almost two years latter comes halo  and i refuse to waste my  on this one there is no keyboard and mouse compatability the game just sux ill stick with real games like bioshock and rather than use the mediocre  ill play it on my pc where games look far superior
bioshock yay halo  nayim not sure if diehard halo fans were created near the time of the first release when the genre was young and when halo was really something of an innovation
but be that as it may i am not one of those folksi first played halo  never played the first after playing a lot of contemporary first and third person shooters gears of war rainbow six etc and i never really could understand the appeal of the game
it seemed cartoonish with lackluster graphics soso weapons and a floaty sluggish feel to game play
somehow this combination of elements fostered an unimaginable allegiance and love for this game that i just dont understand and probably never willi picked up this version because the hype has been otherworldly and i didnt want to be left out of what i thought was going to be a groundbreaking genreredefining release
but i was wrong
halo  feels very much like its predecessors offering little if anything in the realm of advancement in any of the aforementioned areas
i deeply regret buying before renting itand to those of you who popped in halo  and  and didnt get it i assure you you wont feel any different about halo  however you will be  lighter than you were before
save your time and your money
halo  profits from the momentum of previous releases and preposterous amounts of fanboy loyalty  nothing elseif you liked halo  and halo  you might like this game because all it is is repeat of those games
better graphics but the same game
i would congratulate microsoft in convincing all the teen fanboys to buy this garbage
so how bad is the game
well lets put it this way all the people who were so hot on buying the game a couple of months ago no longer play it
yes those same fanatics who preordered the game dont play it anymore
i played the game on the easist setting just to get through it but even then it was too boring
and online play
horrible
menu system
worse everi would suggest that colleges teach about halo  in their marketing classes
to sell this dog turd at  bucks a pop is truly a great marketing accomplishmenti got this game after listening to everyone say how great it is and after my experience with halo  which was ok this game is basically very stupid because all you do is jump around all day and you cant zoom in on a lot of guns shooting at midget things
basically ok graphics ok online and the hammer is just plain gay
overall dont get this game there are much better games out there dont waste your time and buy into the fan base hype
use your money wisely and get something usefulok were to start
when i buy a new game i want it to be different from the last one in the line
this is the same game but shorter
i dont mean a little shorter i mean a lot shorter
you can beat all lvls of diff in lest than a day
the multiplayer is the real down fall
the selection of maps are dismal
it take you about  minutes to play all boards then you are board
you do get a map editor but most people that you would play with refuse to play on eachs custom maps
no real change in weapons
some new vehicals but not significant
they added game modes within game mods witch was a waste idont need a rocket ball when i can change all that in the match settings
the multiplayer is what sells these games  they could have done alot better
the game is fun for a day or  but after that it is like well what now
if you refuse to play any fps multiplayer besides a halo play halo   if you wanna play a real fps buy a ps or a pc and play unreal   that is how you make a multiplayer fpsif you are a victim of too much hype  just like me who mistakenly bought this game cause microsoft spend millions on too mush fake hype then sell it before its worth penniespreviously i wrotefirst to let you know about myself so you dont think i am biased  i am xbox and microsoft fan
ive been playing games for last  years so you can imagine i have gone through many generations of video gaming
i myself is it systems architecti played this game for hours yesterday before coming to conclusion
honestly i bought this game because of too much hype  but all my expectations were broken yesterdaythe halo gameplay is average nothing special
no special fighting moves or movements just simple fps
the graphics are below average when you compare them with the graphics of gears of war bioshock masseffect or timeshift
there was a hype about no frame drop  that is completely false  there are frame drops and any body can notice itit is completely unbelievable that all the editorial critics said that they have never played such a fantastic game
either microsoft filled their mouth with a lot of money or they are also nothing more than hyped criticslets see how much of  million fake hype can take this game tolets be honest here this games not that great
the controls are my biggest gripe
by controls i mean the character movement
niko moves like a hunky brick
theres no real precision to where you can move just a general squirm in that direction
it feels so clunky compared to cod ghosts infamous  and the newly released watch dogs
is that an unfair comparison
well either way the movement was the biggest irk for mesecondly the games plot is short and predictable
the online mode didnt do anything for me and it was clear rs was trying but it wasnt anywhere near donei bought this on a gamble thinking it would be fun to play but it is confusing with very little documentation on the game play
i am done with rockstar gameswith only a foggy memory of playing vice city long ago at a friends house i cant comment on how this one compares to other gtas
that being said this game isnt very funfirst and foremost the developers bit off more than they could chew with the realism they tried to incorporate in this game
driving feels slow and sloppy and while i respect the realism of not cornering at  mph it makes traveling in liberty city slow and frustrating
only the three or four best and rarest cars in the game have superior driving characteristics while the rest are about the same
the driving system poorly stitches the game together which is absolutely devastating for the average attention spanthe friends you acquire throughout the game will sometimes call you to hang out go out and play one of several minigames which can be irritating when youre on your way to a mission they get mad if you reject their offer
otherwise you must drive across town in a slow car to pick them up then drop them off afterwards
it isnt fun and i think they should have done without itmissions are fun at first but quickly get old once you realize that there are only two types chase missions and assault missions
chase missions involve chasing a car with your car until it stops and you kill the occupants while assault missions require you to attack or escape a defended position
luckily combat is much smoother than driving and some assault missions were very fun bank robbery in particular
the game wears on and even these grow tiresome
starting massacres is often more fun than doing the missionsmy final gripe is with the  storyline
nikos primary goal in the game is to track down a man from his past withholding spoilers while making money to survive
the entire game that i played couldnt bear to finish it entirely revolves around niko meeting mobster a and doing his dirty work then meeting mobster b and so on
very rarely does anything surface on his main goal and niko ends up feeling like a mercenary to the player instead of a man out for revenge
not to mention that youll soon end up with more money than you could possibly spendi dont play games to replicate reality i play games to be entertained
if reality must be bent a little for big and quick thrills id rather have that than this
playing through it was often a chorei have been a long time gta player
i have been playing gta from the time the very st one came out
i liked all the other gta games but gta  is just beyond bad
the only reason why anyone says this game is good is because they are a gta fan boy
this game is so boring
i almost feel asleep playing this game
i have tried to play it a few times but every time i tried to play it it felt more like torcher than having fun
if you want a good gta game get  and pass on this crap or even better buy a good game like saints row   and  forget about this gamei was looking so forward to this game as it got great reviews but be warned unless you are a video game junkie it is impossible to play this game
i have spent about  hours on it and it is impossible to make it past the rd mission where you have to disarm someone
no matter how much you follow the instructions its impossible to do
so keep that in mind driving around is fun but actually completing the missions is super difficult
it would be nice if they had difficulity levels
oh well will sell it used for what i can getthere is nothing revolutionary or even particularly welldone about gta  the gameplay and mechanics are pretty much the same as ever which is to say not that great the story is like a straighttovideo parody of every bad gangster film ive ever seen and the graphics despite the  from ign are far from top of the line and in no way do they deserve that score
i can think of dozens of games that are more fun have better stories and better graphics than gta  unfortuneately these games dont have the benefit of rockstars multimillion dollar hype machinethis was the worst game i have ever played all the missions are the same the reload on the gun is fake the ia is the worst i have ever seen the way you die is fake you hit a car gently and you fly feet in the airyou hit cars gently with your car and you fly out and die do not buy this game buy a goreat game like bia hh or cod wawi wouldve given gta  four stars but every single time i play it it freezes and a lot of ppl have had this problem
the things i dont like about the game is no character costumization no safehouses to buy and missions are very repetitive and similar to previous gta gamesi barrowed this from a friend who hasnt played the game in months and i asked him why whats wrong with the game
his response was you wont like it and ill even give you a month to try it out
turns out he was right within a week i gave it back to him due to the unbelievable amount of bs this games subjects you tofirst off the controls for this game are straight garbage
let me repeat that
pure utter garbage
seriously who wants to spend precious time toggling through weapons during an intense fire fight
wtf
saints row got it right all you had to do was press and hold the b button and you were able to select whatever weapons you had in your arsenal
what happened to simple controls like halo  where you press one button and youre able to cycle through all the weapon in your possession
i dont know if this happens to other players but niko sometimes takes off without me touching the controls again the controls suck because of this
rockstar address this issue or all your fans will be running to other gaming titlessecondly the load times for this game are abominable the time it takes this game to load are inexcusable
this probably my second biggest complaint about this game did they seriously test this game before releasing it to the massessthird the driving is a complete nightmare
regardless of the car you drive one little slight movement of the wheel and youre all over the place
last i checked i wasnt driving some  hp twin charged supercar am i missing something here
i mean whats the point of driving especially the bikes when they are undriveable
during missions where youre required to chase or run from enemies this is where you really notice just how bad the driving on this game really is
my goodness i failed more missions due to the poor handling these cars provide you in the game
what were they trying to accomplish by making everything undriveablenext we have the running hmmph
talking about being unrealistic  whats the point of running away from a guy if they can catch up to you
lets be honest a heavy set man or woman weighing at in at  lbs has no business keeping up with a slim seemingly inshape guy come on wtf
during an intese firefight with the cops i ran because my life was low and while im running i looked behind me and get this this fat cop is literally runnnig stride for stride with me wtf
i guess everybody on the game has the speed of usain bolt because out running people on here is a jokesince when did fighting become a community effort
you attack one person and youre getting swarmed by  or more people if things were like that in the real world then i would understand but come on how are you supposed to enjoy getting killed by average people ganging up on youcamera control i think ive spent more time fighting with the camera control then i did with the bad guys come on this is by far the main reason why i stopped playing this game
why cant the camera simply look where youre looking not where it wants to look for corns sakemissions got old very quick and are really difficult especially if you lack the patience as i do and for what
to do another pointless bs mission they really had no directions or true sense of accomplishments after completing them
the storyline it completely didnt have any point to it oh wait it did sex drugs killing racism and more of the same
safe to say i could have constructed a far better plot than thisthe good thing about all of this was i didnt give rockstar any money for this game as i barrowed it from a friend and im glad i wasnt in line waiting for this game or else i would have been severely disappointed
so hopefully my review will serve as a wakeup call to those seriously thinking about purchasing this game cause its not worth itam i right
i think another case of my having too much hardware for this game
phooey
i think consoles are the way to go
i mean youll always have a game that will play
with pcs if you need to upgrade or if windows does their thing and comes out with something newall of a sudden your game is unplayable
what a racqueti love zelda but this game only stayed in my collection for a day
didnt really capture my attention the way other zelda games havelinks awakening dx is still the best zelda imoits funny one description says controlling link is easier than ever with the stylus and touch screen
yeah right
so touching and dragging a stylus all over a touch screen to get your character to move is easier than simply using a control pad to move your character
sorry i wasnt born yesterdayand believe me this feature simply makes the game totally frustrating and not enjoyable at all
a shame because i truly love the zelda games and the game would probably be very good if they didnt force these ridiculous controls on us
theyre more intent on showing of their touch screen and what it can do than making the game in a way that would be much more fun to play
personally i wish they would rerelease this game and spirit tracks in a game that allowed you to play it normally with the control pad to move your character as opposed to the stylus
if they did i would snatch up both of them
but forcing me to play it like thissorry not gonna waste my timei got this game when it first came out it was quite buggy
horribly buggy
every time i played i ran into problems
i cant say you will they have patched the game a multitude of times nowso moving on the game play is quite bland
you smash the attack button to crush your opponents theres no strategy involved
you just keep on hitting that button before your health runs out and youre good to go throughout  of the game
the boss battle
spoilers ahead there isnt onethe ending is very anticlimatic
the man who screwed with your life is a frail coward at the end and when you stand  over his teeny arse theres not much else to say other than theres no contest
hes been in his castle for the last something years while youve been muscling up
body builder vs oldfrail manthe quests arent memorable at all
i can hardly remember any of them
theyre boring too
dont expect them to take long either if you play video games regularly
most of them end badly because of glitches anyhow as i said before they probably patched some queststhe whole marrying thing is quite annoying when you have two wives they come over and argue with each other
not to mention all my kids turned out to be wait for it black
pitch black kids
im not talking africanamerican but the essence of the color black
they werent mine
one day theyre white kids next day theyre black
i never understood why this happened it just didits not a very good game
dont expect it to be anything like the first
they sold out big time to reach a larger audience
the gameplay is dumbed down the story is a sack of bricks and the coop is not worth mentioning
it sucksone and three were amazing but this piece of trash
dump it
ten more words required four three two onethere are so many glitches with this game it is ridiculous
so far ive had several key npcs disappear making quests imposable to finish and a troll monster become immortal thus locking that character in the crucible
on another character ive had a spouse that will not die respond or move
youre faithful little companion runs through walls and floats above chests and every time you dig turns the dog the color of the ground its standing on
the dog also misses many chests or just sits in your waythe chat scenes and sequences are extremely slow and glitch as well
some games the npcs will finish what they need to say and others they will simply stop in midsentencealthough i expect peter molyneux to lie through his teeth almost every promise he made turned into a falsehoodbuy the original fableit is amazing
stay away from this unfinished game there are betteryou know the game ending glitches people have been so pissed about
well it happened to me and it completely pisses me off
the game ending glitch happened to me in bloodstone
not only that it started to stall and not load screens
then my saved games got corrupted
this is absolutely unacceptable
what even pisses me off even more is the company who created this game did not fix it
trash
i will not support this company at all in the future
screw umbuy this game if you a
have a problem with holding on to  b
hate your xbox and want to see it crash and red ring of death itself or c
want to see what its like to participate as a plaintiff in a class action lawsuit of which there is already talkfor me the game froze up shortly after starting
had to restart the xbox
froze up shortly thereafter
had to restart again
and again
and again
no pattern to these freezeups
searched the net for help
found lots and lots of people having this same problem some to the point where their xboxes were being rendered useless broken or scrambled
many theories no one answer yetits inexcusable
you wont see anything else like thismaybe lionhead will patch things up very very soon
anyone interested in buying this title though is strongly urged to see what the status is with regard to the critical flaws and bugs prior to purchase
or because thats a lot of work just buy something elsenever got far enough in game to experience any bugs some others had gotten
i quit real fast mainly because the gameplay put me to sleep
it almost seemed childish to me and makes me wonder how it even got an m rating oh my god avoid thisfable  sucks
the game contains long several minutes sometimes cutscenes where people stand there and talk and you cant fast forward through it
the quests are boring
the jobs are boring
the story is boring
the only thing that fable  has going for it is that the load times are faster than in fable my favorite xbox game of all time is fable  didnt expect fable  to top it but i did expect a qualify game
however fable  only resembles fable  in box and character but the rest is lost
fable  made you a part of the game and was easy to play this game however is more difficult in controls casting spells fighting etc which would bother me more if the game actually took skill to playall this does not matter as the game even this far after release is a total crash fest for some users
nobody can say which machines it will work on and which it wont guess i am the lucky one and two versions and two updates later it still crashes as so many have reported
only game i own that has this issueif you really want this game  borrow mine
borrow it as long as you need as i have better things to do that replay missions and wear my reset button out when the game freezes my second copy and second  unit that has happened onalso in my opinion buying this game only reforces the software developers decision to release a glitchy gameit has about half an hour of good art then the rest is trash
youre with prostitutes ect
gross i want to throw up
i wish we could launch a boycott of these games until they make some that are actually worth buying and playing
bring back the old pc games of the si got one  just to play forza  happens i got really disapointed with the game when i saw fake shadows and reflections on cars for example put the game to run some replay and keep the camera view in back of car then pay attention to shadows and other details also damages are very arcade even em simulation mode the car never loose big quantity of components when involved in accidentdisapointing was also the fact all cars seems to slizze on road even with sport tyres and all wings to help grip far from realityoverall its fun for the body painting and prizereward system as we progress but the game is far from other simulator titles as gtr pc or gti got this game free when i purchased the xbox  elite and i did play it for a bit just to see what it was like and it wasnt very fun
the first  minutes are great but after that im done
i just really dont like racing gamesthis isnt really my style of rpg but i got into it after playing for a while and having fun kicking enemies around though its quite frustrating with the ontherails action sequences where youre dead if you dont do the correct things in the correct sequence quickly enough
it was just enough fun that i was willing to put up with the view swinging around wildly whenever i moved the mouse and i was even willing to put up with dying dozens of times while trying to figure out how to get through particular sequences but the last straw was when i got to the spot where im chasing some creature and i end up in kind of a pit where the only way out seems to be climbing a tree and for the life of me i could not do it no matter how hard i tried
jumping up on branches of the tree while trying to move the mouse as little as possible because it tends to fling you around all while listening to intense music and a voice in your head pushing you to move as fast as possible is a great formula for severe frustration
i think i spent over an hour trying to get out of that pit
i finally gave up and uninstalled the game
if youre good at console actiontwitch games you might like this one otherwise spend your money on something elsefirst you need to understand that im  by nature
i say this so you realize i was extremely careful in prepping the ds screens and applying the shields
that said these shields ended up in the trash after about  hour of trying to make them work
the first application and it should be said that you really only get one try at it after that the shields start picking up dust and fingerprints on the tacky side that cant be removed would have gone well if the shield had been trimmed properly
unfortunately it was a bit too large and caught on the raised edge of the ds touchscreen creating a long air bubble along the top edge
before you ask i had carefully aligned the shield and it was flush all around except for the one edge
in other words it was not user error
 the only option i had was to try to trim it but that ended up being disastrous
despite my best efforts the shield became progressively more smudged and nothing i did including trying to wash it  helped
in the end it went into the garbage
i had bought one for a friend who has a psp and she had very similar results
the first attempt was the best but trying to fix minor flaws rendered it useless
id love to protect my screens but this isnt the way to do it
for now im just living on the edge without protectionit is sid
aha aha there is no god  ahahahahahahahaa  aaaaahahahahah
arriving men in white coats with nets force postponement of review for  hours or after sanity hearingthis is an extremely dumbed down version of previous railroad tycoon games and its really a disappointmentdont expectto lay your track precisely you dont even get an optionto figure out switchbacks and all the other routing problemslots of trains there seem to be less than any previous versionto buy or build industries except in citiesstation improvements you can only upgrade a station twice no other optionsmanagers giving you bonusesany indepth finance no bonds
no short selling
no option buyingindepth control of difficulty levels  there are four levels no tinkeringand a ton of other fun featuresdo expecta very fast and easy gameonly  eight single player mapsscenarios and about the same for multiplayerno replay valuethe track is simple to lay which isnt a good thingthe trains are very easy to routeconsist which isnt a good thingi probably played railroad tycoon  for a couple of hundred hours and really enjoyed the complexity and replayability of the campaigns
can you do it just a little better next time or do it all electric etc
but none of that is here in this game i expect ill get less than  hours out of it
at least thats more than i got out of railroad tycoon  i guessa huge disappointment
be sure to play the demo first if youre remotely interested
or wait for it to hit the bargain bin itll be there in a few weeksi thought this was supposed to be railroad tycoon   its more railroad tycoon   even with the latest patch this game crashes too much and is too slow and too buggy to be playable
once my railroad empire gets more than a dozen connections the game slows to a crawl even on my relatively fast system
literally after i place a section of track there is a second delay until the interface becomes responsive again and this is with the game paused
train routing is seriously flawed
even with easy train routing enabled if a train gets near its destination station but that station has another train in it instead of waiting the train will turn around and circumnavigate the entire track system to approach the station from the other side
so a short delivery between two neighboring cities could take years of game time
i saw trains frequently move back and forth on a section of track and never reach a destination
the only fix is to delete the train and create a new one with the same route
i have better things to do with my timeridiculous checkpoints no in game saves this game is a horror to play
hey eidos why dont you sell your ideas to real game developers like ubisoft oreaim glad i didnt buy this gamei did play the demo and that was enough for mei waited a long time with great anticipation for this game to be releasedwhat a let down it wasi think pc gamming is dead there hasnt been a good release in two years
 scarface was a cheap imitation of gtagta sanandreas was a big step backwards from vice citystargate was cancelledall the other pc game releases have been so so run of the mill junk nothing inovative what has happend sence vice cityhalf life far cryboiling pointits all been down hillthere are still two games on the horizon that look good if they are ever releasedstalker and resident evil if they dont pan out or are duds i think i will buy a consolethat looks like where all gammimg is headed anywaywell thanks for listening to all my pentup frustrationsim just disgustedjust a piece of crap  i paid  bucks and played it for a half hour or so and it just has no direction whatsoever just a mess  i cant recommend this at any price not even if it was freethis game has the potential to be great
however at this time i cannot possibly give this game anything but  star
this game feels plays and acts like beta software
the physics are way too wacky most of the cars are barely controllable weird bugs like governement helicopters flying around blowing up your enemies before you can complete the missions and a stutterijng problem that will drive you mad after about  minutes of game play
the stuttering problem is a problem many others are havingcheck some gaming forums and oyu will see what i mean
it halts the game and the sound stutters for about  seconds
try dealing with that when you are in the middle of a chasei and many others are not having hardware issues
i am running an amd fx cpu gb corsair ram twin mb nvidia  gt cards running in sli mode and twin rpm hard drives one for games and one for the os
i eat every game for breakfast and beg for more at high resolutions on a  inch lcd hd screen and never have a hiccupthis game is bad codeperiod
if you think you will buy this game as of this date and have a great out of box exeperience you are mistaken
wait until eidos clears up the mess they madethen buy this game an play it
i have uninstalled it even though i have  hours of game play already
i dont want to waste a great experience while this game is so buggy
when patches come out i will try againthe low rating doesnt come just because of the fact that the game is  years old
the graphics are excellent especially impressive given the sheer size of the world and that you can view it hundreds of feet from the air anywherethe game has a very ambitious design a massive sandbox action game
unfortunately they developer just wasnt up to the taskit starts out with small things cars popping in right in front of you or getting out of your car to pickup up an item  ft away and finding the car gone when you turn around because the game decided to wipe out and refresh all the vehicles on the map suddenly
then theres the memory leak error extended gameplay  minutes causes the game to start having massive hiccup  stuttering errorsthe vehicle handling especially cars is something best likened to trying to juggle wet turds
they cant go straight even on a straight away
car stopping obstacles are all made of supermagnets because your car will veer into them if you get close
vehicle behavior is pretty screwed up whenever another faction is after you every other entity on the map ie
normal civilians will try and run you off the road when enemies swerve and try to block you and you teebone them it will stop your car dead
if an enemy hits you the same way he will not slow down in the slightest and will carry you with him whatever direction he was going until you hit a wallobstacle or abandon the vehicle hit even the slightest bump in the road and you will go flying even at low speeds
if you tried to park a car in a driveway with this games physics youd fly  ft in the air as soon as you touched the curb land on the roof and the car would explode one of the more common ways to die in this game is simplyexiting a vehicle
the will often times spend  seconds settling after you come to a complete stop
get out to soon and theres a good chance the car resettling will simply crush you and kill youspeaking of common deaths in the first half of the game my most common death was during liberation missions where you get a bunch of allies
one would eventually come speeding from behind in a car and run me over
i learned to keep a constant vigilance on my rear end eventually
you allies are more dangerous to you than most of your enemiesyou can airdrop vehicles for yourself which is a cool idea except you cant do it when innear a town you cant do it when under fire you cant do it sometimesjust because
no explanation on why or how to get to the point where you can get one sometimes it comes in about  secondssometimes it takes  minutes
sometimes it just never comes sometimes when it does finally comeit just doesnt work
its like the batterys dead or somethingdui could spend a couple terabytes explaining all the problems with this game
whoever came up with the game concept had an awesome idea on their hands
unfortunately it suffers from a terrible implementation
avoid this game
hopefully the second one is betteri was very disappointed in battlestations midway
i have a stateoftheart pc and after installation the game would not even load the tutoriali returned battlestationsmidway to amazon the next day
like i said a huge disappointmenti usually sell my pc games on amazon but in this case i refuse to stick somebody else who buys this program with the expectations that its playablei bought this else where the seller said i could use a custom head set and with the splitter use a pc head set or two seperate headsets
i thought great
but the bottom peice and the splitter only fit xbox headsetsi dont see the point to have a adapter to fit a xbox controller with a mute and volume on it just to plug it into a xbox headset with a mute and volume on it
though the headset with this product sold here as well does not have a mute and volume its the only one with the right plug in that youll find doesntwow i made the mistake of buying this piece of garbage before playing it because of the lack of rpgs for the xbox 
hey i was desperatehaving said that this game is absolutely awfulfirst off the the story and dialogue will bore you to suicidethe dialogue is so tedius and meaningless its just a waste of time
the apparently gay member of your group will sit and talk about how in love he is with the other male character for way too long and other conversations that have nothing to do with gameplay take way too longgraphic wise this game is not what youd expect from a huge console like the  it looks like a ps game and not even a good onealso the battles are boring
i have played rpgs and turn based games for years and the combat on this game is uninspired  and just flat out lamealot of this game is way too drawn out
conversations and movies and boring and have no story value and take forever to get through
dont get me wrong sometimes a long cutscene is cool if its telling the story and is exciting and well done
these are not like that at allbasically there might be some people out there who might dig this but i dont
id rather play any of the final fantasy games or any of the other turn based rpgs out there
this was just a waste of  in my opinion
if they are going to charge that much for games for this system they better be really good because ps games are cheaper and last i checked they had better rpgs for alot less money
new system or not games like this will not keep a system sellingdefinitely rent this if you really want to check it out before you buy iti recently bought the xbox  arcade edition and decided to buy enchanted arms and mass effect
enchanted arms looked like a good rpg though i didnt know anything about it since this was the first time i bought a xbox systemi was extreamly disappointed in this game
i expected a lot more
ill go over the list of problems that i had with it
first the so called graphics werent that great the were even a little worse the the ps average rpg and this is supposed to be the xbox  then there is the story which didnt make any sense and wasnt interesting
next was the game play which was slow and added to the boredom
finally we have the characters who were uninterestingand didnt care whether they lived or died
atsuma was the worst of them all he got on my nerves and was annoying and he was the main characteroverall one of the worst rpgs ive played with the likes of magna carta for the ps
i really hope xbox  is coming out with some better rpgs in the future because its my favorite type of game to playthe idiots at ubisoft got together one day and decided to make the worst role playing game in the history of role playing gameswhat they ended up doing to accomplish this was take every negative factor from all past role playing games and jam them all into one horrifically bad excuse for a video gamethe dialogue in this game is completely irrelevant
there is no reason to pay attention to any of it anything you need to know youll figure out on your own
there is hours of spoken dialogue in this game none of it bears any purpose
characters speak but they say absolutely nothing
conversations that go like how are you
i am ok  you look cold  i am cold  thank you
after that waste of programming code youre allowed to continue on
the spoken dialogue is also done by what have to be the most unproffesional voice actors ive ever heard
they either over emphasize the idiotic personality of the character or dont give the character any personality at all
you will speed click through all the dialogue in the game that is if you end up wasting your money on this gamethe game is just one long straight line with random encounters along the way
i spoiled the entire game for you right there
you run forward fight some monsters and win the game
thats not worth sixty dollars in my opinion
ubisoft deliberately released a game after putting absolutely no effort into making it interesting
you get one town of irrelevant and annoying dialogue where the high point is running around collecting tickets
final fantasy x was just a game where you run forward throughout the whole thing but at least they realized that they had to make their characters slightly interestingthe battle system is slow and makes the turn based system of battle look even more ridiculous than ever
its like the battle system from koudelka youre on your own grid and use ranged attacks against your enemy whos on their own grid
this is the most irratating system for turn based battle in my opinion
ubisoft will probably explain that they thought long and hard about it and decided to make a turn based battle system that lets you use strategy to defeat your enemies they just forgot to plan the actual enemies in the game around this concept
what i mean by that is you fight enemies who can attack every square on your grid and you gain abilities where you can attack every square on their grid
chess it is not more like turn based rochambeauthe menus in the game are very time consuming and were obviously just thrown together and abandoned
you make a weapon in one menu quit that menu open a different menu equip the weapon
you buy a skill in one menu quit that menu open a different menu learn the skill back out of that part of the menu equip the skill
ubisoft apparently thinks that when you make a decision to own something its for the sheer joy of knowing that its not being used as a part of your repitoireone are where they obviously invested wasted alot of effort was in making neat little companions which they call golems
theres alot of them in this game so you can have fun making them and looking at them
youll only use one at a time so the other sixty will have to wait in limbo
each one is designed to be unique and speak one of two styles of japanese slow and menacing or high and hyper
they even wrote biographies for each golem they explain their uniquely irrelevant detailsthis game is literally the worst game out for the xbox   yes even worse than perfect dark zero
shame on you microsoft and shame on ubisofti have had errors on installing errors on playing the campian maps and errors in battle maps
i have installed the patches and have the expansion pack as wellthis game could have been great
i have spent a total of  hrs tying to fix it and it is is buggy and unplayable for any length of time
after installing new chip set drivers new grafix card drivers and new sound card drivers i am still  dollars poorer and pissed off
do yourself a favor and dont bother buying this game
i have a top of the line gaming cpu btwi wish i could rate it lower than one stari found this version very boring and repetitive
get a castle lose a castle get a castle lose a castle over n over n over again the same fights in the same places
the ai is still pitiful as rtw too
i also still hate the board design as the ai played much better when the map was provinces and not squares
it also could reinforce itself better
of course this one was made because of the graphics upgrade but the gameplay is horrible and not fun
get this only only when bargain bin for  or lessthis game is the remake of ace combat iv for the ps however game play on the psp is far worse from game play on the pscontrols dont feel the same camera cumbersome to switch and just dont get iti purchased this game by mistake
it was designed for psp
i later returned it
while i like the ace combat series for playstation   i couldnt evaluate this gamethe game doesnt work not happy
the game wont start in my psp
i would like a replacement or a refundi got this product free with my purchase of my brand new ds lite
first off the instructions were not in english
however i have used protective covers for my touch cell phone so i understand how they workthere are  protectors inside and a nice cloth love the cloth
nowever one protector is larger than the other one so which one does it go on i assumed the top so i started there
i applied it just like i did for my touch phone but these are super sticky
you get  try and that is it
needless to say i had so many bubbles that i carefully took it off and threw it outi tried the bottom one same results
there is no easy way to put these on and they seem to result in bubbles galore everytimethe bubbles are probably because they did not fit on just the screen but overlapped on my ds which resulted in air underneath
if they had fit just the screen maybe they would have been okay but eh doubtfulthe cloth was nice
i kept it
trashed the restthis was by far the worst nancy drew game yet
story does not flow and at times makes no sense at all
her interactive used items that were used in other games which was weird
not a great game
graphics great but that is all
very disappointing considering how long we all had to wait for this gamei am a huge fan of the nancy drew games
this was an exception
for the first time ever i actually gave up out of sheer boredom before solving this mystery
the colours are garish the characters are dull the storyline uninteresting and tasks and puzzles are mundane
fortunately herinteractive didnt let this affect their other games
the only mystery here is why they lowered the bar so muchmost of the reviewers summed this game up quite well
the guy who said hed rather play et on his atari  couldnt be more right
im warning customers to not buy this game
i feel sorry for the people who dont read reviews before buying games
its games by thq that buy these big names from shows movies etc and attempt to make the money by the name only not the quality of the product
i wont get into details i reluctantly rented the game already knowing it would be bad but being a fan i had to give it a shot
the only good thing about is the theme music rocks
then the game starts
terrible storyline lack of any plot or motive to play terrible gameplay boring dialogue mediocre graphics and overall mediocrity
heed the most of the reviewers on here this is a bad game and the show deserves so much better
the guy who gave this game  stars wouldnt make it in tony sopranos crew for long because tony wouldnt have any part of it
there are so many better games out there
if you need a game like this the godfather is worth a look although that game could use some work tooi was hoping for a freeroaming world type of game where you can rank up to be a memeber of tonys crew but instead you are stuck within an extremely small an limited environment which feels constricting
its lame
i feel bad the guys lent their voices to this crummy game
its not that fun  yah you can fight guys and theres some kind of special moves but it was all so boring that i couldnt tell you how to even execute some of these moves  its a little complicated and not worth your time learning cause you get no special reward for executing them
money is a complete waste in the game
dont bother collecting it for yourself as it serves no purpose whatsoever for the game itself
its weak
i rented it and won it in maybe  hours gametime
its not challenging in the least
i never died or lost a fight
i wasnt even trying  just playing to see if it got good
dont waste your time
go watch season  againthis game would be alright had i never played the original
the original games humor was much better
the plot was more interesting
the games physics made the game more enjoyable
for instance theholobob feature seemed a lot more sleaker than the body snatch feature in the sequel
do your self a favor and stay away from this one rent onlythis is probably the worst installment even before the first one
command has the worst controls ever in my play history and has the worst voice acting of the whole series
starfox has really dissapointed me
there is no on foot landmaster or in the water tank thing from n
compared to adventures  and assaault this is junkgraphicsstorygameplaywifi playcontrolsthe games graphics are really good for ds but fails in every other aspect
whatever you do try the game before you buy it
when my friends tried it they could barely stand doing wireless play with me nor watch me play
this game is only for hardcore star fox gamers or for star fox junkiesi just bought this game last week and i can get past level  but i cant figure out level   i tried many times to beat that level but it is impossible to beat
the enemy formations on the screen where you make your paths with the stylus and use the turns to get to where you want to go keep on hitting the great fox and killing it
i have tried everything to try to get through that level but i just cant beat it
i got so frustrated that i just gave up
i wish that the game was more like the original star fox from the super nintendo or star fox  from the nintendo  because those games were so much easier and more fun to play
i would much rather play those two versions of star fox than star fox command for the nintendo ds because this one is a total waste of money and i dont think that i would recommend it
overall i think that fox has hit rock bottom with this installment of the series and i think that it should stop right there
i wish that i could get my money back because i dont like this game at allfinally people are starting to see wwe wrestling games the way ive been seeing them for the last  years they are nothing but a waste of time because each new wrestling game that comes out is almost exactly the same as the previous years version only with minor updates and slight roster changes
oh yeah you may get one or two extra match options but its almost entirely pointless
not worth the outrageous price tagyeah wwe smackdown vs raw  is extremely realistic but the gameplay suffers as a result
this game is the most boring wrestling game i have ever played in my life wwe or otherwise
its painfully slow to deliver a move to your opponent because of the realism the loading times are horrible and the storyline mode is ridiculously overrated and pointless because needing a reason to fight another wrestler makes no sense
it never made any sense to me why i need some madeup story just to wrestle an opponent
i remember the good old days when i only had to battle  or so opponents and no storyline was ever brought into the mix
thats how to make a world title run interestingthe loading times are really bad
were going into  for crying out loud
if loading times still occur in todays games then something is seriously wrong with the thing
i understand this is a big game with lots of options and wrestlers to sort through but come on you have to sit through loading screen after loading screenoh and the control system is horrible too
it takes forever to deliver a simple move to your opponent because its really complicated to figure out what to dowhat a boring boring game
i really hope something happens and no more wwe games are brought into the world of video games
once i noticed how average theyve become i knew it was time for companies to stop making them
unfortunately this was back in   finally people seem to be agreeing with melet me first say that this game sucks
first the loading in this game is rediculous
it takes  hours to load everything
the story mode is kind of numb and i really hate the fact that you cant buy superstar points in the shop
if youre like me you like to create a lot of characters and if youre like me you like to copy your best superstar then edit the copied one so you can have a new superstar with a good rating
basically you cant change their weight class when creating a new character off a copied one to reset the attributes so you can change them up
the create mode is really lame
the clothing sucks so bad in this game
my best friends name is david and they dont even have that as a superstar calling name when you enter the ring like they did in the last one
last time i checked david is a pretty popular first name
hell its batistas first namelike all wrestling games it does have a degree of fun a very small degree of fun
but this game is really really lame and i find it hard to believe that people are saying its a turning point in smackdown history
how the hell do you figure
seriously
did you ever play the other games
you cant sit there and say its the best of the smackdown games because if you do you must have never played another smackdown game
if you create a character and for example you make them from las vegas nevada the announcer will say on the way to the ring from las vegas nevada from nevada why the hell are they saying the state twice
make anyone from a city and state and when they are introduced the announcer says the state twicethere are so many damn glitches in this game its unbelievable
you have to be a damn cruiserweight to be a luchadore or martial arts
thats pretty lame
anyone remember nathan jones or steve blackman
both martial artists and blackman was a heavyweight and jones was a super heavyweightstory mode sucks
all i am gonna say
music in the game is better except for that one damn money in the bank song which is probably the worst song ever recordedalso where the hell is paul london
sure we have  friggon mick foleys but no paul lundon or as gay as they are the spirit squad
they really screwed this game up in every way possible
they really rushed this game
all the little  year olds who like this game have no clue about any other wwe game i can assure you because this game sucks big time
there are barely any grapple moves
wtf
how can anyone sit there after plaing the other wwe games and say it is a good game
this game is utter crap
i brought it back within  days of getting itthe heights in this game are all off
i put a wrestler at  and he was as tall as angle angle is 
i have played every wwe game and have been a fan of the wwe wwf since the early s
this game sucks plain and simple
they rushed it
just like mortal kombat armageddonif you feel like wasting  bucks then get it otherwise stick with  or just wait until this one is cheaper which shouldnt be too much longer because the game sucksi always been a fan of thq wrestling since n and i own day of reckoning    on gamecube and i liked themfriday i picked up smackdwon vs sighand i took it back monday morningok when i fought i got knocked down with a weak grapple only to tap the life out of my fingers trying to get back upyou spend too much dn time on the mathorrible controlseven if looking in the booksoooo not much funlt sucks ai cant believe people are rating this game at  or  stars
this is the worst wrestling game to date
i cant believe that they even released thisfirst the grappling system is awful
you can barely control your wrestlers abilities let alone grapple efficiently
second the announcers announce moves before hand or not at all
third the gm mode is the worst gm type mode that i have ever seen
you try to control matches to get better ratings
sounds fun really its notthis game is an embarrassment to the video game industry as well as to the wwe
my only question is why cant we go back to making them games exactly like world tour wrestlemania  and no mercy
those games were fun and easy to controltrust me when i say dont but this game
waste of moneyi recently bought  new psp  consoles a few games with vice city stories and i didnt get to play past a few missions before i couldnt even play them game anymorei deleted any other gta games on my memory card and some other gamesi thought it was because of thati put the disc in and it wont playive restarted my systemlet it load for a long time and still wont playive been a fan of the gta series and doubt i will play it anymorei tried the disc on both my pspsnone of them will play iti dont want to dish out more money to return itim very unsatisfiedowned this less than two months and the battery is dead
doesnt even hold a charge
wouldve been really pissed if i didnt spend less than  bucks on it
used it as a add on to go over the  dollar amount for free shipping
good thing is the battery that came with my psp over  years ago still worksthis isnt like the original battery for the psp  but it does get the job done
i repeat the advertisement says you will get  more power that is falseupdate  months i hate this battery it died on me and doesnt want to charge anymorethis game is perhaps the worst video game i have played in a long time
if you are interested in this type of gameplay definitely stick with gta or falloutprosnice graphicsconsbad musicbad controlsnot realistic parachuting off of car roofsenvironment is unplayable despite it being a huge map you have to stick close to the roadsgets boring fastnot fun after  minutes the first  minutes were pretty funas a long time fan of the sonic series i couldnt help but check this game out for myself regardless of all the bagging it has received in various review forums
boy oh boy i should have listened to you guys
i could not have ejected this poor poor excuse for a game quick enough from my machine
shame shame shame for shame
as a tradition when placing a new game into any console for the first time i refrain from touching any buttons making sure to watch any intro movies first
kinda like the initial sip from a bowl of soup before you tackle the guts of it
anyhow after the oooing and aaaaing at the intro movie with a giant grin on my face i finally pressed start
thats where everything pretty much turned to a steaming pile of minke whale crap and my excitement turned to bitter bitter frustration
amidst the graphical glitches broken camera view points and horrible horrible voice acting tails iq seems to be dropping as his voice gets dopier with each passing game the game just lacked any excitement
my enthusiasm died pretty much at the shoe mission at the very start
dear lord i can only hope that the next one is better than this waste of a blueray disc
its going to take hours upon hours of gta game play to remove the filthy filthy after tasteplease friends avoid this like the plague and spare yourself the suffering of hair pulling and gnashing of the teethi dont know what to say that hasnt already been said except that i concurthe gameplay is extremely boring especially in the town missions
you basically run around and interact with people and do stupid little errands
in the regular action zones its somewhat reminiscent of latergen sonic games but the problem here is the camera never helps you
i find myself constantly having to readjust my view after even just taking a few stepsalso theres little to no consistency or progression with difficulty
meaning some of the earlier missions will be really easy and some will take many retries
the same applies to all the later missionssonic does go fast in parts but nowhere near the blazing speed were used to seeing as sonic fans
also whats with the alternate character storylines
do you really want to play through shadow and silvers missions after completing the sonic storyline
just so you know theyre even more boring and annoying than sonicsits hard to believe sega actually made this game
after playing through the first half i remember checking my box to see if it was put out by another company
they have really lost their touch at least with sonic
i hope that if they do decide to make another sonic game they rethink their whole strategy because this is not a fond memory of the blue hedgehogi remember seeing this game at gamestop for  so i thought i would give it a go
i am a huge fan of sonic and it looked alot like sonic adventure    on sega genesis
the game looks great thats the only thing that can be said good about the game is that sonic team put alot of work into the graphics department
everything else about the game is just terrible the controls will leave you dying alot in this game and the camera is just horrible youll have lots of death and have to position the camera with the right analog stick just to see where you are going
its a terrible game and should of been better if sega didnt rush out of the door with this just in time for it come out on next gen systems
not worth getting if you want a good sonic game get sonics ultimate genesis collection insteadthis is by far the worst sonic game ever
i thought that sonic adventure  was starting to lose its entertainment factor since it strayed far from the original games that made sonic so good
dont buy this game at all
its a waste of your money
you can rent it to confirm all the issues mentioned in the other reviews
yes horrible camera angles long load times and boring story really make this game unbearable
sega really rushed this game out to make it on time for the th anniversary despite all the bugs and flawsthe game might not be so bad if you actually had some control over what was going on
half the time you spent just along for the ride and trying to not crash into something which would result in instant death of the character
the rest of the time the camera is moving around such that you cant see whats in front of you and as the camera controls control where the camera is rather than what its looking at i was always moving the camera in the wrong direction ive seen this particular problem many times before and it is not unique to sonic but it is something you should be allowed to select like reversing the yaxis on fpss
my wife and i gave up on this game after becoming frustrated with it
we buy games to have fun not to see how many unique ways our characetr can be killedwell since there arent many titles for my powehouse game system i decided to go out and buy a bunch o games for it
well this game is a complete waste of money
it seems that this game would be more fun on the wii but all in all the only games that i consder worth having are nba k resistance fall of man and maybe call of duty
note that i love basketball and football gamesthis was a complete failure this wasnt the sonic i new and liked this was a waste of time the storymode sucked the player was kinda difficult and i gottan board of this game
this game was trash sega really mest up this opertunity so this was a whack gamesonic the hedgehog was suppose to be a reboot to an already good series of games
sega failed hard with this title
bugs slow down just plain not fun gameplay all combine to make a game that leaves a horrible taste in your mouthsonic the main character controls horribly
he either goes to fast or to slow and turns instantly so you fall off things constantly
he can stand on a loop at the top and just stick there
that isnt an intended power that is just poor programmingi dont want to rip into the dev team that much seeing as sega forced them to put this game out sooner than it should have been
but they seriously could have fixed issues like drowning in knee high wateri dont think anyone even play tested the game because some parts are so broken they are almost unplayable
like a boss battle with silver he can throw you up in the air make you lose all your rings and then catch you as you fall because sonic and everyone controls horrible in the air so you have no time to reactover all this game is complete crap and should be avoided i bought it out of a sick curiosity and i was punished for it with a horrible timefirst off  zero stars
not even worth one
terriblesuper slow too many reasons for this game to be recalled and remadewell if they remake it it needs to be done with the sonic adventure  game engine
that was by far the best one
for d games at least long load times horrible game play sonic is slow no one likes playing as tails and amy and knuckles and the rest of the gang
doesnt sega get that yet
at least shadow is cool and sliver was alright slow the graphics are horrible story isnt good did i mention its the slowest of sonic gamesoh man when i got this i popped it in and i got pissed off
its horrible
i have a notebook with three full pages of what can be fixed and how it can easily be fixedsonic team hire me to help you make the new sonic game and i promise you that their wont be horrible reviews because the game wont be terriblepros it has sonic on the cover the case can be used to store another disk after burning this one you can start a fire with the users manualcons graphics are worse than on ps controls and camera dont work well music makes my ears bleedi hate this game and i hate myself for wasting the money
youd rather want to spend it on a nice meal or getting a 
jb insteadi played sonics other version and expecting to play a nice platform shotmup game but such a disappointment
i am just glad it was a rent i didnt paid  for it
even if it gets discounted to  i will still not buy iti bought this game when it first came out i was waiting for it to come out i was so excitied i thouhgt it was going to be the best sonic game ever to come outi have been a sonic fan for along time since first sonic game came out
they still have not fixed the camaera angle
the character has the same freaking stages as soon as i turn on the game i play one stage i am tired of playing because all the stages are the same
the character all had the same videos
the story was crap was not all deep like sonic team sega said it would be
they are running out of ideas they need to takesome ideas from there fans
grahphics was not to goood nethier sonic unleashed was even worseyou know i have been a huge sonic fan for as long as i can remember right down to the genesis days
i know that the d sonic games tend to have a polarizing reputation but in all honesty i liked most of his d outings with the only two exceptions being the sd version of unleashed which wasnt bad by any means but i preferred the hd version which i am going to discuss later on and this
okay so the gist is that sega had to rush the game into stores in order to meet the th anniversary deadline so they could remain financially stable and it really shows
one the one hand i do admire how it tries to recapture the ambition of the adventure duology  shadow the hedgehog but when it misses it really misses
first lets look at the story
sonic decided to go on a vacation in soleanna the city of water where they are celebrating the festival of the sun
just as when its princess elise lit the giant torch in the center of the city dr eggman with a new and pretty odd appearance arrives and captures elise to seek the flames of disaster despite sonics best efforts to save her but she gives him the blue chaos emerald
so sonic teams up with tails and knuckles to rescue elise investigate the mystery of the flames of disaster eggman mentioned rinse and repeat about six times and there you have sonics story
shadows story is that he and omega broke into eggmans base to rescue rouge and retrieve the scepter of darkness
however at the rondevux point eggman knocks the scepter out of rouges hands and causes it to shatter freeing an entity known as mephiles who took on shadows appearance as he was the one who sealed him inside ten years before using time travel
there is also the newcomer silver who came from a future devastated by iblis and enlisted the help of blaze from sonic rush who possibly warped there and lost her memory for some reason
since iblis keeps healing despite their best efforts to take it down they run into mephiles who uses chaos control for them to travel back in time in order to kill sonic who mephiles prophecised to be the socalled iblis trigger and it becomes one big convoluted contradictory stupid melodramatic  plot holelaced adventure with a revolting love story between sonic  elise for good measure
wrap your head around that
in addition to the kids voice cast there was also lost in space survivor lacey chabert as the voice of elise who also made a guest appearance in the black christmas remake the exact same year
to be fair chaberts voice in general can be annoying at times but she at least tries actingwise
she along with mike pollock as eggman  dan green as mephiles were the three best voice actors in this game
everyone elses talents were wasted by the material they had to work with
as far as the gameplay is concerned i do admire how it tries to recapture what made adventure   s gameplay so special to me and try not to make the same mistake heroes made in having the playable characters stages and bosses virtually the same and the music is pretty cool
however it was bogged down by some fatal flaws
it suffers from the exact same problem as spyro enter the dragonfly which i reviewed two years ago
a lot of the glitches can be gamebreaking and they have become the butt of a joke on youtube right down to knuckles  rouge getting stuck to the wall on occasion characters running off loopdeloops and falling to their deaths etc
what is up with the excessive load screens
one way i can sum them up is talk to somebody load screen they tell you the objective load screen you do the mission load screen they congratulate you on a job well done results another load screen
trust me
extensive loading can leave some people bored out of their minds especially when you take into account of how tedious the side missions can be for some reason
some of the character bosses can be pretty cheap such as silver when he constantly throws you at nearby walls using telekinesis without giving you any time to react while shouting its no use over and over again
the same can go for the opposite side of the spectrum when you play as silver and you can just throw items and debris at sonic  shadow and you win kind of like in the horrible karate kid  when daniel threw one punch at mike barnes and he won the fight
at least the character battles in sonic adventure    were fair
to be fair the remaining bosses at least had more emphasis on strategy than the attack repeatedly nobrainer ones from heroes but still could have used some extra work
despite being able to roam around freely and it is not onrails the controls were mindblowingly awful
it doesnt look bad when you watch gameplay videos but trust me its bad
a lot of the characters maneuvering felt way more slippery clunky and sensitive than other d sonic games combined and the attacks felt so awkward and stiff that i usually get hit first
it is hard to do controls justice and that along with the where the  do i go level design cheap obstacles etc is what killed the game for me so the true way to know is to play it yourself and to quote chris mccleen from total drama island i triple dog dare youthere are more reasons why this game became the sonic series crowning achievement of failure but this review was getting long as is
if you want to know every single solitary little thing that was wrong with it i would suggest watching clementjs part rant
i would put part ones web link below but amazon always deletes the link to prevent people from navigating away from the site so i would do a search on youtube for clementj sonic  review to check it out when you have the time on your hands
with that said i will see you guys later and the later d sonic games are miles better than sonic  in executionthis game just down right horroble
did sega rush through this gamecamera is horrible wich needs to be decently goodvoice acting
human characters make these wierd sounds
the text messages should have only existed for this failureso many other mistakes to list
now getting to the point
dont know if sega had to rush the game so they can meet a relese deadline or what
the most important parts of this not considered game are missingthis is an incomplete game that should have not been released when it didif the developers gave this game a few more weeks of development i am sure people would have appreciated it moreinstead it became a waste of resources bluray disk time and moneywhoever released sonic like this should be relieved of their jobsonic needs to be rethinked from the dreamcast days
dreamcast was the last time sonic showed what he is made ofive just loved sonic games for too long to not be upset about this
ill start with the good newsyou can buy it for a cheap pricethe characters are cute little animals well not elisethats about all i got for you
the rest is pretty much horriblesonic takes shadows place with maria in shadow the hedgehog sonic adventure  sab by kissing a human girlother than the fact that that point is being bitten off shadows story its utterly disgusting
they actually kissdidnt think they were going to take it that farsonic just stick to amythe storyline is a bad attempt at a good one
ah wellat least they didnt waste the whole time biting off their previous gamesloading times take up about half of the game sometimes it takes so long i think my game crashedand yet its not worth the wait bringing me to my next pointglitches
its just so easy to make a list and most of the time theyre not funny which is weird for me because i usually find glitches hacks mistakes and bloopers highly amusingfunny how they called it sonic the hedgehog after the artwork sonic team made for genesis while this ones garbageyes im even upset about the nameagain with the new character thing
yes shadow and jet were okay and chip wasnt really that bad but elise and silver
my problem with elise when she kisses sonic he comes back to lifeew
my problem with silver he seems to be a futuristic sonic and he always seems to be mr perfect not referring to curt hennig
in my view a completely useless charactercamera angles get more annoying by the level
people who didnt have trouble with those are luckyyep thats ita poor and choppy attempt at a socalled next generation sonic the hedgehog
one starso i got this right when i got a ps
i was so excited i had seen trailers and i had been waiting a long time for a good sonic gamei never even got past the first section of the first level
the controls and camera are just terrible
i literally could not move where i wanted
i tried for about  more minutes then gave upthe game was rushed
the instruction manual says there are things in the game that  in fact never made it in the final release
the load times are totaly unacceptable incredibly long load times for just  five seconds of either a cg or minigame instruction
the controls are horrible and in some areas the ground is there but you can still fall through
the slowdown in this game is unbearable and the camery will kill you
try to avoid this game alltogether unless you dont mind playing  dollars for itimagine your child coming up to you in tears because someone shot sonic
i was standing there and he died
and his body was lying on the ground and i dont know why they shot him
this is what i get for not watching every minute of this horrible gamemy daughter and i have played every sonic game we could get our hands on
some of them are wonderful some were pretty awful but this is the one i have to tell you about
in the beginning i was fascinated by this long glossy finalfantasylooking cinematic
but once the gameplay starts its a hideous awful disaster
this sonic game doesnt know if it wants to be a roleplaying game or a d action game but both are unbearable  missions to wander around and figure out who to talk to theres a puzzle that has no pattern for exampleyou just talk to everybody until one of them coughs up an answerbut he lies to you the first time to make you go around again and worst of all levels where you tear along at a high rate of speed and then plant facefirst into death
touch the controls and screw everything up
dont touch the contols and screw everything up
if i tried to make a video of the gameplay itd be an endless montage of death after death many of which you dont even know what you did wrong
the only way to get through is to be a robot  i pressed the x button last time now lets see if triangle does anything
new game
 minute loading screen
lose all your lives
 minute loading screen
complete a level
 minutes go make a sandwich or maybe play a better game while it loadsyears later i still cant wrap my head around how this game got created
its a colorful exercise in cruelty and i cant see how it could do anything to sonic fans but punish themolder guy rating a kids game so consider that with my review
but i didnt get this game at all
so this ones for kids onlythis ruined sonic completely the storyline is whack the player mode sucks and kinda hard the way the you run and theres a space or a part you get stuck in the old sonic games were more better with better storyline and design this game was a little off balance so this game wasnt good at allthe camera sucks and gets stuck on things like someone is trying to follow you with a video camera so it causes you to not be able to see where your going
you cannot touch water or you fall into a black hole and die instantlywhich you will do alot in the first level you go back to the start loading times and cut scenes included if you lose all your lives the voice overs are terrible the animations sucks and overall this game is just a total disasteravoid
i still play the real sonic the hedgehog on genisis or rom when i want to play a good sonic game the news ones sucktheres too many glitches and errors in this game the story plot is horrible as well as the missions presented in this game
sega rushed this game out a little too quick and that was their down fall
this game makes secret rings look as good as sonic gameplay  music  story  the only good thing about this game is the soundtrack excluding the characters theme songs
theres better sonic games out there look elsewherethey keep trying to make sonic an rpg this is not what sonic is aboutthis is game is about as fun as watching pait dryand a story line like some kind of final fantasy rip off but only corny as hell dont bother this game really really really is badif u want a sonic game rent sonic sonic i bought this game recently from amazon for around six dollars with hopes that despite the poor reviews that i as a stoic sonic the hedgehog supporter would be able look past its flaws and find a core consisting of at least a well meaning attempt to continue the adventures of one of my childhood heros
the joke was on me however when all i found was a massive collection of glitch after glitch instead of anything even remotely resembling the game i deluded myself into believing existed
i have been playing sonic games since the sega genesis was a topoftheline product which is farther back than i care to remember and when the sega dreamcast was introduced i purchased one for the sole purpose of buying and playing sonic adventure which was a mindblowingly spectacular game
the reason that this information is relevant is to show that after all these years of sonic existing as one of my favorite fictional characters of all time i can honestly say without the slightest exaggeration that this game will forever leave a scar on one of my most cherished video game related memories
nothing about this game can even be considered close to being halfway mediocre it really is that bad this is not a joke
if you are a sonic fan then do yourself a favor if you consider buying this game and burn your money instead so that you never have to endure this mockery of video gaming culture
if you are not a fan of sonic the hedgehog then this game would make a fantastic supporting argument if you insist that mario is superior to sonic although you would still be wrong
i am kicking myself for wasting six whole dollars on this game when i would gladly pay five times that amount to never play it again
in summary everything about this game is nothing less than utterly contemptible and i hope whoever designed this game is never allowed to even think about designing another game without having to pay an outrageous finei remember playing sonic the hedgehog for the sega genesis and sega cd and having a blast
it was simple played well and was fun to play over and overnow this load ofshowed upthe goodsonic is on the next gen systemsthe animated movies are mostly fluid and fun to watch until you notice how poor the voice acting is
there are some funny mess ups with the animation during the cut scenes when characters start to speak but their mouths continue to move even though the dialogue is donethe badthe camera is almost never focused on what you need to see
the enemies are offscreen where you cant fight them and you die because you are blind to them
when youre in the tank with shadow you drive off the map and cant find your way aroundthere are glitches
sometimes when youre running through loops your character falls through them when theyre obviously not supposed to and you diethe load times are frequent
they occur before a cutscene after a cutscene before a boss fight after a boss fight after you die before and after you begin the next phase
it slows the action down to bordom within minutesthere is nothing original about this game that would set it apart from other sonic games or other platform gamesthis could have been half way decent if the development team had done proper testing and fixed all of the problems
they obviously dont care about quality or a good reputationi had heard from a friend recently about sonic the hedgehog sonic  and how bad it was
i havent played a sonic game since sonic adventure and i grew up with the original series on the sega genesis
in fact sonic  was one of the first games i ownedso i had fond memories of this series although i had been oblivious to the development of more recent titlesi couldnt believe that it could be that bad so i ended up purchasing a copy for  dollars at a local swap meet to sate my curiosity
this would turn out to be the worst  dollars i ever spent
after playing the game for about four hours i couldnt take any more
rather than continue playing it i turned to youtube to watch and see if the ending was any betteras i simply did not want to play any more of it myselffrom a gameplay perspective sonic team truly botched this attempt
the camera is horrible and controlling sonic has never felt more sickening
sonic can no longer rev up for a speed boost and his movements feel jittery
because of poor control dying is common and frustrating because of the games absolutely absurd loading times
i would predict about  of this games length could be entirely loading screensno jokethe presentation is equally horrid
theres a lot of bad level design here as even the hub worlds are way too big and difficult to navigate
sonic and his friends are all here poorly rendered and animated
disturbingly sonic team decided to place these odd furry mascots alongside realistic looking human beings
if that werent bad enough sonic even has a romantic relationship with one of these humans
the contrast here is jarring and somewhat disturbingthe story is absolutely insipid and the entire thing feels like bad fan fiction
the only fortunate thing is that the ending which i looked up online completely retcons the entirety of the game as if sonic team knew before the game was complete that they wanted this to be forgottenin summation obnoxious controls extremely long load times a poor save feature that can make you lose lots of progress bad level design horrible presentation awful story and a literally forgettable endingyeahthis game is horrible
one of the worst games ever
period
if you were a fan of sonic in the old days this game will only destroy your fondness for the franchiseive been told games like sonic generations are better
stay far away from this game thoughnow look here im a huge fan of sonic i have been for over  years now
even i a huge hardcore fan is warning you kind people to not spend your hard earned money on this catastrophic piece of entertainment that sega dares call a game
look this game is awful
if its not the broken game mechanics then its the plot hole infested story and if you havent lost interest by then the horrible voice acting would have driven you insane
now i know this looks bad but thats because it is
sonic games have been much better since this game im writing this review in 
the sonic series has been doing very well recently
if youd like a good game from the series pick up sonic unleashed sonic chronicles sonic  episode  andor especially sonic colors
all the games i mentioned capture sonics universe and character much much better that this game ever did
trust me i beg you
buy any of the games i mentioned and avoid this game as if it were the plague
also yes fanboys i beat the whole gamethe story line was not goodand it was not worth the money i paid for
sorrynot at all happyreally
princess sonya kissed sonic after the chaos emeralds appeared
this game is the worst
just super bad
so many people saying glitches and bad controls
boojust what kind of th anniversary sonic game needs to be crappy with heavy load times and major glitches that makes part of the game almost impossible to beat
for instance when silver shouts its no use
 he launches an unavoidable psychic attack which kills you even with some rings on handsure ill give sega credit for making games challenging to play but if you make it too challenging this is what you get
glitches that cause trouble for the player who merely wants to scroll through the storylineplus i dont like the new look on dr eggman
i mean he looks a bit youngernext time sega dont be rushed to release the game if youre not done with it yet
i hope youre doing a remake of sonic  for  which would be sonics th anniversarygood luckive been waiting forever for twisted metal so i was looing for some kind of racing shootem up destruction you know what im saying but this game bites
no wonder i had never heard of it
dont waste your time as im not wasting another minute writing this reviewcondition was good a nd played smoothly but the game its self
a disgrace the worst title i have in my collection i bought it for the multiplayer and because full auto  was fun but this one pissed me off
played it twice once alone and the next time with a friends and the next day i gave it away
a piece of crapof course usually my expectations are low when i get a game for  especially a ps game because there is usually a reason a game is that priceim not making it up when i say i have played snes racing games like mario kart for one that control far better than this game does
its like every car is a tank and not a car at all
graphically this game is definitely an early gen game
ive seen some people mention online as a redeeming feature just do yourself a favor and buy blur if you want a true online experience no other racer on the market lets you race  to a roomif you want some blowing upaction with your racing games then go with splitsecond which just had dlc released or blur
dont waste your  on this gamewell i will review the ones eforcecity will give you if you decide to buy from them and what can i say other than i can only review a false product meaning its not even what is listed on the product page as they are just protectors for small phones and cameras
lcd proctectors for cell phones  nintendo ds lite screen protectors no matter how much eforcecity or anyone else likes to deny it
i even read another review saying the same thing and that they dont even fit your screen
not only that im heard one other person complaining about the company in question
i see what they were going through
buy from eforcecity at your own riskthis is a worthless item that makes no sense at all
after i opened the package they then tell you that a bubble around the outside is normal i do not want to play games with a bubble around the edge
it looks like i didnt apply them rightit is a waste of time and money it is a good thing they were cheapthis game is only for arcade use
do not purchase if you want to experience flight similar to the real planes
i feel that if you are not a flight sim person and just want a game you can shoot and shoot then this will appeal to you
there is a segment of flight gamers that will really enjoy this type of flight game
i do not use the term flight sim because this game has none of the characteristics of a flight sim such as il and microsoft x the graphics are good thoughso for arcade like fun great flight some nowow here i am writing a bad review 
i didnt think it possible its ironic that they put this game next to iron aces wich i rated as cardboard aces the graphics are lile crayon drawings 
now this one even with this years new computer   massive memory and top of the line video card 
i can not get this game to install 
ok if your reading this you must like flight simulators 
dont waste your money as i have 
the best are still il and il  sturmovic also il  ace expansion pack 
those are great flight sims it seems today they spend the marketing on the box and the game does not even load up
trust me go for il forgotten battles ace expansion pack that game does not dissapoint in anywaygame will not run properly with my thrustmaster tflight hotas x joystick
according to bold games tech support theyre not going to release any current patches to fix the problem
so save your money on this onebought this recently to use on my brand new arcade bundle
wish i had read the reviews before purchasing
same issues everyone else has mentioned for past  yearsobviously nothing was fixed
only one battery charges
batteries only fit in the controller if jammed in
controller does not recognize the battery green light spins endlessly so it doesnt matter anyways
last time i buy an alternative productthis kit is pretty easy to sum upcheaper than the microsoft modelnot nearly as high qualitythe battery life is about as long as the microsoft brand ones not nearly long enough in other wordsthe battery packs are microscopically larger than the originals meaning they barely fit the controllerthe charge dock doesnt charge the microsoft brand packs this one really irritates menow you know what i wish i knew before i bought it
thankfully there are now about a hundred different charging options besides this oneupdate one of the battery packs now refuses to hold a charge even though i have used them as much as the microsoft ones
so one star it is then buy the microsoft brand insteadthe xbox  does not have  usb port
it has  the reviewer who said it has  obviously doesnt own a  andor probably works for the company that makes these things
the xbox  has  usb port in the back for the optional wireless kit and  on the front panel
duhpersonally this device is not worth much especially if you consider that most of us that have digital cameras can also obviously get those digital pictures onto our pc already via docking station or a card reader on your pc  most likely however would be a docking station or you may already have a usbtopc cable that you transfer your pictures to and from
so with that said just get yourself a  usb flash drive aka usb stick for sale everywhere these days and just plug that into your front panel instead eg with photos mps etc
i use these tiny usb sticks all around my house epecially if i want to throw some pics or music onto my xbox  to listen or look at
simple compact and cheap and now available right at the checkout counters of office supply stores and walmart as wella multireader for the xbox  is ridiculous and redundant if you already have a pcworked great for a few days
then when i needed it the most during my rock band party it decides to stop working and hasnt worked since
i love paying  for something that works for three days
probably as much as i love bashing my own head against a wall repeatedlyok we all love classic bubble bobble
the classic game is here in all its glory
the new version is terrible
one stage spans  screens so there is alot of not see whats going on
whats more the characters are bigger and so are the pixels
indeed the new version actually looks worse in spite of the brighter colorsthe new version also has a major bug that makes the game unplayable past level   there a boss is supposed to appear which never does and as you can move on other levels before beating the boss you are stuck
which is just as well because you wont want to play the new version for more than  seconds anywayfor this reason the game gets one starnow if you are interested in bubble bobble on a portable get bubble bobble  old and new for the gba
this  version of the game is not only graphically more impressive the new version in that title is an amazing joy to play and offers many features like a museum that are absent hereits odd my laptop is fairly new
i wasnt able to play this game
why
im not sure
my system passed their systems check
there was one thing that said acel
not sure what that was
save your money if your computer isnt brand spanking new your not playing this game
i had to learn that the hard way
i hope you dont have tomaking a video game doesnt necessarily means that you have to have to be over realistic
why there are games with very simple designs and visuals on pc like harry potter and the chamber of secrets or the first one called philosophers stone and the movies that can be very fun to play and get you entertained over and over again even though everything isnt perfect visually which is the case with desperate housewives the video game
where there is both a good story and visuals
even though there is enough product placement in it to remind you that the all laundry detergent slimfast chrysler cars bertolli pastas sears and all this rubbish that pollutes television is the ideal for the twentyfirst centuryhowever it is unacceptable that a game based on a very popular tv series and sold to the public in general stores amazon and costco so that it can be played by millions of players is overfilled with bugs crashes and other kind of problems that people have to download a patch on the internet and correct it to make it more playable
i write more playable because when you pay it either on windows  or on xp there are still enough bugs and crashes coming out at you so that it can ruin the whole fun of the game
trust me it is frustrating to try to get your charcter to brees house for the weekly poker game and then all of a sudden your game freezes and thats it you cant find out how the story ends
it is  bucks wasted on something that should have been tested more properly by the makers of the video game
something that they didnt doso if you want to buy a game with a good story like this one but isnt too much filled with bugs to ruin your pleasure and remind you that the makers rushed it out too fast and didnt test it properly then do not buy this gameyou are not told that if you are missing just one thing on your computer that cant handle this gameguess what you cant play it without upgrading your computeri chose this rating because while playing god of war  i got up to the boss fighttheseus and there is no sound music after the part where kratos acquires horse keepers keyand open the second door it should start at cut screen  where a blue guy would zap kratos andgive him cronuss rage  power up instead my copy just stops working all togetherthis is my first rpg game and will be my lastthe quests are nit picking and boeringi had to quit the game after several hours of playing because of the numorus bugs in the gameone of them being the black screen bug associated with having the nvidia geforce video cardmy pc more than meets the game recomended requirements but the further i got in the game the more bugs started showing up untill the game just was not worth the troubleat first everything was great then the black screen problema little later parts of the screen would blue out if i turned a certain directionin battle i would have to run around to a position where i could see the what i was fightinganyone who can play this game with a nvidia graphics card i say good for you but it did not work for mewell this game finally destroyed my pc before i could finish iti bought it for my xbox  and it played greative played alot of star trek games
going back to the original star trek game for the nintendo this is by far the stupidest game ever designed
the training course alone is enough to drive you insanethe visuals are not stunning
the game play is pretty lame
and you cant even skip the cut scenes
almost  of ps games allow you to skip cut scenes if you want to go on with the game
plus it takes like two minutes to load the main menu
its billed as shoot em up but you view it from a semi birds eye viewmy purchase was an impulse buy
if you are reading this stay the hell away from this gamei think that the design company went extremely cheap with this game as if though it was designed by  year old high school students or something
this has given me serious second thoughts about bethesdas other game for the pc legacyi played this game a total of  times and this game kept coming up bad disc error or something like that
i already returned it once and its going back again apparently im not the only one having this problem
bethesda really screwed up on this oneif you have insomnia and youre fresh out of nyquil try playing stl
youll be fast asleep in no time
the voice acting is laughable the visuals are bland and the missions are absolutely boring
id find it hard to believe that even the geekiest of star trek fan would find this game fun starsthis is a terrible gamethe controls arent well designed partly because the game is mainly set in d but is also d whenever it is most inconvenient
you are controlling a fleet of ships but the controls arent up to the task of controlling individual ships which is frequently necessary
commands to individual ships are often mysteriously forgotten
the ai
for both the enemies and your own ships is quite poor
tedious micromanaging is the normthe main voice acting is merely decent while the secondary voice acting is dreadful due in no small part to muddled accents father was russian and mother was scottish
even worse dialog during combat is actively misleading with lines such as shields are down captain
when all ships shields are actually finethe space battles are dull affairs as you have so little control over the single ship you are managing at any given moment
on top of that there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to the effectiveness of the weapons and shields
on many occasions ive found it necessary to retreat from an enemy who had hammered my ships only to repair and return and find that same enemy is suddenly ridiculously weak and easy to destoryeven at the easy setting the difficulty of this game has nothing to do with the actual gameplay and everything to do with the how well or how poorly the mission is crafted to the controls and how random are the spawned enemy be they ships or asteroids or even timed events
more than one mission and you cannot skip a mission is nothing more than tedious hours of repeating the mission until you are lucky enough to overcome the objectivesstar trek fan or not avoid this gamepokemon ranger has to be one of the shittiest and most pointless editions to the pokemon franchise ever
all you do is run around the world controlling pokemon by circling them time and time again
this could take you  hours to complete with constant stress and a story you will most likely forget in  days
the graphics are a piece of garbage tutorials are a piece of shit
 bucks for a game that came out  years ago
bioshock  is only  dollars and it was made in  seriously nintendo review your pricesi bought this game and played it for  minutes and then switched back to gow
tryied online and no fun there either
characters looks like stupid mice and have to keep on recharging urself before you can fight
not fun
sold back to eb games 
i would say its not even worth rentingsocom is best when played online
well it was but not anymore
now it is impossible to have a decent game online
too many cheaters people with rapid fire rockets double health invulnerability vehicles that can climb mountains invisible vehicles pistols more powerful than an assault rifle and many othe glitches
i had been waiting for a long time for the developer to fix the problems but theyre not doing anything at all
dont waste your money on this onei rented this game last weekand after putting four hours of my time into it i discovered that i put the controller down in a worse mood than when i picked it upthis game is a waste of time
it looks great but just isnt playablethe ai isnt capable enough to handle combatat all
your party members just walk into the enemy swing and die
blocking is very effectivebut your ai party members never do it
you spend over half the time in combat stopping to bring up the menu to heal or revive your alliesi died three times in the second area of the game as well
dispersed among the levels are absolutely terrible monsters that will can easily kill your party
the treasure chests attack you
and they annihilate you
theyre by far the most difficult enemy in an rpgs early game that ive seen
one hit from them takes off most a characters hp it can hit multiple characters and can sometimes attack more than once per animation
the game also scales them up in levels to always be vastly stronger than you and to top it all off the game explicitly prevents you from running away from them the run menu is greyed out when they attack you this is completely against the general exploration theme of rpgsyoure supposed to find and open treasure chests not wonder if the chest contains an item or a practically guaranteed game overthe game also froze once when i was playing it
interestingly enough it was when i opened a treasure boxthe screen flickered and just stoppeddont pay  for this game its not worth the frustration or the moneyneither of my sons seems interested in this game
i thought it was a good idea but as with my wipeout pure purchase i blew it
my yr old gave it his fatal poopie game ratingratchet  clank size mattersnot worth money ata allthis game does not have any great gameplay or camera workstick with insomniacs versionsred steel packs in a lot of interesting ideas and quirks that ultimately just dont come together
whether it was due to unfamiliarity with the wii technology the rush to meet a console launch deadline or both red steel is filled with myriad glitches and annoyances for every innovation madesword fighting is a nifty idea that ultimately devolves into oversimplified slashing as opposed to something more graceful
of course part of this can be blamed on the limitations of the wii remote but it doesnt change the end result  a timingbased mode that resembles a poor mans punchout
and whose special moves are incredibly difficult to pull off thanks to some unresponsive motion controlstargeting is great  using the wii remotes pointing capabilities for shooting is always a treat  but changing your viewing angle is awful since its contingent on you jamming your targeting reticle at the edges of the screen
in a slowerpaced game like zelda this was acceptable
in a firstperson shooter this is as limited as if not moreso using an analog stick instead of mouselook and  as a result  just does not cut it
the bullettime gimmick is brought back here and it at least adds a bit of variety to how you plan out your gun battles but the zoomin motion needed to effectively use it is awkwardthen theres the host of clipping bugs inactive enemy character models and enemies who freeze in place
add these issues on top of the aforementioned rough motion controls and lazy viewing angle mechanics and the game ends up feeling like a mess
undoubtedly these were due to the rush to meet launch and while we can sympathize with developers who face this pressure the sad truth is that  again  the end result is what it is a halfbroken gamered steel really could have been something and though this game miserably fails to be a compelling experience theres enough of a foundation of ideas here that i have faith in a sequel as long as the development team does its due diligence
with wii motion plus on the way and the lack of unwanted console launch pressure red steels successor could be everything that this game wants to be
for now though this title should be skippedokay first of all i couldnt even make it through the first level without spinning looking at sky his gun in the air while enemies shoot at the dumb sapi found myself just shooting at random things while the bad guys were firing at me
the nunchuck was not impressive granite it was the first level but its supposed to get easier they throw you in the game and people are already killing youthe wii remote doesnt offer much sense of direction either i point it down and he looks up how
i thought it was a first person shooter how in the world do they expect you to get through the game when you cant even point and shootsorry ubisoft i like prince of persia and king kong but this game reallyreally sucks
thank you that is alli actually played red steel  before playing this one so that might not have been a good idea
although the controls were so bad on this game that i didnt even bother to finish it
it looks pretty cool but if its so uncontrollable that you cannot enjoy it whats the purpose of playing it then
i wouldnt even bother with this one and just play red steel  instead
there is no connection between the two games and rs is very cool
blows this game awaythis was the first wii game i got and its mostly because i couldnt get a hold of zelda
red steel looks promising
certainly its controls are good but it feels more like a game thats supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment
a tutorial of sorts
the problem is that it isnt much fun to deal withyou play as scott a man in japan with his girlfriend
you suddenly find out that her father is a yakuza mob boss and that hes got tons of enemies
your girlfriend gets kidnapped and so its up to you to save her ultimately getting yourself involved in this family struggle
its pretty simple stuff
most of the game is told through voice acted cutscenes or graphic novel like storyboards
the graphic novel storyboards look interesting but its really painful that you cant skip any of these cinematics or storyboard cutscenes
this is especially annoying when you die and you have to listen to the same objective over and over againred steels appeal is its gameplay which seems to be the focus of the game
the controls are solid for the most part but again the whole game seems like a tutorial to get used to the wii remote
you use the remote to aim at enemies and the b button to shoot
the nunchuck allows you to pick up weapons reload said weapon and tip over tables youll know what can be accessed because it has a golden outline around it
the nunchuck is also how youll move around
you can strife from side to side and you can move forward
the nunchuck also allows you to jump and duck
youll be doing a lot of duckingthe remote is responsible for most of the gameplay
it allows you to turn from one side of the screen to another
the game itself will help you get adjusted with a tutorial provided at the beginning of the game with your grifriend directing you what fish to look at
youll be able to use the remote for several things
you can lock onto enemies with the a button and if you hold the a button you can zoom into enemies by moving the wii remote closer to the screen or you can zoom out
its all pretty cool but the remote is extremely sensitive
just the slightest flick to the left and youll look to the left
its great to actually point and shoot at an enemy your accuracy is really important but now its all up to you whether or not you hit an enemy
granted the controls take time to get used to but they flow particularly wellswordfights are another story though
these are annoying sequences actually
mostly because the controls are clumbsy
youll have to swing your sword using the wii remote and youll parry and dodge attacks using the nunchuck
at first this is fun but its so limited
when fighting with swords you cant pull out a weapon
this is bad when youre in the middle of a firefight and some guy has a sword
youll be forced into the sword fight even when all the enemies using guns are still up
and theyll still fire at you and youll lose health
theres no way to back out of sword fights either and thats also really annoying
the controls just feel clumbsy as well especially with its extreme sensitivtyto the gameplays credit there are some interesting things you can do
for starters when youre not shooting someone and youre ducking behind something your health refills
at first this makes the game seem easy but you have to understand that if youre taking damage or shooting at all your health doesnt refill
so this doesnt make the game incredibly easy
also after a sword fight youll have the choice of finishing your attacker off or sparing his life
sparing his life earns you respect which you can use to learn more techniquesthe game doesnt look fantastic but its not bad looking either
its visual presentation is alright but the part of the graphics that lacks are the games numerous bugs and glitches
there are moments where youll be staring an enemy right in the face and he wont move
wont flinch or even attack you
he just stands there waiting to be killed
sometimes enemies will run right past you or claim they cant see you when youre in plain sight
there are also moments where i shot an enemy in the back and neither him nor his comrades even acknowledged my existence
there are probably more bugs than this found within the game but it was hard to take after a whilethere are a couple of other annoying aspects of the gameplay as well
you can only hold two weapons at a time
this isnt as annoying as it sounds but i wish i couldve held on to more
luckily ammo is not hard to come by at all
there are also glitches such as your bullets passing right through an enemy while he takes you out
enemies shooting through walls
this game is just full of themi wish i could say it sounds good but it doesnt
the voice acting is very mediocre and the soundtrack isnt great either
some levels sound good but theres nothing memorable herered steel has a good control scheme going for it but thats really all it has going for it
its not a fantastic game by any means
the bugs and glitches strewn throughout are also just really annoying
its hard to recommend this game even to die hard first person shooter fansthe goodthe control scheme workswell there is lots of actionthe badtons of bugs and glitches found throughout the whole game enemies who dont attack or walk right past you
enemies who cant see you in plain sight
bullets going through walls or through your enemies this game is full of them and they detract from the gameplaysword fighting is clumbsyyou can only wield two weapons at oncewhen youre forced into a sword fight theres no way you can get out of it until the fight is overhorrible voice actingtheres really no story to itthe controls while good just seem like another ploy to get one used to the wii remotei love the call of duty games in general so i bought this version for the wii
it is abhorrentthe controls are often backwards and change from scene to scene such as when spotting enemies for a tank in the beginning you have to use the minus button to fire but later on it is a different button
when using mortars and antitank guns you have to rotate the wii controller to position the gun to fire and it always seems backwards from what it should be
the heavy machine guns dont aim like the real thing and they are useless compared to the normal machine guns such as the thompson or the mpmaps if you arent paying attention it is easy to get turned around and have to wander a bit to find the location that you are supposed to be atfighting mode absolutely idiotic
there are i think three places in the game where you have to fight an opponent and the controls for it are nothing like what you would actually do and you cannot avoid these fights
the first time i encountered it i had a heck of a time figuring out what the on screen directions were trying to tell me to do so i ended up swinging the remotes wildly in all directions till i found something that worked
it wasnt anything like what the on screen directions were indicating at all
you can not fight any other characters in the game in this way only those three enemiesthe arrow keys  controls for grenades switching guns and fighting  often do whatever the want so you end up throwing a grenade instead of switching gunssensitivity needed to be adjusted almost all the way off in order to keep from spinning wildly around when turning
you would think that you would only have to adjust if the controller was too slow or somethingshooting you can shoot the enemy in the head three or four times and he just gets right back up but if he shoots you twice youre done for
this sometimes flipflops around and you suddenly find that you can take  hits before dying
it is not relevant to what level of the game you are on either ie
it doesnt necessarily get harder the further you gotanks and jeeps the controls for these are quite different and the tank is idiotically hard to drive
i ended up holding down the button to align the tank to the turret all the way through just so i could drive it correctlythe ending what a let down
i was waiting for the final battle when i realized it was already all overmy final real pet peeve i dont like having to sit through the cutscenesmovies thats what i buy movies for not video games
seriously half of the game you are sitting through these and you cant push a button to skip them
the storyline that they are attempting to create is stupid and has little continuityit goes like this cutscenewalk into a building cutscenefire at enemies for  minutescutscenewalk into another building and fight for  minutescutscenesigh
i just have to wonder who it is that makes the final decision on these games sometimeswas it the head of the art department
every single game that has these there are always people complaining about them and yet  they keep putting them in
i thought the object of making video games was to sell them not to annoy your customerson other versions of this game on the pc
the only real problem i had were the movies
the game itself was good
this game just blowsi bought a copy of this game a few years ago and just now decided to play it
in the beginning of the game i got stuck and looked in a walkthrough
turns out the reason im stuck is due to a defect missing hoptspot
no wonder i was stuck
so i downloaded the patch and now the game wont play at all
the screen just turns black when i launch itplease help if you know a solution to this as i was unable to find any source of support for the gamethanks for reading thisplease do not spend your money in this game if you want to feel the skateboarding as it is buy skate  or  any of them
but tony hawk well so time ago ie
for play station  was awsomesuck
you just press x and the skate seems like a car accelerating jajajaj and you make an ollie over a house
nothing real at allwhat is this piece of crap
terrible cartoonish graphics horrendous voice acting especially compared to chaos wars a simple fighting system thatll make you snore and a boring unoriginal storyline
seriosuly my wet dreams have better stories than thisfor a good ps rpg play chaos wars or final fantasy xupdate well there is one good thing about this game
me and pedobear agree that anise is nice lolithe graphics are nice
there ive said about the only good thing i can think of about this gamethe gameplay is silly unintuitive and devoid of strategy
the story is alternately trite and forced as it tries to make sense of nonsensical gameplay elements
the heroine is a complete twit and i hope she ends up dead although im sure she wontsorry but i have come to expect far better from the likes of square
i bought this game based on their reputation as a maker of quality games
i wont be making that mistake againman
whats the fing deal with companies handing over their biggest game franchises to second and third party developers
havent they ever heard the old saying dance with the one that brought you
this game is horrible and if you say otherwise youre in bad need of therapy because youre so desperate for a video game that youve convinced yourself this is worthy of your timeor maybe your time is truly that worthlessin which case you should contemplate drastic measuresfirst off the game is very linear
call of duty  truly felt like an open battlefield whereas this one feels like a ride at disneyland
sure the scenery is beefed up and beautiful but how about those character animations
the mouths arent synched to the dialogue and they do that mindless handwaving thing when they talkjust like all cinematics did back on the ps and nthe ai is horrible
in call of duty  you couldnt just hold your crosshairs in the same spot and wait for the idiot german to pop up in the same place so you could plug him
in this one you canbut you just dont care toalsoits glitcheriffic
i shot a german and he flew straight up into the air completely off the top of the screen
i snuck up behind another german and hit him with a melee attackthe friggin dude did two front flips and flew like twenty yards
mind you he was in the standing position the entire time
not unlike tossing an action figure across the yardthis game left a stale taste in my mouth and really just pissed me off
call of duty  was s only killer app
if nothing else these people need to realize that once you have a great gameall we really want as gamers is a great big expansion pack
they couldve added  more hours of additional content to call of duty s campaign missions and i wouldve paid  cash on the barrelhead sonway to go jackaesnot sure what activision was thinking by putting this out
call of duty  was awesome
the game feels like a dumbed down version of  with lots of terrain bugs
on top of it the ai is way dumber in   all in all this game doesnt even deserve more of a description if there is a black sheep in this seriesthis is it
enough saidi wad very dissapointed of this game
call of duty  was a lot better
the campain is the same as all the wwii games that came before it storm the town kill the nazis
im kind of getting tired of wwii games too
theyre all the same
rent it if you really love it buy itget gears of war instead
i like the civil war for xbox tooyou should definitely avoid paying retail for this title
its really not that good compared to what else is available and the improved graphics and audio are the very least one should expect from a next gen console game
the fact that theres nothing new here is particularly frustrating
i think the wwii experience peaked about  years ago with certain of steven speilbergs productions
we can never repay the greatest generation and making stale video games meant to approximate what those people saw and did is the very height of cynicism
the only thing that could trivialize the horror of wwii more than this game is probably some kind of sugar cerealthings that suckextremely linear gameplayworthless multiplayerannoying aihighly contrived hand to hand combat scenes that literally resort to button mashingunclear objectivesvery little control over what equipment you can use basically you should steal the first german mp you can get your hands on for ammo purposesunclear reasons for dyingoftenlittle in the way of funby the time i finished this game naught  days after purchase and moderate play i felt no other sense of achievement than i didnt have to play it anymore
once you finish the game thats it you dont get anything special when you start a new campaign  like the ability to select the one or two cool guns that exist in this game
you dont get any medals no promotions i mean who cares
the only reason to play it again is to try to justify its unwarranted expense
do not buy ithow about a korean war game or maybe vietnam
do those conflicts not deserve our respect understanding or attention
isnt this supposed to be a variety of edutainmentmultiplayer games on xbox live are fun until it freezes or disconnects for no reason
they should fix these things before releaesing the game
the singleplayer game is mediocre at bestim a huge fan of call of duty united offensive and  on pc
however cod  was disappointing in numerous ways so i was excited to be wowed again by cod  for ps
unfortunately nothing of the sort happened
things looked great at first during the training session then the game starts and i quickly realized  the graphics are a big problem
at first they look great
the problem is when you start trying to shoot people and realize that the graphics are blurry and its hard to see
apparently they made these graphics for the  and ps but the problem is ps cant handle graphics that good
in that sense id take the graphics of cod  any day a game which gives incredible distance graphics where you can spot someone far off
the second thing i dont care for is using the ps controls
i guess thats a matter of preference but on the other hand i was impressed with the controls for timesplitters future perfect resident evil  and urban chaos riot response
to me the weapons and moving here just dont feel good or fluid
in fact they make me feel sick
the controls in cod  are probably the best in any fps ever to datethis game might be worth playing on  or ps if you like console controls because im sure the graphics are a lot better
but i cant recommend it as a ps game
on march th  medal of honor vanguard for ps will be released
it looks like an amazing game if it controls well it will easily surpass cod its  and this is what they come out with
my god theres more gaming variety in super mario bros
boring boring boring boring boring boring boring
boringi play a lot of games and i have only ever had one or two that lock up and crash my pc
windows xp
i run many video intensive games as well but this one crashes over and over
i took it back off
from the little time i did use it it was boring and only interesting for about  minutes
the graphics and sounds are about  years behind the times even for  which is when this game came outi downloaded the version  patch and lost all of the profile files i had and there were no more challenges just a blank screen and when i clicked on start im in a field with grass and trees instead of a river
i think the patch is on cracknot worth the moneyyou can only play with  characters they are missing alot of characters hulk punisher beast nightcrawler etc
and i have all chars
frustrating camera angles along with ultra devestating gameplay and control issues
for beginners theres going to be alot of confusion
the story is very weak and the graphics could be better then they are they used xboxs graphics engine lame
ai is unbearable because unused characters get in the way and take all your kills
ingame bugs are out of control level design is horrible and no variety and very repetitive
this game trys to be so much like city of heroes but fails miserablyif this game would of been designed and created like the two other spiderman games psxbox it would have been perfectdont like the story line mode
its too long and theres no face to face fight mode
i pass
 activision screwed this game up real bad
call of duty  for xbox  was a standout game and had infinite replay value online multiplayer and offline but it seems like they changed the flow of the game a lot
everything feels slow and boring and it pales in comparison to resistance fall of manif you have an xbox  get call of duty  or resistance instead
this game is really disappointingbought this thinking it would be like cod but boy was i wrong
the graphics are worse the gameplay is worse and the  minutes i pent playing online there were at the peak  people playing myself included
long story short i put it back on amazon the same day i received it in the mail
as much as i hate to say it im glad it sold even if it means passing this failure of a game onto someone elsei like the game but it is very hard to play on the ps
the graphics are a bit choppy and jump aroundand there are some points of the game where you have to do some silly things with the motion sensing ps controller you cant get by that part of the game unless you use that motion sensing feature
we had this game for the ps but ended up selling it used and getting it for the xbox   the game itself can be funbut do yourself a favor if you have both the xbox  and psmake sure you choose the xbox  version for this gamethis game was an amazing game until xbox  got dr doom as a playable character
the greatest hero in the marvel universe should be playable on all systems
other characters are ok but the ps bump over the ps version is mainly graphics
colossus grab moves are amusing but who the hell cares about moon knight
if people want to play as batman they should buy a dc game rather than settle for the cheeesy marvel knock off version
overall the game is very fun and i will modify my review to  stars the game would otherwise deserve if they come out with dr doom as a playablei would not recommend this game
my daughter has trouble reading the small print even though she is  yrs old and my  yr old cant read it at all
the screen is constantly popping up with more stuff to read
sometimes you have to click four or five times just to get past all of the reading
all of my three girls hate this game
there are just much better options out there for childrens gamessome even in the price range of this gamethe title of this review says it all
im going through a library of games and trying to play each one for at least an hour
i couldnt stand this game after  minutesi believe a key ingredient to a fun game is incentives give the gamer a reason to keep playing
for example in the game grand theft auto you complete missions to reveal more storyplot or to earn access to new and more powerful weapons  very powerful incentivesthis game completely lacks incentive
oh im on the next level more flashing colors random shapes and crappy repetitive music
oh joyseriously there is no reason to play this
at least i can keep the spare game case lolthank you for reading my review
if you enjoyed it be sure to rate it as helpfulafter the hype disney has given this game over the past several months i was expecting something really special and not a pokemon ripoff as the company had promised
well they got that part right but not much else
the game basically consists of you entering a level at one point randomly digging all over the entire map then searching for the exit
there is no online multiplayer as the wifi logo on the box might lead you to believe only local adhoc that is once you dig up the randomly placed cube needed to unlock that function
you also have to locate other hidden cubes to unlock such basic features as say using the cards that are included in the box
who thought up this genius idea
this is a kids game
another stinging point is no direct control over the spectrobes themselves just your main character who dies almost instantly any time he recives damage in a battle
you can only use the l  r buttons to activate spectrobes attacks while trying to position your player without dying
this seems like an idea for a new franchise that was ruined by poor planning or a desire to get the game out before pokemon diamond  pearl
trust me save your money for those games as they are  times more fun and rewarding than this onethe origional was awesome this is not the origional
they should call these remakes final fantasy iii remakes or something different so people dont waste their money thinking they are buying their classic favoritesnot only are the characters too shallow for anyone to really care whether they succeed or not but they also look ugly as hell
d does not always mean better looking as this game proves
the characters are all turned into precious moments creatures and the monsters are all babyfied
so not only does it look bad on the outside but its also got a pretty useless inside to matchlike most other people i knew about the game having a glitch that made it so you couldnt continue on with the game at a certain point and made it unable to get a  clear file
that was on the cart that had a more colorful sticker on the actual game chipcartwhatever
the fixed version had a grey background instead and took care of that one problem
but after enjoying the game and getting close to  something still managed to ruin everything my file was erased one day without warning
i had just played the game  minutes before turning it off to go make a phone call
heck my ds was still on me and when i started it back up my file was gone
everything i spent dozens of hours earning gone
because of that im telling you to not even bother with this game
when a fixed version has a problem this big whats the pointbut if you still want to risk it snk vs capcom card fighters clash is a pretty fun game though thats only if you have another person to play against
the story mode is very stereotypically japanese and has your main character taking on opponents in card battles curing them of the sudden darkness that overcame them in a great tower youre all in
you work your way up floor by floor battling everyone and earningbuying more cards
the storys boring and youre really only going to be playing this to see all the cool cards trust meplaying the game may look complicated at first glance especially to someone whos never played a ccg customizable card game before like me
but in truth its very easy to play
each player starts out with  cards
you select which ones you want to put on the battlefield
you wait a turn letting them activate and gathering power based on their respective colors each one has different colors they belong to and as the color power adds up you can use cards that require more power example one card requires  yellow power in order to be used so you have to build up that much power via other cards
when theyre ready you can attack your opponent and their cards
both them and their cards have their own hp and once the opponents is gone you win
trust me matches can go by pretty quick if youve got a good deck especially when some cards do over  hp of damage and your opponent only has  hp most of the time
if things seem complicated in the game you can always keep trying your hand at the lower level opponents and pay attention to how things work but chance are youll get it after  or  matches
theres always a nice tutorial mode toothere are a lot of different capcom and snk characters here many that will bring back memories from your childhood if you played their games in the early s
king of monsters is represented here for crying out loud
sure i didnt know every single character here but i was impressed at the diversity both companies had and was glad to see it wasnt just king of fighters and street fighter characters like you might think based on the cover art
the graphics on the cards are good but battle animations are limited to usually one of these categories punches fire lightning water ice sword slash gun shot and wind
theres one animation for each of them and thats it
the graphics outside of card battles are simple and very pokemonish
as for the soundtrack youll be hearing the same  tracks over and over
while theyre not bad to listen to youll probably end up turning the sound off and listening to a music player or somethingif you have a friend that has the game playing against them is the way to go because of how stupid the ai is here
there were many times when the cpu wouldnt do anything on their turn or would only attack one of my cards that had a ton of hp while the others only had a little bit left and couldve been taken out by their attack
if youve got a friend to knows how to play you guys could probably go on for  minutes
but thats if you really use everything here like support cards
but you know what
i never used any of those when playing unless there were matches that required me to have them
otherwise if you just have character cards you can still win without any problems
i think thats how most people played it tooi shouldnt have wasted so much time on this review since theres really no reason for anyone to buy a game that doesnt work right
its a shame they didnt fix it  because this couldve been a nice one to keep
its not as good as the card fighters for the neogeo pocket color but was still fun while it lasted
hopefully snk can get things right with the next installment if there is onepros you kinda get to play your fav capcom and snk characters like yugioh duel monsterscons not very intuitive because the translation was poorly done
i couldnt figure out how to pay the cost of some cardssome cards didnt even have their magic like effects cleary statedso i just quit
its fustraitingim glad i only paid  bucks for this trash
the only thimg this crap is good for is a trade in at gamestopotherwise dont waste your time or moneywhere to start i was expecting much from the addon to the great game fear
instead you get little
they reused much of the same textures dark areas and characters from the originalno new characters to speak offnon exsistent story line even weaker than  the first
you will have a hard time finding much new herethe game is far too short you can finish in about  hours and its too easy even on the hardest settingohh and to top it off it adds nothing to multiplayer at all no new levels characters or weapons not even a new modeif you never bought the original you can have the multiplayer for free
truly there is no reason to pick this up at all
the game is still fun in the way the first game was fun but feels less like an expansion and more like the last few levels they left out of the game not worth  dollars in anyway shape or form
best to wait and buy in the bargin bin for  dollars or less
in other words dont support developers who put this kind of stuff out at almost full game price its a rippoff at bestwe need to show big companies like ea activision and vivendi that its not alright to rip us off the only thing they understand is not buying their products
i finished this the first night i bought it in  hours of none too exciting gameplay
then you can uninstall and use as a coaster an expensive coastera demo is to show you what the game is likei loaded it and crashed my pcit was so buggy it was unplayable then it crashed my pc to the point i had to reload windows from my recovery diskdo not take a chance with this demo
i will never buy this gamethis game is poorly made
i love most adventure puzzle games but not this one
i agree with the other reviewers who say this was a big disappointment
the people who developed this game have not heard of something called a mouse
the game is st person d but you have to move with the keyboardand not even with the arrow keys with a s d and w trying to move through the scenes was an exercise in frustrationi was constantly running around in circles bumping into walls and sometimes ending up in random places as if i fell through the floor
according to a walkthrough i consulted i had made it about halfway through the game before i gave up and decided to move on to something less painful
another thing is that the graphics demands for such a simplistic game are insane
unless you have a fairly new computer you will have problems with the graphics in this game
i have a mb video card and while the game was playable the graphics were constantly freaking out and the panning was unbearably sluggish
its really too bad because i think i would have enjoyed finishing the story but i simply cannot stand to subject myself to this poorlyconstructed gamevery bad
better off with kinect
i do not recommenced buying this to anyone
kinect  vision camera sucks a lotthe camera is great if u only wanna video chat with other people it came with games but i didnt like them
so ima let my lil bro use this  ima get a kinect  price for this camera wasnt bad at all 
oh the seller didnt leave a tracking number so i saw the commercial for flight simulator and it looked pretty cool
reading all the reviews here on amazon it seems like i was one of the more lucky ones to have a smooth installation
everything thing went well game booted smoothly graphics looked nice but there are a few big major flaws to this game
first off microsoft took great lengths into detail like how the baggage carts move the gate opens and its almost like real life
however your plane cannot blow upcome on
what ever happened to real world problems
landing gear fails out of gas etc
all your plane does is keeps on rolling when it hits the ground
now heres the catch
you really need to cough up the extra  for a joystick to really get the max enjoyment out of this game
the mouse and keyboard dont cut it
personally there seems to be a lot of problems and its just not what i was expecting for 
ive only played this twice and im bored alreadyalthough there are many features and advanced graphics in this simulator you wont be able to see or use them with present day technology if ever
ms goofed in their future tech considerations and did not provide dual core technology or sli and banked on ever higher speed single core cpus  this is not going to happen in the future
the game cannot run with options set above medium settings on todays highend technology  it is a monumental disappointment
on top of that the geographical landscape in huge regions of the us and other areas is totally wrong and looks nothing like the real world
it is a slide show with  to  fps around major cities with everything dumbed down
dont waste your moneythis game does not run with the recommended system requirements listed on the box
i have an athlon x   with gigs or ram sata hd and an nvidia  gt and even on the low settings the game chugs along at  fps or lessi can only imagine how much money one would need to spend to upgrade a computer that is capable of running this game on the higher settings
i play most of the latest games on my system at x resolutions at the highest graphics settings and x aa and they run at over  fps without any hickupsthis game looks worse than the oldest playstation  games which when comparing the hardware is like comparing a bicycle to the space shuttlesave your money buy something else with the  for all this is good for is providing a good training tool for anger managementas many have said fs x is horribly bogged down by an inefficient software engine
compared to fs  the graphics quality potential has been increased with more reflections and sharper graphics but in order to access any of that you will need to have the absolute cream of the crop computer and i really do mean that top of the line no less
you will be living with frame rates anywhere from  with the graphics at about the same level as they would appear on fs  on max
this is unacceptable
the terrain doesnt feel as realistic as it did on fs and the overall fun of the game just isnt there anymorei strongly recommend staying away from this game unless you are running a top of line core i processor or higher with a top of line video card and about gb of ram
unless the graphics are turned up to near maximum you might as well just get or stick with fs a sonic racing game normally a good thing
not sonic r known for being a rushed out game for the failed sega saturn it has poor graphics strange not fit music and controls like sandpaper
it is no fun at all only something to stare at in disgusttitle says it all basically
i got pretty far in the game then it froze up and when i went to play it again i had to start over not only did this happen once it happened twice
needless to say i gave up on it because i got tired of the brian parts very annoying
definately not worth buying its worth renting to entertain for about an hour or this game is not creative or challenging
it does not offer a lot of thought and becomes quite boring and is now gathering dust on a shelfi have been playing hockey video games since before they had nhlpa permission to use the players names
but i have to say this is the worst hockey game i have played
i have not played nhl k for the  as of yet so this may just be the second worst but for now it is the worst  where to binpassing is simply awful
half the time you pass to the other team or up ice for an icing
it would be nice if representations of professional players could atleast pass to their own teamcomputer ai is awful
the players on your team that you are not controlling will sit in the zone and cause you to go off side about  dozen times a game
you literally have to skate around the neutral zone and wait for them to exit most of the gameopponent will either suck or be the greatest team ever
what i mean here is i played an entire season and lost almost every other game
so i would beat ottawa  and lose to montreal the next night  only to rebound to beat detroit   it seems that wins causes your goalie to suck it up while making your opponents betterspeed kills the fun
if the other team is faster then your team simulate though the game as you will have a better chance of winning
a slow team is a kiss of death as speed seems to be the only thing that matters to this gameshot tick is a joke
i know i will get blasted for this but i prefer the buttons
the stick seemed very non responsive at times
also it is impossible to line anyone up for a body checkbody checks are a joke
i attempted to knock koivu down with a body check by domi
domi chased him around the zone attempting to check him
not only did it not fall down but he never loss control of the puck
overall id say that if you want to play this rent it first
i guess i will have to try nhl k to see if it is as bad as this gameno way to win a faceoff
played video hockey games since they first came out and this is the worst
you would think ea sports would try out the games before shipping themwhere do i begin
i have been playing the k series for about the past  years or so
before then i always got the ea nhl games
well when i read  days before the release date that nhl k got delayed by about a month i decided to give ea another chance
after i started the game up i set my settings for the hardest difficulty level with the shot accuracy and power turned all of the way down
then i played my first game with the columbus blue jackets thats my team
i won the game   then i started my dynasty with the blue jackets
after  games my record was   also i had already scored  goals by that point
thats an average of almost  goals per game
im the columbus blue jackets this shouldnt be happeningi have gone on to play a few more games after that but have been pretty bored and frustrated with it
i played a game today and won   i should not be able to score  goals while playing minute periods
another annoying aspect of the gameplay is that the game seems to throw a fit when i score
so  of the time after i score a goal the cpu scores a goal within  seconds
it doesnt matter if their shot comes from the faceoff circle theyll make it
i usually end up having football scores by the time im finished rather than hockey scoresgraphics theyre ok  some of the faces look really good in a cartoonish way
lets face it ea makes their sports characters look more cartoonish than realistic
i have always preferred the graphics of the k series in any game
not only do the faces look cartoonish but the bodies look compacted
everyone seems really short and wide
its almost as if the makers of the game decided to make nobody taller than  feet on the icethe audio its horrible
the playbyplay commentator is the worst in video game history
the last word of every sentence is dragged out for abour a second
examplecolumbusneeds to make a line change soooooooooooon
and the music in the game is pretty bad
there are  or  tolerable songs thats it
i will say that the crowd sounds good but they will switch their reaction like a light switch
they will go from an cheer to an instant boo with no transition in betweento finally conclude this review downright awful defense its practically nonexistent shooters who are way too accurate subpar graphics and the worst commentary in a video game ever make this game a complete waste of money and time
i havent been this disappointed in a game for a long time
i play mostly sports games and this one is one of the worst that ive played
i am going to trade this in tomorrow toward my reserve of nhl k
my impatience certainly cost me this time
i figure i can get decent trade value for it if i turn it in soooooooooonafter playing live for the  it made me fall asleep it was boring and while the graphics are excellent it just has this weird vibe
the shots do not come off right the shooting animation is so slow that you can have a wide open guy on the wing and by the time he gets up and into the air and release the shot a defender can make up serious ground and block it
against the computer i had jj reddick and turkoglu blocked  times apiece by mourning and shaq coming from the basket on what were wide open shots
there are also a ton of missed dunks even howard missed several
it is hard to pull of threes as well since their guaranteed bricksthe point guard and fatigue issue also sucks
the comp team never subs regardless of sliders
and their point guard scores  of the points
i played vs milwaukee and maurice williams scored practically every basket
this occured regardless of what level
edit player is also a joke i cannot edit the height but at least i can edit the number and position
the rosters were supposed to be as of aug th but where is turiaf
and why is battie a fa he was never renounced or waivedthe press box angle is actually not bad
i dunno why live insists on having their players pass in uncoventional ways things like hookshot style passes behind the backs even though the situation does not need those
the subsitution is also clunky you can do the sub using the dpad during a break in the action but by the time you select the player you are bringing in the game resumes leaving you with the same people on the courtthe timeouts are also timed as in if you call a  there is a  second clock and so on
but you can always press a button to continue
the archs on the shots are off as well
who shoots a higharcher in the paint
there are no retroes unless their unlockable
the courts look good but they dont have mascots so it seems kinda dead
that should be the new name of this series
nba dead i dont blame mac for signing an nba k game during lives launch party
he knows what game is betternba live  for the xbox  looks next generation especially in highdef
but most of the time it still plays like currentgen or even to a degreemuch worse
the ingame camera is too shaky
the players twitch and dunk through other players including the backboard
bad programming folks
and unacceptable ea
im disspointed in this addition
ea sports really needs to control the lag time for online play which is basically unplayable
there should be no excuses this year
the game producers have had enough time to smooth everything out from live  most of the reviews here have vented all the messy game mechanics and awful programming which is glitchy and unplayable
sure the addition of espn is pretty cool and ea has added a dynasty mode to the  this year but who cares
this game plays awful
and i think everyone out there who has access to hd television will enjoy what k sports has done with their rendition of an nba sim
the producers for nba live  need to step down let some other folks take over to reenergize this game
i will keep my nba live  game for now until college hoops by k comes out and then trade the gamethis game is horrible
the charactors all run shoot dribble and move the same
ea you guys are as i said before but noone listens the worst devoloper out there
get k insteaddont believe me
watch this video and u will see how bad live isi had and quickly got addicted to nba live  for the xbox
when i picked up my  i thought okay now which games do i really really want to see in hidef
so i picked up the big three madden fight night  and the unknown to me at the time onestar wonder that is nba live i expected to lose i realize that when a new game version comes out
but you get used to the changes adapt and go on your winning waynot with this steaming dog turdlike many have said before the camera angles make it hard to keep track of the action and the computer just takes over the game
ive played it over and over again even with teams ranked lower than mine and the opposing team always makes almost all of their shots and their players are faster than mine
i swear they run like theyre knee deep in wet concretethe graphics are great but who cares if the gameplay stinks
i was hoping they would change the foul shooting mechanics for this version but no
so if in some miraculous instance you get fouled instead of the other way around dont plan on nothingbutnetsthe threepoint shooting is abismal and defense is nonexistent
one of the things i loved in the game was stealing the ball and cutting into a fast break
not in this game
for some reason you cant stay in front of your man and if you lean in too far and get dodged your guy stumbles about three steps and leaves his man open to charge the netand if you do get a fast break going your guys are so slow the other team is on your heels or have one or two guys at the net by the time you get therei bought the wireless version of  and actually thought it was a problem with the signal getting from the controller to the boxnopea lot of effort went into this you can tell
its beautiful to look at but playing it will make you want to pull your hair out by the rootsi actually went back to my old xbox and played nba live 
graphics arent as good but its not graphics im paying for
the thing plays greatthe graphics suck really bad this year
thunder  looked a lot better
no carl edwards
nascar needs to give their game rights to another game maker before ea runs it into the ground
very disappointed
buy  or later
the game literally looks like it belongs on the pswell personally i havent got a new nascar game since  theres no realistic flips and you have complete control of your car when you spin out damage is just rigid graphics with black paint
on fight to the top mode you cant join a actual race team
also if theres a wreck the whole field stops on a dime at  mph and the car wont stop like that for me real life cars keep goin and can only slow and avoid not stop and wait
anyone agree
also that share draft thing that pops up above the cars annoys me terribly
nascar  was funner then these gamesgame was received on time and packaged well however it is an online only game and the servers to play it no longer existi took a hit on this onei have completed the game and traded it in for store credit shortly after thankfully breaking even as i got this game originally for half price on a holiday sale
this game does not meet the hype
for those of you who dont know there is no story line or plot
all this game is is  days of mini games  games per day
i also might add for multiplayer you have to complete the mini games in single player first in order to use them in multiplayer whats the point of that
why make a mini game game and make you unlock the games there isnt even a plottrust me you will be disappointed
the mini games are repetative use the same basic controls for most part and they are relatively quick games
another thing about the controls most mini games use the same motions there is some variety but for the most part there are different mini games that use the same controls for example launching a rabbit by rappidly alternating up and down with the wiimote and nunchuk or making rayman run using the same motion described aboveas for single player fun there is little replayability for the games
as for multiplayer you and your buddies will probably get bored unlocking the games as it is and once you actually have them unlocked to play they arent that fun after playing them a few timesso overall this game has very slim longevity
if you are looking for a good adventure game get zelda
if you are looking for a multiplayer party game hold your money for wii play wario ware or mario party   this game simply does not meet the hypepoor quality in material the red octane dance mats were much better and had a glossy surface so your feet could glide over the steps this mat crumples up to often and is not stiff enough for the skill level i am used to playing at it makes a pretty sweet changing mat for my  year old son thoughi pull out the mats only to find a usb plug at the end of the cords
i plugged them into the ps and nothing happened
did i miss something
i googled this mat and it only showed videos of people using this for pc use but yet when i looked at what platform this product is for it said ps
it did come with a cd but my ps didnt recognize it and my laptop nearly froze trying to read the cd and then it couldnt extract the files when it finally did open
if anyone can help me fix this problem i would be greatly appreciative because i bought two of these mats and checked the mail everyday and until i got them so you can assume i am raging right now
i planned on using this with my ps for ddr extreme extreme  max  and supernova this head set was ok for about the first week then came the static the adapter that plugs the headset into the controller is huge which makes it uncomfortable while playing if u rest the controller in your lap while playing bc the adapter is always bumping into your body do not buy this headsetit just doesnt work
its extremely tight as well
basically a novelty toy for your kid if he wants to pretend hes an nfl coachyes i did this game one starter although the first game wasnt perfect the space battles did look good but the area of battle was very small compared to the ship size each mission seemed to be directed to a certain point but it was still more fun then this edition to the game i fell they fell flat on their face with this one be straightforwardness of the last game by just adding a another faction just became from what seemed would be something a little bit more simple the something little bit more complex to something that was just a mess there so many more empire and alliance ships and story they would be more interesting than the addition of this storyline never remember correctly there was something about you could not use the skirmish mode with the specifics that you could use in the original gameplay with the added contentthis game is a real frankensteins monster
this beast is built from three different game engines
one built on top of another
these engines do not seem to like each other all that much
then there are three expansions with their own quirks tossed in
these expansions by the way have also had to go through rewrites
the net result is utter insanity
this game has no idea what it is or even what its supposed to be
the end result is its not going anywhere and it isnt going to take you anywhere
at best you go in circlesall this bad developement has left this game mired in bugs
more then is acceptable for any game
furthermore you have to work your way through abandoned mechanics of mechanics that just refuse to work
you also have to accept that nothing is optimized for the game experience
you will find this game has no real feal other then point n click
simply put this games combat is unimaginative and lazythis game also suffers from a myriad of other woes
this is a dieing game
the mmorpg community as a whole has abandoned it
due to the latest engine change in large part
this leaves a empty wasteland in a game where you should be playing with others to get your value
the games developement team is incompetent abuseive and disrespectful
in plain english they cannot do their jobs often breaking things that do work
they speak down to their customers and will call them names
yes this is the customer support you get with this game
the in game technical support isnt any betterthis game is unstable and has serious technical issues
the bugslagbroken mechanics make playing a chore
the staff is not only not helpful but rude
your a customer you deserve some respect and should never feal insulted
the gameplay itself is poorly conceived not that there is much to do with it
the community which is what a mmorpg is about left in outrage a long time agothis game has no redeeming featureswhen the game was first launched it was filled with bugs and missing a lot of content like land mounts you had to run everywhere
the bugs and lack of content gave the game a bad name right from the start and it never recoveredi started playing a few months later after most of the launch bugs had been worked out and new content had been put into the game
i really enjoyed it
there were about  different classesprofessions to choose from and you could change them as often as you wanted to try new things
i myself started doing entertaining then changed to an armorsmith and a combat profession
you could have any combination you wantedmany people complained as people tend to do about combat class balances and this and that
sony decided that trying to balance  classesprofessions was just to much work so they decided to group several professions into a few to make the job easier or just flat get rid of some
so came the cu combat upgrade
this was not taken well by many players and several left the game
i myself still found the game still playable but not nearly as enjoyable
i wanted to keep crafting but now i was stricly a crafter and could no longer engage in combat because i could not have more than one profession at a time
i would find myself wondering the land being oneshot by every low level creature around
i couldnt check my harvesters that collected the resources i needed without a few deaths
i couldnt collect skins that i needed to craft since i could no longer kill anything
yet it was still barely playable so i stayedsony under pressure from lucas arts to make the game a success hurried out yet another large change that became known as the nge
what is really sad about this is how they went about it
a new expansion was about to come out
they advertised the heck out of that new expansion and started taking preorders for it charging peoples credit cards for the expansion before it came out
two days after they started doing preorders for the expansion they announced the major nge changes
this upset most everyone who felt they had been trickedthey also told players there were going to be changes to professions coming soon
they had announced the first class to be changed and told players what they planned to do with it
if i remeber correctly it was going to be a support class that wasnt played much but i cant remember the name of it
they were great ideas like being able to stealth and tons of others and changes that the class had badly needed for some time
yet here they were working on this nge that would destroy the very class they claimed to be preparing to make major upgrades to
it just seemed after the fact that sony was just stringing along people to keep them around as long as they could
after all why would they be working to make major profession changes they knew were going to be pointless in just weeks
did one hand not know what the other hand was doingwhen the announcement of the nge came almost instantly you could log onto a test server to try it out for yourself and give feedback on it
this was no normal test though
they already had planned the release of the nge to live servers in only like a week away and were unwilling to change it with the christmas shopping season coming
you cant do a whole lot of testing and bug fixes in a week
so this was coming out one way or another no matter what the player base had to say about it
and it was unusual how fast it was all happening
they gave us a much longer heads up for the cuthe funny part is no one could test it because the first thing you had to do was get on the millenium falcon which was broken
so no one could get past that to even test the game for the first couple days
but by god it went live on time regardless of whether it worked or notit was a nightmare
nothing worked when the nge went live
sony defended its actions and even lied
they told the world that it had been eagerly accepted by players and that it was drawing in a large number of new players
we knew better but it took a long time before they admitted it
i even watched a developer from the game go on gtv to show what a great new change this all had been
the host of the show who interviewed him basiclly called the players who were complaining whiners and crybabies
the developer then showed something on the new and exciting game and guess what it didnt work because it was broken but then played it off as if it worked as promised
i dont know if they paid g for that interview because it certainly wasnt unbiasedits amazing to look back at it all and see just how much went wrong
they basicly showed the gaming world what not to do
to bad they had to drag thousands of us along for the ride with so many empty promises and outright liesthis game is an embarrassment to the star wars license and mmos
it is a hodgepodge of several failed overhauls stacked on top of each other where nothing really works like it is supposed to
the graphics are dated the community is terrible there is nothing to do the quests are dreadful and if you get past all of that somehow you will discover the star wars universe itself isnt even replicated correctly
the time setting is stated to be between the original star wars and the empire strikes back yet you cant swing a dead bantha without hitting  jedi in robes talking like teenage punks and challenging you to duelthe people who post that this game is fun are either viral marketers hired by sony to spam boards with fake reviews employees of the company who will lose their job when its finally shut down or delusional fans who refuse to accept that this game is terrible because of some kind of vested interest
this game is an utter joke and if you want a decent star wars experience i would instead encourage you to check out knights of the old republic  and  empire at war or even lego star wars instead of this piece of garbage
for that matter i would recommend buying a dvd of one of the movies and watching it a few times before i would recommend playing this game
you have been warned
may the force be with you and guide your dollars elsewherestar wars galaxies has been repackaged and resold several times since it came out in 
the first rerelease came about about the time of episode   about  months later the game was rereleased as the nge ie
new game experience
after upsetting its player base to the point of a mass exodus to other games such as world of warcraft eve online and others  soe redesigned the game again and has rereleased it in this complete adventures set
about six months ago it was the starter kit
and in about another month it will be released again as part of the  best of star wars gift setthis game is in perpetual alphabeta state depending on how much code they delete between patches
it is not fun at all anymore
i made a lot of friends through the original swg  but they have been milking the star wars license for all its worth to comedic dramatic effect  culminating in embarrassing gaffes on the game channel attack of the show as well as cbs specials detailing some of the atrocities committed by soe  and also written articles and a mailbag specialmost of the players who had any sort of selfrepsect whatsoever left a long time agothe only people playing this game right now can be equated to the women who go back to their abusive husbands because he promises not to beat them againit is only a matter of time before you have to tell your parents that you fell down the stairs the next time you beat your head into your computer desk after soe pulls the rug out from under you with a new star warsy enhancement that negates most of your time spent with your character ingamethings have gotten so bad with the server population that soe has given all characters an extra character slot per server something that used to be reserved for players which earned certain rewards ingameyou can be a jedi out of the box but your powers are so ridiculously weak and your lightsaber so flaccid that you will lose fights to the most ridiculous creatures cavemen correllian butterflies and all sorts of other dangerous beastsif you have any selfrespect whatsoever  dont even try this game
i can honestly and  say that i would not play this game if they paid me twice the monthly fee you have to pay them it is that horriblei played swg from  to april of  in the beginning the game had major promise
after that crazy cu patch in april of  it wrecked the feeling of the game
around august of this year i did download the trail version to see what happened after  years leaving
it plays boring and has a cartoon look to it
hopefully in  bioware can redeem star wars as an mmo with there old repulic game
soe should have packed this up long and agostar wars galaxies an empire dividedsigh where to beginthis game could be better namedstar wars galaxies a development team vs a player basenever in all my life have i seen a company alienate so many people in pursuit of the almighty dollar
its truly sickening
i was a month veteran of the game i had been playing since week oneplease read onin the beginningthis game was alright it was fun it was unique and it was totally bugridden and unbalanced
over the course of the last  months the soe dev team have made us promise after promise to do certain things to fix and enhance this game
they in fact did very little if anything at all
they milked us
they exploited the star wars name to make a buck
they made promise after promise after promise and never delivered squat
dont believe me
just ask any smuggler in the game for their opinionthey strung us along and led us to believe that the fixes to the game were right around the corner
instead they were hard at work on an expansion pack to sell us
and then once again promised us that the fixes weve all been waiting for were the next big thing waiting for us just hang on this game is going to be great
they promised us that they were going to do this combat upgrade and do it right and it wouldnt be released until its ready
we all had a lot of hope we thought that they had finally figure out that they had totally screwed up and were trying to make amends with a player base on the brink of total collapse
god how wrong we all werewell much to everyones surprise they made the announcement that the long awaited cu would be coming out along with the rage of the wookiees expansion pack
uhhhmmm did i miss something somewhere
the alpha test for the cu was supposed to begin in january it never happened
beta testing began in april  whole weeks before it was supposed to go to live
we all rolled up our sleeves and dove in
i think after the first week or so the sad realization of what was happening to our game begun to sink inthe cu was supposed to go live on may th
soe decided to push it to live a whole  weeks sooner than that
honestly with all the bugs that were still in beta and then in live beta could have gone on another  months
i guess they figured they could milk us all a little more and dump this beta on the live servers and let us pay to test it
why am i not surprisedthe cu itself is unplayable
it has become everquest in space or everstar galaxies questwars as we call it
there are just too many things to list
there are a lot of other more technical reviews which go into much more detail over on the page for the standalone gameas you all can imagine the player community was totally enraged
we went to the swg forum boards to voice our concerns
the only response we ever got back from soe was thousands of deleted threads and players banned from the forums i was one of them
facing futility a large portion of the player base has left the game permanently this timethen  whole months later after they finally figured out that the cu did indeed suck they let loose the nge
they released it just two days after releasing the obiwan expansion which had special items for classes that were about to disappear
 professions reduced to  the nge is the final nails in the coffin of this game
it totally destroyed it
it became some sort of a twisted mmofps wannabe
fake and cartoony and dumbed down to where a  year old could figure out how to mash the buttons
it is so bad that even smedly himself said that it wasnt good
and a recent developer conference in austin the quote was learn from our mistakes
its widly rumored that the game will be sunset soon theyre gonna pull the plug on it
this complete im feeling sick here edition is their last ditch effort to milk a little more cash out of it before its all overthis is just not how you do business
i personally will never deal with sony online entertainment soe ever again
i do not pay my hard earned money to be lied to deceived ignored strung along censored and banned for voicing my concerns
i do not pay money to folks who treat me a paying customer in this fashionstar wars galaxies is dead
servers are empty
people have moved on to other games where folks know how to appreciate their patrons
if you are a fan of star wars and this is the only reason i ever started playing this game to begin with you will be sadly disappointedswg is nothing more than an exploit of a title a milk machine
i for one am tired of being milkedyou have been warnedhave been looking for a long time and buying and playing for something for ds like bejeweled but this one is not it
i looked at jewel quest and its ok but still not what im looking for
i know about the zoo animal one and i dont think i could stand the graphics
im 
update  wonders is a satisfactory substitute
see my review at that productmbthis weekend i played two games  bioshock and puzzle quest
bioshock was pretty good
puzzle quest was the worst game evar
three handled trophy and all this has to be hands down the dumbest idea i have ever encountered implemented in a manner that can only charitably be characterized as hamfisted with so arbitrary and flimsy a primary play mechanic that any fun that this game threatens to have gets crushed into dust before it ever happensperhaps im being a touch harsh but i suspect that the game deserves it  however before i proceed with the bashing i feel compelled to provide the basic rundown
puzzle quest is in many ways a generic rpg  you are generic hero of variable type druid warrior knight and wizard in this game who is entering into knighthood in the service of the just and good queen who must save the world from evil
pretty basic stuff for an rpg
the art is cartoonish and good at it
what character progression i saw was relatively fast and satisfying
so decent in that regardwhat kills this game is the puzzle part
long story short you basically have to play bejeweled competitively against anybody and everybody with a grudge to determine whos got the bigger well jewels i guess and move on to the next angry puzzlephillic skeleton
as you eliminate jewels from the table various effects from adding mana to your pool to dealing damage to your enemy to granting experience and cash happen based on the gems you pull out
strange concept but interesting on its face you might think
heres the problem though
theres a reason bejeweled was never a competitive game and certainly not on the same board  puzzle games are hard because random stuff that gets pumped into the board make it hard to achieve your goal
rpgs are hard because your opponent is beefy and strong
this game is hard in both ways and abusively so at thatall the way from the beginning of the game to where i quit in frustration to prevent myself from unleashing a barrage of profanity that likely would have blanched my relatives features i had to deal with the game essentially arbitrarily deciding that i lose
thats a problem
you can play this game with a perfect ideal strategy and the computer will still rip off a hit combination out of nowhere based entirely on the pieces filtering down from the random ether above the board that you cannot peek into and you will lose
periodbut i hear you thinking you can do this too right
so its you know fair and junk
well  yes and no
technically it should be possible for you to do this
however in some experimentation that i did i lagged far behind the internal computer in random crud that i ended up cheesing at him versus random crud that he cheesed at me
it was something like a three to one advantage for the machine
if that ratio were totally reversed this would still be a broken practically unplayable game
the reason is pure basic game design  theres an infinite number of the computer but only one of the player so when the computer starts doing cheap things to the player that cause him to lose that has a much much greater effect than when the player does something cheap that causes random spider  to prematurely dieto call this game infuriating doesnt even begin to describe the experience
i cant say for sure whether the ai was cheating or not but it most certainly was frequently getting the better of me and im not really a slouch with rpgs and puzzlers
the spells and effects added to the game are theoretically counterbalancing effects but theyre far too little to save this game
any game that unintentionally arouses the sort of red fury that leads men to beat each other to death in alleys with pool cues has some serious deficiencies
this game has that in spadesthe glitches are just the extra cheese and bacon on this hamburger
not only is the game broken in the theoretical sense but apparently it is also broken in the literal sense
i didnt encounter any of the issues here listed while i played but my experience was mercifully briefbottom line on puzzle quest  this game is easily in the running for my personal list of worst games ever implemented not because you can drive up walls without so much as slowing down and fall through bridges but because it is a terribly implemented interpretation of what might otherwise have been a good mechanic
this is the kind of game that makes all games look worse than bad or mediocre the kind of game that drives children and adults away from the pastime and the kind of game that gamers should not tolerate under any circumstances
i wouldnt recommend that anybody buy this piece of software and that everybody regard it with raised eyebrows and dubious expressions if offered it as a giftthis sounded like a good game that is why i picked it up
i then played for a while and enjoyed the puzzle battles and fought the battles around the starting area
then i smacked my head against the first boss again and again trying to get past
i raised my experience level a few times but still there was no getting past
i laid this game to rest to stop wasting my time
best of luck to those who continue on this questfun
zero is what i should be allowed to give thissince i cant properly rate this ill have to rate it here in the commentaryhow much fun is this game
zero zero zero zero zerohow do you rate this game overall
zero zero zero zero zerohow i can count the ways on how freakin awful this game really is
maybe for the puzzle twitch junkie this will get their buzz on
but for me its so bad i cant describe the hate i have for this turdi really try to avoid giving negative reviews but this game was twice the normal ds game price and it is terrible for a few reasons
i do not have arthritis and am far from old but this game made my hands cramp so bad because you have to use the stylus and the buttons throughout the whole game which is extremely fast paced so apparently an octopus invented this one
it is a pain in the butt and essentially impossible to enjoy
if you are looking for a bball game keep looking elsewhere and dont waste your  on this onethis is the worst game on wii that i have played
the controls are awful this is almost as bad super monkey ball adventure and both of those games ruined the great and addictive games of monkey ball    its become clear to me that this series may never be great again
i dont know whether ill buy the next monkey ball game that comes out
dont buy or even rent this piece of crap thoughpresentation graphics sound gameplay replay value overall as a veteran of the super monkey ball games i had high hopes for smbbb around system launch time
hopes that were to be let down in the worst kind of waythis game has to have the worst control of all the wii launch titles
using an analog stick to control a board was easy but to use a motion sensing remote
good idea in theory terrible in practice
some people may call this a challenge  i think of it more a wastethe mini games are the highlight seeing as the main game is uncontrolable and generally bad
but that isnt saying much as the mini games are tedious remakes of all the other mini game games out there heck even the zelda twighlight princess herding game was a heck of a lot better and not even a mini game
do i recommend this game
nope
based off my experience with it would i buy another monkey ball game
only if its analog controlled rating
just badvery boring
my cousins love this game for some stupid reason
dont waste your money on this piece of crap
go get a different game instead because like someone else said youll end up smashing it to pieces because its so freakin stupidi am a big fan of super monkey ball     i even liked the gba game
i expected great things from the wii version of this game
i slid the game into the wii and started it up
i immediately went into the main game and went to play
according to the instructional screen i was to hold the wiimote parallel to my arms direction like a dvd remote and tilt it
i tried the game this way
its terrible
this kind of precision work needs both hands on the wiimote holding it horizontally  like a traditional gamepad
this is how it is held in the wiiplay cow racing game
i played a few levels through and went out to change the control scheme to horizontal
to my shock  horror there was no way to change the control scheme
youre stuck in one handed mode
this is insane
how could sega have allowed this to happen
they have to realize a game like this requires precision and as such the needs of their gamers will vary
why couldnt they offer alternate controlsdisgusted i went back into the game to give it another chance
i nearly threw the remote through my tv after  or so falloutsthe mini games are garbage
dont bother
i should also mention something about how painful the music is but in fairness its not so much worse than the other games
this is not to be taken as a positive
the music was always horrific and its definitely worse here
its just not so bad when compared to the control faultsthis was the worst waste of seven dollars to rent a video game ever
we returned it the same night we rented it
the play control was awful and i agree with the review that said the wii sports control is better
way better
i would never pay full price for this
matter of fact i wouldnt buy it used either
if this is your first purchase into the wii system seriously consider something else
rayman raving rabbids is way way better if you are looking for fun minigames and a good introduction into the wii remotes method of controlwhere do i start some of the worst graphics this side of the ps
the repitition of the maps make for one boring game
controls are bad
the cut scenes are goofy and once again the graphics ruin them
game is constantly saving itself making for jumpy game play
i cant think of one positive thing to say about this game
thank god that it was a free rental
try resident evil  or the godfather which are both fantastic gamesfor the first few months this game performed fine but recently has started to freeze constantly especially when traveling between roomssections and has even started freezing when i try to saveloadfreakin nubs saves is what uou are allowed
that is not enough
constant crashing means that in reality you need to save in almost every room to avoid replaying
it is not my ps  i own a number of games and this is the only one that crashes
yes i know that you can delete old saves
ive had to do that over and over again
now im stuck in a cave system  because when i try to leave the four zones that are part of the cave system the game crashes consistently
i guess i have to go back to an old saveby the way the promised customer service is a joke
i have called and been hung up on before a single word gets exchanged about  times now  i hear music and a click a second laterother games that are this bad get a patch
the patch is stored on the hard drive
oblivion has not issued a patch
dont waste your money on this turkey just get a fork from your kitchen and stick it in your eye the experience is about the same
there are lots of good games for the ps and maybe the xbox or pc versions of this game are good but this turkey would not have been released by anyone who cared about their repnice visuals but slow game that feels outdated
your character jumps through the air looking like a frozen roboti have been playing this game for a couple of days now and no matter how hard i try i absolutely hate the game
i find the game to be boring as all hell dull and overly easy
i bought this game after getting fallout new vegas and fallout  as i loved both games but unfortunately this game is not as exciting as fun or as challenging as either of thosegameplay   the game is so boring that it is not even funny
from the first section npcs do all of your fighting for you then when you finally do get to take control and climb through the sewers your magic can kill anything rat or goblin in  hit
travelling from area to area is absolutely aweful
you have to trudge across long stretches of land to get from one location to another this would not be so bad if there were tons of enemies to kill in the middle but finding an enemy is like pulling teeth
the fighting isnt aweful it actually works pretty well if you can stomach sword fighting in the first person perspectiveleveling system   oh my god this is an absolute nightmare
in every other normal rpg you fight enemies you get exp and you can level up not in this one
to level up you chose a set of dominant skills and you have to use them over and over to increase their skill until you level up
for instance if you chose destruction all you have to do is spend an hour shooting fireballs into space and you will level up or if you chose agility you jump up and down for an hour and you level up if you chose blade swing you sword around for a while and you level up it dosent even have to be at an enemy it can be at air get my drift
quests   very few of the quests are really fun
they all entail hiking long distances to do some repetitive action fight a few bad guys and call it a day
truthfully nothing fun or creative about itplot  the plot is pretty good the emporer is dead and you have to find his illegitimate son to take the throne the only problem is a portal has been opened and demons are pouring out of it so of course you have to save the world
pretty generic stuff but could be worsepowersweapons   i really do love the inclusion of powers
you can use every combination you can dream of and the magic system was done very well
my character is a mage base so i use the powers more than i do the weapons
the powers have different classes from healing to killing to everything in between
i love using the conjuring destruction and healing powers as i find them the most useful
the weapons are pretty generic sword shield mace until you get further in the relly start getting cool
they are useful they do the job and they are easy to usegraphics    the graphics really are nothing to get that excited about
the scenery and the towns are beautiful well built and perfect
but other characters are a disaster they look aweful
the targeted landscape or perfection and dropped the ball on character designmusic   what can i say
generic lord of the ringsesq music not good not bad just eghin essence the game is a cross between lord of the rings and fallout
the came is very mediocre and is boring as all hell
i expected it to be similar to fallout in the amount of enemies and difficulty but i was dead wrong at that point
either rent it or buy it used definately not worth the moneyi loved the sims  on dsand had high hopes  this gamewhen i got iti was very depreasednot onlydid i find it boring buthard to figure out the controlsafter  minutes of gameplay i quitdont buy is very bad its hard and dificult to drive i recomand you the original xbox microsoft drive wheelthe reviews have been mostly good to lukewarm but being a fan of the overall nfs series i was about to purchase this game until learning ea will insert realtime advertising into my computer via the internet
it was bad enough to see all the lame ads for retailers and products in earlier games but there is something inherently wrong with purchasing a game and then being forced to watch ads in order to play it
as far as i am concerned they should be paying me to watch their stupid adseven if the game were free i am not sure i would play it due to all the security holes and exploits these types of programs have the potential to create
this is a slippery slope i refuse to be a part of and ea will not get my business as long as they continue this policyi bought this game based on the reviews but its very dated and not fun
i wished id payed attention to the dates on those reviews because they were from i would not recommend this to anyone unless you like crappy graphics and sophisticated controls
i played for like five minutes then threw it in the trash can i was so pissedlet me start off by saying i really thought this game had potential but in the end it looks like just another half hearted attemptok let us begin with the good
you can play as any character from the series  in any of the games
good graphics
create a fighter modethe bad fighting is absolutely terrible even worse then the previous games
now it feels like one of the old tekken rip offs from the arcades that was only a quarter to play
you can have your weapon out and use it the whole round
you can be knocked into hot lava and killed after  hitthere are no specific fatalities at all the characters have lost their sense of identity
the value and presence of projectiles is next to nil shall i continueoverall this game looks and smells like a weak cash grab from a strugging franchise
you will be happier and still  wealthier playing umk from the psnot only do i agree with gamerarocks and the rest of the fans outhere but this is game is actually an insult to all mk fansthe negatives are clearly stated ans yes they are a real reason to call this game a piece of crappolaone set of fatalites step  being the ultimateto a whole cast of  something fightersnot too smart
ohh and wait
 sorry fatalitiesthey dont even look like fatalities at all
step  and  are just punchesthen you finally rip an arm in step wow
steps  and  are just punches to the gut then you rip another arm or heart then finaly if youre lucky a leg or headthats it
thats for everybody
second no animated endings  no photo endings just plain letters
in my opinion mk had best endingscinematicthird the kartracing is terribleno grippno steeringjust accelerate and youll be finethe bonus ultimate mk is just repulsive disgusting and insultingright out of the genesis  bit port
its that badthis game is a failure so please dont fail to buy thisand no it doesnt deserve to be called one of the hottest or the hottest game up to datecause its notmy husband is a physican so i thought he would like this game
there is just too much talking and reading
when you finally get to surgery the controls are too sensitive especially when it comes to handling the forceps
at one point when we finally figured out how to handle the controls time was up and the surgery failed
i think with a little redesign this game would be funthe regular  version for classic xbox is the best golf game ever made
this one however is not the same
i have no idea why they would alter it so much  really butchered it into a piece of crap
if you want the fun version get the old onefirst of all i never saw the movie and i dont care to
infact i wouldnt even have played the game except for my little sister got it for her birthday and wanted me to play it with herthe first thing i noticed is the dance part of the game where you tap the circles at the right moment to make the penguin dance wellthis is a huge rip off of elite beat agents how unoriginal can they possibly get
elite beat agents excels while happy feet is just a joke and such a bad insultthe other part of the game basically all you have to do is sled down hill on your belly avoiding things on the way down and finally crossing the finish lineso do yourselves a favor and stay away from this game fan of the movie or noti cannot believe i wasted my time on this game only to hope that it would be better
spoiler alert it does notalright so what am i complaining aboutwell for starters theres two types of levels  dancing and sliding
the kicker
the dancing levels are poor riffs on nintendos superrad elite beat agents
all you do here is just tap the circles at proper timing
unlike eba theres no variety and you just tap and tap and tap until the shoehornedfrompopculture song endsthe meat of the game takes place within the sliding levels and believe me when i say these things take up way more of the game than the dancing levels
in fact i think there were merely  dancing levels or less and the rest of the game is flooded with sliding
that probably wouldnt be too horrifying if it wasnt for the fact that the game took two and a half hours to finish
i am not kidding
the game file kept track of my time and the game took that long to complete
and like the dancing theres no variety
you just slide down the hills until you reach the finish
every
single
time
sure there are the rare times where you must collect stuff on your way down but the result makes this game overall feel exactly like filler
filler in place of what could have been substance for an actual gameas my son loved the movie i bought him this game
i never saw him playing he told me it is boring
so i started to play
i really thought that after some time it gets better
but it is always the same thing
two different things to do always and alwaysone of the worst games i have ever seenpets are cute at first
kittens and puppies eventually grow into cats and dogs
however the pets are annoying and scratch up your furniture
you can buy a bird cage but if you dont feed it the bird eventually dies
dogs and cats can be bred and have litters but they take three sim days to do so if theres a hack to speed that up i couldnt find it
dogs and cats come out at night and dig up holes in your front lawn and scare off other pets
adds a lot of modern furniturenot worth it
my sims could of lived perfectly fine without pets
after you install this expansion they only want to buy and train pets
i wish i hadnt wasted my timei was all ready to buy this game but after reading the reviews iam glad i didnt
 bucks is a lot to pay for having ur privacy invaded i wont be  buying this title everafter preordering and receiving battlefield  a while back i finally got the time to install and try battlefield  and shortly thereafter uninstall it
i was really looking forward to this game as i am a huge fan of battlefield if you are considering battlefield  and do not have battlefield  stop immediately and get a copy of battlefield  first
the graphics are just as good and the game is better in every way i can think of unless possibly if youre an absolute future nut in which that might make one aspect an improvement over its predecessor but it simply does not compare
and then i would suggest battlefield  and battlefield vietnam as well as some other first person shooters call of duty  counter strike source or the original day of defeat source or the original halflife  any of the unreal tournaments doom  quake  and even quake  which i was greatly disappointed withthe gameplay is decent but it predecessor was superior in almost every way  those who have played battlefield  or almost any other good first person shooter since  are going to be very disappointed
first they tried to combine classes from battlefield  down to four classes
in battlefield  you had a vast range of options to choose from  special ops for a balanced class assault for a great mantoman combat class antitank to destroy vehicles but not very good against ground troops and so on
in battlefield  the assault class recon class sniper meets spec ops and support classes are all good against ground troops but are useless against vehicles
the engineer has been crossed with the antitank and can destroy vehicles but cant put much of a dent in troops on footbut heres where it gets bad
the sound is absolutely horrible so bad that i found myself doing what most others seem to do muting it and we all know how unenjoyable fps is without sound but its worse with sounds on
at first i thought my sound card was broken but that appears to not be the case as the menu music and everything else sounds fine
it reminds me of what one might expect for sound on an old atari game from  except it has much more static and occassional voice tips and bot chatter which is so covered in static it is hard to make out
if we somehow forget how to build a functional radio in  years then i fear for all of humankindi could have easily given the game another star if the sound was at least acceptable
and it may have got three stars if it wasnt for the fact that this game generates random blue screens periodically
after receiving a random blue screen of death sometime during the course of a round an error that occurs in no other game or application ever on this computer this game really is not very enjoyableupdate the blue screens went away and the sound is a bit better since i no longer use a creative xfi sound card but the sounds are still poor in this game
id up it to  or  stars now that the blue screen problem has been fixedi will never purchase another ea brand game ever not for pc x or ps
like adding ingame ads wasnt enough they sell you a game with spyware
so just to recap you are paying  for a mod of bf which contains ingame advertising and spyware
we need to set our foot down now and not allow this to be acceptable
dont buy ea products dont buy bfspyware and adware is not permitted on my home computer so i will not be purchasing this game
i have carefully read iga and eas statement regarding spyware and their license agreement
eas statement neglects to comment on many details that concern privacy advocates about this game they say what it doesnt do but they are not specific about what it does
and the license agreement gives them permission to add even more spyware to the game in later patches it also says that by installing the game you agree give ea lawsuit immunity if the game harms your computer or violates your privacy
why would they need this immunity if they were not afraid that some of the things they are doing are illegaldont give ea a blank check to make money off the information on your personal pc and certainly dont pay them to do it to youtoo bad it seemed like a good gamewe were more than patient with you with bf  because it was revolutionary and eventually the patches caught up and there was expansion goodness for everyonewe were forgiving with bf vietnam for the balancing bugginess lack of standard features and maps just so we could have all the helicopter goodnesswe were excited and then quickly disappointed by bf  with all the same problems showing up yet a third time along and a lacking of features promised in the last two versions along with a crop of other things such as rampant cheating and patch updates that were almost nonexistantill admit were a bit slow but if you think were going to throw money yet a fourth time your way for what amounts to a mod a buggy mod at that with the great new feature being adware wow youre dumber than we arei for one am going to pass
ill check back in six months if it lasts that long
hopefully by then all the patches and balancing will be done
if that is the case then ill think about picking it upjust to be fairjust be fair i went back and gave it another try
here is how it wentanother  hour download
nicereintstalled dxreinstalled gamegame crashed first attempt but came up second time no problemsi see that the jump to center bugcharacteristic is still in the control menu annoying but tollerable
its been there since the  versiongetting the control menu to keep my settings took a few attempts
for some reason it was dead set on keeping w set to nothing
i dont use wasd i use esdf more keys to the left to use
similar problems setting up the joystick and mouse but nothing serious just had to play a game solo and jump into the menu  times to keep changing things back again another characteristic that has been with us since video is similar to bf as long as i dont max them out it is very smoothno widescreen support big thumbs down
closest thing to x is x
some warping but playable
sorry kiddies who think wide screen is cheating i like my  monitor and like having a wider viewthe optimizing shaders annoyance is back from bf
if you change video setting expect a  minute or more wait till it optimizes something
dont know why this couldnt be done before you try to enter a map in the background so you are going to be late to the fight the first time after a changegame play that i tried was titan
interesting concept though nothing original its been around since the days of ut and rtcw
moving around and launching aircraft onboard the titan is buggy quite a bit of the time
the ship moves around subtly causing things to get hung upweapons seem to be more accurate but classes feel kind of generalized due to the reduction in total numberssound quality is still pretty muted and generic all the weapons sound alike but at least theyve finally figured out what d sound is
you know which way its coming from nowthe powered lift craft theyre not helicopters theyre not airplanes
it feels like theyre found the perfect dumbed down sensitivity
bfv they were crazy sensitive bf they felt like you were flying with your hands numb
i personally like things light and sensitive it took a lot of skill to fly them but this should help get people up to speed faster and make people less afraid of jumping in with random pilotslooks like the helicopter instant roll over and play dead bug is still in the gamethe ground vehicles are so so
the weapons have some interesting characteristics like the curve ball grenades on the walker
other than that nothing really newlots of gun stabilization on vehicle guns finally make accurate passenger support fire possible while on the movethere is no cover or vegetation which to speak of but then none of the bf games ever have had much
i like the fatigue bar but its a long run between things to hide behind so anyone on foot is still going to be constantly caught out in the openthe indestructable chain link fences make a return to the game ready to stop your  ton tank dead in its trackslight vehicles arent all that fast and explode almost instantly upon contact with water
seems even in the future that is still a problem
the walker can wade accross no problemsi saw one of the infamous billboards
it was green and simple said the enemy is out there so right they are but i didnt notice any more than that
no adds
id rather if they were going to stuff adds in the game to have them in the menu while you are looking for a server to join rather than in the game
the classic brought to you by brand x type placements there would be less strangethis game feels very much like a mod it still needs some tweeking to get some things right
the menu system is still quirky but seems to be actually stable which is an absolute first for any bf game
simple things like not telling you how to set up a joystick are still absent
its not hard but its not obvious eitherthere is nothing that interesting to a long time bf vet to make me want to pay money for it
i find the whole thing kind of boring
there are better games out there that suck you into the action better
it seems that dice didnt bother lifting any ideas from the many games that have come out since they have come onto the scenei downgrade my opinion from flame to yawnwars are dirty loud confusing overwhelming and dented
this game delivers none of that
even bf for all its warts still seems to be the much better gamebattlefield  is to have ingame advertising
do you think there should be two versions of the game  a free game with adverts and a paid for game without advertsadverts will be delivered electronically according to your ip address  in other words your geographical locationisnt paying for the game enough for ea gamesin the uk we pay a license fee for tv without adverts  bbc the channels with adverts are free
the channels are free because we have to endure advertising
why should games be any differentno more games from ea games for me until this sort of forced trash is overthe game
yeah its good but taintedabsolutely the worst idea in years
not only are you paying a premium price for this but they are adding mandatory advertisements in game as well as installing internet monitoring spyware on your computer
of course there is no warning on the box and only after you have opened it does the piece of paper telling you about it come to light
i returned my copy and refuse to support this out right attempt at invasive spywarei came to amazon to buy the game but after reading the reviews decided not to spend the money
i will not purchase a game with ads and possible spyware
i am now very wary of ea games and think i will pass on their future offerings as well ea still refuses to enable widescreen support for its nonsport nonconsole titles despite widescreen monitors becoming more and more mainstream
nasty hacksworkarounds are necessary  for bf i spent nearly  hours just making the game look right and quit resetting resolution on my widescreen
even then  it is not as good looking as real widescreen support
ea charges  and then as part of the eula end user license agreement requires that you consent to the display of ingame ads and installation of spywaremalware which collects your surf habits in order to play online
i would rather not have a bright neon display selling coca cola in a postapocalyptic future
does not fit the setting
just an attempt by a greedy publisher to gain money at the expense of not by helping its customers in enjoying the product
ea leaves bugs that have existed since bf ingame and on release this game has been buggy and patches are few and far between
if its support of bf is any indication  gamers will be disappointed in that patches generally breakunbalance things rather than fixing reported problemson a positive note to earn its onestar is that the new titan mode is pretty harrowing and exciting assuming you are actually able to find a stable server and your system doesnt crash your client randomlyi for one am boycotting ea titles until customer grievances are redressed appropriately
withour your customers  no advertising company will see a point in paying to have their ads ingamea game for  dollars of my hard earned money that contains spyware in game advertisements and ip address tracing
no way
plus a patch was released the very first day
that proves the game was rushed out to make a quick buck
i can understand in game advertising only if the consumers benefit
why did we not see a discount in price
no thank you ea
try again when you are less greedythis game is unplayable
there is zero support
ive written several requests for solutions some a month ago still no reply
they will not refund and this game has made my bf unplayable
no help from support on that front either
one hundred and ten dollars worth of games disappears
i give up on ea they just dont care
their price to dividends ratio is very goodi can see whygarbage cannot even create an account to play itthis game is total garbagebuy it now just to see how wasteful your money can be spentbuy something instead from the tattooed guys in the broke down building on that street  across the tracks instead
at least you might get high stars for forcing me to create an ea account just to play the demo
ok i can take the medicine i got dsl ok so ill create an accountsix tries with  jonx or samgould type names later and i get the same resultuser name already taken stars for not even letting me create an ea account to let me play the demoat least all i wasted was my time in downloading this gigabyte trash from filefront
somebody owes someone else money if the retail product was actually purchasedadvertisement has reached a new evil
not only does it ard you nonstop on the tv and internet now in your games too
all rejoice
insert massive amount of sarcasm yeah or not lol
this is just another insane way that marketing is trying to invade your life and take it over
boycott this
this is completely ridiculous
this shouldnt even be allowed do not just accept this not only is it advertsising in game but it is also installing spyware
i think they should have learned from sony that installing things onto a computer that the buyer doesnt want ends in massive lawsuits and problems
oh well if they go bankrupt on this i have to say itd be well deservedthank you for listening to my ranting d rofloh and by the way
since advertising is a way for a tv corporations to make money it makes tvcable cheaper or free even right
well if thats the case why isnt it the same in video games
if they put ingame advertising the game should be  dollars intead of ea cant you allow us more than  profile per cd key
your just asking for troubletheres the spyware and adware issues and the game is really just a bf expansion pack the same physics and game engine
but if you get tired of the ingame ads etc and want to sell your game  forget it you cantheres the reply from ea when i asked about thatthank you for writing eacom account servicesunfortunately your registration code can only be used to create oneaccount
if youve previously created an account using this code youcannot use it again to create a new account
also the accountregistered once cannot be unregistered
you will need to login to thegame using the same account name and password with which you haveregistered the gameplease let us know if there is anything else neededthank youea online supportyou shell out  for a game and then youre stuck with it
its really unfair and exploits their fan base
ill keep playing bf not bf even with all of its flaws
but bf  is the last ea game ill buy and you should pass on this game too
remember you were warnedbought this game on the back of being a big john woochow yun fat fan
it seemed really good at first although the graphics on the cut scenes are a bit lazy in terms of details
diving around and using precision bullets is fun for a while but it soon gets tedious
the whole gameplay becomes shooting infinite amounts of rather dull ai baddies who just appear from nowhere after you walk over a partucular point
the bad guys dont move much they just stand and shoot and there are far too many of them
this is ok if you are watching a john woo film but is rather boring if you have to kill armies of drones just to progress to the next stage where you encounter the same againi tried the online part but cound not find any game rooms after trying several times over a few days so i cant say if the online gameplay is any better stars are for the initial impression but general gameplay is disappointingfirst of all i loved the past couple need for speed titles i bought this one the day it retailed just because the previous games were impressive
i started playing this game and it made me regret buying it
to start off with the crew is an alright idea except on the race wars races when there are  other crews with  other people and you are by yourself
next the was the races are set up you can control a crew and then when you win a race after you have an area controlled an attacking crew will attack you its an alright idea but close to the game when you control almost the entire map it gets annoying to have an attacking crew come in
as for the cars lots of muscle cars the cars are a definate plus but all of the good cars that i was used to from the previous need for speed games toyota supra mitsibishi evolution to name a few these cars are unlocked at the end of the game when you cant even use them because all of these space ship looking cars the extremely fast cars are all that you are racing
so the cars have some negative and positive elements
the worst part of the game the canyon races not sure if this game was modeled around the recent fast and the furious tokyo drift but drifting down down in a canyon where you can fall off the edge why would you put something like that in a game
i can only hope the people that design the next need for speed game read this and know that carbon sucks take the suvs from underground  and add a few more besides the escalade and navigator and put more cars in and work in a story something like most wanted but leave the canyon racing falling off the edge crap outwhen i first got into gaming one of the first games i got into was max payneit was really cool how you could slow down the action and take out a bunch of thugs without worry
in this game you can do the same thing however instead of bullet time as in max payne in this game its called tequila time
also while in tequila time you can jump over tables etc but it gets really annoying when doing so bc the character in the game makes this really irritating sound like hes dying or what you
i just could not see what the big deal about this game was
another blatant rip off of this game was in max payne towards the end you have to fight a helicopter in nichole hornes building
in stranglehold you do the same thingdifferent setting but still same idea
in essence this game wasis repetitive and boring as in max payne well im sure i need not say but max won over this game hands downthis game utilizes the wii motion sensor controls very little
while graphically ok the gameplay just isnt there
rampage td was a repetitive unoriginal and honestly boring gamesadly i anticipated this title most amongst launch day titles even more than zelda for nostalgia purposes
soon after i anticipated selling this title most amongst the other launch titles
rent do not buy this pile of junki recomend buying this game for any of the other systems you may own
the wii controls are a disaster and youll find yourself flailing your arms and not getting anything accomplishedi call this a passsonic genesis is a god awful piece of somthing
if its not the glitches killing you it somthing else
the collision detection is bad the slow frame rates worse and to top it off the game music is insane
the music is so awful to listen to it makes you want to rip you ear drums out
it makes me cry knowing this is based off the genesis oringinal
this is celebrating the original games th annaversary
wow sega you must hate sonic
i cant believe youre tring to con people out of their hard earned money for this insult
and whats worse youre tring to pass this off as the original
wtfwhen i first bought this game at wal mart i thought i was going to have fun with it
well as with most gba ports of  bit games this one is a huge dissapointment
first off the game lags so badly espiecally in the scrap brain zone that it is almost unplayable
the only way to somewhat make the game run faster is to turn off the music and sound effects and play with total silence
even with the music and sound turned off the game will lag
you might as well as turn off the music since it sounds so bad
trying to get all chaos emeralds in this game is almost impossible as you have to save the game before you turn it off
if you dont the game will lose the position and you have to start all over again
rather than change the backgrounds or animations to make it run more smoothly they churned it out as quickly as possible to make some quick money
some may argue if they did that then it wouldnt be the original but i say its much better to have a game thats playable
i thought this was supposed to be a port of a classic game not some horrible movie based game
buy sonic mega collection plus and stay away from this piece of garbagei think this game cannot be called a sonic the hedgehog game
its more like a slowy the slugguy gamewhat the the heck were they thinking when they made this
sonic had a good history on the portable systemsbut this i think has destroyed his reputation
the game itself is okay but it was redesigned for the gameboy and the frame rate was slowed so that moving sonic is like moving a slug
the music was also changed so that it only has the basic themes of the original
blech
skip this one and stick to the originalokaysonic the hedgehog is a terrific game
but only on anything but the game boy advance
see my review for the original genesis version if you are curious about the real thing
this portis awful
utterly awfulhow did sega mess this up
they could have just simply ported the genesis game onto the gba and call it a day
but nope
they had to update it to the horribleness that is at sonic  standardsso why is this game so bad on the game boy advance
well first off the camera is a bit more zoomed in than in the original
that way youll never know if an enemy or some other projectile would fly at you from above
the control is actually worse than the original
there would actually be quite a bit of lag
it doesnt take long to get sonic to run but you dont get that speedy feel
and when you jump you actually move a bit clunkier
not to mention the games choppy framerateand then there are glitches
come on
really
why did sonic slip backwards into a space where hed be crushed
why did i go through robotniks wrecking ball
but those are only a few of some pretty fatal glitches youd find whenever you playthe music for sonic the hedgehog is some of the best tunes youd ever hear from the sega genesis
the game boy advance is clearly capable of it
actually its capable of anything from the bit consoles to super nes and genesis
but the music happens to be poorly done on this port
its like as if a sound chip from the nes was borrowed with a measly  notes from the genesis sound chipby the way the sound effects were wonky toothe socalled anniversary mode sucks
its only the inclusion of the spindash move from sonic the only good thing about this trashy port is that you can save
games like sonic could possibly be unforgiving without any save feature
only experienced gamers could beat it under one sitting
now anyone could step into the action somewhat and still continue progressingoverall its easy to see that this game wouldve be seen as the end of the sonic franchise along with sonic  actually even if sega just directly ported the original sega genesis game without any changes it would still be something to overlook considering the fact that that version has been released on so many game collections sonic jam mega collection ultimate genesis collection sega genesis collection to name a fewclassic games and motion control do not mixi bought the wii version of the msa as it was cheaper than the ps version
i figured since there was a gc controller option i could hook up my ps controller via my controller adapter
i was disappointed to find out the dpad does not work
and it wasnt because the adapter isnt compatible since i also tried hooking up a gc controller and using the dpad on that and it turns out that the dpad is just not activated in gc controller mode
so the only way to play with a dpad is with the wiimote which wouldve been fine except you have to shake it to throw a grenade
they didnt even give the option for the classic controller
i like using motion controls on wii games meant for motion control
i like thumbsticks for d games
for classic d gaming however i prefer to keep the controls classic with good olfashioned dpad and buttonsi highly recommend metal slug anthology just not on the wiiunless you like endless hours of grinding for crafting materials and gold to pay the insane costs of everything
or like being constantly under attack just traveling from point a to point b or like boss fights where youre always fighting hordes of adds
or like to be endlessly stunned disarmed crippled snared poisoned bled diseased or otherwise impeded whenever you fight anything
did i mention the quests that have you running all over eriador taking hours to do just for a few experience points and crappy rewardsgetting to level  is long and frustrating because in order to level reasonably fast you need to do the quests and most of the quests require a  person group to do and its difficult to get such a group together
leveling up solo is your only other option and that takes a tremendously long time to doso if you like being frustrated and bored then this game is for youi loved the original bomberman games
it was a great strategy game  you had to set up bomb patterns to blow out walls and destroy enemies
then came the xbox  versioni was really looking forward to a fun engrossing strategy game that i could play for hours on end
i dont mind dark games so choosing between a male and female somber realistic looking robot didnt bother me much
you can choose from a few colors to highlight their metallic outfits as well
then you head onto the playing gridsuddenly the game is far less fun
i realize its about grids its about thinking out your moves since you can only move at a certain speed
you have to try to lure your opponent into a trapped location so that you can blast them into oblivion
however because of the camera angles the unnecessary excess graphic items and the darkness it tries to seem more like a first person shooter
the slow pace of your character instead of being a normal part of the strategy now seems unnecessary and annoying
you cant always see what youre trying to domaybe the sound could have been the saving grace  but if anything it makes the game far far worse
the incredibly tinny robotic voice that gives you a status at the end of each level is perhaps the most annoying voice i have ever heard in a game
it almost makes you want to deliberately lose so you dont have to hear the winning commentarythe irony is that usually we only buy games we really expect to want to play and replay
we rent the rest so that we can review them thoroughly play through once and then send the game back again
we thought this would be a keeper  we were told itd be a lot of fun  but as it turns out we had to force ourselves to play itif youre a fan of the bomberman series then there are numerous games from before the xbox  which are great fun to play and replay
get your hands on those enjoy them for the fun puzzle worlds they provide and avoid this misguided latest versionnot recommendedthis game takes everything that made the old bombermans good and does the total opposite of it
this is on superman  levels of horrendous
is it exactly the same game as the s and s game only with a generic piece of crap as the titular hero
some lame master chiefrobocop darker and edgier hybrid
plus everything looks as generic futuristic and edgy as possible
the worst kind of lame judge dredd type of marketing attempts to appeal to audiences possiblethe game has no story and actual seperate game modes just to switch the camera
the new camera is called first person bomber and you have to actually play it seperate from standard camera aside from just switching a button or option in the menu
you have to exit the game youre playing just to switch the camera
oh and you cant save
and this game was originally sold for  full price
extra insulting that this wouldnt even be a good free dlc yet they have to gall to trick people into spending money on this
this
this game literally isnt even worth its price if it was free
they should have to pay you for the time frustration and insult to the franchise theyve committed with this atrocitythis game was even featured on poison mushroom a show that reviews the worst recent video games and it made the bottom of the list
bomberman act zero isnt even a so bad its good game
its simply bad
on every level
well except for it being minimal on glitches and bugs
somewhatbut still
avoid at all costs
dont even play this game for free
itll just frustrate and upset youthis was segas handheld
it was big clunky hard to see had terrible sound and not many good games like gameboyhence its dead nowthe sega genesis has always been one of my fav consoles of all timethe sega cd was greatso was the saturn and the dreamcastunfortunatlythe x was pure crapand sorry to sayso was the game geari owned one of this little handhelds a long time agoi used to enjoy it very muchuntil the day i went to turn it on and it would not worki thought the batteries were dead so i changed emnothingtried the ac adapterstill nothingit just all of a sudden quit on mei thought i was the only one who had this problembut i wasnt alonea friend of mine had the exact same problem with his gear gear as wellsega was a great company when it came to having cool game and cool consolesunfortunatlytheir consoles and other material were not very durablenintendo defintley had it over sega in that areai would not recommend one of these handheld systemsif you still decied to buy one anywayi hope you get a better one then me and my friend hadjust dont pay too much for itwas not really impressed by this got it just because but the new kinect just blows this so hard out of any consideration reallyi have played htis game on the ps and gamecube so i played the wii version and it still sucked guess you cant make a bad game do new tricks and good gameplaydo not believe the description amazon gives of this game
its a blatant lie
control full compliments of troops and move them across the battlefield  cavalry musketeers riflemen and morecommand cannons and mortars build and take forts and experience d combat you dont control any compliment of troops other than the one soldier you play as
you dont dig a trench let alone build a fort
the d combat might as well be d sidescrolling combat because the game limits your movement so severely that you might as well be on railsin addition this game is grossly historically inaccurate
other reviewers have already covered how so ill leave it at that
this game is atrociousthis game serves no other point than to rip off mortal combat and its very cheaply done too
theres no tutorial
theres no moves list my cousin and i played  player on this game for  minutes before throwing it on the ground
it sucks so bad
everything that makes a fighting game good is not present in the least bitbuying this case was my first bad experience with amazon sellers ever
ive been buying from amazon for quite a lot of years so im not too angry but i just thought id put out there that this item is terriblethe item description clearly says that this case does not work on a psp  which is fine for me since i have a  so i get this case and it doesnt even come close to fitting
i wouldnt have minded this cheap flimsy plastic shell if it had done what the description said it would  you know fit over my psp  but this thing not only sucks just holding it but will not fit a psp  dont buy this product im sure there are other better things out theremy mouse had always been logitech now i bough this for a change and i am very disappointedfirst the software have a lot of problems detecting the mouse etc when i turn off the computer and i turn it on again i have to unplug it and plug it again if not i cant use the mouseso stay with logitech i have this mouse since  days and i want a g alreadyas i walked out of the store with the habu i joked with a friend of mine who works for microsoft that knowing microsoft they have taken a decent mouse and applied their microsoft magic to it to make it crashi laugh now at my woeful naivete
oh it got microsofted all rightconsider
you open your box
inside there is a staid instruction manual and an even staider troubleshooting insert which says things like make sure you plug in your mouse if it needs to be plugged in and make sure you put batteries into your mouse if it needs batteries and et cetera which tells you right off the bat they didnt really customize it for the product since the habu neither has an ac adaptor nor need of a battery or plurals thereof
but as you shake the box to make all the last components fall out a bright green inserts falls into your lap warning you quite explicitly that you need to install the drivers on the cd before you attach the mouse
covering the usb plug on the mouse is a label softly glued to the connector warning you with the same warning making sure that the ignorant mouseattacher cannot possibly miss the important fact that the drivers must be installed before the mouse is attachednow see thats funny because if you do in fact install the drivers first the habu will never work on that computer
ever
it will only detect as a normal usb mouse and you cannot make use of the sundry utilities to for example change the sensitivity of the mouse or the sampling rate or option any of the other options
the habu software will indeed load dangling these tantalizing features before your eyes but it steadfastly refuses to acknowledge you do actually have a habu connected
in fact as i found out online the only way to make sure that your system does not become to coin a phrase habuproof you must install the drivers only after the mouse is already attached
once the drivers are on your system no amount of effort short of a line by line audit of the registry will allow your habu to work as anything other than a plain usb mouse
you can choose to addremove the drivers you can try the updated software on the website you can try updating firmware et cetera and et cetera  it will not work
the only method some person online found that worked is this flash the firmware of the mouse with the firmware for another razer product uninstall and reinstall the drivers and then reflash it to be a habu
he said that he got occasional bluescreens of death now and again and the mouse would occasionally lurch in an epileptic seizure but that for the most part he indeed had a habu working on his computerin my opinion he had an undead habu but i safely kept that opinion to myselfand naturally to make the microsofting of the product complete microsoft forbade razer from supporting the product making their tech support people direct all calls to microsofts where they can very unhelpfully fix nothing as true to form
microsofts technical support webpages and wizards are always along the lines of twenty different ways of making sure all of your cables are attached
keeping in their milieu perfectly the habu tech support page has nothing helpful only suggesting that you might perhaps want to replace your mouse pad
and under general support it recommends installing the latest version of microsofts intellipoint software which of course does not support the habuas a fitting postscript the process of uninstalling and reinstalling the habu software several times killed my video card
fortunately modern medicine does work on nvidias products and so my machine was not permanently blindedconclusion microsoft can indeed take their lessons learned in software design and apply them to their hardware process as wellbeen playing sid meiers pirates for over a year now and was looking forward to a different game with the same theme
too bad it wont be this one due to starforcethe sid meijer is great if you need your pirate fix
ill just pass on this and wait for the multiplayer pirates of the burning seai lost my hard drive and nearly destroyed my optical drive after unwittingly  downloading and installing  starforce protected games
problems with slowness and just plain old peculiar behavior were obvious after i installed the games  on my almost new  inch toshiba desktop replacement notebook p  ghz super multidrive gb harddrive rpm
the total wipeout took almost a year but it was a rough year with drivers misssing drivers being misplaced electrical failures
it was horrible
it was starforcestarforce has a stealth mode where you cant find it on your device managers hidden drivers
reports have come in that just because starforce isnt listed in your device managers hidden driver lineupdoesnt necessarily mean its gone
bits and pieces and sometimes all of it remains after use of the removal tool
it just erases the name
check out some of the boycott starforce sites as to how to look up and zap the stealth modeno game should be patronized that uses starforce
this is identical to having thugs come in and smash your computer
the europeans not only got ubi to drop the dastardly stuff they are actually trying to get a class action suit together over the computer damage this junk causesmicrosoft sanctions the use of starforce and stealth starforce
this is a windows game
i dont care how good the game is
patronizing starforce is sanctioning big business to damage our personal property without any recourse for us
i have no conclusive proof that starforce caused my problems because i found out about it after i replaced my hard drive
but i have no doubt that it did
even microsoft couldnt diagnose my problems when my genuine copy of xp all of a sudden said it wasnt a genuine copy of xp
after  hours verifying product codes and subsequently  hours after micrososft telling me this wasnt a hard drive problem my hard drive failed
starforce caused me an unbelievable amount of lost timetheres an editor of pc gamer magazine that could not get his optical drives working after downloading and installing a starforce game
nothing he did would get them working until he used the removal tool and followed the directions on a boycott starforce sitethis stuff is bad
just because you arent aware of any immediate damage doesnt mean you are not going to get clobbered by it later on
these hidden drivers can activate themselves without warning nor without provocationto check whether or not you are making illegal copies of just about anythingwhy people would support this junk is beyond meuses starforcewas ready to hit the submit order button but decided to check the boycott starforce games listingthere it was much to my surprise  since i dont recall atari using itvery disapponted hmmm copy protection is now optional see post abovethen why include it show me a link and ill buy the game asapplaylogic forum will delete posts with starforce related info  read forum boards on the netsome included it within bugpatch related threads  they were deletedplaylogic will not return starforce related emailsi as well as others asked if a patch to remove it is in the workswhen this game is available without starforce a removal patch i will purchase itthe game asks if you want to install starforce  which will install upon you running the game for the first timethere is a crack to play without starforce which can be used once the game is installed but before you install starforce  not sure how that works but you do need the game to use it on the web in a aop forum  plus i dont crack my games  you run into risks using them as welloh please dont call us ignorantsome of us have experienced starforce related problems know others who have andor read numerous posts over the years of individuals who have had problemsi did my research on the gameplay bugspatches and the game in generalthere are forums not those associated with the game  these will delete starforce related posts  a bad habit shared by those who have a vested interestwhich will explain any problems  there are techgamer related sites written by industry professionals columnists who have opinions worth notingon one forum board some who mod games obviously tech savvy and very knowledgeable about gamescoding etc noted they wont play games that contain starforcetwo noted that they purchased aop and are waiting for a removal patch maybe one is in the works 
 the other is waiting to see if a patch is forthcomingpertinent information based on facts does not indicate ignorancethis game has starforce on it
starforce is a copy protection that was used before windows  came out when you install the game it also installs starforce with itnow why this is important is because it will mess up your os
in their infinite wisdom they did not try to make a copy protection that will work on future operating systems instead they opted to make one that would only work on a current operating systemwindows xpi gave this game  stars for fun the game itself i think is a decent and fun pirate game
as you can tell though starforce gives this title an overall  rating from me as it deserves no lessdo not buy this game if you have windows  plan on getting windows  or if you plan on getting any future os
starforce will destroy your operating system requiring you to reformat try a system restore or god knows what else to save your computer
good luck even logging onto your computer
i do not recommend itpeople once said starforce is a virus
guess what
it actually isonce again stay awayi got the ten and under bargain bin version
this is supposed to be the fully patched and completely uptodate version
even though my pc is well above the minimum and recommended requirements this game does not work
i went online to the games site and tried all the fixes suggested in the forums by other owners of the game none worked
the game still freezes my computer with the windows blue screen of death requiring me to manually power down my pc
i cant even get more than halfway through the first training mission without the game crashing
i now have an expensive coaster and another jewel case to use for some other disc that deserves to be protectedthis review may only legally be shown directly on amazoncomif you own itthe word scourge means to punish chastise or criticize severely something you should be doing to yourselves if you picked up this gamescurge hive by southpeak interactive did well to fly this under the radar
much like etrian odyssey and other unhyped games it just landed on the shelves of video game retailers everywhere one day
and one fateful day i walked into eb games and saw scurge and i had never heard of it before
so instinctively i bought it
plus the cover had a nice yellowishorangeish hue to it and it looked sort of nicewhat a disappointment this was
i hate myself for spending the retail  on its release to purchase this abomination of a game
maybe its my critical side speaking because the other two reviewers had pleasant things to say about the gamethe graphics are super nintendo at best and i think snes rpgs fared better in many situations
the gameplay is downright horrible the functions are extremely clumsy and youre stuck with a pathetic excuse for a gun that shoots little orblike blips to kill enemies
i lasted a whole  minutes on the game before i started thinking about a possible way to repackage the item so i could return it for a full refundi always conclude my reviews with an analysis of the price of the game and what it has to do with its overall value
my purpose is to inform you whether or not i think the game is worth the price its set at
it is for you to decide whether or not you agree with me and for the review to be a determining factor in your hesitation to pick it up or notand so the price should say something about the game
after its intial  public release it quickly fell to a meager  at eb games  gamestops i go to eb a lot if you didnt notice then fell further to an unheard of 
brand spankin new
not used
brand newping pals didnt even hit that low
you could pick up a brand new copy of ping pals for a measly 
and let me tell you its not even worth it at that
it should be given out for free and even then i dont think you should take itmaybe im being overly harsh but its because i paid more than  bucks for it and ill hate myself forever for thati bought this for my daughter  times when she still had the ds lite
when she used it the whole game codes erased it self
she like using it but it was a waste of money
some codes freezes up her games and the ds lite
i bought her a dsi and it doesnt work on dsi
it only works on ds and ds lite
the first one it got bricked when she updated the action replay
the second one was working fine but when i bought her the dsi it didnt work
it just say there is nothing insert in the game card slot
the first one it shows stripes and on ds lite it says there is no game card inserted
i overall this prouduct  star
what a waste of moneythis is a waste of time money and plastic
dont even bother it doesnt work
its garbagemy gosh we mustve bought this thing  years ago or more and it never never worked right
from what i understand after doing some research nobodys worked right either
it wouldve been nice for my kids to have been able to use it but they couldnt
waste of moneybought it
arrived fine
worked fine for about  days
then all the game cheat codes on the unit somehow erased themselves
link to internet software installed fine but didnt get a chance to use it
rhokay product cruddy programming and worlds worst technical support oh did i mention they do not honor the warranty
the ards erased the saves on my castlevania dawn of sorrow failed to work with many mentioned games and one day upon updating it it bricked itself and now does nothing
it is absolutely useless to me
upon updating it with their program and updates nothing out of their warranty and now they wont honor the warranty that is inside the packaging
beware in buying this product that if you try to contact datel you probably will not get a human being even after  phone calls and  emails
i had to use the editor email address and have him foward melong story short do not buy datel products because you will be up a creek without a paddle sooner or lateri purchased this along with the saitek pro flight yoke  throttle in an effort to notch my flight simulator x experience to the next level
well i changed levels but not in a good way
the foot pedals were awkward and uncomfortable to use and dont have a selfcenter feature so you can never tell if your tail rudder is set to null straight
that wasnt the chief reason i returned the gear but it was contributory
putting this stuff back into its original boxes to return to amazon is not for the faint of heart or slow of thought
it took me quite a while to figure out how to put it all back for reshipping to amazon
i would not recommend this item or the matching yokethrottle to anyone sad to say
im way disappointed both this item and the saitek pro flight yoke and throttle are going back for refund
 update dec    the saitek combat rudder pedals are very nice and i have  been completely satisfied with them
they cost a bit more about  for the combat rudder pedals but they have metal pedals not plastic and that alone ratchets the realism up several notches
also the metal pedals on the combat model are adjustable via allen wrench included and thus you can angle them to feel just right with your feet on your flight deckthe eye toy is old and tired
my children quickly get bored with the truly lame games the eye toy offers
complete waste of time and moneyfirst of all i played this game from classic until firelands raid which was released in cataclysm
i wish i had quit sooner but kept hoping they would release content that was fun again
it is worth noting i have done quite a bit of progression raiding had  level  characters and had most achievements completed on my main as well when i stopped playingyou pay for the game the expansions and basically pay them for the full cost an expansion again every  months of subscription fees
and then they do things like leave intentionally low population servers open so if you cant find a decent guild on your server it is another  per character so if you have alts you want to bring it is more to transfer servers which doesnt actually cost blizzard anything this game is completely designed around bleeding the money out of your pocketonce you are max level the game wastes as much of your time as possible on repetitive tasks such as daily quests daily instances farming materials achievements that require grinding rather than skill etc
raiding requires either a lot of materials or a lot of gold
one great addition was cauldrons to reduce the need for farming once your guild level was high enough to give it more uses and whatnot but they do still take a lot of materialsthe daily quests and instances i think the instances are weekly now but require you to do an average of  per day are also somewhat necessary for progression raiding for quite awhile after content releases because of the rewards they give
running the exact same instances that you have cleared countless times with a random group every week is not only mind numbingly boring and time consuming but you also get stuck with either horrible players jerks that qued together with the intention of screwing everyone else over or a group that already kicked someone and has afk members
if you leave you get a half hour debuff if you dont you cant get rid of the afk people
finally there is raiding
this used to be what made wow a great game
i remember in classic killing a new boss was actually an accomplishment
raids had  people in them which made the fights much more complex but fun
the content itself was also much more difficult and more fun
after classic they switched to a  man raid format
since cataclysm they made the gear in  man exactly the same as  with easier bosses in  they also took the lazy way in instance design by making the higher end raids heroic modes of the same exact instance and bosses
most good guilds beat normal content within a week of its release meaning the rest of the time until next content release is just repeating the same content on a higher difficulty
to me that is very boring and just lazy on blizzards part
even the gear models stay the same all the items look the same on higher difficulties but have higher stats
they used to release multiple raid instances and once you beat one you would move on to the more difficult one instead of just repeating the same thingno where on it did it say it was for a mac i dont have a mac  am very unhappy and well not be buying  from here again  i well tell every one i know thats alot of ppl alot of my familyfriends buy on here and they well be knowing that i emailed them times i have send it back and nothing very unhappyi was really excited to get this game after all of the reviews sounded so positive plus im a huge fan of the sims and animal crossing which its been compared toi dont know if im missing something but its just not fun at all
really repetitive and i know people have said that its better than animal crossing because animal crossing was so repetitive but at least there was strategy and a storyline
this is more like plant stuff get your pinatas to hook up build a house plant stuff get your pinatas to hook up build a housei really want to like it and i really hope im missing something and its going to miraculously get better as i go along but i dont know how much more i can takei purchased this game because i had purchased the ridge racer unbounded so i thought it was gonna be cool not as good as the unbounded but good enough
however when i opened up the game and played it i got disappointed
when you see the intro the game looks amazing but when you actually start playing it is not entertaining at all
the game is so so so easy than even i if you try to crash the cars refused to do it
no matter how hard you try i will never crash
the graphics on the game are really badi am  i am used to play games like forza motorsport grand turismo formula  and things like those
so you can see where i am coming fromi recommend this games to children who just want to have fun and race
if you want to have a real racing experience buy one of the games i mentioned beforealso i suggest not do buy like the previous series of games that you played thinking that they are good as well because you will find nothing but disappointmentgears of war is everything youve heard it is and then somewhile i wasnt a fan of thirdperson shooters this game just hooked me and wouldnt let go
the rd person format allows for a welldeveloped system of cover or hiding behind objects during intense firefights
once you get the hang of it youll be running and jumping around from concrete slab to burned car to doorway seamlessly while punishing the dreaded locustthe concept of active reloading will keep your fingers busy during the otherwise boring reloadthe graphics are out of this world and put any other shooter out on the market to shame words cannot describe you have to see the game to believe itthis is an adult game with violence that is not for the squeamish
the blood and guts factor is this game is phenomenal and is guaranteed to keep you yelling out loud with every chainsaw execution and head shotas a seasoned gamer who grew up with the boss of each level concept this game brought back memories with situations like the berserker at the end of act  great funthe immersion level of this game is up their as well
youll find yourself talking in the storyline lingo with expressions such as oh no
a boomer
best shooter for the  out right now hands downbut
there is an apparent problem that this game is causing
during the whole of the campaign i recommend you start out on hardcore setting casual is a joke my  would freeze now and then with the message of disk is dirty coming up
i checked the disk which was clean so i chalked it up to the fact that the game was rented
when the last cutscene ended the game locked up permanently and i couldnt load it at all after that
i tried  of my other games which i used to play problem free to no avail
i looked this issue up and im not the only one who has fallen victim to the gears of war curse
there are numerous blogs throughout the internet complaining about the same issue theres a review below with the same problem
after calling microsoft it turns out that i now need to get my  repaired at a cost of 
again this is not an isolated issue
its been happening a lot just look it uponce i get my console fixed i intend to buy the game anyway
its that goodi was not able to install this game
i had aoe already installed and was able to install the asian dynasties but this game would not install
i was very disappointedi am a big fan of the age games and i am very sorry to report thatthe war chiefs expansion is the worst age expansion ever releasedthe war chiefs expansion offers mostly new content and almost no real new featuresno only that all the existing bugs from age of empires  were not fixed and were passed to the expansionin addition to that the biggest missing feature from age of empires   playing custom scenarios online is not included in the expansionnumerous scenario editors bugs that were reported to ensemble were not fixed eitheras i said before i played age of empires  for hundreds of hoursin general it is a good game but the bugs are just very annoying and it gets worse the more you play the gameyou would expect the expansion to fix all the problems but instead they were ignoredthey went ahead and added new campaign and  new civilizations and few extra units and that the most of itif you buy the expansion you wont notice much difference when you compare it to the original gameensemble advertise their powerful scenario editor but fail to mention that they are not supporting the editor and that they are not planning to fix any of its bugsthe scenario may be powerful but it is extremely buggy and very user unfriendlythe list of existing bugs that were carried over to the expansion is very longhere is a short sample online drop bug  players can drop in purpose when they loose
gathering point for releasing combat units from war ships doesnt work
gathering point for remote mines and trees doesnt work as the settlers arrive at the remote location but dont gather resources
attack move doesnt work when you click left click or right click on any enemy building
out of sync error in the middle of online games is still an issue one year after the game was released
the  minute resign bug  players can resign within two minutes from an online game and suffer no impact on their rating
numerous bugs with walls too long to get into mortars dont attack buildings when they are in range unless they are instructed to do so
very often you cannot release a large number of units from a ship in one time
obstruction radius bug  there is a bug with the obstruction radius of war ships that makes them overlap with each other
v in quick search online doesnt work
the option is there the players are there but you will never get a v match no matter how long you wait
it is not possible to create a gate when there are units standing next to that wall segment
ships that carry units or train units cannot release the units unless their nose is all the way at the shore
the ai has many issues and limitations yet it was not improved at all
online games are very laggy especially the v gamesin the past year ensemble released  patches with emphasize on balance changes instead of bug fixingthere is also the issue of one cd key per gamemany fans complained about thatonce a player creates an online account he cannot change it delete it or reset itonly one online account can be created per gameas mentioned above the ai in the war chiefs expansion is so stupid that it is very easy to beat it even on hardit is even more stupid than the regular gamealso this game that is all about rushing
turtling and booming are not viable strategies in the war chiefs expansionthese three strategies supposed to counter each other but not in this gamedefensive structures are very weak in the war chiefs making rushing the best strategy even against turtlingoutposts are good only against ships and cavalry but very weak against infantry and artillerywalls can be taken down easily due to their low hit pointsonly one fort is allowed and we can not rebuild it if it is taken downas a result rushers have an advantage as rushing counters booming as well as turtlingthe war chiefs expansion is all about new content such as a new campaign  new civilizations and a few new units for the other civilizations thats itthe treaty game type is just a new no rush map option to accommodate players who like to play no rush games the trade monopoly is very similar to the wonder type game that was included in previous age games so it is not really a new featurethat is all there is in this expansionalmost no new features no new physics just some new content that is allin addition to that all the bugs from the original game are still thereso save your money for other games such as rise of legends lord of the rings middle earth  and company of heroesi was hearing how incredible this game was how its way better than saints row or grand theft auto
so i borrowed the game from my work and i decided to play it
wow is this game overblown
only fun the first couple hours and then becomes terribly repeative
once you max out your guy what the hell is there to do
plus enemies constantly respawn so most of the time you get shot off of a building and die
im at the end of the game right now fighting the wang guy and i screamed out in protest
ive beaten gears of war on insane diffuclty but this game is just downright stupid
plus there is no storyline you can get all of the achievements within about a day or two and the graphics that everyone is raving about is not even on par with better games like gears of rainbow six vegas
dont believe the hype this game isnt all its cracked up to bethis game is just all around cheesy from the story line to the game play the objectives are not clear and there are just mobs of enemies every where but you just dont really get any sense of satisfaction from completing missions they just dont feel like they have any deep meaning
i could not believe that they are actually making a second one after this one has bombed so muchi cannot get past the main menus screen
tends to freeze
i played the game before but this copy suckedthe thing i notice quickly about the entire series is that it remains the same no matter how many expansions they do
its just another hack n slash but the worst thing about it is there is no improvement on equipment
weapons armor runes magical items shields etc
all remain the same as in the origional
that  weapon you got in prophecies is still as good as the  weapon you get in nightfall andor factions
without playercharacter improvements this series is destine for boredom much faster with each renditiononce you have leveled up at least one character to level  the repitition is tedious and boring to say the least since it requires going thru the same content over and over and just hacking and slashing your way thru it
its an experience grind but theres no other reason to level up since there isnt any improved equipment to be hadi grew bored playing faction and were it not for the alliance battles and the fort battles i would have quit playing the series a long time ago
adding heroes to the game does nothing for me except add more ignorant ai performance during battles although it does allow me to keep them in place while i pullabout the only improvement worth nightfall purchasebottom line if you have the others and only if you play the nonpvp portion of the game will you really get anything of value out of this expansion
my suggestion is just wait until the price falls as it already has by  i see
its just not the mmorpg that it should be
if they would separate pvp from nonpvp and allow players to progress in higher levels and equipment this by far would be an outstanding non pay to play game
chances of that happening are nill to none but we can hope soon someone will pickup on this idea that that is what single player players wantbought it as a spare to always have one battery ready to play while charging the nd one
i charged it twice without any problems with myxbox  quick charge kitand on the third time i noticed the lights on the charging kit wouldnt turn on as in there wasnt any battery in it
left it overnight without the charging kit lights on but just as i suspected it didnt charge one bit
ive googled a lot trying to find a solution but havent found one
what i did find was that other customers have the same charging problem
very dissapointededit forgot to mention i also experienced what other reviewers have written
this battery is a bit larger than the original microsoft one and it has to be forced a little bit into the controller
i didnt pay much attention to this the two times i used it because i was happy that it was working properly
have read in other pages that in time it can actually break the controller so also take this into consideration before buying this productive had the battery pack for about  years didnt use it too much but now it wont charge anymore in my quick charger
i have two official battery packs one of which is older than this one and they both charge just fine
couple this with amazon selling a twopack of what looks like official batteries for the same price
dont bother get the official battery packsjust like the wii console the ds is being plagued with endless mariowario wtc games
good god i like mario games as much as the next person but enoughs enoughthis game is horrible and i agree with the reviewer coconut
nintendo didnt makedevelope this game and it is obvious
this game is unforgiving and so challenging to a degree that it feels like beating this game is impossible to beat
this game is unbearable to play
if you want a good version of this game buy the one for gameboy advance
if you do not own that system this game can be downloaded via virtual console on the ds
do not buy this ds version of this gamethis game to me is the worst kirby game out there
i am a kirby fan but this is not worth no  or  because you can beat it in one day instead rent it
this game is the worst of them all why dont they make a remake of kirby superstar instead of this crap
canvas curse is better than this
the controls are good but i expected something like kirby and the crystal shards which you can also beat in one day also but at least theres d graphics to come back topretty much if youre going to get it rent it dont buy itthis should be done with almost all kirby games because most are short except for air ridethe original fuzion frenzy for xbox is an amazing game
however this is nothing like it
it is absolutely terrible not worth a single cent
fans of the original game will be repulsed by this sequel that feels like someone new tried to make it with right purchased from the original games creatorsapril the wii version of the game has corrected the faults of the old xbox game
apparently ubisoft heard the complaints and changed the game
the rabaul raid is now broken into several segments and a strategy can be formed besides kill everything that moves
i still believe that the game is a great way to teach the geography and importance of the individual battles in wwii
the game is challenging but much better to play
i would change the ratings but amazon will not let meold review playing the game is initially is fun
the planes are responsive  except you cant see where you are going
however the mission rabaul raid  cannot be won and campaign stops there
there isnt any strategy that can be employed to win
therefore play is restricted restricted to lower levels and early campaigns over and over again
a real shame because it is a great way to teach kids about wwii history
ubisoft wont help and their website is useless
i am going to ask them for my money back and follow up with ftc for fraud vis a vis unsuitability for intended purpose
very disappointingbefore i even begin my review let me just say that ive been playing rpgs since  when they were played in text form only
ive played everything from zork to bards tale to diablo  lod to oblivion all of which are great gamesthen i attempted to play enchanted arms
i knew within the first  minutes that i was not going to like this game
one of the main characters uses a saxaphone as his weapon blasting enemies with song notes
the combat system is confusing and unfun
its as if the people who created this game had never played an rpg before because it doesnt seem to borrow any of the good attributes of the many great rpgs which have gone before itthe fact that this game comes out on the very advanced xbox  system makes it expensive but believe me when i say that you will quickly regret dropping  on it
rent it if you must but i like rpgs as much or more than just about anybody and i could barely stand to play it for ten minutesjust another announcementbasically the ps version is not worth purchasing
the quality of the picture is too blurry
just creeping around achieving undetected from your enemies is just a waste of time since you too can barely see them haft the time
its like playing a ps game on your ps
a very bad port to the ps
id get the sequel rainbow six vegas dont buy it for the ps
either get it on the  or just get the sequel
the picture quality is important when playing
i dont understand why their are so many perfect scores when the picture quality sucks unless someone can help me with it
dont bother telling me about hd its like tell someone about wifi d movies the iphone droid the world is round and it revolves around the sun
i got it
thats not the casegrafics so bad like play   not good for play   sorry im sell in  jajaja  noi feel relived that i bought this game used from gamestop
that allowed me to return it if i didnt like it
i returned it the same day i bought it
this game is just terrible
it was created as a ps game but then was just created on ps and xbox  all the company that created this game did was take the ps version and write it onto a ps and xbox  disc
the graphics look terrible and the lighting effects are worse
it is very hard to see and you sometimes have to use nightvision in plain daylight just to see two feet in front of you
also the terrorists are just plain stupid and will stand around and get shot sometimes
at some points in the game you just sit around wondering what to do next
i know the reviews on this game are great but please take my advice and rent this game before you spend  bucks on this piece of garbagei originally purchased and played through and am still playing through vegas  and i absolutely love it
vegas  was a huge let down after playing   the graphics are fuzzy even on my flat screenm which means i struggle to see the terrorists at long distances but they still see me
and with two different discs i have tried two different copies the snake cam has failed to work which is a vital part of regular game play
i am done with this game and will just stick with vegas  which is by far my favorite shooterthere is no need for a long review of this gameit is simply unplayable
the graphics are so unbelievably bad that it gave me headaches every time i tried to play it
looking down a street you cant even tell a bad guy from a trash can and its not because they are using the trash can for cover
its because of inexcusably horrible graphics for a ps gameive read where you have to go into the ps menu and modify video output settings to clean up the screenbut why bother
this is a ps three system not a circa s ps one so i dont expect to deal with pc load letter type problems when i install a game
i also didnt invest in a  flat screen so i can manually dumb down the video output on the ps to however i went the extra mile and did change the output to  expecting the screen to clear upmine didnt
this game was a complete waste of money and for that reason i can not give it anything more than  star since amazon doesnt allow zero star reviewsthe only reason i can think of to play this game is if youve already played every other shooter on the psthen youd better have a bottle of tylenol next to yousimple as this
if you have windows vista it will not install
i just got this game off of amazoncom and it wont even install
it freezes up my computer when i try to explorerunautorun the discfirst encounter assault recon or fear the worst acronym in a gaming title yet and a game that couldnt decide if it wanted to be first person shooter or survival horror and ultimately failed at being both of themthe story is unoriginal and poorly executed the level design and enemires are monotonous the controls are terribly awkward and there just isnt that much action
this game also contains the most anticlimactic ending in game historyas far as the horror aspect of this game goes a few things jump out at you every now and then which is pretty cheap but still fun for horror fans like myself
there are also some flashbacktelepathic state type parts which involve some weird reality shifts and lots of blood and creepiness and so forth and are reminiscent of those paranormal moments in the suffering in how they are executed and quite similar to the ring in terms of their horror content
while these parts are pretty awesome they probably make up about  minutes of the total gameplay which isnt really enough to warrant this game as a horror musthaveif youre into firstperson shooters in a big way and think the sound of a small injection of horror would be right up your proverbial alley this game might be for you
however anyone looking for a serious survival horror game on xbox  no dead rising doesnt count should be patient a little longer and anyone looking for a decent fps should definately look elsewherei loved dead or alive for the regular xbox
however this game is just a piece of garbage
first of all this might not be a big deal to most people but if you love to earn achievements you will hate the achievements for this game
i cannot begin to explain how hard this game is
yes it is fun to watch these beautiful characters dance around but there is no nudity in this game
i was very sad with my purchase because personnaly i thought this game had nudity
but there is none
there are no instructions for when you start the game possibly your only option is to research the game online and watch youtube videos how people play the certain types of games in doax
i have to tell you all the racing games this doax has to offer are very challenging
you will waste your money if you purchase this productthese are great board games but awful ds games pretty much just tap the screen
tap tap tap  tap tap tap donethis game is terrible
this is coming from a big fan of the mgs series you can read my glowing review of snake eater for instancethe camera and the controls are what do the most damage to this game
without two analog sticks controlling the camera without moving is almost impossible and even if you take two hands or modify the controls to do just that it fights you the entire time making the effort wasted
needless to say where the camera automatically points is almost never in the direction youre interested in
the controls pioneered in the second installment of the series are very poorly carried over here
the aforementioned camera is a huge issue but the lack of the two shouldertrigger buttons hurts this game
a mgs style game probably could have made an excellent psp game but alas they opted for a control scheme not suited to the limitations of the pspthe analog nub doesnt ave any speed control to it not sure if this is the psp or the games failure to take advantage of it making the analog portion refer to directionality only
this makes finetune aiming difficult and on a moving target impossible
this is further complicated by the low resolution of the psp
this means that due to terrible camera and awful handlingcontrols both sneaking and gunplay the only two kinds of gameplay in the game are tedious and unpleasant affairseven if the controls were perfect or this was ported on to an actual console this is still the weakest game in the series
level design is obnoxious ie  minute long vent crawls with nothing going on is a common feature
the game repeatedly beats a dead horse with forced repetitious ojectivesexample of a typical level upon beating the previous level you are given a  minute dialogue about the next mission objective
when you select the next mission you are given roughly the same dialogue about the mission objective again
upon entering the mission you immediately get a lengthy raido message about the mission objective again
upon entering the room with the objective it does second cinematic pan of the objective and you get a radio message about the objective
once you approach the objective you get a radio message about the objective again
you blow up the objective and then get a radio conversation about blowing up the objective
after completing the mission you then have a dialogue sequence again about how you blew up the objectivethe mgs series is known for being overly verbose but this game is almost a parody of it
its only saving grace is that every second youre in a dialogue means its one less second you have to be playing with the games awful controlsfinally theres the load time
every time one of these dialogue sequences comes up theres loading
dialogue sequence ends
theres loading
restart level
more loading
i have the psstore downloaded version ie not the minidisc which i think would make loading less of an issue
god help you if you have the minidiscdo yourself a favor dont ever play this gameas far as st person shooter games this game is lame
go with great ones like rainbow six or call of duty
thats where its at
this game is hurtinwhat an annoying gamethe first couple boards are okbut then after that the game gets way to difficult to playbad camera viewsdriving vehicles sucks in this gamesame old one liners by charactersstay away from thisone of the many interesting points with the xbox  is the amazing detail and graphics the console itself provides
another is the d effects and the go inside the game abilitythe makers of this game failed miserably to see these reasons as opportunities to make a better game
i honestly think they slapped this one together and threw it on the shelf before anyone had time to tell them just how awful it was
the effects stink the gameplay is awful the controls are very difficult to figure out and the players move in awkward and hard to maneuver waysi played this game for about an hour and had to take some tylenol from the headache
the headache caused by screaming as the screen and looking at my bank balance and wishing i had never purchased this game at alllet me start by saying that if it were not for all the ridiculous perfect  star reviews this game has gotten that my real judgement on gta iv would be closer to  stars rather than  however in the interest of fairness i had to rate it  to counter all the biased positive reviews written by gamers who are just quoting what they read in a magazine reviewgta iv falls incredibly short of what it was hyped to be and indeed what it could have been had its developers not rushed to get it out of the door too quicklyi wont comment on all the glitches people are reporting because i havent experienced any but i will comment on the games short comings in the way of mission variety lack of side missions seen in previous series installments and a general lack of fun as the game progressesgta iv starts off strong with an interesting storyline that ultimately falters somewhere half way through when some of the most interesting characters youre introduced to dont get their just deserves and the story seems to turn into a rush job to finish rather than having any kind of really satisfying conclusionreviewers and game designers have given players the false idea that the story is open ended and concludes based on choices that the player makes throughout the games course
this is simply not true as no matter what you do youre going to be presented with only one of two choices toward the games end that will decide how the story wraps up
even then theres not much difference between the two endings to even warrant saying that you have much of a choicewhile there are a few incredibly fun and satisfying mission over the course of the game there just isnt enough certainly not as many as you had to choose from in san andreasalso there is not enough variety of good music on the radio stations and the looped conversations get old fast and become more annoying than funnyim not asking for the sky but i feel the games designers and anyone who isnt under the age of  who shouldnt being playing this title anyway would agree if they were honest with themselves that this game was a rush job and could have been far better than what we ended up gettingno wonder it got so much hype word of advice to prospective buyers any time a game gets as much hype as gta iv got its a pretty good rule of thumb to think twice before buying something thats over compensating for a major shortcomingyoure better off spending your  on something thats worth the price like metal gear solid this game is too difficult for me which made the experience frustrating and ultimately unplayable
i see others find it too easy
this could have been easily solved by having  levels of difficulty from very easy to very hard
the game would appeal to a much greater consumer base and would have had much greater sales if it had  difficulty levelsthe other major related problem is that one cannot save in the middle of a mission
because of this one must repeat the same driving sequence over and over to finally get through the hard part of the mission ultimately i could not pass missions and had to stop playing the gamebecause of the two problems above i find this game more frustration than fun
i will not buy any more games of this series or any games that do not have levels of difficulty hopefully  levelslike many other gta addicts i was thrilled when i heard a new version of gta was to be releasedthat is until i played ithere is a list of problems i have encountered game locks up and freezes my brand new ps constantly even when in single player mode after a few hours of gameplay i encountered a crash so bad that i was greeted with a message saying my ps hard drive was corrupted this has never happened before with any other games online game play is impossible
wont load crashes massive amount of glitches stalls halfway through gameplay only to delete all progress made other online players are often impossible to see making missions unachievable after searching through hundreds of comments on gta iv forums i can see this is an ongoing problem with many other customers the game graphics are only fair at best characters are unispiring and quite boring often times hard to understand without turning captions on missions are repetitive dull and go nowhereill be one of the first to admit the gta franchise seems to have gone stale
i was extemely disappointed after hearing all the hype surrounding this game i think critics rushed to give this game great reviews far too early
to me it has been nothing but one big headahce since i opened itnever have i been so inspired to never play a game againugh dont bother with this one
i have played vice city vice city stories liberty city and san andreas and all of them were hilarious wild fun and exciting
good story lines comedy on the radio hilarious graphic effects when you hit something with your car etc
the old gta was a fun game for adults that was primarily action based satire just my kind of fun
i was so excited about gta
i heard so much about it that i couldnt wait for it to come out
when i played it i wasnt excited by it but i figured it would pick up in a bit
it didnt
the main character isnt someone i particularly have any interest in the other characters are okay but nothing special
the graphics are really awesome but the radio is terrible to listen to because there really isnt anything funny on it unlike that of its predecessors especially gta vcs
as far as comedy goes one of my favorite comedians katt williams was on it and i didnt even chuckle
that hurts
the missions were alright but it was sometimes hard to tell where you were supposed to run or shoot
i enjoyed the hokey ghetto graphics of the other games because it made it feel like you were playing an oldschool video game
i stopped playing this one about ten percent into it
ill just play the others again i think
i hope that they bring some of the old crazy spirit back in the next onechrist this game was annoying
while i do admit having played them all so far that the voice acting the storyline and the general atmospherics are the best in the series it simply got too annoying having to drive clear across town to the site of a mission youd failed
why werent you allowed to save right before the part where you kept messing up
the fact that some of the missions were difficult was par for the course but it was simply inexcusable wasting my time driving across town merely to see another cutscenethe only good thing i can say about this game is that it features an excellent very convincing atmosphere of new york
besides that though all i have to offer is a bunch of gripes
i dont give a toss if you find this list useful or not  here im actually writing to myself so that i check this list and remember how infuriating this game was so that i dont some day forget about this stuff and play it again
receiving these calls that you cant hang up on just as youre finishing missions often when the police are still shooting at you and youre about to die unless you can shoot back or get in a car
you cant run while talking on your cell phone or enter a car
the cheats for this were not enough and the ones there are are unsatisfying
why couldnt you simply have been given an infinite life cheat
why did you have to keep dialing on your cell phone
what an annoyance
the missions dont have difficulty levels
why the heck not
the camera defaults behind you and theres nothing you can do about this
even though you can move it about it invariably drifts back to just behind you
there should have been a way to turn this off in the options
though there are several camera angles there never seems to be quite the one you need
why cant you shoot michelle
and others
openended sandbox my heiney
i say shoot her and move on
you cant make minimap any bigger  kinda hard to see at times whats what
the plot doesnt make any sense  were hounded by loan sharks and yet ive got k in my pocket
how much are we in the hole for
like im sure a poor russian would have been able to borrow k
this is ridiculous
whatever i or my cousin borrowed or stole i definitely have the money to pay it back right now
so why cant i
the autosave interrupts what youre doing
theres no way to collect cars as there was in previous versions of this game
you cant zoom in on something to get a really good look
you cant replay any of the missions without starting the entire game over
one must complete all missions to progress
brutal
can you let us skip one once in a while
i hate having to call people you dont to call and having to be friends with people you dont want to be friends with
whos in control of my character anyway
like im gonna spend another second with that reggae guy
your autoaim system blows
itll have you shooting at a pillar when theres an enemy right in front of your face
the villain responsible for all your sorrows kept changing about every  missions
this got ridiculous real fast
like i said they had a great setup for an action game but no actual plot
they give you all these fancy cars yet theres no place on the map to really open up any of the cars
disappointing
instead youre just stuck in traffic with your ferrarimany people say that this  games plot  is the best of the seriesit isothers say it has the best graphics in the seriesit doesso whats missing
in my opinion just about everything that made gta san andreas such a blast to playyou cant customize your characters physique by working out
you cant get tattoos or increase your fighting ability
niko starts the game off wimpy in handtohand combat and stays that way to the very endin gta  you could improve your fighting shooting and driving abilities to near superhuman capabilities
it wasnt realistic which one of gta ivs selling pointsit was funand while gta ivs environment is better rendered and more realistic it is far smaller and less diverse  than gta san andreasgta san andreas built upon its predecessors by creating a more vast varied environment that included urban and wooded areasand all of gta ivs predecessors  had one thing in common by the time you got to the end of the game you had tons of money and pretty much ran the whole towndrivingthe driving in gta iv is also tedious and frustratingthere are many missions where you have to chase someone down in an automobile
these missions require that you drive at high speeds through the traffic congested maze that is liberty cityand  the vehicles handle nothing like they did in the original series
they veer outofcontrol easilyafter about five missions this got tiresome for me and frustratingyou can chase someone for seemingly endless miles lose them and then have to start he whole thing over againthere was one mission where i was chasing down someone only to have giant metal pipes fall in the middle of the  road and cut me off
and i failed the missionand so many of the great stuff i liked about the other games are goneyou cant buy safe houses
wthi was so disappointed with the graphics looks like your playing on a ps console
ai is not that realistic tooi cant believe how many hours of my life i literally wasted playing this game
 of the game is based on completing the main storyline missions and i got up to 
the mission paper trail is the most ridiculous mission ever in gta history
in that mission you are supposed to take a helicopter and shoot down a target helicopter miles away with little jacob in the passenger seati cant tell you how many times i tried doing this mission to the point where im about to write an official letter to rockstar games
gta must have a difficulty setting adjustment
no excuses
how can you make a game with ridiculously frustrating missions towards the end of the main storyline without any difficulty adjustment whatsoever
this is mindless and idiotic to say the very leastive had a lot of difficulty with some previous missions and luckily i got through those but paper trail really puts the icing on the cake
the other  of the game consists of side missions which are worthless in my opinion
thats an even bigger waste of time
and if youre one of those trophyhunting nuts who needs to have every trophy in this game then youve got no life at all
save your efforts on another game not this oneas a result of all this im happy to say that gta  is now collecting dust on my shelf
early on in the game i was heavily thinking about purchasing episodes from liberty city but thats definitely not happening
it gives me great pleasure that rockstar games will not be making  to  off meim very glad that i got this game for free through amazon promotional credits ive saved up because i tell yai would not have spent any sort of currency on this title
i havent played red dead redemption yet which is on my shelf in the shrink wrap but if it gives me the same amount of frustration i will never purchase a game featuring the golden r ever againi thought halo  was over hyped but gta  redefines the concept
there is no way this game deserves the landslide of perfect scores it has recieved and the only reasonable conclusion is that the reviewers were paid off
the gameplay is the same as ever and it gets very repetitive and dull
drive to point a shoot some dude
drive to point b repeat ad nauseum
the story is a complete joke where they throw in every gangster cliche and rascist sterteotype in the book
includes numerous lame banal attempts at satire
nico bellic has the personality of a cardboard box save yourself the trouble and watch scarface instead
and the graphics are seriously subpar
the characters are super blocky and look like something from the original xbox or ps textures are bland and overall its pretty unimpressive
unless you have a thing for the demoiselles davignon you are not going to find the strippers here attractive
dont be fooled by the press
save your cashthis game is hard as hell to handle
it was in great shape but i cant stand the game
sighseriously ive played some god awful video games in my time but this one takes the cake
i bought it because everyone and their mother was saying it was the best game theyd ever played
and i guess it just goes to show people are retarded
i took this game back to the store after playing it for  dayscars are your primary mode of transportation in this and any other gta game which rockstar seems to have forgotten this time around because each and every car in the game handles like a dead cow on a sled hill
the excuse being to give the game realism so you cant turn the cars at  miles an hour without spinning out tje reason anyone would want this feature in a game is beyond my understandingin every gta game the supporting characters have been real jerkwads
this one is no exception the difference being that in this one you are forced to interact with these jerkwads on a regular basis playing mindless stupid minigames that arent that fun in real lifein most gta games you start out working for some crappy mobster but in this one the mobster is much crappier than usual
its like working for a  lb baby with explosive diahrea you have to follow behind him with a shovel and catch whatever hes throwingthe main character nico bellic is a tosser the main characters in gta are always likable with an asterisk but this guy is just plain not likable oh yes hes developed with his imigrant accent and all that but in reality he has all the depth of a background character and the problem is in order to get behind a character usually it requires you to relate to him and nico is unrelatable so even if the gameplay was fun you feel so detached from it all that it never really sinks inthe problem with this game is one word realism
except the real world sucks most of the time
thats why we invented forms of entertainment like video games they are an escape from reality
if you take an escape from reality and make it realistic you sir missed the point in its entiretyone of the worst games ever made and the most shameful winner of so manny undeserved awardsthis game is not worth buying
im not even sure if this game is worth renting
if you have played gta san andreas it is pretty much the same thing
its a sequel so i guess it should be
there just arent enough new things in this game to justify purchasesif you have never a gta then you should rent it and see how the gameplay is
you pretty much drive from one location to the next and complete missionskinda of boring missions toothis game is boring and unimaginative
its just shoot shoot shoot
it takes a long time to get through one of their boring shooting scenes
i have played games for years
ive communed with animals explored caves roamed through africa in other games
in this game everything is stupid and predictable
i hate this game its pure miserywell i never did get past the first cutscene
tried a new disc and it did the same thing even with the new patch from rockstar that was supposed to fix the freeze issues
some sites suggested disabling internet on the ps settings etc and after jumping through all kinds of hoops same result
well that was fun
what a dud
at least i was able to return the gamemy ps is a gb version bought new when ps first came out which happens to be the model that is having the most issues with gta iv
besides this buggy game i have not had any issues with the ps previously
only a small percentage of people seem to be experiencing this problem with the game but for us unfortunate ones its a big issue
especially after all the hypethe first copy i got wasnt read by my toshiba laptop and i thought the disk was blank
when i returned it the second one wasnt any different
i then loaded it onto my nephews xp dell with no trouble
its too bad because i was really looking forward to playing itso much promise so many cool weapons and spells but then it is the same thing over and over and over again
the game is only level after level of dungeon with perhaps  different atmospheres that cycle
this game had so much potential but after about  levels of the dungeon youve seen pretty much everything
get something elsethe main menu is nice looking
not sure about anything after that as starting a new game hangs the computer
i havent even seen the first cut scenei did the standard i play games on a pc thing  download latest drivers instal patches google for hours read the support forums etc
it seems like spending hours trying to figure out why a game wont work is a part of the pc gaming experience which as i was reading the th yeah i get that exact same error but i also cant find a workaround and the company wont respond to forum posts or emails i realized was pretty sad
some games crash occasionally dark messiah some frequenty sin episode  some are unconscionably laggy mass effect and some work perfectly halflife  gears of war oblivion neverwinter nights  at least on my new computer etc
timeshift is the first one where i have never ever even seen the game run in any way shape or form
i wondered why a game so many people said they liked was being sold so cheap
yes the game is old but even old games these days sell for at least 
now i know
the game has been out long enough that all tech problems should be patched now but im finding plenty of people having problems and all of them have exactly the same error with the same error message thats  reproducible and not one person has gotten it working  that sounds to me like the problem that is easiest to solve widely seen perfectly reproduciblefor the record my pc is well above min specs
xp  bit dual core  gtx gb ram etcfor my part i think  hours is enough of my time trying to make a game work
considering what i make per hour this game has wasted enough of my time that i can buy a console where i know the games work
its not worth making this game worth
its going in the trasha recommendation for others that i wish i had thought of earlier  a lot of people are saying the demo for this game freezes
if youre considering this game find the free demo and see if you can run it
if so maybe its worth risking buying this gamewe have a fairly new computer with windows xp and a graphics card which meets the specs listed on the box and we cannot get this game to run
it installs but then when you ask it to run it flashes for a second and then dies
after doing some extensive research this is a common problem
some people have managed to tweak their computers in order to get this game to run
we have not
id seriously advise against wasting any money on this game
even with the latest patches we still cannot get it to run
this is apparently what is happening generally when attempting to adapt xboxplaystation games for the computer they are sent out there with a lot of bugs
good lucki loved killzone on the ps and was excited to get a killzone game for the psp
sadly i find the difficulty level in this game to be too high
i have to replay some levels five or six times to get through
i do not find that kind of difficulty to be enjoyable
i find it frustrating and irritatingif youre good at third person shooters maybe youll breeze through this one
for myself i think im going to put this game down and stick with first person shootersfor those of you who own a super nintendo with bassins black bass i recommend you bust it out and play it before you opt to buy this game
im not sure if this game is a port from an older console or if there was no effort at all put forth to develop a good fishing game
when you are given innovative hardware i feel i should be doing more than holding a to reel in a fish
oh not to mention the graphics are comparable to playstation  maybe
im still trying to figure out why this game was even released for a next gen console granted so much more could have been done better not to mention there is virtually no use of the wii motes innovative controlsnow for the reviewstarting from when the game was first booted up the opening music and graphics gave me hope that i may be playing a good fishing game
as soon as i saw the chracter select screen i knew i was wrong
the graphics right from the get go are pretty bad probably slightly better than playstaion  graphics i was also using a widescreen tv which only made it look worse
there was no createacharacter mode to customize your player you just select from a few preset male and female models
moving along to start the game nothing is unlocked to start so you are pretty much stuck with the one boat and a few lures
there are limited lakes to fish from most of which only contain a few types of fish and most of the locations look the same
the boat controls are standard but the graphics were so bad i didnt think it mattered where i was fishing as i couldnt tell the difference between the dock and a floating branch any waynow for the actual fihsing
the controls are terrible you dont even use the nunchuk to reel like zelda
you basically hold a and flick your wrist
hold a to reel and move the wii mote left and right to guide the line
you cant change the camera at all once you cast so you are stuck in this poor underwater view
the fish for the most part appear randomly out of no where and bite
oh and for reeling in a fish once you figure out that all you have to do is hold a while swinging the wii mote like a lasso youll have the fish from  ft to your boat in less than  seconds
boooorrrring
the underwater graphics are much better than the rest of the game but the poor views and fishing controls make the game a complete bomb
also there are severeal glitches in the game
once the fish gets close to your boat it randomly gets stuck under the boat and some how comes through the bottom of the boat into your netconsglitchylimited camera options and poor viewterrible graphicslimited character creationlimited fishing areaslimited fish varietyvery repetative boring fishing controls once you figure it outcontrols dont make use of wii mote or nunchukrapala in your boat is annoying and just says random things the whole timefish appear randomly on your lureprosnoneoverallif you are satisified with n graphics and dont care at all to use your wii mote  nunchuk to fish innovatively this game is for you
for you true anglers just wait for a real fishing game for the wii im sure there will be one soonsince my husband and young son enjoy the fishing on wii play i thought this would be fun
im so sorry i bought this game
unlike wii play this game doesnt vibrate when you hook the fish
driving the boat was ok  dont buy this game
stick with fishing game in wii play until a more realistic fishing game comes outthis may be the worst game i have ever played
i bought it used from a local gaming store and they said i could bring it back if unhappy
i brought it back the same day
i am not keeping a game like this in my house
i am an avid fisherman and video gamer so perhaps i am expecting too much
however this game fails in every department so i doubt it
do not buy this game
shame on nintendo for putting their good name on such a horrible productgraphics are as bad as the nintendo   the game makes no sense in general and the instructions are terrible
it doesnt feel like you are really fishing as i had hoped because you just push buttons which makes no sense
dont buy
at least if you are thinking of buying it rent it first you will see what i meanat the time i am writing this i am waiting to recieve it in the mail
that being side i may have to just send it back as soon as i get it
why
because of the confusing description that is on this webpage
when i oredered mine the review about what being only pal compatible means was not here after reading thatand calling around to other game stores i now know that it means this playstation will only play european gamesand or it will only work with a tv that works in europe
now the question is is this just a typo by amazon
why would they be selling a ps on their us site that only will work in europe
is it fact or fiction
that my friends is what i am waiting to find out when this package comes to my door
it is a real shame that amazon would sell this if it is only workable with products made for europe
and even a bigger shame if they just made a mistake in the description and have not taken the time to correct it
there are a few reviews that state how satisfied they are with the product and how it works with their games but did they buy this one from amazon or some place else
i will write back when i get this just to let others know if mine worked or not
if anyone has brought this system please leave a review that states you brought this silver version from amazon and how it works for you
thanks
oki just got my silver playstation  in the mail today
this is a ntsc system it plays american games
so my star rating goes way upbought for knight of the old republic jedi outcast and empire at war
i have a fairly new  bit machine win  ultimate  gigs of ram newish nvida card quad core  ghz processor and plenty of hard drive room and the only program that works of the three i tried was jedi knight ii outcast
knight of the old republic continuously crashes under different settings and compatibility modes
i cant even get empire at war to install after dozens of different tries
i think i will return im very sad this is why pc gaming is such a painesta collecion incluye titulos unicos en la saga de starwars para videojuegos de pc
 impresionantes titulos de modalidad de juego distinta prometen ke este pack sera uno de los mejores x vendersei am bothered by the fact that the item here does not come in the box as pictured and concerned about reports of warranty voids
if it isnt in the appropriate packaging how do we know who really makes it
we did follow another reviewers advice and picked one up at target for  that is packaged in the box shown herei am big fan of ea soccer game
i am playing many ea fifa games on both pc and the console version
i was very excited when this game came out
after buying it and trying it out for  hours i was so dissappointed and had to trade the game in got less than  of the price i paid forbasically the game has very little leagues you could pick and choose
i dont have to say more about this weakness because you would spot the same complaint from the other reviewers
some people said the graphic is great i would disagree
comparing with the last fifa game  world cup fifa i think the graphic of this game is a lot worse
plus in this game you dont have many different camera viewing optionsit was claimed that this game was designed with the new engine offering many new and different features
for instance it tried to show the realism of the game by allowing the players bumping into each other
i think it is ridiculous
overall comparing with the  world cup fifa this game is really badi have read many other reviews about this game after buying it
 i know its a mistake
i thought i would love it regardless what other people said and i finally regretted and i totally agree with most of them after playing itif youre fifa fan my advise is save you money and go with  world cup fifa
trust me
you wont regret
this game is a complete mess up of ea
if youre new to ea fifa game my advise is still do not buy it
rent this game at best
again  world cup fifa is  times better than this gamei hope it helpsthe darkness is a first person adventure game with prevalent crime and horror themes
interactions with the environment are limited and the mood and feel of the game leaves me with nothing but disgust
avoid this game at all coststhis game had an interesting premise but it failed to capitalize on it
were never given important elements of the story and the main character just seems wrong
furthermore the game doesnt work well as a shooter and the darkness aspect of the game which is what makes it unique is difficult to use and really not that interesting
mainly the game is just boring and shooting out all the lights gets old really fast
i wasnt able to finish the game because i lost interest
fortunately i paid less than  for it but even then its not worth itafter spending  hours trying to get this puppy working w windows xp and numerous time sorting through forums ive come to the following realization  this product was released too early
my first clue was the lack of support from microsoft when i called they didnt even know what it was
check the forums or just google this thing  youll see what im talking about
and forget it if you have a wireless mouse that runs on ghzusing windows vistawas hoping to use with halo  vistabut ive yet to get it to actually function in any way
it just doesnt synch with headset or xbox  controlleri may try another one but from reviewsseems its a very common problem if you have other wireless devicestried  of these with vista os and they will not work
they do not even show up in the control panel gamepad section
tried to find info at microsoft support  forget it they did not even know they made them
so until the techs at microsoft get off their high hats and actually perform support dont waste your time or moneythe logitech wireless works great and is half the price
i use this with oblivion and a nd party pinnacle program to set up the controls and whoh it worksthis is a counterfeit and its from hong kong
dont be like me and please read the reviews
youll become a better shopper if you read the reviews
if you buy this item and decide to send it back
youll have to pay shipping cost which cost as much as the item
so youre basically stuck
however if you do decide to buy this item just buy it from amazon and not this sellerthis was a very disappointing purchaseprosthe device is small and coordinates with the white xbox  accessoriesone of the few devices on the market which seems to have windows vista bit drivers
not released on the driver cd that came with the device of course  you had to download them from the xbox siteconswould not connect to  different xbox  controllerseventually forces other usb peripherals offlinei used two different wireless xbox  controllers and neither one was connecting
after making several attempts to make a connection with one or the other i called xbox  accessory support
the first person i spoke to had no idea what i was talking about
i explained it at some length and then was put on holdsome  minutes later he returned after consulting with another person and proceeded to give me wrong information about where to go to determine if it was connected
when i corrected him i was put on hold again
he returned and told me that contrary to the documentation the controller device would not show that it was connected in the same way it did on the console
when pointed out that the documentation disagreed with him he told me that the item was defective and i should just return it to the store and get a different onewhen i noted that he didnt seem to know enough about it to determine if it were working or not he passed me on to a supervisor
she seemed to know a little more but not much
she finally gave up and indicated that she would need to look it up and call me back
as you can imagine microsoft never called backi left the receiver plugged in and the next morning my usb bluetooth keyboard and mouse were not working
i unplugged them and after rebooting i was able to reconnect them
the following evening they were disconnected again
i removed the xbox wireless receiver and then had to reboot again before the bluetooth devices would reconnectnot only does this thing not work it causes other perfectly good devices to stop working as well
i am unwilling to go out and buy an external powered usb hub when i built my pc with several onboard usb ports so i wouldnt have to go buy an external hub
this thing is crazyavoid avoid avoidi figured that microsoft would put a decent product on the market when it released this wireless headset for the xbox  unfortunately the headset hasnt met any of my expectations
it is awful do not purchase
it continuously disconnects from the xbox so u find yourself turning the power off and then back on so it reconnects
if you leave the room that the xbox is in it loses connection and either must turn offon again or wait a long time for it to reconnect
the technology in this headset is abominable
i bought this headset when it was 
needless to say i wouldnt pay  for it
ive since switched to the bulky and irritable but consistent wired headset that comes with the xbox
thanks for a great product microsoftnoti dont see how a yr old computer or a xt can run this game see other reviews i have a yr old computer with a xxl mb card  card was upgraded after purchasei believe the minimum card req on box were nvidia  and radeon x
were these cards offered yrs ago 
 is a xt similar to a x does anyone know the reccomended sys req if the past is any indicator minimum vs reccomended sys req can be quite different  id like to know  what it takes to get the most graphically out out the gamemy xxl doesnt pass the vertexpixel shading requirement  you need im not tech savvy so im confused as to how a xt has  vertexpixel shading or if a yr old computer hashad cards with  i bought the game based on those reiewsguess ill have to wait till i upgrade my cardthis isnt a review of the game but a warning on the sys req as stated on the box in contrast to several reviews posted belowive altered my reviewsomeone pointed out in a comment my nvidia  has vertexpixel shading  why then does the box state  as the minimum requirementas for reviewing a game before playing it i stated i based my purchase on the reviews belowi think they are inaccuratefalseim not tech savvy thank you for pointing out my ignorance on the nvidia  im physically disabled and unable to access that computer  in another roomthere is a war going on and im not talking about the ongoing iraq struggle
the battle im talking about is a lot more fun to discuss and a whole lot easier to understand
im of course referring to the war of the handheldsif youve been paying attention which im sure you have because youre reading a nintendo ds review then you will understand that sony and nintendo have been at combat for quite a while
four years into the seventh generation of video game consoles consumers are now forced to pick between two dominant choices of handheld gaming devices
the nintendo ds and the sony pspnow at first glance it would appear from a sales perspective the nintendo ds is the format of choice
after all it is the top selling handheld video game system worldwide as of march  nintendo has sold roughly  million units amazon at the current time has even put a limit on how many units can be sold to one household
compared to sony and their psp sales this seems to be an easy decision for anyone in the market for a new portable gaming system rightwellmaybe not
true the nintendo ds has been selling very well
but lets not get confused here
remember the band new kids on the block
they outsold everybody for awhile there but does that mean they were a quality band
i didnt think socompared to the psp the nintendo ds seems more like a cheap toy for children who are desperately saving their allowance every week in the hopes of one day owning a real handheld gaming unit such as a psp
not that the nintendo ds wont appeal to everyone but after taking just a quick and honest look at the two systems it would be hard to understand why someone would purposely pass up a quality handheld like the psp and settle for something lesswell start with the screen
now this is were a lot of consumers think the nintendo ds shines over the sony psp because of its dual screens and touch screen ability
the truth isit doesnt
after using the touch screen on the nintendo ds it feels more like a unnecessary novelty than a real convenient feature
it doesnt really subtract from the unit itself but bells and whistles arent going to score you any real points in the world of series gamers
the nintendo ds comes with two inch screens and a  x  pixel resolution which again doesnt say much
compared to the psps beautiful  inch widescreen display and  x  pixel count there is really no contest between the two
the psp is the clear and obvious winner herewhile were on the subject of system hardware it should be noted that several people have had major problems with the hinge on the nintendo ds
it seems after just some moderate use the joint becomes weak and breaks rendering the top screen of the nintendo ds inoperable resulting in a blank white screen
i guess adding moving parts to a handheld unit is proving as questionable as it sounds
also and again compared to the psp the general feel of the ds feels cheaply thrown together
some reviewers have commented the psp feels and looks a lot more expensive than it is with comments from engadget reviewers likewere sure sony is losing a few hundred bucks off each unit sold as the psp easily feels like its worth  of gadgetry when compared to portable video and audio players and the dsgraphics is another subject worth tackling here
even the most diehard nintendo ds fans have nothing to say when asked between the graphics on a ds compared to a psp
if youre looking to play sports action or combat games in other words anything meaningful then youll be sorry you own a ds
the psp delivers stunning graphics comparable to ps style gameplay
the ds on the other hand very dullone of nintendos biggest problems is not with the unit itself but what is played on it
it seems like kiddie games are the games of choice for the nintendo ds
now it is true the ds can play some more teenoriented games but these a few and far between for the most part nintendo seems to think that a seemingly endless supply of mariorelated games will keep ds owners occupied and for the most parttheyre right
the children who play the ds seem to enjoy these games but if you ever get tired of mario kart and you willfaster than you think and want to play some real games like grand theft auto youll need to upgrade to a more advanced handheld for example you know where this is going the pspthe lack of a web browser without starting in with the addons is also a problem for the ds
also no music of video storage makes the ds a simple gaming device that lacks anything innovative and this stage in the electronic world it is almost standard to have some multimedia capabilities
the psp again succeeds were the ds failsat a time of war the battlefield is no place for children and their toys
although the nintendo ds appeals to the kiddies it will never be taken seriously by real gamers
its lack of multimedia features condemn it to a simple uninspiring cheaply made childrens gaming unit with dull graphics
it may continue to outsell the psp because of its cheap price tagbut in the end you get what you pay forthis thing came with my hp blackbird game pcin the  year warranty i had to replace it twice and now just  month after the warranty expired it is out againsometimes when the pc starts it is deadsometimes all the lit keys flash like crazy and all  of the squares in the top right corner stay litwhen this happens you can not type on the keyboard and there is no way to turn them offthe letters on this keyboard are extra smallover the years i have had several computers and this is the first one that the keyboard has quite workingto me this is just a junk keyboardyou would expect a ps game to have amazing graphics game play and be just plain fun
this is not that kind of gamethe good news
there is a gundam game for the ps and the gundam suits look pretty good
the opening cutscene looks amazingthe bad newsthe opening cutscene looks nothing like the actual game
if all you care about is graphics this is not the game for you
you would expect this game to be on the ps or even the sega saturn but not the most powerful next gen system
the battle areas are bland with no detail past the muddy looking ground and poorly animated trees
there are glitches everywhere in the game such as water going through trees and when your mech tries to cross a bridge and falls in the water just sits there
the other thing about the graphics is that the frame rate is clunky its as if youre constantly blinking and dont see every fluid movement
only youre not blinking youre seeing the actual game
the missions are straight forward and take no skill whatsoever considering the lock on system is more than accurate because you dont even need to face your enemy completely to hit them
the controls are mushy and dont respond well
its tedious to make your mechs and maintain them
when damage is done to them you must repair them because you cant continue the game otherwiseits bad enough this game had to be released for the ps
the very idea that people will buy this at launch makes me very very sad
this is not worth paying for a  system and you should let this game collect dust on the shelf of your local game retailerthe guitar controller that came with this game is a piece of junk
right out of the package the strum bar didnt work when strummed down
only when strummed up
needless to say its being returned
not really worth the price if you ask methere is an insert original disc error on install however there is only one disc
the game is no longer supported sadlyi wouldnt recommend this pad
the right sensor must be too big because it drags down to the x square button and i get random misses with the right
even after modding taping to dense foam i still cant play with this pad even with the controller setting set to off
the triangle  square buttons still go off unfortunately
i need a pad with no square or triangle button just x and o
i guess thats the price you pay for getting a universal pad
should stick to psx pads only
fyi my old soft pad a cheap soft pad from walmart after modding lasted me over three years while this pad lasted for two days
its back to the arcade now
with an accurate metal paddo not buy this
you can download the files for a boot disc from the internet this is not illegal the developer gives it away and burn them yourself to a standard cdr this will allow you to play any import that you would likefear not america you will play shenmue iithis is simple dreamcast boot disc
you can download one off the internet for freei will not lie
i purchased halflife many years ago and the game was very enjoyable
the problem is in order to play it you have to use this program called steam
steam is an attack on consumers rights to control and access the content we pay for
allow me to explain why this isi purchased a game and i want to play it online at my buddy joes server
no problem right
i can just load up the game type in joes ip address and have fun or not
this program steam requires you to contact the game publishers server to even start the game and it is too busy to accommodate the traffic
there is an offline mode but it frequently fails to work delivering cryptic error messagesso we have a completely unnecessary slow advertisementinfested piece of software preventing us from using our game we rightfully paid forthis is why you should not buy halflife  or any other game that makes use of steam
by purchasing these games you are allowing a third party to control you and dictate when you can play your gamei just bought this game used from an amazon seller
my advise is if youre considering doing the same thing dont
its a steam game
and as such the cd key has already been activated on steam
it is not transferable
in my case the key i got was hand scribbled on one of the cd sleeves and was a non functional number
so now what i have are five tiny frisbees or if you prefer coasters
their too light to be paper weights
needless to say the seller is going to get a negative review
i just thought that this in info
you can usei bought it sometime ago and was annoyed to find i needed an internet connection to install itwhile i finally got it back out i went through the steam nonsense but found i still needed to enter the registration code which is on the pamphlet but not on the box and not on the cdwell the pamphlet had managed to escape the box and after spending an hour looking for it i gave upso i took a simpler route and went online to a warez site and downloaded a steamfree code installationfree hacked copy which worked finei must say the the game is pretty decent  better than quake but not as good as far cryregardless im not paying money for another steam gamei bought this game because someone said it was fun for kids
well my twoyearold does like it even though he cant control the cars in the game
for a normal gamer this game sucks
the graphics is extremely crude like psone or even prepsone games
the wheel which holds your wiimote is sturdy but its not easy to steer at all
for one thing you dont really get a feel for how the cars steer unlike a real racing wheel
its also tiring to hold it in the air for a long time
even though the game set me back just  bucks i feel i wasted my moneythe singleplayer lasted me a a whole  hourswhen i went onto multiplayer i could login to the server but i would be disconnected every time i go to look for or create a matchafter a little searching online i found out they have shut the servers downwhy are they still selling it as an online capable title if it doesnt have online capabilitiesi bought this game and attempted to play it for the amount of mods available
im not even able to play the game the cd key isnt accepted even though it installs fine
i finally found a fix for the cd key but im still not able to play any mods or online
there is no support for this game through the developer
the stock game is terrible the mods are what make it anywaygot this thinking we would save but the kids call this the bad remote and never use it unless they have to
it works but doesn not work as good as the others
response is slowi am supprised by the high ratings we must have got a lemon or as another review says the ratings are fakeanyway would have bough more if it worked but instead will be replacing it with an offical wii remote i am not going to even try any of the other nonnentendo brandthings you dont need the nunchuk for super paper mario the games of wii sports excluding boxing browsing weather or newsthings you need the nunchuk for everything funlike vin diesel and pez highly recommendedas you can tell by the last  or so posts this seller is selling counterfeit wii nunchuks
which are made every more poorly than unapproved rd party accessories
besides the retail price on a nintendo made one is  so why would you pay more 
go down to your local store and buy a legit one for lessthis was not nintendo brand as the listing states amazon should have quality control on this stuff
does not work as good as nintendo brand
kids call this the bad remote and avoid using it except when they have  player and game play is not as good with ityou can buy this directly through the shop channel on your wii for 
why in the world would you pay an extra  to get it from amazondont buy thissomehow they are charging over  for a  points card
go through nintendo directly and pay lessowned since the release of the console and its still mint
the controller is poorly developed that i wouldnt recommend it to anyone at any price
the first thing that needs to be known about this controller is its awkward design
it does not fit comfortably in your hand at all
the rear button springs take a bit of effort to push in as you cant exactly just tap them
they are so stiff that you can actually hear the springs
the two analog sticks are extremely close together
youll be rubbing your thumbs together more than anything else and aside from all this the worse feature is the location of the attachment cord
it is always in the way since it faces you
this controller is the worst design i have ever used in over  years of gaming
the original nintendo controller with its square and jagged shape that cut into your hands after hours of play was better than thiswhen the classic controller pro was released i felt relieved and it should have been made sooner
if you need a classic controller skip this and get the latest version its worlds apart and all the features i just mentioned have been changed
the new controller features softer trigger button springs so now you can gently tap buttons as you play
the center analog sticks are further apart so your thumbs have space now
the best part of all is that the cord is in the back where it belongs
out of your way and off your lap
my favorite part about the ccpro is that it has palm handles and it feels so comfortable to use
the classic controller shown here is nintendos mistake
make the right choice and get the improvement with the classic controller proi specifically purchased two of these to play smash bros  i was informed that the normal wii controllers were not very good to use and that i should use either the game cube controller or the wii classic
i made the wrong choicethe biggest gripe is how uncomfortable this thing is to hold in your hands
it almost feels alien
is it that we have had some sort of ergonomic sensibility in controllers going back to the sega genesis or am i just a wimp
playing the game with this controller felt utterly and totally unnatural
also i am not fond of the wire coming out towards meanother thing that seemed out of place
to play with this controller using the two thumb sticks is not naturalgo with the game cube controller
i have never been displeased with any of my wii stuff but there is a first for everythingi have a small pile of games awaiting review so it is unusual for me to review on out of the order played
but odin sphere is kind of special
its been the object of a media campaign and a number of excited commercial reviews
so i think im doing a public service to alert potential buyers that this is one of the most overrated games ive ever played
in plain language its not worth the money even if it was freethose of us who have played valkyrie profile  or  will recognize that the ploy is borrowed
this is the story of the end of the world as told in the old norse legends
well not quite as they were told
more like what would happen if you put some scraps of norse legend a dash of bible and some other random tidbits in a blender
think twisted fairytales without the glitter
but the problem isnt really the story line
ive enjoyed many games where the narrative was even more mindless
the problem is that the gameplay is horrendousthere are five primary characters in the game each playing under some form of curse
all with abusive parents and dysfunctional enough to fill a library of selfhelp books
you get to play each one one at a time through the same exact settings with slightly different scenarios
there is a story section that shows how these paths interrelate but from the players viewpoint what you get is an unending supply of sameness
add in a fairly simple minded set of attacks stiff animation and balky controls and you have a pretty clear idea of the experience
in battle you also are likely to get hit with something out of the blue so add arbitrary outcomes to the listmoney is hard to find and desperately needed since you level up by overeating
if you ever want to be more than a complete wimp you will find yourself gathering seeds planting them and feeding them by killing opponents
and you get to do this for five separate characters
all to the sound of a minimal music track and a slew of rude noises
your greatest pleasure may turn out to be those accidentally humorous scenes where a character defeats a monster by repeatedly stabbing it in the crotchatlus usually does a better job than this
i find it hard to believe some of the ratings ive seen in some of the gaming magazines
curiously fan boards are much more negative noting the pretty graphics and the poor gameplay
save your money there are better games to playwas so boring
sonic colors  sonic generations  sonic unleashed  the great category
sonic the hedgehog   the terrible categorysonic and the secret rings joins the  waste of time being so boring and lamemy best friend played one round then looked at me we nodded our heads and i went up immediately and changed the disc tosuper smash bros brawl which is actually a game you should spend your money onbuy smash bros or sonic colors and give this one a passfor moms doing christmas shopping for gamers for sonic fans all a ya
trust me youll do yourselves a favorall the d sonics have been hideous
this game is no exception to that trend
sonic the hedgehog should have died with the sega hardware
instead greedy money hungry individuals drag what was once a great franchise through the mud in an attempt to turn prophet off horrendously made sequels and spin offssonic and the secret ringsis the worst sonic game in sonic the hedgehog history
the game requires you to holdwii remote controllersideways which only complicates things
there is a voice and subtitles informing you where to go and what to do
it says for sonic to do this or that and when i do it doesnt work
the controls are horrible and more difficult to deal with than being  grand in debt
i cant get past the fourth paragraphlevelstage
ive spent over  weeks trying to figure it out
its the controls
they suck on the game
maybe if the game was compatible with thewii classic controller it might have been easier to play
i rightfully deserve my  bucks plus tax back for this wrongfully made sonic game
whoever composed this game had no clue what they were doingive been playing sonic since the day he was first introduced to us sega fans
he came with my first genisis and ive loved playing him ever since
sonic and the secret rings was maybe the second game i had for my wii
the system was new and had few games for it funny it still is in the same boat
i picked up sonic because its sonic
this has to be atleast ok good right
i couldnt have been more wrong
i played this game for about an hour hating absolutely everything about it
this is not the sonic of past nor like the sonic of newer games
this game has no real free play
you cant explore anything
all you do in this game is flip your wii remote aroud and sonic moves forward
i mean this game reminded me of those god awful sega cd games
matter of fact it plays exactly like them almost
games like this shouldnt even be allowed to be produced in this day in age
pretty much thats it all you do is go forward with very little say so in how the game is played
almost reminds me of sewer shark for sega cd
i was so furious after i purchased this game
after spending  dollars i hated it within the first hour
eventually i sold it for maybe  of that
probably the only game ive sold after i brought it
i mean you really have to wonder why they bothered to make this awful game
its simple way to easy and doesnt offer any satisfiable game play
this is just an example of sega cashing in on the wii hype back thanheavy rock music jinni choppy graphics terrible camera angles difficult controls what could be better
not
really this game is sonic in nothing but the name
tilting an incredibly touchy wii remote to change direction may sound interesting at first yet this becomes infuriating after a short time
the heavy rock music really gets irritating after ohfive seconds
the camera control is terrible
plus the player is treated to the continual whiny advice of jinni assisting sonic
ugh
truly dr robotnik must have designed this game
what better way to turn people away from the blue hedgehog
he must have chosen to serve as a ghostwriter for the project subtly carrying out his nefarious schemes to undue his arch nemesis sonic the hedgehog
that is the only way i can make sense out of this titleif you wish to foil the bad doctor in his evil plot stay away from sonic and the secret rings
instead givesonic unleasheda try
there you will find a game that holds the true character of sonic
or if you wish for a better executed game in the sonic storybook series trysonic and the black knight
there sonic takes up sword and gauntlet to free the people of arthurs realm from creatures of the underworldryan robledoauthor of the aelnathanive been waiting  years nowi get the game and wonderwhich is worsesonic ridersor this onehmmmits gotta be a tie
seriouslyits that badwhen they revealed the storylinei had a bad feeling about this oneyeah surewe see sonictailsknuckleseggmanamycreambig cameos only
silverblazeerazorshahraand some othersbig stinkin dealthe storline is like thissonic is napping when someone wakes him upsonic finds a mysterious ringand shahra the genie of the ring explains whats going onshe tells sonic that she came out of the book of arabian nights
how boring could this get
nextshe says that an evil genie known as the erazor dijinn is trying to destroy the book so he can rule the real world
soooi wouldnt mind a genie in the real worldas long as he forces nintendo and sega to put sonic in ssbbanyhowsonic realizes what he must domust i type itsave the book
one less book in the worldthats fine with mehow about you
wellsonic and shahra enter the book to stop erazorsonics friends and foes play the roles of the books characters
they even go by the books names
as for the graphicslets just say it looks like a baby drew the graphics for the cutscenesand gameplay graphics are worse than sonic heroesid much rather be in the bathroom all day
trust meits more fun
even the controls are dumbyou can barely do homing attack without plumiting to your demisesegayou could have done so much more with this gamewow sonic games i dont likesonic ridersand now this onewhat happened segapleasebelieve meim a sonicmegafanthe megafans seem to be the only ones who dont like sonic ridersand this as wellpssonic on ps roxz my soxzits the best sonic game sega ever madethe game is very boring
i played it for  hours and it has never gone back into the ps again
the gameplay is boring there is no variety the response is sluggish and the graphics are terriblei had some nice memories of virtua fighter like a decade ago
so i decided to buy this
unfortunately it is very boringand the mechanics of the game are just very primitive
i practically felt like i threw away my money on this onethis game was terrible the gameplay was hard the storymode sucked the combos are terrible and its real boaring
this game was a massive breakdown after virtua fighter evolution that was the best virtua fighter game but this was a waste of time and money
the customization is not that good the player sucked the movement is a little to heavy i perfer dead or alive cause thats more lighter and the attacks are more eaiser then this trashy game
the training didnt help much just some attacks but then after awhile it was a waste of time being that its hard to even use the great combos the graphics were good but thats really it
theres no new characters there all from virtua fighter evolution the stages are the same and theres not much to do in this game so this was a terrible gamethis game altough it looks great its gets boring very fast i got bored of the so called arcades and versus and everthing its just not my type of game you fight and fight and just get enough  for sunglasses no story at allgood graphicsbad boring no story no online gets very repetitivewell i do not know how this game plays because it crashes sometimes in the game menu or about  minutes into the game
there are no patch fixes out that i can find for thissi todavia no tienes un ps esta es tu oportunidad de conseguirlo
la version slim es la mejor xq no solo es mas compacta sino de la ultima referencia capaz de pilotar todos los ultimos juegos nuevos ke en la version fat ni sikiera arrancabanif this wasnt the case i would give  stars only because it advertises that it changes red to blue falseother than that if it had worked  percent out of package and had stated advertised that it was blue led stand not blue and red  then  stars would be in orderbut judging on how my item came w two leds out of order i would say the life span may be a tad short which is why the item is  bucksbut you get what you pay for and at that price if my unit worked as advertised and worked  percent then it would be a great buy at that pricei spent a few hours on a friends ps before deciding whether or not to keep mine or sell it
suffice to say im selling
while the ps isnt bad at anything it isnt better than the  there are no ps games yet that can match gears of war plus my oblivion greatest rpg ever for the  is over  hrs
and i dont feel like switching just to
the sixstick thing is nothing more than a gimmick they added it late to try and mimic nintendos advances in controller technology
bluray blah who needs it
i dont plan on switching to hddvd or bluray ive got a billion dvds and i dont need picture in picture dvd commentary or whatever junk the bigger space is supposed to offer
i figured id see some real muscle from the ps
but i cant say through  games ive seen anything that cant be done on the  just as well
and for  bucks cheaper
with that kind of difference youre better off getting a wii and a  for the price of one ps
plus stuffing in a bluray means they are manufacturing them the true sony way for the last ten years the parts are too expensive and the loss is so great so they try and compensate with terribly shoddy manufacturing
i know firsthand since i got rid of two pss which were total pieces of junk never played ps games at all both stopped playing dvds  and one even started boring circular ruts in my discs
which ended up as a successful class action lawsuit against sony
at least ive never had any  problems knock on wood but i wouldnt rush out to buy a launch ps due to sonys track record and the percentage of problems that are had with launch systems of any type
better to wait  months or so or even a year or two for the price to drop
at  i might be waiting  years or so for the ps to hit a reasonable priceby then i will have played all the games on the  anyway all the top gaming franchises are pretty much going to be simultaneous releases thankfully
and ive got a wii soon and ds and gba for when i want to go a little nintendo happydont waste your money on an overhyped console in the frenzyalso be aware that sony has stated prices for ps games might be higher than  potentially up to  sony chairman
thats insane  is way too much as it is for any game that isnt called oblivion or gears of war
game publishers and makers note if you sell games at  only hard core crazies with lots of money will toss that money around regularly
but if you drop a game in price or really what im trying to say is introduce it at a reasonable price which isnt sellingex
lego star wars it may fly off the shelves decreasing your per unit profit but giving you a far healthier bottom line because of the much increased volume
a new shocker i went to walmart the night after the release and both pss they had on display were down
one was stone cold dead
one died in the middle of me playing nba  id wait a few months for them to iron out the kinks
lots of reports coming in about dead pss now unfortunatelyi tried to install it on my computer but i ended up just buying it on steam
ten bucks on steam and its the hd version
i wish i could get my money backworks for a month if you dont get a doa
after that the fans wouldnt start up unless i manually spun them firsti am a professional computer technician and have worked inside pcs for  years
i found the install to be easy and painless but the net result is disappointing
after installing the fan i pulled my sound meter out and checked the decibels being emitted
they were indeed down significantly and the fans light looked greatthen i closed the case and put the xbox back together
it was grinding
ahhhh
so i disassembled again and looked for wires that may be hitting the fans i didnt really find anything but i tried to clear what i could and reassembled the unit
again during test while xbox was open it was fine but when i enclosed it again it started to grind
i squeezed the back of the unit and it stopped
weird but okthen i ran under load  while watching netflix or gaming
the sound is  decibels higher than the stock cooler
worse my xbox experienced a red ring of death while playing kinect adventures
this leads me to believe its not  more efficient
i dont think its moving air as well as the stock cooler was and now ive opened my xbox  times twice during install and once for removal for nothing
bummerthe red light is cool
that is all i can say positivelygraphics and gameplay are very disappointing for a ps game
ive never been a k bball fan but thought ps might make it better and this was cheap
after trying it twice we never played it againall i have to say is rent first before you buy
i personally think its a snoozerwasnt able to play in my computer as it would not load
found that i cant rate as didnt play iti generally love golf video games
i finished both versions of outlaw golf on the xbox as well as hot shots golf on the psp
but this game was tedious and annoying
first the swing control was poor and imprecise
then you had to sit and wait while the computer took its turn
every other golf game on the planet allows you to skip this
i played  holes and gave up on this mess
this ones not even worth rentingall the way to the bank
ever since ea sports bought the exclusive rights to the nfl license madden nfl hasnt changed much except for the usual roster updates slightly more polished graphics etc
i wish that sega sports could still make nfl games because the nfl k series was the best football sim around
i would even rather play an old nfl gameday sony cea rather than this overrated pile
back in  madden nfl  lost in sales to nfl gameday  because it was inferior
the next year ea sports improved and went back to being the  selling nfl game
then in  sega sports released the breakthrough nfl k which destroyed madden nfl  gameplay and graphics wise
ea sports hasnt made a madden nfl as good as nfl k ever although they have always out sold sega sports nfl k because of better name recognitionmarketing
i hope that electronic arts exclusive nfl license ends soon in the next few years because madden needs competition like nfl k and nfl gameday to stay freshanyway about this game ea sports must have lost all inspiration for making a new madden nfl game every year because this game simply feels stale
the graphics are clean and smooth for the most part but the gameplay feels really slow and the controls are stiff and unintuitive
controls are the worst for kicking field goalspuntkick offs
if you absolutely need to play a new football game then i guess you should buy this lame piece since madden nfl is the only game in town these days i cannot rate the fun or overall experience of this game as it was out of stock and the order was cancelledget a better game this game has no fun at all looks like ps graphics and the cars are slowearly january  warner bros switch to support blue ray only
effectively signing a death sentence of all hddvd players on the basis that now most studies support blue ray
do not buy unless you have a hddvd library you need to support hddvd format gets a reprieve later on very doubtful or you just have money to burn and dont care
other hddvd players might still be a good buy because they still play old dvds and upconverts so as a regular upconverting dvds they may still be good although still overpriced update timewarner just went bluray exclusive likely the format war is over invest in a ps or a bluray player instead of an expensive addon that will be obsolete in weeksnot sure why would anyone buy this  external addon with the annoying cables etc
to watch an hd standard supported by less than  of the movie industry
netflix collection of blueray is at least twice as large as hd and my new p tv is not fully leveraged as this device cant display pnow between the cost of the xbox  the wirless option and the hdtv i got an expensive messy setup that is less powerfull and more expensive than the slick ps aside from the fact that a couple of my xbox games never worked in the first placei already put my xbox on sale and ordered a ps 
i also checked the new generation of ps games ie
motorstorm etc
they rock  i will miss my halo though i urge you to read the text that follows carefully keeping an open mind from the beginning to the end and without skipping around
i further recommend that you take breaks as many of the facts presented will take time to digest
microsofts lies come in many forms
some of there lies are in the form of deeds
others are in the form of intimations
still more are in the form of folksy posturing and pretended concern and compassiona small child really couldnt understand that deranged dunderheads cant even agree among themselves as to how deluded microsoft is
but any adult can easily grasp that this is not wild speculation
this is not a conspiracy theory
this is documented fact
my usual response to microsofts jibes is this microsofts crusades are based on prejudices and preconceived notions
however such a response is much too glib and perhaps a little vitriolic so let me be more specific
if youre interested in the finagling doubledealing chicanery cheating cajolery cunning rascality and abject villainy by which they may promote the insecure quips of the most inarticulate tax cheats ive ever seen before you know it then youll want to consider the following very carefully
youll especially want to consider that microsoft somehow manages to get away with spreading lies those of us who oppose them would rather run than fight distortions freedom must be abolished in order for people to be more secure and comfortable and misplaced idealism clever oneliners are a valid substitute for actual thinking
however when i try to respond in kind i get censored faster than you can say contemporaneousness
stand with me be honest with me and help me exert a positive influence on the type of world that people will live in a thousand years from now and together well encourage open civic engagement
well focus on the major economic social and political forces that provide the setting for the expression of a counterproductive agenda
im counting on you
thanks for reading thisits a great addition to the system but i do have a few bones to pick it isnt built into the system
this is bad because there are wires and stuff to mess with
it adds size o an already pretty big system
it wasnt the easiest thing to hook up either
there arent many good hd movies out there
i am not a fanboy but the blue ray has better movies
they both look great though
pricey
getting this bumps up the price to the ps price levelso in conclusion it would be great if this was built into the systemnot to many movies available for this hd player and is now history because of blue ray tech
hope this helpsbuy a blue ray player hd doesnt exist anymore
even if it did having a little one attached to your xbox is just a waste of money
it doesnt upscale normal dvds unlike a lot of standard dvd players you can get for about the same price now a days or blue ray playerswhy would you buy a player that uses an out of date format
maybe cause its 
microsoft is making a bluray add on now so if you plan to watch alot of hd movies on your  you might want to waithd dvd is losing to blue ray wait for microsoft to come out with blue ray and hd attachmentbuying this device right now would be foolish
the news that warner brothers is dropping support for hddvd and going bluray exclusive is the death of hddvd
you will only be getting about rd of all movies released on the hddvd format
being that rds of the studios have now firmly backed bluray there is very little hope that hddvd survives the rest of the year much less foreverif you really want an hd dvd player do yourself a big favor and wait about five months
you should be able to pick up this useless addon then for about heck the one studio the hd dvd has exclusive paramount has their biggest producer stephen spielberg saying his movies must come out on bluray
you have michael bay the transformers producer actively railing against hd dvd and promoting bluray
he was very vocal and ticked off that transformers wasnt coming to bluray
well given this warner announcement it should be coming to bluray pretty soon nowthis thing is useless
format war ended and hd dvds are near impossible to find
no not buy this
waste of moneyfirstly this thing is huge its ugly and its a waste of money since it doesnt support hdmi
if your  dies so does your ability to play movies
well and its tied to your  meaning in  years its just a piece of junk youll try to pawn off for  on someone taking a  lossyoure better off waiting a few months and getting a combo drive which will play hddvd and blueray
and one that will be around in  yearsbut seriously no hdmi is a huge deal movie studios can program discs to display at lower resolution when displayed via componentvideo outputs which could render the xbox  hddvd drive almost useless for many consumersand if you dont think they will do this look what the mpaa and riaa have done to consumers over the yearsi am not sure what people are cheering about i went through  of these and every one skipped and didnt work properly
then i find out i cant play a single movie from th century fox disney mgm united artists columbia pictures lionsgate starz and anchor bay video
thats  of the hollywood movies so i bought a bluray player which does play them all
no thanks this was a clunky piece of junk
if you have spent money on a good hdtv buy a bluray player
if you have spent money on a decent stereo system buy a bluray player most movies have uncompressed sound and sound alot better because bluray discs have gb more space less compression for audio and picturethis only works on some tvs
on mine the colors are all washed out
my tv is properly calibrated
if you buy this make sure  you can return it
i want to point out my problem is fairly common
i have a dvi input on my tv so i had to buy a vgadvi dongle
the vga cable is the only way to get the p
i will say that the washed out pictures did look very sharp
it upconverts dvds nicely
if i connect through component the color is fine but no p and no upconversion of standard dvdsupdate  well this is what i found on another site
looks like it ill never get a normal p on my mitsubishii have it connected by vga but the colors are all washed outthats not technically a question but yes some tvs expect pc levels  in their vga input and the  sends video levels 
the result is that a video black rgb  looks gray and white  looks grayer too
try to see if your tv has an option to accept video levels on the vga input if not then calibration can lessen this effect however your best bet is to use component input
it is not known whether ms will try compensate for this problem or if they do when that will happen
i wonder how many of these reviewers are actually using the vga cable and seeing true pupdate im buying a vga to component converter
ill post the results of this effort later
hopefully this will allow me to watch upconverted dvds through componentanother update
watched chronicles of narnia
upconversion through vga is incredible but still the colors are washed out
upconversion much better than my sony
sony upconverts to p
xbox player is supposed to do p on upconversion
also since installing the updates for the dvd player i cant connect to xbox live
get dns failure
microsoft blames my gateway even though it always worked before the update
anyone else have this problemalso i asked earlier how many people were actually watching p
after reading the reviews i see very few people areupdate found on another site i have it connected by vga but the colors are all washed outthats not technically a question but yes some tvs expect pc levels  in their vga input and the  sends video levels 
the result is that a video black rgb  looks gray and white  looks grayer too
try to see if your tv has an option to accept video levels on the vga input if not then calibration can lessen this effect however your best bet is to use component input
it is not known whether ms will try compensate for this problem or if they do when that will happenthe sony component cables are  and cover you under their warranty and are of the same quality as these monster cables or as any other component cable
dont waste your money
also dont be a moron and tell sony you are using rd party cableswhoa iam very surprised by this heaping pile of plastic
get call of duty or something else
the graphics in this are very ps ish
controls are good sound is ok i just dont think alot of time went into the gameit seems very rushed and incompletecheaply made game as usual
took my money for nothing
it has a very nice cover but thats it
dont be fooled by the coverim sorry but those that gave genji anything above  stars are either the games developer or havent played many games
the story and graphics are the only salvagable piece of this disaster scene and you dont get to enjoy either very much
imagine  with a stuck fixedcamera and only having  moves per character and you get this poorly designed arcade style game
it isnt exactly a sidescroller but it might as well be with the confined spaces and blind spotsthere is a reason this game is always on sale from amazon for  and you will be sad you even paid that mucheverything about this game is average
i know its just a launch title but when this game and system is so overhyped i expected alot more
the sound is ok the controls are decent but it just doesnt seem to have the quality of game im used to on xbox  i am sure this will not be an issue later on but i was expecting more from a  machine
i just hope the other games coming out are not just xb ports
let us prayi bought this as part of the dual pack and oh my god is this game terrible
i damn near fell asleep playing i just started shooting anything because it was that boring hopefully the resistance two i have yet to play is at least a little bit better if not im getting my money back and putting it towards deus ex or somethingthe story is poorly told the game play is painfully boring and lacks excitement and for a game that was supposedly the next halo it was a massive disappointmenti dont get the love for this game
lame is what they should call iti found this game to be a huge dissapointment
all i heard about was how good the game was and gettin it started everything was so repetitive
not to mention i felt like i was playing on the ps with those graphics
do not waste your money on this gamelet me start out by saying i know this game came out  years ago as a launch title
that means it shouldnt be compared to current fpses and by being a console release game it was most likely rushed
even considering that the game is really bad
ill forgive the dearth of voice acting the rushed stillpicturevoiceovers substituting cutscenes utter lack of character development and a narrative structure that rivals the literarycinematic masterpiece doom   what i cant forgive is some of the dullest gameplay seen this side of the th century for a game that the box cover says is rated  and 
these reviewers have been added to my long list of people never to take seriously againgraphicssoundsfor being  years old the graphics relatively good
textures are crisp even if it does have the muddy color palette of too many psps era games and the framerate is solid
models move a bit stiff but thats forgivable for the games age
aside from the female narrator whose voice acting is soso and the occasional troop chatterradio message theres not much aside from alien screams gunfire and explosions
its ok i guess but the game just feels kind of empty
that might be intentional with the whole mankind being exterminated theme but its not necessarily a plus in the ambiance department
either the main protagonist had his tongue removed before embarking on this mission or any dialogue he delivers was so immaterial my mind has completely erased any memory of it
with gordon freeman the silent protagonist is kind of a joke at this point
with this game its just lamegameplaythis is where the game truelydoesnt shine at all
it is trying very very very very very hard to be a ps halo clone and it shows partially rebounding health meter
check ai companions troops aka fodder
check aliensvirus taking over friendlies
checki trimmed this list back from about  items but you get the idea
even here it fails though
im not even a halo fan never played any of the games after the original but this game makes me pine for the innovative fps days of   aside from the graphics and stealing a few superficial elements from the  release of halo this game would be considered stale by mid s first person shootersthe fodder i mean ai companions are worse than useless as you generally only notice them when theyre actively causing you harm more than once i got trapped in a corner or between them and a structure unable to escape until the enemies did me the favor of killing them
the enemies all have instantaneous perfect accuracy as in they run stop to fire perfectly at you and run again
even when youre behind large cover they put all their bullets into the spot youre in and fire the instant before you break cover
this was incredibly difficult to deal with until you learn to take advantage of their ai routine ie learning theres always exactly  seconds between their volleys etc then it just becomes tedious as even the standard enemy youll face s of thousands of in the game is a bullet sponge requiring  shotssome of the alien weapons in this game are neat but hardly enough to make the game worth playing
its compounded by the face that for the first halfthird of the game you only get one to play with and its not that good in the context of the gameto summarize the game is terrible
this is one of the few games i can honestly say im sorry to have forced myself to play
if youve played any first person shooter since about  youve played a much better game
steer clear of thisi played resistance for  minutes at a motor cycle convention i was glad when i was done
the game has a very simple and narrow track feel
dull enemies shoot and clamer at you as they try to eat you or something
so it was a surprise to me when i saw this game rated at four and a half stars which is higher than both the rainbow vegas as well as mw bad company
i like a lot of video games but this one is not included in that roster
so why the high rating
whyi would give this game  or  stars but i thought id give it one to counteract the fallacy of this games qualityfair warning recently this game was purchased by sony online entertainment and most of the original developers fired because of poor sales and low subscriptions
this game may be discontinued in the near future so keep that in mind if you are considering buying this product
vanguard was a very hyped up game that turned out to be a sour lemoni know the title sounds pretty extreme but i do not want to leave any doubts about this game
ill be short with my points as there are too many problems to go in to depththe game renderer is severely buggy
animation stops characters disappear surfaces flash and disappear
sound stops and pops keyboard input is lost for seconds at a time
no driver updates on my system changed this its a quad xeon with a mb video card and gb of ram very fast and uptodate
i get about  frames per secondthe design of the maps appears to be very amateur and are quite ugly
most objects have one dull repeating texture
the shapes of most objects are really unrealistic and aesthetically repulsive
either no artists were involved in its creation or there is something very wrong with the game engine that hinders them
i refuse to believe there are artists that badcharacter animation is really poor as if the developer had no interest in animation better than say a d title from   the player is animated in slow motion i assume to slow down the pace beyond glacialcombat is a mindless button mashing and timing exercise much like eq and its copy wow but even less fun to watch
the timing is roughly three times slower than wow and eq
it can take three or four minutes to fight one lower level monster and more than ten for higher monster
its incredibly boring
to the point where i lose interest and would ignore screen if my character was not in danger of dying at all times
there is no choice in fighting monsters anything two levels higher can flatten you in two hits they chase you to the end of the earth and run faster than youalmost no one is playing
literally
i saw three people after six hours of play and two of the the three there were very rude fanboys
none wanted to play in a group
there are no populated outposts just camp after camp of nonplayer characters giving lame quests
all the broadcast channels for player chat are off there is no way to find other nonlocal players to ask for advice or helpmonsters or opponents are spread out evenly so you sit there and pull one
then fight it then another fight it ad infinitum
until you can walk to wherever
all monsters respawn in a matter of seconds so the monster you just killed will pop up right behind you while you fight the next and attack you
in many cases they respawn immediately after dying
this game manages to faithfully preserve one of the lamest conventions of mmosout of the thirty or so quests i did all but a few were kill seven bears and kill seven wolves
how do the quests change later
kill twelve bears and kill twelve wolves a few seemed different but essentially were deliveries or bosses
there is nothing of interest in the world but assigned queststhe classes are just rehashes of every other mmo that came before
all of the skills i encountered were mundane
click a button and you hit for  more damage
click another and its  more damage etcthere are about seven monster models as far as i went with just a name change to designate what they are
a grey wolf kit wolf pup and whatever else are all just a chalky white dog model with different text floating above themthe day is seventy two minutes i believe so its constantly flipping from day to night as if the planet is suffering from some neurosis
this happens so fast yet there are no shadows so it just seems like the lights are going out
daylight is really dim looking on top of it all
of course the player moves as if its a seventy two hour daythis game has constant lag while the other online games i play do not
lag is also devastating
you dont go slower or have a minor hiccup you just suddenly have different health are somewhere else are dead
etcthe world is big and open and pretty much empty and featureless
combine the barren world with the horrid art and visually its like playing a noncartoon themes version of wow with even less noticable scenery
the monotony is broken up by rocks though
giant rocks all with identical surfaces that are shaped unlike any real rockscharacter creation seems to be little more than a feature to put on the box
its useless as the characters all look the same very ugly
the armors and clothing in the game stick through eachother and as stated above appear to be designed and created by an  an amateurit takes up to five minutes to log in because the launch utility checks all your files every time
once that happens  the game sits there with a drawing of who knows what its not related to the game until it loadsdeath penalty is harsh for two reason
you will die a lot due to the draconian control over your choices as a player you can not fight outside your level because its designed to make the smartest and stupidest player completely equal yet random high level monsters are tossed in lower areas
you will die when encountering bugged monsters that suddenly can no longer be hit or lose health but they still can kill you
on top of it all it costs more to repair your items than you will ever make
also you have to run back to continue your quest and all the monsters will be alive againthey charge money for it
it would be inaccurate to describe this game as not quite finished
its not really anything but the most rudimentary and broken beginnings of a poor game yet they are actually telling people its done and accepting money
maybe it cant be called fraud as a legal charge but its certainly misrepresentationso to be blunt
its bad
before this game i didnt think i could reccomend a game a sbad as world of warcraft over anything but wow is better than this game
in fact i dont think any mmo i have played before even comes close to being this badgame in general would have been good content would have been amazing if it wasnt for the hard core lag from the server they had a ton of technical issues all the time the game was rarely up on a server and when it was it barley worked maybe if they changed things i would try it again but as it is i wount go backwell to start things off i will list the pros of the game
i happen to own both nba games and k is better by a long shot
i have to say the graphics are great
the facial graphics arent the best but overall its very good
it shows some of my systems potential to my friends
secondly if you love blowing out the other team by  points its easy to make shots in this game
i shood  from the field every time on easy difficulty  on the next level and still manage  on expert
so if you want an easy to win game this is ithere are the cons
there is no player creator that i am aware of
kinda sucks because i know all my friends would love to create themselves in a basketball game and asign himself to his favorite team
secondly the gameplay is bad
playing defense is a hassle unless you steal the ball from the cpu which isnt hard at all
its pretty much impossible to block a dunk or win the tipoff on any difficultywell there are other features in the game which i never used but all in all k is the winnerpros good graphics one of few games to support p mini games are fun especially the shoot outcons ai is horrible
you can have  defenders in the lane when a defender gets burned and they just stand there and watch as the opponent goes in for a slam shot meter needs to be tweeked passing needs work
you can pull your controller up to the left and hit the pass button trying to get the ball to a wide open teammate and it will pass it to a guy behind you to the right too many slam dunks had  dunks in a row in one game limited number of set plays  on offense and  on defense no defensive controls expect poke at the ball which  of the time just gets a foul called on you season mode is a joke as welloverall one of the worse sports games ive played in a long time its a sham that this game was released in the state it is inmajoras mask stands above all other aonuma zelda offerings as eiji aonumas magnum opus of horriblenessmeaning if you ever doubted for just a moment that eiji aonuma was a horrible videogame directorcreatorproducer this is the game that should change your mind about thatmajoras masks game world and design utterly radiates aonumas total lack of charisma and incompetence throughoutfrom the goofy stupid moon above which aonumanintendo fan lemmings constantly scream is omg mature and dark
to the obnoxiously nasty remixed music of the legend of  zelda a link to the pasts overworld theme this aonuma zelda offering the first of far too many began the viscious cycle of aonuma becoming the turd in the legend of zeldas proverbial punch bowl and thus the zelda series began its steep decline in sales as it slides down aonumas creativity colon into the commode known as the bomba bin where it then is flushed and deposited in the septic sewer of unsustainabilitythis game is the penultimate game for non entities and aonumas fellow traveller charisma deficients to cling on to and claim is oh so great in a pathetic attempt to make themselves look artsy edgy and cultured as a result because wink wink reader they know something about majoras mask that we dont knowor so their aspergers syndromeautism addled minds makes them thinkyes indeed followers lemmings and mental defectives are majoras masks main audience ie hipsters liberal geldings guys who get barb wire tattoos on their biceps because they think it makes them look tough etc
those are the kind of weirdos that are drawn to defending majoras mask on gaming forums and making it out like it is the second coming when all it is in reality is eiji aonumas second attempt at playing game designerwell his first attempt with marvelous failed abysmally and his constant inability to learn his lesson and quit while hes ahead has unsurprisingly resulted in another sales bomb for him with this trash known as majoras mask which i am reviewing for you amazons game customers nowthe internet lames petition to have majoras mask made into a ds game has predictably and utterly not to mention gloriously failed because nintendo knows what i know and that is majoras mask was a dud when it originally launched thus its not like its suddenly going to light the world on fire if its rereleased nowoh the nintendo fan lemmings and nintendo damage controllists continually make their excuses for why the game failed ie theyll say that it failed because it was released at the end of the nintendo s lifespan and required an add on to work etcyet the truth of the matter is the game failed because it was a different game altogether than a legend of zelda gameit was a completely different game that simply featured link the setting was uninspiring and the npcs were bad as is typical of aonuma zelda gamesthe nintendo fanboy excuses for why majoras mask failed dont hold water because a truly epic game a game that creates a phenomenon like the original super mario brothers halo or ocarina of time for exampleit wouldnt matter if such games were released at the end of a consoles lifespan or if they needed an add on or both fans would move both heaven and earth to secure their copy and get whatever add on they needed to be able to play itthats the kind of motivating power true gaming phenomenons possess and majoras mask just didnt have it because it wasnt the game the true zelda fanbase were looking for at the time which was a true genuine sequel to ocarina of timepeople argue and even nintendo says that majoras mask was a sequel to ocarina of time as it used child link from ocarina of time but these damage controllists and nintendo simply do not get it get what people wanted out of a sequel to a game like ocarina of timewe wanted a game that continued the sandboxopen world exploration of hyrule and its themes and lore a non linear game world featuring hyrules forests fields and rivers lakes and lost woods ganon zelda gorons and the whole nine yards of what the true zelda experience entails just even more epic than ocarina of times experience was due to the idea that nintendo would learn something about creating midieval sword and sorcery fantasy adventure epics that feel so good to play they are damn near like having a religious experience and wed think theyd of learned as much from having made ocarina of time link to the past and even the very first zelda game on the nes but nooooo
nintendo had to put aonuma in charge of zelda instead of who they should have that being kozuimi and because of that this effeminate geekdweeb non entity hack jimmy fallon of japan pretentious egg headed left brained high iq beta male whose never gone on an adventure or taken any big risks in life who cant identify with regular everyday normal people has just got to prove his worth and show us just how creative he can be by using the legend of zelda ip to vomit out his second modern artart house flop disaster major embarassmentoops i meant majoras maskor did i
and the result just like his first game marvelous was a sales flopno surprise thereanyway ocarina of time fans wanted nintendo to take things to the next level instead of giving us garbage like the world of termina and its boring circular field and its incredibly boring and lame clock town and a boring goofy looking totally non threatening moon overhead and a closet homosexual manchild named tingle to mock true zelda fans with as kojima mocked metal gear solid fans in a similar but far less offensive way with raidennintendo please for sanitys sake fire this guy already or if you cant bring yourself to firing eiji aonuma at least switch his role in the company to something thatd be more befitting his skillset which in other words means he should be cleaning the corporate toilets or bringing donuts and coffee to people if not rice and octupus whatever corporate types in japan prefer for breakfasti like the books
at least the early books and im an avid video gamer so when i saw they had a left behind game i decided to give it a whirl
first of all even though my pc is up to spec the game has really long load times
the tutorial was beastly the interface awkward
the units people look too similar and have specific assigned genders such as no female soldiers etc
halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial i gave up
the graphics and the clunky iterface just didnt do it for mei think this series would make a better adventure game you know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations like those produced by dreamcatcher the lb universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment
particularly if characters could visit places such as jerusalem new babylon and tribulation force hqthe one plus to this game was the soundtrack
it was beautifuli assume they size the thing for an average teenage boys hands
well my hands arent small like that and i have to fight just to hold on to this thing and try to reach the buttons since they are not located for comfortable use especially the r l r l bottons
i was excited that they chose a boomarang controller early on but that fizzled out and were stuck with the same dinky design as before
microsoft needs to design one for the playstation i bought the ps console new about a year ago
im not an avid gamer maybe just a few hours a week
well my controller that was included with the console worked great for about  monthsthen randomly during game play all of a sudden the controller would act as though im rotating the analog stickeven though i wouldnt even be touching the controller
i attempted to get a refundexhange through sony but they were no help as i hadnt purchased an extended warranty
okay fine so about  weeks ago i bought a brand new controller from best buy
and here i am nowafter not even putting  hours of use inthe controller is dead
a few days ago i noticed it would not charge
and when the power finally drained it just died
no lights nothing
ive tried usb ports in my computers to try recharging
nothing
opened it up to expect the battery connection
nope
and yes i hit the reset button on the back
im very disappointed in the quality
when i pay a steep price for a controller i expect it to last for at least a year even more since i dont even play too often
and finally my stupid
mistake i had faith that this new controller would work so i tossed the receipt
dumbassehhh
oh well guess im off to blow another  bucks on a controller
im keepin my papers this timei wonder if they are dropping the price on these because they are going to bring back the feature every gamer has been yelling forrumble 
ill waitspend the extra  to get a dualshock these controllers are junk
lightweight and very flimsy
i dropped mine off the couch and it didnt work anymore
i didnt even get to throw it before i had to get a new one
why are controllers getting more and more expensive and more and more delicate
give me an old nes controller that can be dropped off a building and still work and i would be happyat the start the controller seems nice
its light and the buttons are easy to use
however after about two months of use the joysticks start to wear down
after about four months they are almost unusable
they are poorly made and cant stand even a tiny drop
and lets face it it is very possiblr
inside because i wanted to see if i could adjust the wore dwn joysticks the battery is just loosely hanging there as are all of the parts
dont buy this save for a dualshock  it is more expensive but its better than buying a new sixaxis ever few monthsi just went out  bought a new ps
i bought resistance fall of man  the total with tax was around 
now dont get me wrong i have really enjoyed the console  am excited about the new titles that will be released in the future
but what is ridiculous is how the console has three different external memory port formats
not one of them is for the memory card format for the ps nor the ps it seems like when sony was adding all of the other bells  whistles to this console as it has many it seems like they would have given it the functionality out of the box to support the memory card formats from its earlier generation consoles after all the games from the ps  ps can be played on the ps
why should the customer have to shell out an additional  for an adapter that will only be used once to transfer memory cards from the old game consoles
this is really just a trick to make more moneyive always had a problem with these companies charging me to gain access to saves on the games ive already paid for
i cant imagine it would have been that much trouble to include a ps memory card slot on the ps
just another chance to squeeze a little more profit out of us helpless consumers
the adapter works fine but it shouldnt be required in the first placethe first day i bought it it does not work at all its a fake console no wonder why it was so cheap biggest let down ever want to beat up the guy who sent it to me such bs when ppl write good reviews save ur moneyso heres the thing
i ordered a playstation from another website and it did not read my cd and made a loud sound when i turned it on
other than that it looked very clean and was in excellent shape no button issues or anything besides that
so i looked here and ordered this one
turns out i fixed the first system just by gently wiping the lens and checking the latch that keeps the try closednot sure how i fixed it but its working perfectly now
good thing because the one i received from amazon is  times worse
it looks beat up and dirty
it does not play any cds and the power button is very stiff
hard to turn on and offand thats if it even turned on in the first place also the controller had many button issuesnot registering when you press themstiff buttons
i could not clean or fix up this one with any luck
overall very disappointed in the product i receivedas noted by other reviewers the game box was poorly designed so that both dvds arrived loose and badly scratched
this reflects very poorly on microsoftwhile halo  is a must game for the xbox  the limited edition version of it is not
due to a packaging error the game disc comes out all scratched to hell
buy a different version of this game
you have been warnedi played the first halo and didnt really care for it
played a little of the second one and same response
i thought id give this one a try since it had hd graphics but still the same
this series just is not for mei would like to address the most malicious ones though
i urge you to read the text that follows carefully keeping an open mind from the beginning to the end and without skipping around
i further recommend that you take breaks as many of the facts presented will take time to digestwe must let bungie know in no uncertain terms that it has done inestimable damage to everything around it
those who claim otherwise do so only to justify their own contemptible conclusions
if we are powerless to make some changes here it is because we have allowed bungie to keep a close eye on those who look like they might think an unapproved thought
my vision that some day people everywhere will say no to bungies irritating roorbacks is an inspiring dream
unfortunately reality always awakens me and reminds me that ive heard bungie say that you and i are inferior to mindless lumpenproletariats
was that just a slip of the lip or is bungie secretly trying to render unspeakable and unthinkable whole categories of beliefs about power
the complete answer to that question is a long sad story
ive answered parts of that question in several of my previous letters and ill answer other parts in future ones
for now ill just say that it has been said that those who think that it has the trappings of deity should think again
i in turn claim that it is doing everything in its power to make me abandon all hope
the only reason i havent yet is that i believe in the four ps patience prayer positive thinking and perseverance
lastly for those who read this review i hope you take it to heart and pass this message on to othersgameplay sound graphics replay value granted this was a launch title so its old but people rave about the graphics which quite frankly arent that great by todays standards
there is quite of bit of tearing but no texture pop in
the textures are all kind of washed out im not sure if its supposed to be the style or not
theyre pretty but nothing that will knock your socks off
the level design is unimaginative and very linear often literally so and very repetitive
boss designs arent very imaginative and there is little to no variety in enemies
the controls get the job done for the most part though feel a little clunky sometimesthere are  different play styles listed in order from least to most suckeymain character i dont remember her name shes the hack and slash character and frankly the only one that should have been playable
her animations arent great but shes fun enough to use to hack through hordes of bad guys three different sword style you can switch quickly between and blocking is usually automatic as long as you have the same style selected as your enemy
this alone would make the game about worth at most about  bucks but sadly when it deviates from its hackslash course it just sucks
motion controls sometimes youll need to pick items or aim cannon balls at targets when you shootthrow you take on the first person perspective of these objects and control them with the motion control in the controller
if used a little sparingly these sequences could break the game up nicely
i found my motion controls worked fine and these parts were sometimes kind of fun
unfortunately these sequences can over stay their welcome and seem to be there to pad out an already short gamequicktime events if youre a fan annoying random quicktime events that go on for too long and flash too quickly and when you mess up you start from scratch then this game has to top your listkaisighkai this is the main characters younger sister and takes the game from ok to tedious instantly
shes a playable character who has a wackychildlike personality
she shoots arrows so buckle up for awkward sixaxis encounters with enemies
her segments rip you right out of the action and any enjoyment you may be having
she cant really defend herself and when you shoot it takes on a first person perspective during which you cant move then you have to shoot the approaching or distant enemies
these parts get tedious really quickly and at times youll be overwhelmed and die then have to play the sequence again which wouldnt be bad if it were fun
these sequences make the game feel like a slog you want to get over with not a gameoh and this part just adds insult to injury often youll be running around with this annoying twerp and youll go to shoot bam first person perspective aimed in the opposite direction it takes forever for this bitch to slowly rotate to the target so youre screwed  this happens all the time after five minutes with her youll hate her more and more every time she says something childlike
sometimes as a added bonus treat she gets coupled with quicktime events which take the game into suck overdrive these should have been stealthpuzzle missions which could have been fun controlling arrows to activate switched behind guards instead its the wrong play mechanic in an action environmentoverall its cheap if your curious i wont change you mind but ive been bargain slumming lately and this was one i was hoping would be a forgotten gem instead it turned out to bewell read the title of this post
this game makes the much superior yet greatly flawed genshi spirit of the blade feel like ninja gaidenalthough this game may be really good to beat it around  hours its not woth for that short time of fun i wouldnt pay more than this game is a non stop  hour button masher with a bunch of quick time events and terrible motion controls
sound fun
it isntthis game isnt worth the bluray disk its coded on
graphics suck characters suck story sucks gameplay is aweful music sucks and everything else that makes a game sucked in heavenly sword
not worth your time trust me
if you want to rent this because its short rent wolverine insteadgame play nothing like description it suggested something totally different from what it actually is game has very poor controldont buy this game
youll get halfway through it wonder why its getting such bad reviews then when it gets a bit more difficult youll go crazy
as the game progresses the controls get more and more important
the high difficulty to perform necessary maneuvers kills it
its a beautiful looking and sounding game its playability is horrendous after the first several levelsi do not hold seller accountable for this it was a brand new game still raped up
it would get to start menu and do nothing but play sound
i was going to contact seller but lose my paper work on this game
since that time i have replaced the gamepicked this up on the clearance rack for   and for good reason the controls are terrible
i mean flying games are hard enough with a joy stick
after about  days i just couldnt do it anymore
if you wanna try it out for  your not gonna really break the bank
but i would have rather got a bottle of coca cola and a slim jimi ordered this for a friend he never received itsincerelyira carmeljust for being a gb sd card with the logo wii on it should have been a lot cheaper than the price i paid for
was just looking to put homebrew on my wii u i have a gb sdhc but it didnt support it because the wii mode takes only gb and lower so i ordered one and i probably paid like  times more than it should have been
better off buying a sd card without the wii logo on it six disk install
wouldnt accept input from my logitech gamepad
constantly aborted to windows
update didnt work
update locked up pc on reboot chkdsk was needed
uninstalledhere are the specs you need to knowif you dont have every spec up to datethe game will not runp  ghz processorgb rammb dxc video card  reccommended nothing prior to ati x series or geforce gtsound card with dxc with dolby digital livehd space gbill say it again
if you dont even have the minimum requirements the game will not even startubi soft is not being helpful on the support page
from what people have told me even with the minimum requirements they have not liked the game due to no save feature the story mode and lack of real difference in weapons
this is from word of mouth not my own review they said nothing about any commercial issues but i will asksomeday i will buy a better gaming rig and will be able to play it
someday
i can play oblivion and dark messiah witth very little lag
i dont see why this should be so much more advancedfirst
the lure of the game console market has completely corrupted yet another great series
this game is no longer filled with the detail and complexity that is common to pc games but it has been dummed down for the console crowd
you no longer plan your assualts select your team outfit your team as you see fit
it is now a playstation shoot and scoot type game
those here that gush over how great it is obviously dont play pc games normally and im willing to bet prefer to play console gamessecond
 was bad enough with its billboard ads in the game but ubi soft has gone a step further
now if you shoot the right bottle you get a full minute commercial
a commercial in the game
according to the littature of their advertising department its a treat
yeah thats what i want a tv commercial in my game
i say dont buy this game
send a message to all game manufacturers that we wont pay for commercials and we wont buy console games that have been back programmed for the pca reviewer pointed out that this game was designed for console gaming and does not meet the usual complexity of games intended for the pc
i fully agree with that
different than the older r games such as rogue spear etc you dont plan out your course anymore
you basically just shoot your way through even stealth mean little in this game
the addition of the cover system completely defeats the need for stealth
you can run into a bunch of enemy back up behind cover safely and just peek and shoot
the halo like health system also made the game much easier
no longer will you be gimped for the rest of the level if you take a few hits
and you can take a lot more hits and recover fully again
so this completely destroys the r feel
and why not r vegas was not even created by the same people that did the previous r seriesso as said above compared to previous r games vegas has completely lost the element of stealth strategy and difficulty
this does not mean it has more action no
the game plays at an amazingly slow pace
for one you cannot even sprint or prone
you can walk run or crouch  you way through the game
throwing away what made r series awesome the new developers decided to retain one lame thing about r and made it  times worse
while the health system makes it so you can fully recover from anything you still cant be out cover for long
that does not mean stealth is important
the enemies can know you are there and most time they will just shoot at your direction
and heres when that annoying thing come in  if you go out of cover for too long say  seconds you are gonna get killed  thats the only thing that feels like an r game what this means is that you have to be behind cover constantly at every turn and every corner you will want to use the cover action to stick your back against a wall or a crate or something
this makes the already slowpaced gameplay even slower
it pins players down to the same routine over and over run cover peek shoot reloadrepeat as needthe game does offer different locations but the above described cover system absolutely ruins any scenery differences the levels have
for the most part you will find your character facing toward you
you will stare at him in the face and then the wallcratewhatever behind him and then a tiny part of the screen is devoted to whatever else that is going on
for the times when you actually do get to see the different settings it is not at all great
for one the graphics suck
vegas takes about  seconds on my computer to just start up  just going into the main menu screen which i do not understand why
cod takes less than  second
there are further loading times after you select single player missions or multiplayer
and for all that loading the game does not look impressiveat all
you can tell they tried to add a lot of colors lightning effects and such
but the whole thing just doesnt look real
your characters look like they are drawn by crayons or watercolor painting or whatever
they just look washed out
not tunning the graphics settings to the highest level can vegas come even close to reaching the photorealism that cod can do by just having a medium video settingof course the two games run on very different graphic engines but that doesnt give vegas an excuse to suck so much on so many levels
it does not only lack action
it lacks difficulty lack strategy lacks stealth and loses all of the rainbow six feel that its predessors have
the game takes about  hours to finish
but after a while you wonder why you are still playing it and you realize that the only reason you wanted to beat it was because you paid  bucks for it
face it there wasnt a real story at all
the characters had no personality and the voice acting sucked as well
you dont really learn anything about the character you control
cods  hour of the single player campaign told more about soap and cpt
price gaz and jackson and delivers a whole lot of wows and woes than vegas ever could dream ofnow the single player mode as said sucks
unfortunately the multiplayer part does not redeem itself either
the graphics look even worse online and the whole system is not well designed
the cover system makes the servers plagued with campers and with the developers trying to make this game as inaction oriented as possible you just dont get the kind of gun fight fun you get in other gamesseriously the people who praised this game do not know what they are talking about
the only reason i took time to write this is because i dont want any more innocent people waste money on this game
it maybe a mediocre game on a console with its peekashoot formula but its shallowness and simplicity and lack of any narrative content whatsoever makes vegas the worst pc game  has seen
rainbow six vegas does not live to half the expectations that one would have for what used be a great and unique series on the pc
now its just a pile of cow poopi bought this at the beginning when i bought my psp i expect something nicer instead of a bulky plastic that will only care for the psp bottoms
the case is too bulky to hold it down sides the grind wont hold down as shown in the pictures and when you add the  umds on the top holy it becomes a brick instead of a light gaming console
so my best advise is go for the stealth version its a bit lighter and is made of aluminium not plastics it makes it better protection that this bulky plastic casing
sides here you dont have enought access to all the ports of the psp so you have to take it out anywayswaste of money
hard to get in and out of the case
so much so that my  year old doesnt even use it because they dont want to have to try to get it out
you cannot use the psp in it easily either
try something elseqyep title says it alltoo bad because i was a fan of all bia games but this nonsense with recent illegal drm infctions has to come to an end  do not buy this game show ubi your middle finger as long as they support sonys illegal securomyou say drm  we say nothis could be a great game but i will never know as it does not play on windows  bit at least not minethis is a pretty horrible rpg and ive played most of them over the years to know what to look for and not to look for
while i had played the demo and liked some of the features ie sidebyside weapon and armor comparison with what you have on your character versus what you have in inventory etc the retail version doesnt play much better than an alpha or a cruddy beta build
graphically the game takes on a cellshading style atmosphere which may look interesting in a screenshot but doesnt translate to smooth game play
the camera has a low ceiling with which you can scroll out too and scrolling in doesnt provide detail as much as it obscures detail
the mouse controls are clumsy ie when you click the response time is sluggish as if your character has the iq of a rock your character doesnt respond well to way points and tends to charge off even when youve told him which enemy to attack the path finding is apparently mia as instructing your character to walk from one side of the screen to the other requires minihop clicks to get him there and the list goes on
i really did try to play this game for a bit considering what i had spent on it but in the end i uninstalled it and was left fairly disappointed
additionally i notice some other users had an issue with the copy protection  i can concur that this was an issue before i patched the game but after the patch was installed it fixed the launching issues for me
did it fix the gameplay to make it enjoyable
no im afraid notbottom line  looking for a more enjoyable and less frustrating rpg to play thats a recent release
check out titan questthis was released during the now infamous starfk starforce pc breaking rootkit installing copy protection fiasco
windows wont allow it to run
i tried with steam thinking they wouldve removed the stupid pc breaking crap first but no it still wont run
a leading female developer did this and i was very anxious to get a look at it
i imagine its dismal failure was due to exactly the thing that was meant to protect the revenue stream  idiotic copy protection
look idiots  you should know by now that criminals will always find a way
copy protection only hurts the paying customermaps are awful and the minimap is just as bad
the enemies are spaces on a grid nearly and they gain levels with you
i hate this because you dont get stronger and move on to another area with harder enemies  the same exact enemies just get harder with you
thus you could run around in circles killing zombies for  hours get to level  and still whenever you go anywhere the enemies match your level zzzzzi never did purchase one but a friend did and his ps crashed
when filing an rma with sony they asked him if he used a cooler or external fan
he said yes then sony rep went into this speech that these coolers cause more harm than good
i would stay away far far awaythe idea behind this product and the implication that doubtless drives many people to purchase it is that you need an external means of cooling your ps
you buy something like this because you want to protect your very expensive investment but thats assuming theres a problem with the console overheating in the first place
i dont believe thats the caseive seen these things played for hours at a time without a cooler and most of the consoles on display at local retailers which are on for many hours are not cooled externallybesides being probably unneccessary however the intercooler is poorly designed
the thing is bulky though maybe that cant be avoided
its terribly loud as wellloud enough that you may not be able to use it on a ps if youre playing it late at night with the sound muted so you dont wake up the family
there is a dial to adjust the fan speeds but even on the minimum this thing sounds like some kind of mutated hairdryerit has its own onoff switch which also acts as a master switch for the ps
if you switch off the intercooler the console goes off as well which could be a major issue if a game is saving or something
sleep mode for the ps works only if the intercooler is still on and roaring and you can forget about turning the pss power off from your controllerbottom linethis is a pretty poor product
dont let the fear of a ps meltdown drive you to get ripped off by one of these thingsjust leave the console in a wellventilated area and let the system cool itself off the way it was designed to doi have my ps in a credenzza with the rest of my components
although the cabinent has an open back the ps was still running hot and you could hear the internal fans kick into high
it was surprisingly loud
i found if i left the cabinent door open while i was using the ps it wasnt a problem but it tempted my kids to mess with itso i grabbed the nyko intercooler to help out
i read the reviews saying that i didnt need it but none of them mentioned that the ps will get loud when it gets hot
i installed it two weeks ago
it worked ok from what i could tell but it was really really loud even at the lowest settingthen it happened
it went nutz
the intercoolers fans started to vary speeds on its own
it started to freak out all  by itself
i wasnt about to let this piece of rap mess with my  ps
i repackaged it and it is going backtotal let down
i guess i will just leave the cabinet door open when in usegood luck if you buy thisthis actually came bundled with my ps i certainly wouldnt have bought itthis cooler is loud prevents you from really using your controller to turn the console on and off you can but the fans run all of the time if you do that and it might even be causing more problems than it solves
personally i would rather not have extra dust being blown into my ps especially since it doesnt seem to have any overheating problems to start withi advise saving your money and not buying this productmost of you have the gb or gb which doesnt have a problem keeping the system cool but the gb which has the ps emotion engine that runs hotter than the others gb only has ps emulator therefore it is strongly recommended that you have a cooler
my first gb overheated after about a week playing about hrs a day
the system just seized with my call of duty  game still in it
i exchanged for new one minus the game unless i went throught the hassle of shipping to sony and waiting weeks for a reply
at least for all you gb owners put your hand next to the side vents and see if it feels like a hairdryer set on low but hot
protect your gb ps as not only is it discontinued but is the only version that has full backward compatability with ps games making me the envy of my gb and gb owning friends
anywaysthe point is you really need an intercooler just dont get this nyko one as it is very loud doesnt snap on firmly doesnt shut off unless you hit the front switch and also doesnt allow remote play through the internet as the ps system needs to turn on automatically but the fanunless u keep the fan on all day cannot be turned on through the internet
havent tested other fans yet but i write this as i search for one here on amazonhere i was thinking i was going to be protecting my investment blah blah blah yet i seriously think that the stupid thing was causing more harm than good
besides being noisy i think that it was causing more heat problems by covering up the original vents and not allowing them to function as intendedthis thing didnt stay long on my system
it now sits at the top of my junk collection pile gathering dust
you are not really likely to need this anyway
save your moneywhy would anyone need a intercooler for the ps anywayfrom what ive heard the ps runs cool and doesnt have the overheating problem that the  doessomeone correct me if im wrongim about to buy a ps for the reason i can play games longer on it without it getting hot and not get the red ring of death lightsi owned this product for almost  hours
in that time it sputtered and coughed like an asthmatic trucker
after investigating the source of the sound it seemed that the fans themselves were the source of the sound and not from vibration or other sources
i double triple and quad checked the fit to make sure but it was definitely the fans
for  i would have hoped that they could have done a better job
they do get a plus for the overall look of it which is sleek and the nice packaging but a pig in a dress is still a pig
stay away from this product and find some other way to keep your ps cool in your entertainment centergood review by kenneth gardner kenny gardnerand keep in mind that since no one mentioned it product manufacturers supposedly do their research regarding their products
and in this case the having a fan blow above optimum levels of air that will most likely have dust flying all over the ps components is not advisableyou risk damage to the lens premature mustiness dust on the cooling fins etckeep you money unless an official product endorsed by sony that will maintain your warrantythere is no need for this
in fact it makes it worse because of the loudness and bulkinessill skip over the hardware problems with this product since everyone else has already mentioned them and explain the biggest problem of all with the intercooler  it is completely unnecessary
the ps has one of the best cooling systems ever put on a gaming system or computer
it has a huge  fan liquid cooling cables and an enormous heatsink that takes up most of the bottom of the unit
it has been out for a year now and there have been no reports of the unit overheating
there is absolutely no reason to buy this or any other external cooling system and this company is simply trying to sell you a product based on consumers fears that they will overheat their pssat first i though my controller died so i bought a new controller  then i figured out it was actually the cable that wasnt workingi am a shamed to say i purchased this game it was brilliant until after you kill  baddies using the glave its all the same old splat and blood only  or  close range kills that get old quick
guns sound under powered and uninspired
i feel that i have heard better sounding guns on the mega drivesome of the skills you unlock for the glave are fun like shocking people with a flying glave is fun the first few times but after that its same old same old
puzzles are the same one or two are difficult then they get easyboss fights yawn o rama just lately i am feeling that boss battles arent challenging in most gamesi am sorry if liked this game but for what it was made out to be just a waste of good game funds that could of been better spentnot even worth a purchase from the bargain binthanks for readingi really dislike this game
its short and confusing
the game play is a mix between a fps and a rpgwhen i got these headphones i was hoping for clarity and at least some range of volume within the headphones but the sound is somewhat muted and i have to wiggle the jack where it connects to the ds in order to get sound in both ear pieces
it could be just something with my ds but i dont think soalso i got the primarily so i could do the vocal testing in brain age  but it still cannot pick up my voice
the mike does work with brain age  so it could just be that gameim going to try the nintendo bran next
if that fail ill just use my mp headphones and just dont worry about the brain age vocal testslet downsorry turtle beach but your headphones blow the mic in the nintendo ds lite
we have three dss in our house
one for me one for my son one for my daughter
i purchased the kids a black and a pink pair of these earphones for their dss
the earphones work great sound great and the mic is fantastic however try your ds mic without the headphones after you use these a couple of times its shot
we blew all three mics sent all three in for repair but it wasnt until my niece used the headphones on hers and her mic blew that i made the connectionbuy at your own risk turtle bay will not take responsibility for the damagei have enjoyed playing adventure games like those by dreamcather
but the mystery in this game is when does something happen
i wandered the house for over an hour and nothing happenedmy first clue should have been that it took an incredibly long time to install its a single cd
it sat there and loaded into memory
for several minutes that i thought it had hung upthere was no progress bar or indication that it was doing something prior to installing
and if they were revamping the game to give it an alternate ending why didnt they fix such an obvious error as having the hotspot for the doorknob on the wrong side of the front door
they also talk about updated music but its not like it plays except sporadically so its not setting any sort of mood
there was very little voice acting except at the beginning and during a phone calli realize this is a pointandclick adventure not an fps but i expected something at least mildly interesting or spooky to happen
something to forward the storya clueanything
but it was a lot of clicking to wander the place open drawers examine contents
i think i found one item to collect and another one a lantern i couldnt use because i hadnt found any oilwhen youre playing an adventure all you have is the plot to keep you engaged
this game apparently has none and i dont see myself going back to waste more time on this
whats really scary is that theyve actually added additional contentwho wants more bad contentthis game for me sucksno hintsbut i do love the way u have to hold it vertically so both windows are used but i got to hotel lobby  have no idea what to do nextit sure isnt easy or funthis game is boring stupid not fun poor controls and the characters are not interesting
if your a mystery fan get myst or anything other than this
the only mystery here is why this game was made and who would have the time to waste on itafter playing through each game quickly and dealing with the poor controls of the wiimote in this particular game you may never want to play this game again
the game is cheaply made because the price is cheap go figure i guess the game companies figured this toothis game is fun for about  hour
by then youve played all the games  times
tank pool and hockey are the only games with any replay value
the pool controls are very annoyingfor me it was worth it because i needed another controller
im just glad i had that excuse because this title is not worth the price without iti highly advise against buying this
allow me to expalinlets lay out the facts awii remote controlleron its own is 
this wii remote  wii play game is 
in essence you are paying  for the wii remote and the remaining  for the game packed insince you could just buy the remote separately what you really need to know is if i want another wii remote should i pay an extra  for the wii play game
the answer is nothe wii play game is a collection of mini games in the vein of wii sports
the catch is that this time the games have far far less appealwhile we have logged countless hours on truly fun games like wii sportsrayman raving rabbids andmario party  it took my wife and i only about  minutes to play through the entire wii play collection and not a single minigame left us wanting to play it again
in fact each game on wii play reminded me of cheesy freeware games you can download or play online at cure for boredom sitesif after reading this you are still just dying to try it i say borrow it from a friend
no friends have it
ask yourself why
then if you still want to play it go rent it
spend  on a rental and discover for yourself that wii play has no rii play valuethis game really really sucks
you could get a used copy of this game for about   its not worth oo if someone were to talk up this game and try and unload this game on me at a garage sale or something then i would kick him in the nutswii play with wii remotewii play no remoteto sum this up the games are more boring than the wii sports
its just a updated wii sports
wii sports is fun to a degree but this is bad
the wii remote is nice but thats all you will ever use out of the box
so just buy the remote for  bucks and save the  extra dollarsmany people are going nuts over wii playit comes with a wii remotewoopdeedooput the wii remote aside and you have a  game
it is definately not worth buying
only one fun game exists on the disk and that is the shooting range
the rest of the game is quite terrible
it is better to just buy a lone wii remote
i do believe that wii play should only cost  because i frankly dont believe that the game is worth 
if you are looking for minigames you should probably get mario party  or wario ware smooth movesall the minigames suck
you will never play it the second timerival swords for the wii is a remake of two thrones  so 
why the hell not keep the same name ubisoftmechner
what a crappy thing to do with your fan base
i already owned two thrones for the gamecube and when i saw rival swords i quickly snatched it up without doing a little digging
i thought what any sane person would
different name different game
nope
same game  rip off
it was a very lame tactic guys
but i had the last laugh
you made no money off me
i bought a used copy
these kind of tactics however are despicablethis game really isnt that fun
i tried it after reading all the reviews on amazon and it seemed like it would be a great game  but really  its not
all you do is fight someone and then you get to the next level
theres nothing that fancy
if you just stand next to them and keep hitting the a button on your ds theyll die in a few seconds and then you just go to the next stage
pretttty boringi loved the look and feel of these  bought three in fact
unfortunately none of them would connect andor stay connected to my ps for more than  seconds
after trying some selftroubleshooting i went to nykos website and found their solution contact customer service
yay
thanks for that
now i wait and see if the  i spent on these three digital turds went to product design alone or included a  for customer service salariesthanks for nothing nykoit has good build qualitybut it has a very big flow makes it useless it is not sesitive enough for first person shooter etcex
trying aiming to the left if i press r a little bit left the controller is not sensing the move if i press a little bit harder i will move to much
i am now totally a loser in codi bought  of these controllers as extras for the kids to play with
the first one we had a week before the r button broke on it
the second one we only had it for  days before it broke as my husband was playing tw
we thought that because the controllers were nice and heavy to hold that it would be able to hold up better than thatit looks like im not the only reviewer to have problems with thesei saw them on sale so i thought why not pick one up in case i need another controller or two for a multiplayer gamehowever i havent gotten it to work
ive followed the instructions but the controller wont hook up with the playstation  console even after getting a full chargeive bought rd party controllers for multiple game systems before including the playstation   this is the first one ive found that doesnt workavoid theseso right out of plastic bag i notice something wrong
the cable wont even fit into the vita correctly
its way too bigthe little hooks that hold the charger into the vita barely move so when you try to put it intake it out itll get stuck
to fix this i pushed in the hooks with enough pressure to let it inthe cable after i fit it in works fine
it connected to my pc like a normal one would
like i said theres still the problem of getting the cable into your vitanevermind
this is definitely a do not buy
right as i plug in the ac adapter into my power cord to test charging my vita my vita starts to have issues
i couldnt unlock the screen
i thought it was just a glitch so i turned it off and powered it back on
hmm the touch screen and controls werent working
take out the ac adapter oh its working fine
on the livearea screen put ac adapter back in instantly there are touchscreen syncing issues
ill touch the screen and itll open an app with so much lagthe wii is incredibly simplistic graphicswise and i found no practical perceivable improvement by using this cable
i mean the miis are round stylized bodies without legs
i think my super nintendo had higher graphics than this
this cable is like having hd water  it just doesnt make any sensei can never get the wii remotes to sit in this correctly
i have had it for three years just have given up on trying to balance it in the cradle right for it to keep a connection to the back to charge itdont take this the wrong way for this is not about the battery performance
the batteries actually work fine and last a reasonable amount of time
its the charger itself that i hate
for starters i would like to praise nyko for its accomplishment they created the first device ive seen that refuses to do its own job
when i insert the remote the light will turn blue for a moment and then instantly turns green indicating that it is done
but when i used the remote the very first time it did that i realized that it did not charge the battery at alli found that you have to insert the remote multiple times and actually supervise the damn thing for a whole minute to ensure that its charging properly
there are times when the device doesnt acknowledge the remote at all
i have better things to do than supervise a lazy battery charger
but now that we have duracell rechargeables we no longer need the piece of  and now if i could i would sell this on ebay
but as im underaged i may have to do the next best thing and put this piece of garbage in a junk heap
where it belongs
so long story short dont even think about buying this for your wiii love rechargeable battery packs but either the charger or the batteries that i got seem to stop charging too early
when i start charging on at least one of the packs the little done charging light turns green just a few seconds later and stops charging
i checked on my wii to make sure it was charged but it is not the think conks out in less than thirty minutes
that just wont fly for a power gamer like mefailfor the first few days this product worked just great
then we noticed a problem with the left charger station
we thought perhaps we were placing the controller on it incorrectly however after some experimentation we learned otherwise
trying the right charger station we found we were able to easily charge any remote but continued to struggle with the left stationwe ended up calling and emailing the manufacturer
after a week of callingemailing weve given up
they simply will not return your calls
ive spoken with others who have purchased the product and im hearing similar problemsim sure some people have had a good experience with the product however weve returned it and are purchasing the other one which doesnt require the sleeves to be removed to charge
well see if it works better or notmy family is very disappointed with this company and their refusal to resolve the problem with their productto realize these are a pos
got home just now to find these on my doorstep
i was excitedi opened the box opened both chargers plugged them into the wall put wii remotes in the cradles and  minutes later all blue lights turned to green
it literally took me  minutes to do all of that and these worthless chargers went from blue leds means charging in progress to green leds meaning fully charged in  minutes
i messed with them for  minutes trying to get em to stay blue and actually charge the dead batteriesnopeworthless chargers or batteries
after looking at mostly positive reviews i figured id take a chance on theseshame on mewas good while it lasted but after about three or four months of use it just gave up the ghost and stopped working altogether
no idea why but we tossed it and purchased a different charger
wish it had a longer lifewe are now on our rd set
every  months or so either the batteries stop charging or the cradle stops working
yes we know you have to push the controllers in carefully and yes our kinds know how to be careful with their precious wiiall i can say is that this is not build to last and client service at nyko is nonexistent
every time we ended up contacting amazon in the endjunk junk junkupdate after  months our rd set has lasted but we have noticed a sharp decline in battery output ie
the remotes run on empty very quickly now
we ended up going to an online battery retailer and bout  mah batteries and a  hr charger for a measly  should have done that months agoi was able to purchase this as an assecory when i bought my wii
it lasted about two days and then the little metal piece that charges the battery broke off
another thing is the charger has a red led light and when trying to unplug it you cant really look at it it hurts my eyes
i have three wiimotes and the battery pack doesnt really fit skins because of its tight grip another thing it takes a long time to charge and dosent last long
nyko is an okay product maker
but watch out what you buyfind every other onestar rating  there is a recurring consistency here
the problems may not start the day you buy it but this product is trashthis sensor bar is horrible
its the worse most frustrating piece of technology ive ever owned
to start it uses  prehistoric double a batteries and it consumes the  batteries at a ridiculously alarming rate
another con is this sensor bar doesnt actually turn off even though theres a power button its rhetoric and very very inconvenient having to remove all  batteries from the sensor to turn it off
yes all  this junk somehow some way manages to kill itself even if the incorrect amount of batteries is in place
it doesnt work from far away yes ive played with the sensor settings the hand mouse on the screen shakes making it hard to confirm tasks
its overpriced
there is absolutely positively no pros to owning this monumental overpriced piece of crap
do yourself a favor save  buying a wired sensor thats dependable which will also save you hundreds of dollars in batteries and frustration
dont risk it or else i told you sothis was the worst wirless device i have ever purchased
it was right next to the wireless router and still it woudl not poick it up
the sensor would not connect with the controllers
i ended up throwing it away and buying a plugged in one  a million times betteri did not notice any difference on my  lcd from  away
it sucked the life out of my batteries twice
i must have left it on
the warning sound goes off after one or two hours but when you get playing you forget all about it
the blue led light on the front is so bright i had to cover part of it up with electrical tapese si ke la hizo otra vez mostrando un ff un tanto diferente pero conservando el espiritu de la saga ke tanto gusta a muchos
a mi me encanta sobre todo con esta version de coleccionista ke viene siendo un a para el juego mismoi have a lovehate relationship with saitek  their products when they work are good but when they dont expect lousy support
actually i take that back  weve moved into a hatehate more relationshipthis expensive piece of garbage doesnt work
the software provided installs the driver and the programming software provided allows you to program your control
except it doesnt  the programming software opens dat files which are the files that define the functions of your joysticks functions
or do they
the new pro version uses a file called pr
apparently the significantly cheaper nonpro version uses dat files
oh goody punish me for spending morethe disk that came it the package clearly labeled saitek x pro doesnt let me edit pr files only dat files
and the saitek website offers nothing in the way of preconfigured drivers  no premade profiles so youre gonna have to program it yourself
so today i spent the day reading manuals cursing searching the web for answers cursing some more attempting to get support from saitek cursing
im not a programmer and they havent provided me the tools to program even if i was so inclined
i just want to fly a even more cursing flight sim
like i have been doing for the past several years you horrible cursewords youbut i should have known better  when i bought an x from them years ago the box clearly said for pc  mac and i couldnt get it to work with a mac the helpful support guy at saitek snidely told me to buy a pc i told him where to go and what to do when he got there
in the  years after that incident im afraid support hasnt gotten any better  this thing doesnt work right out of the box
what really stings me is that ive had bad experiences with saitek before and i bought this thing anyway
never again  im returning this thought resisting the urge to run it over with my car is very difficultother companies make joysticks  i would strongly enthusiastically recommend you see what other companies are offeringi received the item and it was scratched which was not included in the description
i returned it and havent heard anything yetthis has to be one of the worst boring games i have ever had the displeasure of playing
its more exciting to sit outside and watch the grass growthe board game aspect of one of the game was stupid and took way too freaking long
i found the minigamesduels to be pathetically stupid
i played this game with my fourteenyearold nephew who thought the game was far more stupid than i did and i thought it was extremely stupid
i hated it
if i could have given it a rating in negative numbers i would have
i dont recommend this game to anyonechildren under  might find this game fun but i did notthis game isnt even worth anyones time or money
i excitedly waited for this game for my birthday to only find out i can unlock the games within  hours of gameplay and that most of the games did not utilize the wii remote sensory and advises people to use it as a simple joystick
also most of the games and stages are ripoffs of previous mario party games
even worst is that the computers in the game roll straight s or they land on event buttons time after time even on easy
the fun and challenges once present in mario party is completely lost in this game especially in the once terrifying duel battles which doesnt challenge the player nor is anything lost in the end that you couldnt get back within  or  turns
buy this game if you want something you can beat a  hours and torture your friends with otherwise dont waste your time
theirs much better games to play out thereim getting sick of nintendo releasing a new mario party every one or two years
the series has also been lousy and its getting worse
the graphics and sound are even worse than your typical mario party in fact they wouldnt even be worthy of gamecubes average quality
all the modes and minigames are boring
so far in this entire series no mario party game has been unique less and less replay value
i rate this game this is one of the worst games i have ever playedi currently own mario party  and  and i like them all
some are better than others but overall i like most of the minigames i like the game boards and they are fun to playthis game however is so awful my husband and i only made it through an hour of play before looking at each other and mutually agreeing that it should go right back into its gamefly envelope and never be mentioned again
it is just sooooo boring
there are way too many menus way too much time wasted on stupid things the minigames are horrible a lot of them consist only of shaking your wiimote as hard as you can the boards are all chanceno strategy and i felt like i was playing a game for a toddler i am honestly if this is considered a party i dont know what is going on in the gaming world
my cat could throw a better partyrecommended multiplayer games for wii that are a partykirbys return to dream landnew super mario brosjust dance tetris party deluxepictionary  udraw
happy gamingi liked the first ghost recon
it was challenging had some length to it and was a pretty good gameghost recon  is supposed to be allnew and improved with new features
its not
its not even worthy of having  in the title because its not much more than a sad overpriced expansion packthey dont even try with the story
the game is ridiculously short
i completed this in a few short hours
definitely not worth  bucks
since rainbox six vegas came out the whole fps scene has changed
save yourself the couple of hours it takes to complete this forgettable game and save the  youd spend on it
instead buy rs vegas and see what the greatest fps ever made looks like and its at least a very challenging fun and lengthy gameea you have really dissappointed me this year from  madden to baseball and now this
first of this grafics are merely ok the gameplay totally sucks the players move slow and moving rather sluggish even when u speed up the game i tried to like this game merely because i wanted to make myself believe i didnt just waste  bucks i put it in my  on several different occasions only to turn it off and pop college basketball k in
ea you can no longer live off of your name alone how about makin a good game
dont bother buyin this game if u must have a college bball game get kdo not waste your money on ea sports games
they have not fixed any of the bugs and never will
rent it and find out for yourself but save your pocketbook some cash
also try k sports gameshorrible product this thing killed batteries at an astonishing rate
i would not buy this having the  hindsight
 months battery changesthe remote is fine other than the absolutely frustrating fact that the stupid remote turns the ps on if any button is pressed on the remote
okay so whats the big deal
because its so easy to accidently hit a button because the buttons are so sensitive
everytime i sit on the couch or clean the living room i somehow end up hitting the remote and turning the ps system on
so then someone not paying attention turns the ps on by hitting the remote they leave the room and then the ps is left on all day
not good
i hate the feature just give me one red button playstation i think we can all be smart enough to find it
the remote is down right annoyingwell if nothing else its reliable
ive had mine for two years with no isssues and ive changed the batteries maybe once in that time even despite extensive useas a remote though this thing has long been a thorn in my side
the buttons are small and cumbersome poorly labeled and laid out
luckily im very familiar with the ps so its no sweat for me but for the nonps members of the family its incredibly complex to describe to someone how to usetheres no dedicated power button
every button can turn the ps on but none turn it off
i cant tell you how many hundreds of times ive accidentally turned on the ps with accidental button presses many without my knowledge and wasting electricity because i didnt realize the ps was accidentally turned onthis remote is practically useless with the ps web browsertheres no analog control to move the pointer around on the screen so you have to use the controller to navigate around web pagesthe remote times out after a few minutes of nonuse so if you need to quickly pause or do something with the remote you have to press the buttons a few times to wake it up to work againand because the ps only used bluetooth and has no ir sensor no reasonably priced universal remote will work with this thing
so you either have to buy an expensive multi sensor remote or get an ir to bluethooth converterhopefully these issues will be addressed by sony at some point but for now i hate this remote but im stuck with it
its better than using the ps controller but not by muchok so youve read a few star reviews that mention that the stop button is sandwiched in between play and pause
and if youre like me you may think to yourself meh thats not a big deal
however let me make two points here unless youre very careful you will hit stop when you meant to hit pause and you will do this often
most bluray discs dont support autoresume a step backward from dvd but i digressyou know what this means dont you
if youre watching a movie and the telephone rings youre gonna hit stop on the remote accidentally and end up back at the ps menu and youre gonna have to start the disc again from the beginning
this happened to me  times tonight while watching dark knight and if youre easily offended you would not have wanted to be in the room with me to hear the profanity that was spewed from my lipsi am angry at the person at sony who is responsible for the design of this train wreck of a remote because i know they did it on purpose
nobody could be so stupid as to do a thing like that unintentionallyi ordered this last week
shipping was extreemely quick
i was very satisfied with the quick delivery
but when i opened the package and attempted to use the cable it did not work at all
do not buy this was the worst purchase ive ever made
luckily i only lost about  or so
do not buyif i knew then what i know now i wouldnt of wasted time and money to order this cablethis cable has a max output of p because thats the max resolution the stupid wii can outputsure its better that i but its certainly not hd
hd is defined as p or higher last time i checkedanyway whatever you want to call it this thing only goes to p max not because of the cable but because of the system itselfvery lameif i had realized that i wouldnt of bothered so thats why im giving it one star and warning youthey should call it what it is a p cable
or a enchanced resolution cable not an hd cablethe cable works great and makes everything look amazing for maybe  minutes then the screen goes black
after a quick power on the screen is black and white and the resolution reverts itself back to i
i have used a friends component cable and can confirm that the cable is the problem since none of the problems are present with his
its a weird problem since if i leave it off for a while it suddenly begins to work again but the after the  minutes the problem occurs again
i do not recommend this cable since it has a lot of problemsbeware these cables
i purchased them to make my wii more of an hd experience on my tv except these cables didnt even work to output any signal to the tvavoid this productthis is the worst video game i have ever played
the plot is pointless and insulting the graphics are hohum and the missions are idiotic
i have been a big fan of the ace combat series and received this game as a gift
i was so disappointed that within two days i gave it back to the person who gave it to me to return to get something for themselves
do not for any reason buy this game
if you must play it rent itits hard to know where to beginhalf of the missions are impossible to finish unless you figure out some sort of gimmick
most missions force you to research them on the internetthere is no sense of reality at all
for instance at one point you are shooting into a giant frame of steel girders but you can only fire when the doors are open even though its just a giant open framework
there is a submarine that your weapons cant damage so you have to lure enemy aircraft into crashing into it
again use the internet to understand how to finish the missionsmost missions have a wingman and while you are trying to do your task you often have to keep an eye on the wingman symbol to keep reminding them to go and do something
its so distracting that it really detracts from the gamethe game introduces too many random elements of play
instead of flying and shooting some of the first things you do include tail gunning using a bomb sight and intercepting a train at just the right spot so that you can hover over it for several seconds
these might make nice diversions after several missions but they are some of the first things you do and just add to the random haphazard feel of the gamethere are several cheat codes available but if you use them they lock out the achievements
i presume the cheat codes were released to make up for how difficult the game can be
frankly people ought to be able to finish a game
publishers can certainly add some harder modes for replayability but its just ridiculous to make a game difficult to understand just to add hours of play
on the plus side the game rates your performance in each mission so you could replay them for a higher rating
also your rating earns prestige points that are used to buy upgrades
you might find it necessary to earn more points just to get the upgrades for later missionsthe game booklet is worthless for understanding how to play the game
it doesnt explain how to use some of the more obscure controls and it doesnt explain the map symbols
you just have to play and lose until you gradually figure it outthe plot is ridiculous
so ridiculous that its annoying
the plot is explained through voice acting not stellar but ive heard worse and artwork
fairly crudesome of the missions are fairly enjoyable as they arent all timed and dont all require completing a bizarre task
but far too many of the missions are simply repeating the same frustrating sequence until you figure out some gimmick that isnt explained anywhere except an internet post by someone who also got stuckwhen it comes down to the single playing of this game not worth the price
you have  missions and you go in an order in which you cannot choose
if you cannot pass the mission you dont advance and no more missions
some missions are very difficult to play and without a flight stick and throttle can be impossible
i give up on this game
i am sure xbox live play is differentthe graphic looks good compared to other wii games
however bad controlling scheme makes it unplayable
i cant reverse the car
the manual says press zbutton and tilt the nunchuck to make the car turn  degrees but it does not work at all
when the car i drove hit the wall and got stuck i tried every movements with both the wii controller and the nunchuck but it was still stuck
i searched the web for tips but none workedafter  days i traded it in
its very frustrating
im now conviced wii controller does not work with action games
i rented two other action games transformer and dragon quest swords
they dont respond properly to wii controller eitheri bought driver san fransiscoloved itevery aspect of the game is superbcontrollers are great and cutscenes are short like they should be and free roam is tightdriver parallel lines however is another storyfirst let me give you the prosthere is oneyou can exit your vehicletake another another or even run people over or fight people out of your car now the consgame play is terriblethe controls in the game just do not workz button is supposed to be your accelerate button but if you dont hold it just right youll skid sideways and the car will stop movingcontrols are just non functionablenowif you took the controls in driversan franssco and added them to driver parallel linesthe game would be unbeatableneed for speed would be no match for this game thensoif your looking for a driving game that works perfectly in every way and allows you to free roam and is just plain functionaltrust me folksthis is not itbuy  driver san fransisco for the best driving game insteadonly thing this is missing is you cannot exit your carotherwise it is perfectgameplayside missions and awards are numerous and i guarantee youll play for hoursdriver parallel lines just is an unplayable gameit shouldnt even be a driver gamefor ive owned every driver game to date and loved them all but this oneit is like they threw a car in itsome scenery and dark and light and streets and saidoh wellguess were doneno thought whatsoever went into then controls or the gamethey should definately redo this game with the same comntrols as driver san fransisco for a truely awesome experiencesave your money peoplethe red video cable didnt work
oddest thing the picture was fine except it was missing all of the red
after a day or so of trouble shooting i contacted amazon who decided returning it wasnt worth the  and they sent me a refundavoid
this is a cheap knockoff with a high failure ratepurchased this item to hook our wii up to our new hdtv thank you amazon deal of the day
as is mentioned in many of the other negative reviews the colors are all messed up
everything was green
we called the company and they are on back order so will ship a replacement out monday needless to say we are not at all happy
seems this cord has an issue as many people are having the same issuewe tried adjusting settings switching around the cords in case they were just mislabled none of that workedwe had been using the component ports for cable tv prior to today so we know those are not defectivewill update this review if and when the replacement cord arrives but until then i am back to composite cables for playing wii
updatenew cord did arrive and works finewhat a waste i really wanted to like this game
i played and enjoyed very much all the nba streets especially this isnt anything like that
i didnt even know this came out and i wish i still hadnt
its not fun and its nothing like before 
dont buy itdoes not stack up to def jam fight for ny york
in this game you can only create  character and if you create another character then the other one will be lost that happened with me
in this the environment beats you up for an example a car may spin and hit the icon world shakes kinda lame lame and another lamemy son likes this gamewhy i have no idea
lol i got it used for  or  bucks so no big loss  and i know the games old now
i just cant believe how def jam went from fight for ny  vendetta to this
the musics good
the fighting controls the build your own label story i mean terrible 
almost laughablei can not take this game seriously
its too funny the way the environments move with the music
its hilarious i just find it unbelievable that ea would put out a game this bad the controls suck so bad the computer always has the upper hand
if you can find this game for  cents and you dont have a coke machine close by to better spend this money its a good item to make your game collection look more full
it can be just like mine a decorationrented the game and glad that i did
if you enjoyed fight for ny on ps like i did and think icon is a new and improved version you are wrong
dont waste your time on this gamethis game is a let down
i was waiting for the next installment for a long time over a year
i would think any game in production for longer than a year would be at the very least mediocre
wrong
this game doesnt make it past unsatisfactory not by a long shot
as many others have stated the controls are terrible
i actually controled the game better with a banana peel and one of those paper fortune tellers
people give it up for the grafix
i wont agree
they are not impressive
that might be biased on my part because i read reviews that compared them to real life
that is my fault
the sound track
ill leave it at that
story you ask
not very good i reply
in the end this game was a waste of time
if i was the ceo of ea i would work on hiring a full time wizard to give people the time they wasted backdid you play def jam fight for nythat was a fighting game i tought that this one was going in the same way but ooh deceptionnot recomended at allthis game has bad graphics bad music and bad gameplay
the voice acting is horrible
the characters are horrible
additionally the font they use in this game is too thin and blurry to be seen clearly on a medium sized televisionthe only positive feature that this game does have is smooth controls
beyond that i can only say that the graphics are better in game such as when you are walking around the city or in combat than in the stills and conversations though not up to the level where i could identify it as a next gen game
the graphics for the conversations some of the cutscenes stills ect
are much worse
they are extremely bad lookingavoid this game at all costsi tried the game and after several weeks of interaction ive decided that this is definitely a game for kids
way too much slang definitions are off on too many of the words most of the words are not applicable in the us and those that are one would have already learn them in grade school
the pace is also very slow
once you have reached your peak in the game it basically stops you from going any further
i stopped at  and best time  seconds and thats it unless i can do less than the  seconds on each game it will not go any higher
so i reached my ep and learn a lot of british slang yeagreat mouse for about  weeks
if you are a gamer and log multiple hours on your pcpass on this mouse
wheel started to squeak early on about  weeks in
then it stopped working after a monthseeing that i only used the mouse for about  hours every day or twothe poor quality is unacceptablei was extremely disappointed when i played this game
save your money and buy ssx  because this is same game with a small graphical update less characters less slopes less gear less boards less options exept a new type of tournament and a higher price
they didnt even even add online play
nintendo basically recycled and simplified and old game for more money
shame on you nintendo you should know better
please dont let them get away with this
buy ssx  instead youll save a lot of moneyi might get downed a lot for this but its all true
anyone who owns or has played ssx  would know
i own ssx  and blur and played them both throughly so i would knowssx ssx ssx this is a pretty slicklymade game that could have held the promise of hours of entertainment
unfortunately i think they simply made the game too hard
although you can significantly ratchet down the difficulty on skirmish mode the difficulty on campaign mode is infernal even if you set it to easy a setting that seems to have no effect
im not sure if the game originally came out this way but at least as of the  patch some of the campaign missions are now simply impossible to do even if you attempt them several timesyes those people at ea are idiots
its the easiest thing in the world to program a computer game that can swiftly slay human players
what would be impressive is making a game that is balanced and which your average player has a fair shot of winning
as it is the computer never makes a mistake and never wastes any resources
it has no problem micromanaging a zillion soldiers and using all their special abilities at precisely the right moments
unlike humans it knows which of its structures have been damaged and sets about repairing them with never a delay
no forces are accidentally forgotten about the wrong unit is never ordered units are never mistakenly sent anywhere and in general all resources are being used to their fullest possible extent
efficiency of this type for a human is impossible since youre dealing with dozen and dozens of units and probably several bases
and youre not permitted to slow the game down in campaign modeim sure there are some people out there who have managed to get through the three campaigns without cheating but were talking about the kind of nerds who dedicate their lives to these games and play them for hundreds of hours
for the average joe you will not be able to get through the campaign missions starting at about missions  of the gditheres another problem too
this game is one of those new ones that installs spyware and monitorware on your computer to make sure you dont have certain programs installed that everything youre doing with your burner drives is kosher and that your game is an original copythe problem is that ea doesnt answer the phone when the game tries to call in to register itself which it does the first time you try to play it
it took me days to get it to work since i kept getting this game is not available right now
please try again at a later time or were sorry
eas servers are busy
please try again at a later time
youd think if ea were going to do this with all their games theyd have the foresight to set up servers that can handle the load of all their customers but i guess noti would also strongly caution against buying this used or downloading it
in the first case the serial number will not work since the previous user will have of course registered it he wouldnt have been able to play the game if he hadnt meaning that you will have bought a useless plastic disk that can be installed but not played
in the case of downloads they dont give you a manual  and this is one of those highly elaborate strategy games that definitely require onei installed this on a new computer with windows   bit ultimate and i couldnt get the game to work
i get an error message on my monitor unsupported screen resolution
i have a regular x monitor that as far as i know supports everything but x
i couldnt get to the screen to set options so i couldnt change the resolutionon my old vista computer it worked fine and was fun to play
just beware if you plan on ever using on windows  also other games work fine in windows  so its probably not my computer with the problemafter a lot of work i finally realized that the controller was not working properly
i bought an xbox  controller and the game worked
in the career mode as opposed to top spin that allows you to do or play in any tournament at any time this like virtua tennis severely limits your choices train one tournament or special event
the problem is that much of the time you may have in reality due to lack of cash or too low a ranking no choice and have to pass the whole month
it cost you to train but not to play in tournement
odd deal there
one odd quirk in the game play is that if you hit the safe mode it cant go out
this is just plain silly
on the other hand if you at an angle with top spin which in reality would help it stay in it can go out of bounds
the caveat here is that when you hit a safe shot the good players will usually make you eat it
the risk shots feel gimmicky and not intuitive
if you dont use them the  points can last a long time
since this is a rereview it wont let me restar
i would give  stars for fun and  for overall and  for aspyrs pitiful supporti bought this game because i thought the graphics were awesome and the battles were pretty cool
the games got a lot of dialogue and sound effects but i did not like iteven though i am an avid rpg fan this game is just slow and really palys like one of those popup books in a story you follow through with not many choices to make but to see where the story leads fighting battle after battlei dont recommend this game for new gamers or old ones
it was a complete deception for me
sorry big fans im hard core but not that hard core to the point of complete boredomthere are two to three games that i will buy without having played every year
pirates is not one of themi cannot stress the importance of renting enough to my fellow gamers out there
but for those of you that take the plunge and pick up this product may your shortlived enjoyment serve as a reminderthe graphics are mediocre for a game on a system like the ps
theres a buncha horses under that hood and they certainly arent being taxed by this
gameplay itself is weak uninteresting and repetitive
punch like this swing your sword like that jump like a goof by doing the other thingfun stuff if youre trading in your nes and stepping up a regular yawner if you left super mario behind in the eighties
camera angles quickly become annoying enemy ai is suspect at best the dueling iswelldullto give credit where credit is due the cut scenes are nice
ummyeah those cut scenes really can make a game worth owninno they cantthere are going to be another two hundred games just like this one in the coming year
games that have enormous potential and simply fail to deliver
if you love the movies and absolutely must play this game save yourself the sixty and just rent itit will be one of the few youll have returned well before the due datefor the price is good but isnt a good game for have a nice experience in the ps
not recomendedevery once in a while my wife will get into a video game
usually its something to do with harry potter or lord of the rings
she wanted to try out at worlds end for the i told her it would be dumb and stupid but she insisted
i bought the game on may  the day it came out for 
its now may th and the game is collecting much duston my next trip to gamestop this will be a trade inthe bioshock dvd installs a hidden rootkit on your system
there is no way to remove it once the installation is complete
the process will run forever and will cloak itself from your task managerthe game itself only allows you to install the game twice
ever
you have to have an internet connection and allow the game to phone home to get permission to playi dont care how good the game is ill passwell i was this close to buy this game after i gave a check to all the reviews here in amazon and many other web placesunfourtanely i install the demo and had to follow wombat securom removal instructions to make my pc free of thisis my pc not sonys not ks pc
if i purchase a home place why should i let the seller live in my house and do what ever heshe wantsit was a such good lesson to learn
my advice do not buy games with drm like the one that bioshock havescompanies should follow galactic civilization ii developers example
they have a better way to fight piracy than sneaking inside a pc that is out of their limits
google galactic civilizations ii copy protection and piracy and you will see what i am talking aboutthis game contains a virus called securom that permanently installs itself into your os and can disable your drives as it did mine and should be avoided at all costs
its a shame
i played bioshock on a friends  and was blown away
the cool retro s look of the underwater city and the music set over the dark and creepy atmosphere made for a great gaming environment
it has an original and thoughtful story and the endless attack combos and multiple endings gives this game a very high replay value as well
i was very exited to get this for pc as mousekeyboard is the best set up for a fps by far
i was crushed when i found it had installed a virus that crippled my virtual drives
removing securom from my system was a lengthy nightmare that involved risky registry editing that can damage your system permanently if not done exactly rightbioshock is a great game that contains a virus
buy the  version if you want to play it stars for a fun game star for infecting my computer with malwarebeware if you have an overclocked system
this game will blue screen
game also has very weak support for nvidia  series cards
in particular with high detail shaders which also causes the game to blue screen
i cant speak for everyone of course but i know that myself and many others have these issues still  and there is still no patch
these problems are highlighted on most tech forums including the k games forumnow for the gamemy first impression was wow
graphics were impressive albeit somewhat grainy as aa is not supported
lots of very cool water and blur effects
the atmosphere is somewhat original
has a ss art deco thing going
victrola playing in the background nazi scientists surgical theaters the whole shebang
that aspect of the game was very well done
the rest of it though i can only sum it up as sensory overload
like many games of this sort the suffering  for instance all the psychophysics eventually start to numb your senses and the attempts at shock just become tiring
the swearing screaming brutality and sexuality it all just gets boring after a whilewhen you couple all that with the really weird copy protection  this game is not worth the aggravationbecause of the copy protection used avoid this product to make a statement
it is a bogus system
limited reinstalls and securom features that are making the game crash oftenpos copyright protection means no salebuyer beware  the product description does not describe some important aspects of the gamethis game requires an internet activation so if you have no internet connection you cant playthis game installs securom on your pc  a form of digital rights management drm which is controversial  its like a rootkit and can cause problems with your pc
also uninstalling the game does not remove securom  it remains on your pc permanentlyi bought this not from amazon but from steam
ive tried on three different os installs not a single one will get past the securerom drm nonsense
the tech support is nonresponsive i cant return it im basically out  i bought it when it came outi eventually bought it again for xbox
although i hate playing shooters on consoles the game itself is quite fun and well done
not sure how to rate it though   for unplayable pc version  for a playable versiontake a look around at toms hardware guide as well as the companys game forum
they are in the middle of a very large drm screwup that is locking alot of customers out of their games
im not saying dont buy the game its a kickbutt game but make sure you go check things out so you understand what is going on and can avoid the problems these people are havingits not very often that the word brilliant comes to mind when i see video clips of upcoming games but this one had me wanting it after the first few frameslong story short  after reading quite a few negative reviews regarding incompatibility with some well known respected video card manufacturers i decided to try the demo first
ive had my pocket burned by a few dud games recently so it seemed the best thing to dothis game simply refuses to run correctly with standard video drivers
i use a very nicefast ati card  nothing yet has slowed it down even when set at maximum qualityresolution halflife  at max settings gives me  fps at least
heres the sour part  it seems that to run this game i need to download special ati drivers that have been made specially for this game
what
lets get this right i have to use specially bastardised drivers to run this game
how about designing a game that runs on all the major vid cards instead
anyway you may not be too surprised to learn that even after trying everything that was advised to run this  it didnt
just a screenfull of strange graphics blocks with soundof course i fully expect others to send in reviews stating that it worked on their ati card just fine
well they will either just be lucky that the special drivers for this game work with their particular ati card or they are employees of the company behind it upping the game if you view the reviews in chronological order note that the first  reviews give  stars for fun  overall ratings
mmmmm
due to an increasing number of games demanding sometimes significant upgrades or unreasonable changes in configuration im seriously thinking of buying consoles
there ive said it
for years now ive resisted going to the dark side but now that keyboards and mice can easily be added to consoles for game control i see no other wayout from this madness from recent pc game releases that fail to deliverif youre lucky enough to have this run properly the game does look fantastic to play
you lucky peoplewhat on earth is happening to pc gamingi was seriously considering buying bioshock until i read about the people who recently purchased the game and had problems with their computers
it seems that the company has decided to keep the drm in the game
why
the game is not current and im sure the sales are not too great
not a wise decision
sorry but i am not going to spend my money on a game that may possibly screw up my new computer
if the powers that be finally got rid of drm they would get hundreds of people willing to buy their game
until then my money will remain in my pocketi played this game on my friends xbox  and loved it
it was innovative creative and wicked fun
its not every day you find a game that is genuinely new after youve played a lot of games
the plot was well done the graphics wonderfully creepy and the weapons cool
i was looking to buy this game for the pc since i dont have a  and am utterly disappointed that the game is drm
it has limited activation
if i pay for a game cd dvd or what ever i should be able to install it where i want when i want
you cant play it without the cd so whats the problem
the only people this drm process punishes are the honest consumers who purchase original copies like i do
i would give it zero stars if i could thats how much drm irritates methis is quite possibly the most boring game ive ever played
not to mention it screws with your system and you can only install it three  times everlets keep this sweet organized and fairundisputed factbioshock will only install for a limited number of times it was  but  after a deluge of emails and bad reviews  it was upped to 
so if you install it you will be reluctant to uninstall once finished and will have to carry those gb on your harddrive for a long time
on top of that its resale value is down the drain the moment one pops the box openeven after the patch that removed the activation limit uninstalling still leaves behind certain irremovable folders that will make sure it can be reestablished in the futureso one has to ask even after paying  for it who actually owns my copyundisputed factthe game utilizes an overzealous version of securom 
they either activated all its available options or had a special version custom made
no other game company dared behaving in such heavyhanded way
this means that if your computer has more than one disc drive or even one but nondrm certified it may block them whereas the game may not even install if you are running virtual drives or have certain mediaburning software installed even nero has been known to be considered pirateware
disputed fact it has been widely reported that bioshock installs a rootkit
both microsofts rootkit detection tool and avg antivirus detected either the rootkit or its actions
recently avg was made to release a special update just for bioshock to ignore this alertin hacker lingo to take someones root means to insert a procedure that will allow the intruders to maintain root access highest privilege on the system without the system administrator even seeing themofficial bioshock announcements and their unofficial reviewers here at amazon will try to persuade everyone who would listen that there is nothing there so stop looking and dont even mention itunderstandable reaction since the existence of a rootkit would be a solid basis for classaction litigationweight the facts and judge for yourselfundisputed factbioshock effectively revokes our administrator rights on our own computers
here is what happens even after completely uninstalling the game there is a mystery folder that cannot be removed no matter whaton winxp it is located herecdocuments and settingsuser nameapplication datasecuromas administrators we could unwisely delete even windows system folders  yet bioshocks mystery folder apparently claims a higher authority level
what this folder does and why should it get placed into our computers so that we cannot remove it even as administrators is beyond me
and i for one do not appreciate it one bit
a quick internet search revealed a number of suggestions on how to get rid of it ranging from clearly unsafe to catastrophictrue almost every game leaves one or two folders behind after uninstalled  but this never revokes our administrator rights to delete themi do understand that there are production and publishing costs to get recovered as well as profit projections to be reached
companies that wish to protect their investment will always try to fight piracy
this is only reasonable and expectedhowever with bioshock as it is currently available by k games it gets way out of hand  well beyond ridiculous
no one in the gamepublishing industry seems to learn from past mistakes every security system eventually gets cracked and every online activation requirement eventually gets bypassed
so utilizing an overly intrusive inconvenient and possibly dangerous security kit only serves in penalizing the people who actually paid good money for their product  and manage to shoot their sales in the foot at the same timelook what happened with halflife  legitimate buyers still have to put up with activating the game every time we want to play  and of course valve paid the price unprotected hl had sold twice as many units as steamsecured hl ever did million and million respectively source the washinghton postsince i would never install a contraption such as bioshock onto my computer and wished to have handson experience before i reviewed the game i asked around and a colleague of mine had already made the mistake of purchasing it and installing on his laptopthis is not a bad gamethe environments are well designed and have a pleasant retro patina the graphics are very nice even though they do not meet the hype
they are comparble to older games such as hl not to mention stalkeryou see dark is not always moody and blurry cannot always be mistaken for dreamyi did love the music though
both the collection of happygolucky and bigband romantic s songs contrasting with the bleak environment as well as their smart timing added to the overall experienceit was the gameplay i was the least impressedtotally linear  as it is has come to be expected from any fps today i am afraid
to be fair i cannot imagine a single player holding a storyline without being more or less linear even freeroaming far cry did not escape this curse  but then again that is why i am not a game designer
and unless the publishers release their creative suffocation of the true game artists there is no hope for a worthy successor to system shock the controls are not hard to get used to if not they are completely remapable nevertheless i would love to have an real inventory cycling between which plasmid and which ammo for which gun can get pretty frustrating
fastnot that hitting your enemies does any good
for a game that is based on an alternative reality scenario and counts in immersing you into that world the damage dealt by the guns is pretty unrealistic
a doublebarreled full blast with the augmented
shotgun in the head of a generic splicer will not take him downand whats with the scarce ammo
i ended up using the  combo electric plasmid shock followed by quick wrench hits one picks up in the first  minutes of the game throughout because the ammo was either of the wrong type or too expensive or nowhere to be found
only at the very end was there an abundance of both money and ammo but by then they were pretty useless a fully charged electric plasma gun and some propelled grenades is all one needsand finally dying
regeneration chambers turn the game into a checkpoint one  and i hate checkpointgames
most often than not they are chosen in order to artificially augment the gameplay duration having us replay the same segments over and over  instead of saving wherever we feel like it
moreover when progressing you usually end up getting killed just before the next regeneration chamber and having to repeat quite a distance from the previous one whereas when facing a boss regeneration takes away all the suspense
keep respawning you will eventually get him his health does not increase if you doso all in all bioshock is a good game but not good enough to be worth its excessive drm troubleit is only a slightly aboveaverage game and if k games did not have the guts to publish it for pcs and is hiding it within an intrusive security kit it should have stuck with xboxeven bioshock designers acknowledge there is a serious issue with the security measures forced upon them by the publisher
these measures are hurting their game and so there is an updated version coming in the near future to fix thisdont take my word for it
google for ken levininterview and bioshockfixedversion and see for yourself
i tried to add links but amazon apparently does not allow thembioshock has it all securom  temperamental and limited number of installations overzealous driveblockers possible cloaked rootkits irremovable foldersnone of which is clearly marked on the product description
as it is it will come nowhere near my systemi would advise waiting for  months they will either clear it up or it will find its way to the clearance binsjust last week i bought rise  fall civilizations at war for  less than  months after its release  and that nugget featured starforce of all things       updateby now there are over
comments on this review pages    are especiallyinformative
over these weeks there have been numerous attempts to suppress my review with either negative votes that appear overnight in bursts  over in the last three days alone
or overly insulting comments  with my replies to them mysteriously receiving enough negative feedback to get folded as not helpful within minutes
the same happened as well to supportive comments posted by other customerswhen this was not enough a shady character who constantly changes her nickname managed to become enough of a nuisance to have amazon remove this reviewtwice
amazon decided to split the baby in half it restored but kept from the first page no matter the customers feedback
not until the introduction of the amazons new rating system was this review fully restoredeven after the partial restoration of this review amazons voting system is still getting abused in order to hide as not helpful comments posted by anyone else even remotely mentioning the serious issues of this gamewe can only guess what affiliation this individual has with the game publisher or securommy special thanks to hle biblesword  segaslayer  and to all of you anonymous friends who supported this review during the weeks the dark side seemed to  prevail and managed to bury it in the last pages  and continue to do sodo not hesitate to let them know what you think of their methodsbecause no mention was made of that by the manufacturers they get my one star reviewhere are the minimal system requirements so the rest of you dont buy a program that wont run on your system
internet connection required
cpu pentium   ghz single core processor

sound card  compatible with directx ocsix
gb free space on the hard drive
windows xpvistabyei so want to get this game
i loved the reviews and i have been very very close to buying it
however despite lifting the activations limit the game still needs online activation when your first install it
please please remove activation altogether so i can get it
i just cant bring myself to buy a game that i may not be able to install in the futureits a superb game and i really want to play it and add it to my collection
please listen to buyers who dont want activations
most of them are people who have been fans of the developer for years like meheres an extract from an interview with ks community manager elizabeth tobey who clarified the limited activations issue sayingour other methods of copy protection remain
you will still have to activate your copy and you will still need to keep the disc in the drive
securom has not been removed  just the activation limits on number of installs and number of computers you can install bioshock on simultaneouslyas i promised that the activation limits would go away i can promise that if we ever stop supporting bioshock in the ways you speak of we will release a patch so that the game is still playable
i believe as you seem to that bioshock will be the kind of game we will want to revisit    or more years from now
i want my copy to be playable just as you do and so does k
i know that elizabeth kindly promises to remove activation but i prefer it to be removed now
i just cant trust that they will patch this out as i have been tricked many times before by companies claiming to correct issues at a later timewell i had played through part of the game and im still in the process of completing it
overall ive enjoyed it and sometimes dreaded playing it
its exhausting game play where you are always on edge there is no up or down always looking over your back
in that sense the game is brilliant
the graphics are amazing the options provided to you in the game are entertaining and the overall action is fast pace one of the most unique and original games i have ever played except for maybe the fallout seriesbut after not having trouble installing or playing the game i started reading about some of the software protection issues that came with it
the more i read the more troubled i became
i dislike the fact that it had limited number of installation i still play  year old games at times when i feel nostalgic for them
in my opinion this automatically removes this game from ever becoming a classic
it felt to me as if this was directed not at the hackers and the freeloaders but the consumer who paid good money to play
why am i practically leasing a game that i paid  with tax for
there was no mention on the box for any of this including the different hidden and intrusive files and folders that i dont even know how to access or remove or even where theyre located or even if i will ever be able to remove them or if they will do anything harmful to my computerbottom line i shouldnt have this uneasy feeling about something that i paid money to enjoy
giving them one star is the only way i know to protest a company that mismanaged a good gamei can only say that it must be me and it seems that i must be in the minority but even though i have a cutting edge stateoftheart computer i had to return the game to amazon because i couldnt run the program past the opening cut scene
the graphics were horrible and controls was almost none existent
after reading rave reviews about superb graphics and original game play i was very disappointed
but like i said maybe it is just methe pc version of bioshock is the most drmd game ever released no joke
it runs a new version of the sony rootkit known as securom and will refuse to run if you have any kind of software installed like virtual drive software avg virus scan and who knows what else
it even refuses to run if you have process explorer running on your pc
thats right the microsoft product process explorer is some kind of evil big bad program that makes bioshock refuse to runon top of that you are only allowed two installs total
k claims that if you uninstall the game it will allow you to reinstall somewhere else but the system is currently bugged
after you install two times the game will refuse to register and you have to take pics of your cd and manual and mail them inim sure bioshock is a great game but drm is making the pc release a disaster
even the editors at pc gamer are having a hard time getting the game working with all the restrictions
if you want to play bioshock for pc you have to jump through all kinds of hoops and are severly limited as to what you can do with the game you purchased
therefore i am giving bioshock a one star ratingthis game uses the same horrible drm scheme that is found on far cry  mass effect crysis warhead spore dead space sacred  and red alert  i refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game
there are several games that i own that i have had to install more than five times for various reasons
that is why i refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times i can install the game let alone a drm program like securom that could be considered a trojen horseas a side note this drm method does nothing to stop piracy
all of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some like spore even before their release with the exceptions of sacred  and red alert  which have not been released yet however the developers confirmed that they would use the securom activation drm scheme
the only thing this drm does do is prevent this game from entering the used game marketto claim that this game is the spiritual successor to system shock is akin to claiming that doom is the spiritual successor to ultima underworldthe gameplay suffers from so much consolitus from the low quality blurry graphics to the console style arcade action you might wonder why they brought this console game to the pc in the first place
yes yes they try to claim it was co developed for both but those of us with intelligence understand that its a console game shlocked onto the pc with all the giant kiddy buttons taking up the screen and the lame controlsthis game does not feel like system shock or system shock   it feels like low quality consolitusi have a recent ati radeon video card in my dell xps gaming system and this game would not run until i searched and located a hack
even then very poor performance and artifacts everywhere
exclusivity agreement with nivdia
maybelol see its down to  now
still overpriced imodidnt know about the drm thing  great now i have to go scrub my registrystay awaythis game is a perfect example of the degeneracy that is causing the world to rot withinwhen people open thier window and ask what is wrong with the world
how did we get to such a lowly state
i will answer things like bioshockin case you dont knowthis is a game in which you can murder childrennot one or twohundredsone by onenot only thatyou are rewarded for doing ityou get better rewards for murdering small girls than if you let them goevery time you meet a opponentwhich is many manyyou are posed withe choice to murder the child or notif you dontyou get a tiny rewardif you doyou get the reward times so you are not only rewarded times  for murdering the childrenyou are encouraged to do soand some sick  actualy saidquoteyou are posed with a moral choicecalling that a moral choice is sick and disgusting beyond wordsand whoever these people are who are playing and enjoying this game should be quaranteened and either studied or put downyou want to know why people are so evilits because of garbage like bio shockthis is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game
i find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting
all games should have a very easy option
i suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficulti thought the rest of the game was great
because this was frustrating rather than fun i give it a  star
i wish i would not have bought it to pay for being frustratedbottom line is that if you are a fan of hostel or saw movies you will likely love this gameanyone remotely sane however should just pass this one byi bought this game as a combo pack with oblivion based so many great reviews on both games thinking i was getting a fantastic dealbioshock has got to be one of the most disturbing games i have ever seen
the sounds and music and random voices saying bizarre things throughout are unnerving to say the least
then add in the environment which is a total mess and splattered with blood everywhere
nextthe creepy characters that jump out at you from nowherei was caught off guard and startled into squealing way too many times for my likingi got maybe  into the game when i decided i was done
the mental factor of facing all that gore and psychotic behavior proved to be too much for me
besides which i have two small children at home and could not play anytime they were awake or aroundthe game play and storyline that i experienced worked well and i didnt really have trouble following the story or finding thingsbut the environment just so totally creeped me out i couldnt continueif you google on the article bioshock  overrated disneyland ride i share many of the sentiments
i just dont understand what game you reviewers were playing
it sure wasnt bioshock
i will try my best to not sound like yet another this sucks  kind of person
the graphics are amazing the spotlight lighting and shading is pretty advanced
sometimes the enemy characters are so in the dark they are hard to make out but their features look pretty believable
i also liked the big daddy character mulling around
the story itself is also ok a little different from the humans against the aliens shooters we are used to
but i am paying  to actually play a game not to foam at the mouth for eyecandyfirst the gameplay is just so amazingly basic  you pick up guns ammo plasmids and you run around the dungeon like environment as characters pop up or the occasional turret or flying thingy
this may not be so bad except for the fact that you dont really get to use your full range of motions
you dont ever have to attack somebody above you or below you
it is a basic forward shooting dungeon fps almost kind of reminded me of doom 
oh yea all of that is kind of pointless because if you arent strapped for time you can just respawn and finish off your characters without any real penaltieslets look at halo or gears of war for example
in halo  you might have to take out a bunch of weaker characters close up and then snipe the more difficult ones from a distance while using your soldiers as bait
in gears it is the same thing you are ducking behind walls corners so you dont get toasted by the boomers hoping your friendly characters might kill something
in bioshock i just kind of ran around clubbing people with the wrench because i never really had any ammo
i was bored to tearsnot a big deal but what happened to animation sequences or end chapter sequences
all i am getting is that silly radio message popup or maybe a diary message which i wont normally listen to
those arent very exciting and makes it hard to appreciate the storymaybe i am wrong it could be possible
i am flexible in my analysis of the game if you want to comment on itand i am only at  completion so maybe that other  is where the amazing part of the game is
i dont know
to be honest i dont think i can continuewow so apparently this game is a perfect  based upon some game aficionados
i had high hopes when i purchased this game  days agoalready im bored with it
as a fan of fps i thought a perfect  game would have me coming back for more
not with this game
the game play was short  dimensional and lacking a multiplayer that would rival halo
im sorry but for a fps game not games like oblivion which in my opinion is a far superior game to not have a multiplayer or have serious flaws with their multiplayer ala gears of war is a huge factor is rating the game
since bioshock doesnt have multiplayer i took it down  starsthe most annoying aspect of this game is when you play it on hard level
it takes a thousand shots to kill a regular enemy
it takes a million shots to kill a big daddy
this normally wouldnt be a problem if it was easy to accumulate ammo
unfortunately for a fps game you spend the entire time searching dead bodies and crates looking for ammo or money to buy ammo instead of actually enjoying the shooting aspect of everything
some will chalk to this up to amazing game play features but its retarded
its a fps game not a role playing game
what a waste of timethe same can be said for the powers that you use
you basically get to use your adam powers twice before youve drained it then you gotta scrounge around even more to find eve which refills your adam powers or money to buy eve
another huge waste of timebioshock would have been astute to have the eve recharge on its own so you can enjoy using your powers instead of rarely using them so you dont accidentally waste themalso i played the game on hard and beat it quite easily
i found the big daddys to be a lot harder than the final battle with fontaine the boss
he was so easy that it was laughable
what a lackluster endingi wanted to enjoy this game but for the aforementioned reasons i was more frustrated than pleased
be warned this game is a rental
do not waste your money buying it
you will grow tired of it in a hurryhere is what this game has going for it the story set up underworld city and the graphics are all very good and achieve the desired result
my guess is that this will make for a very good movie the plasmids powers while not being an original idea star wars
 have been mapped the best possible way to the controller and are a joy to useand  here is why the game fails terribly the gameplay could have been so much better but  in the end  it burns down to the  year old formula of finding the key
probably the most ridiculous task in any modern game makes its way in one of the levels where you do not need to find  or  or  keys but  yes twentyone
items in order to progress
while  of them are straight forward for anyone that played quake or doom or duke nukem meaning gamers with lots of patience
 the last  require finding randomly teleporting enemies
this is as much fun as it soundspurpose of any game is to entertain relax amaze etci decided i had enough and sold this gamedont believe the hype
look at all the reviews on this site that just blush about this game
they all seem a bit too well written ie
how amazon is known for selling reviews and promoting such great reviews for products with a lot of marketing behind themback to the actual game
my first complaint
there is just too much going on the games environment is way too busy
most games of this nature would introduce complicated aspects to a game a piece at a time
this game unloads more than a handful of new aspect game play plot structure up mods of which there are plasmoids and other such features of whichs ammo arent named the same but are adam and eve game mapping all in a matter of a minimum of two hours of game play
the map is just utterly confusing even with the arrow that points you in the right directon which it does only at cerain aspects of the game
to help on this confusion they have a number of diaries made to unlock glimpses of the plot to you
playing for about a half hour two hours in i ran across at least five
it becomes so over whelming to have to listen to these diaries to keep up to date on what youre supposed to look out for that they should have found a better way to incorporate them into the game ie
you have to find them recognize them asgainst the several options you have to search for  ammo money plasmoids upgrades health etc etc  that to see oh its another diary on the microscopic font on the screen and then hold down a and listen to it while doing everything else
additionally the setting is so dark  which as a mood setter is good but for game play is horrible
someone would appear behind you shooting a tommy gun and it would take more than a few seconds of gaping around before theyre actually found
at which point youve lost a good amount of health
then theres the vita tanks
the points where if you die youre automatically respawned with just about every weaponitem you had before
and if you were fighting an someone then the damage you had inflicted is still present
ever heard of that in a game before
neither had i and its there because if it wasnt you toss the game in your closet and forget itdid you play condemned  criminal origins
did you like it
yeah i didnt think so
in that case avoid this game because the fighting style is basically the same
nameless lackee jumps out from wall swinging wildly in that same clunky manner running in the same style
and youre melee attack is exactly the same
they may have well as called this game
condemned  aquatic surrender
thank god i rented iti have been playing games ever sence pongi have watched them progress over the years and am amazed at how far thy have camein overall gamming i would say the peak was from  untill after that the curve has been on the down sidei feel so sorry for the people who consider bioshock to be a great gameit is not even a good game compaired to some of the earlier gamesthe game play in bioshock is so repetitive it is like watching the same movie over and overafter a few hours the excitement wears off and from then on it is just plain dullas for the people who consider the graphics to be so cutting edgeall i can say is you must never have played far cry or oblivionthese games had real cutting edge graphics and did it with older graphic cardsi played far cry on a pc with a geforce mb agp cardit looked amazingi moved my gamming to x box because of drmsocial clubsand limited plays on pc gamesto me bioshock is just another doom clone with graphics that are about  years behind the timesthis game is awful
sure the graphics are amazingbut they are also great in gears and halo
this gamegot such a hype and for what
the story lineat first is great but repetitive later
i heardthis game was first announced  years agowhata waste of time
microsoft nintendo sony pleasedrop the annoying animerpg 
bring backfps and the superior hacknslashi was looking for the first edition of the game and found out that it was priced at  for the  versionnearly five years after it was launched
bioshock  is half the price tag at  with prime shipping
how is the older edition more costly than the newer one
and how is the newer edition half the price of the first installment
easy
they put mickey mouse graphics on there that says platinum hits
i purchased fallout game of the year edition a few months ago which is a more current game than the first bioshock because it came out in  i got that one for under  with prime shipping and all five expansion packsdownloadable contents
this one bioshock i googled to see if there was extra content in this platinum hits edition that justified the higher price and its the same copy as the original
microsoft and sony put these games out for more money even though it has the same content it has when it initially launched back in  you want the free market to work
put out the original game without the disney platinum hits sticker and lets see where the price point ends upthis product is sooooo user friendly
i think it is a horrible product and i dont recommend it
hate itthis game is terrible
the combat system is nonexistant
you just watch your ships fightthis is a terrific turnbased strategy game
turnbased games were always my favorite and this is one of the better turnbased strategy games i have ever playeda lot has been said about this game so ill keep this simple
if you like turnbased strategy games set in space like master of orion or its ilk then you need to check this game outsome personal feelings about the gamewith the space ship maker you get to build your own spaceships with all the parts and extra pieces you want
this is a really fun part of the game
if you wanted to create ships that looks like the ones in star trek you could
you get to create your own races as well
with the ability to create ships and races you have a chance to create something really unique
i wish i could get this kind of thing in a fantasy settingthere is no to little combat in this game
i know youll tell me that there is combat but in reality there isnt any combat
combat to me has to be something i have control over
i cant control my ships in combat they fight how they want and who they want with it all being automated
mind you i dont mind automated combat i just prefer to be able to control my ships in combat with the option of having it automated
rather than some kind of tactics involved it seems combat is just numbers behind the scenesthe ai
in this game is just fantastic
the diplomacy in this game is one of the best ive ever seen in a game
i always wanted to play a game like civilization that had great diplomacy and ai
in it because that game always had terrible diplomacy implementation
there is a lot of depth when it comes to the ai
and diplomacyi do have a huge problem with this game however
in order to patch this game you have to be online and connect to their servers
you cant patch this game with offline patches
it wasnt always like this
when i first got the game i could patch the game with offline patches but they now changed that
the reason why this is a problem is because i have several older games and if these games used this patching system i could never patch them today
all these companies are out of business and any support for them is long gone
so the chances of me being able to patch galactic civilizations in the future with its great patches is slim
because of this makes me give the game a low scoreoverall the game itself is great and i would recommend it to everyone that likes these kinds of games if you can get past the patching systemif youre uninterested in playing this game just by reading my review title congrats
youre not missing anything other than a bunch of open doors but you just close any open doors on your way out of the housethats all the game is mario closing doors with horrid cut scenes
the only bad mario gamei am mr miyamotoyou know the president of nintendo
this game is not licensed by nintendo
the company that made it stole my character and created this monstrosity to troll us
theyre a shell company of the evil activision corporation the makers of such duds as call of duty
please dont believe the lie that this game has anything to do with nintendo
thank you for supporting nintendo and all its real products
stay far far away from this fakethis is my third update in about three weeks
i want to like this game there arent enough diablo style rpgs out there but this one just doesnt make it
first off there are many many many bugs and glitches
crashes to desktop out of nowhere
slowdowns
stutters
freezes
character gets stuck in walls
remove and reload base game lose characters start again
repeatcontent wheres the dungeons
at the heart of it this is supposed to be dungeons and dragons sword and sorcery is covered but what the heck am i doing fighting crabs on a beach and frogs in a forest in hades
tigermen that look like tony the tiger and endless ratmen
whats up with these quests that consist of the beastie stole my stuff and went into this cave go into the cave kill the patheticly easy beastie and tadaaa you completed the quest and got  experience pointstoo linear
even with the expanded maps in the expansion the game still consists of straight line outdoor paths with a few really small dead end caves to break up the monotony
follow the edge of the map from rebirth fountain to rebirth fountain kill the small packs of repetitive critters collect stuff sell it in town and move on
endless repetition of areas tilesets equipment and critters
if you do encounter a tough beastie there are a couple run away get back to town restock your healing potions and switch weaponsnew skillset what does the new skillset have to do with dreams
its a pretty routine sorcery set some spell effects with a familiar which has a death raynice graphics but nothing originalcrafting and recipes why cant i pick and choose what items i want to combine into a charm
why insist on these bizarre combinations to get plus  to whatever and it can only be used on a bow or a shield etc
silly frustrating stuffexpanded backpacks caravan stash scrolls thankfully they added the caravans
but theyre not in every town so you need to teleport from town to town carrying junk from the vendor to the arcanist to the stash and back
to assemble a relic colect all the pieces insert in equipment to assemble then take it to an arcanist to remove the assembled relic then collect the various assembled stuff and take it back to the arcanist to complete a charmwhoever designed this mess needs to understand that i want to spend most of my time hacking and slashing critters not jerking around enchanting stuff
every town should have whatevers needed in proximity to each other merchant arcanist caravan etc
the scrolls are a great addition but they take way too long to rechargewhat they did right the skills interface remains excellent its clear organized and easy to use
the graphics are gorgeous despite the glitchesrecommendation wait for this expansion to hit the bargain bin by then theyll hopefully have patches up to correct the glitches
this expansion is not worth the thirty bucks imothere are so many negatives to this game and i dont even want to waste my time saying them all
this game overall is a ok game
the ai of your teamates will surely dissapoint as well as the last stage which is ridiculousthere are many many better games out there to play
if i wasnt determined to beat every game i play i would have cracked this game and threw it out a long time agono battlefield  the complete collection dvd  pc this was a trap  only multiplayer no goodno gooodbahdid not like itafter downloading did the activation key fix to get onto multiplayer but keep getting kicked by punkbuster
tried the forum fix mentioned by a previous reviewer but update fails every time
single player works but who buys this game for that
if multiplayer is your thing buy the disk version or even better buy codi purchased this game as a digital download from amazoncom
it worked fine on my mbp running windows  in bootcamp but when i bought my asus gjw the trouble began
downloads refuse to initialize now and avg detected a password stealing trojan in the amazon downloader agent
avoid digital purchases from amazoncom like the plague
instead go to the alternative water vapor digital service save  and avoid the no refund bs from amazonterrible game
doesnt work
simply put iti bought this game  years ago when i was  and had the same problem
it didnt install and was forced to play offline till i got so upset i smashed the discnow i bought it on ebay brand new sealed for  dollars
not worth iti have done a fresh install entered the cd key and when i create an account it says the email has already has already been used even though theres no way
so i retreave the account and it comes with the username dosel which i made for badcompany  for trolling purposes
somehow it brings up other games usernamesso i created a new username and email and it works but when i try to play multiplayer it says cd key invalid
so i rentered the cd key in the support folder called cd key or something and it said it was valid and i did it again
same problemea if you can help me my email is matttewelllivecomi have tried signing in to my ea member but the website makes me sign in with origin which doesnt run on this game so i have no way i signing into the main website and getting support help for this gamedont buy this game it is broken and will not work
my only option is to give it back to the seller and probally pay him just to get rid of this game that wont actually run to avoid further frustration
shame on ea and dice for making a game so hard to register and install
im really good with computers and this game just doesnt make sense
do not buy it it simply wont workin the time it takes to play this game you could actually pick up a real guitar and learn to play the songs
this is game is good enough for posers and people who lack the talent to improve themselves by learning to play an actual instrumentnote this review is intended for those who are already familiar with the gamei was so excited to finally be getting the  version guitar hero  as my friends have been borrowing my ps version for what feels like years but i was sorely disappointed because of two things audiovisual lag
theres apparently a known compatibility problem with this game and most hdtvs where the audio and visual components dont sync up perfectly  which for games like guitar hero is a death sentence
theres a calibration function in the game but this only halffixes the problem by allowing you to offset the controllers input based on how much of a lag there is
basically you have to choose whether to play where the visuals are accurate or the audio is accurate because it will not be both
i calibrated it so the audio is accurate but this makes playing any song i havent memorized difficult as i rely significantly more on the visual component
i went from being able to beat all the top tier songs  hangar  beast  the harlot misirlou freebird etc
 on expert to actually failing tier  songs on expert purely due to faulty input the xplorer controller
its trash and for one reason alone tilting to activate star power doesnt work
combine this with the repositioned startback buttons and youve got a controller that cant be used to reliably activate star power an absolute necessity for most people playing difficult songs on expertthe best part
at most stores this counts as softwarecddvd meaning once youve opened it you cant return it unless its defectivei am really disappointed in this game
i saw it like a month ago before it came out and i couldnt wait to get it
i thought it was gonna be like a little guitar hero but this game is nowhere near the fun of guitar hero
it doesnt even play along with you when you play the songs
all you hear is when you strum on the guitar so if you have no idea how the song goes youll be sitting there just playing notes in order
you dont even have to be in time to complete the song
dont make the same mistake i did though
i bought it the week it came out and i sold it to gamestop about  weeks later and only got  dollars for it
dont get it
unless you enjoy playing songs out of rythym and stuffthe games story and fighting method sound very interesting
however it never mentioned that this is a first person fightingadventure game
while st person perspective is perfect for shooting game but not for fighting game
i feel like wearing a metal diving suit with everything cover except for a tiny window
i cant tell where my enemies are
you cant turn your head you must turn the entire body
i often fall of the cliff since i cant tell where my feet are
this game would be better if it is a rd person perspective
i gave up after  min
in summary the worst game i had ever boughti bought this one on a whim because i do like jewel quest but really its probably going to be traded for another game
it compares very poorly to jewel quest and i honestly dont see myself playing itmy chief complaints are  the different jewels are very hard to tell apart
some of them are so slightly different that you have to squint at the screen and even guess at times
mostly the pinks and oranges  the blues are distinguishable enough the sound
i had to turn the sound almost completely off and it was still irritating
when the jewels disappear and the remaining ones clack down the speakers produce a sound like static that grates on my nerves
this alone would be enough to make me stop playingotherwise i do admit it plays smoothly and has some nice special features like the fireballthing  theres nothing wrong with the idea of the game but it also doesnt have anything that worthwhile to outweighs those two very very very large negativesit didnt work
cross checked it against a genuine cable
i guess its a shot in the dark since some people had it work but mine didnt
so i dont care to be friendly about itokay the first thing i noticed with this game is there is hardly any lighting effect even when i adjusted it
the tank you first encounter looks like its made out of card board from what i could see of it
due to lighting
the ai is retarded most of the enemys run into walls
and keep running
the first medal of honor for playstation  is better than this peice of garbage
and the american m garand your allies have is semi automatic but they work it like a bolt action rifle
thats what the germans use
and thats if your lucky to even get them to shoot back at the enemy
the last thing i noticed was the phisycs are broken
i shot this german and he floats into the air and disapeers wtf
and my friend who also played this game experianced the same thing
and this was a brand new game i didnt rent it
i bought it from walmart
and after that i sold it to gamestop for 
if you still want to play this pitiful excuse for a game rent it dont buy it
either way in my oppinion its not even worth your time or money for that matterwll this game looks amazing but thats allthe people that gives this game  or even  stars evidentli dont like to get ther moneys worththis game is a big disapointment to all burnout fanslets start by sayn crach mode is goneyou have to drive like a retard all over the city and stop at a street light to get on a racetakedown and other shep tipes of raacesit had the potential to be a great game but it didnt even came close to itdont make the same mistake that i did and buy this doungrade of a great gamejust wait for grran turismo  that would be a better betso just a disc in a paper sleeve
thats it
no booklet
no box
no bueno
this cost me 
i could have just downloaded the full game for less
now i have to go looking for a box to put this game in and without any box art it will always look like i found it at a garage sale
avoid buying this herei wish i would have known the following before i wasted  on thisroad rage is still my favorite except open world  no instant restart  lame
constantly checking the map sucks
crash mode is gone
and theres no splitscreen
with the burnout series the only thing i want to do is crash mode and road rage with my wife
thank you ea for making my wife crynow go make burnout  fun againi just read an article where ea talks about selling advertising to the obama campain
theres going to be an ad in the xbox  version that reads obama for president
i think that is going to far
revenue from sale of the game should be enough for ea but no they have to sell ad space so they can make even more money at our expense
no thanksas a huge fan of the burnout series i regret to say that i am extremely disappointed with this new installment
what is truly sad though is to think of how good this game could have been
the visuals are outstanding the speed is amazing and all the while the framerate is as smooth as butter
paradise also boasts smooth controls and a pretty good soundtrack
but if you loved the previous burnout titles be prepared for a major shock or several as a matter of fact
here are my biggest complaints no crash mode
heres an idea lets take one of the series most memorable and beloved features and give it the axe
yes its totally nixed
why
who knows no retry option
yes you heard me correctly
if you screw up you cant restart the race
which leads me to my next complaint backtracking
just lose a race
oh well youll just have to drive the five miles back to the starting point
what
you cant find the starting point again awful navigation
it is way too easy to get lost and there is no way to instantly jump to an event or location
furthermore the mini map is fixed
anyone who plays openworld racers knows it is much easier to have the map orient itself to the direction of the car no quit race option
oops i didnt want to play this race
i guess ill just have to meander about until the timer runs downnote to the developer thanks for taking a perfectly good series and screwing it up
you were so busy trying to jump on the openworld bandwagon that you forgot why fans really loved the burnout franchise to begin with
if gamers want to play openworld racing they play midnight club need for speed most wanted test drive unlimited or one of the many others out there
if they want fast paced arcade style action and the ability to quickly browse through events they play burnout or used to anywaydo you like frustrating achievements that are tough to get even after  hours of playdo you like missing features from burnout predecessors
like crash mode crash after effects etcdo you like poorly designed navigation systems on open world racing games which forces you to be lost and out of the racedo you like driving slowly in traffic and running into parked cars because you were busy looking at the mapdo you like typos in your games
check the achievement list and look for the word licencewell get ready to get frustrated because you will experience all of the above when you play burnout paradisefirst off i have lost all confidence in professional game reviewers
either they didnt play burnout paradise and reviewed it based on the press release notes or their company gets advertising dollars from ea and dont dare to write an honest review about ea games
well i paid  on a gold box deal shortly after the game came out and just recently got around to play with my backlog
this game is worth 
the professional reviewers gets their games for free
there is a lack of professional responsibility on their part when consumer purchase decisions are based on their reviews hence most of them no longer have any credibility with me
 for this game is a mistakeif the developers wanted to copy games with open world maps thats right i said copy
at least have the common sense to copy the navigation system to something like crazy taxi
the big yellow arrow helped a lot in crazy taxi
instead criterion decided to put street names really
 driving at say mph
of course the ai drivers are not going to get off course the only racer getting lost all the time here is me
get ready to restart a lot of races
just check online no one plays race mode because of this
the traffic and parked cars in paradise city is tough because half the time you are looking at the map to make sure you are going the right way
the crash scenes are repetitive and will add to your frustration as you watch it for the one thousandth timewhats up with the missing features from previous burnout games
its like buying a car without a spare tire not what you expect until you look in the trunk
whats up with the achievement for parking a car
thats not fun
whats up with having to drive all the way across the map to start a race i want to race in
there should be an option to pick from a list let me decide if i want to drive there or use a list feature
burnout paradise left a bad taste in my mouth especially on how hard the achievement were
find all  billboard signs park your car in a special way win these races and get to license a etc  my goal was to get  achievement points and i got about  from  hours of play
vote with your money i doubt i will buy another buggy ea gamei have been a burnout fan and owner since the first burnout game
every game in the series has been a improvement
this game is like a bastarized verision of a once proud series
i have been looking forward to this game since it was anouced over two years ago
here is why i dont like
its very hard to find your way around
the open world sucks
one minute your in the middle of the event and the next your not
where are the arrows to guide you where your goingif i wanted to play game in the style of midnight club i would have bought it instead
no crash mode
you cant crash into anything any more
with out destroying your carthat was a majority of the fun for mei played this game for  minutes before deciding that this was awfuli feel like this game cheated me out sixty plus dollarsnow if you want to spend  dollars to look at product placement and great graphics this game is for youim going to be renting the next one firsti would think twice about this game
maybe there was something to the constant delays after alluncomfortable and really doesnt work all that well
dont waste your money on this because it really isnt worth iti hate this headset
it doesnt fit right on my ear and the mic doesnt recognize my voice a loti loved this game until i entered the second level and there was a bug preventing me from jumping onto a rather close ledge the game rocked until this point if anyone knows the bug i am talking about in the second level and knows how to get passed this jump please let me know until then this game gets a  star because there is no zero it would have been a perfect ten but the bug prevents me from progressing on my pshelp me pleasei wish i could tell you something good about this software but unfortunately i cant
dont waste time couldnt use even the joystick with this failure gamethis game has too much movie and not enough actual play timeit also tends to freeze up at critical points and also you have to do  things at once on the controller to do what is necessaryi thought this was going to be a favorite of mine noti was so dissapointed with this game and having to babysit the grunts is horrible and they wont enter inside any structures to help you by supprise ambushes hiding upstairsthe load time is terribly slow and reminds me of the first disc games back in the day you would think that for the price you pay for it that it would at least be enjoyablebrothers in arms has left me up in arms and i give it a thumbs double thumbs downdont get me wrong killing nazis is fun and all but you need the game to be more then just that
and after all the hype all the delays they fail
the graphics are poor
the first window i shot cracked in the most unbelievable way
the enemy ai became very predictable in there standard duck and cover movements
the overly long cut scenes were irreverent and the fact i couldnt skip them just added to the flavor or s
that was already in my mouth from the start of the game
it made my want to go get call of duty  againdont buy either wait for codwat or just go get cod  and play thatps i got it for free and it still suckedpast games are purely squad based
they worked flaw less
now they want to be a fps and well as a squad game
with this mix up nothing works as it is supposed to be
the gameplay is totally lost in no mans land
i dont think they had a clear direction for this game
flanking is all what the squad will do you have to run around do rambo
there is no clear clue on how to play this game where to do rambo where to do use flanking
it is just trial and error
pure waste of time and moneyone main question why does this game look this worse  it is supposed to be based on unreal engine
i think they are using the same models from past ps games on the new engine
trees and plans are just d card board cut out
all the cut scenes look awfulthat pretty much explains the usefulness of this productseriously your controller can be charged from the ps itself when plugged in by the usb cable it comes with
the separately bought controllers dont come with usb cables but you can buy any mini usb cable in bulk from sams or any electronic store that you can use for anything with a usb port everywherei thought i was buying a fps but who knows what the developers were trying to create with this
it goes from sneakystealth to puzzle solving to platformer to fps
to frustrate things even more the subtitles are microscopic and the voice acting was done by outofwork pornstars
you either need a theatersized tv or plenty of patience if you even care as to whats going on with the story
and what a story it is granted four chapters was all i could handle
you alternate segments between a young retarded lad named billy and his grisled bloodthirsty yet also retarded preacher uncle
billys missions are all about stealth and running like a coward
if you try to take down any of your adversaries  more magically appear and instantly kill you
his uncle is a drunk killing machine which is actually somewhat fun until the game throws a rd grade puzzle at his st grade logic and jumping ability
lastly id like to mention how glitchy this game is
i walked into town to hear the same cow moo sound effect stuck on repeat for a good five minutes
npcs repeat the same lines over and over as well
and more often than not id find myself walking towards what looked like an ocean only to have mountains suddenly materialize in the horizon
same thing with buildings
and sometimes you can magically warp into these mystery buildings and be stuck there forever how fun
dont buy this thinking its gun 
dont buy this game because good games are scarce in the summer
just dont buy this for any reasoni was eagerly waiting for call of juarez  because it looked like it would be an updated more freeform version of gun from last year which i liked a lot except that it was short and much too linear and thus in my opinion not worth 
well this game is a tiny  bit better as far as visuals and a little more bloody which i like if youre playing a shooter its more realistic to have a havoc type engine with blood ragdoll physics and so on instead of the enemy just dropping where they are and their body disappearing  seconds later
but its too short too linear and in my opinion not worth you play as  characters sort of like in the getaway but this is back in about  so there are no cars to jack the weapons are simple and you dont have too many original things to do
the controls to me were awful very confusing id try to draw a gun but bring out a bible instead now i like the bible but it doesnt do much good when you bring a bible to a gunfight ha ha
the shooting part is frustrating the enemies can take like  hits unless you manage a head shot but you can take about  you only have limited ammo you can take guns off dead enemies but they usually have less ammo than you did because they shoot at you non stop whether you are hiding are not and hit you sometimes at random when they cant even see you which sucks and since headshots are hard to hit with the lousy controls you have to use  or  shots to take an enemy down so when you get to that big gunfight parts you will have like  bullets left and die quck
and unless you hide a lot and rest you will die and reset a lot
the save system sucks autosave at certain points no quicksavethe gameplay is disappointing very linear
you can only go to certain areas
you cant shoot innocents at least i was never able to which i hate in a shooter
freeform games are supposed to give you the choice of being evil or not
a big part of  that is getting to kill innocents
if you cant do that the game sucks imo
i know im bad but thats my preferencei dont always kill innocents i just like to know i cangameplay is too shortnot even  hours
multiplayer didnt impress me
theres either no one else on line or brats that think theyre playing halo  this game is not recommended especially at full price
if youre interested get the demo first youll see a good sample of how the gameplay and controls are frustating stupid me i figured the full game would be better
i was mistaken
if youre still interested rent first
if you still want it wait at least till the price drops dont pay  for itnot reccommeneded
if you want something like this gun is a better game and is  nowread a few reviews of this product and youre going to get the impression the thing doesnt work from day  its easy to understand why as you really need an advanced degree to figure it out
if you read the vague and errorridden instructions very very carefully you will ultimately get the thing to work properly
first charge it for  hours
you have to wait about  minutes before the red charging light comes on despite the fact that the instructions say it will only take about a minute to come on
also if youre using the ps to charge it the system must be turned on
it will not charge while the ps is turned off
just keep waiting it will eventually respondonce its charged for about  hours you have to pair it to your ps
way more complicated than it should be but again just follow the instructions to the letter
once done its generally good enough for government workwhoever designed this unit should be fired
its so difficult to get working that im surprised most people dont get the impression it just doesnt work at all
oh waitterrible
couldnt hear a thing except for high pitched feedback
dont waste your money
ps works with any bluetooth headset
i use one made for my cell phone and it works excellent
find a better onethe svideo horribly distorts the graphics and just screws it up
it makes it worst than the av cables dont buy this cableive wasted over  on this buying it and returning it to the seller in hopes of getting a cable that works
the only thing good about this is that only the sound works
youre better off going to digikey or consolecom and buying a solder cup svideo panel jack drilling a hole into the back plate of your nintendo system and soldering the correct wires to it by following some convenient guides on the internet
for audio just use the ones on the regular rca cableupdate if you have this cable dont throw it away
just rewire it and it will work fine
you have to strip the video wires at the end of the cable and mix the colors until you get the right result
i had to put the yellow wire from the cable with the blue wire in the svideo connector and connect the blue wire from the cable with the brown wire in the svideo connector
this may not be the same for all cables
the ground wires the ones outside of the colored can be combined into one wire as the cables are common grounddoesnt even work ttthis game was an absolute waste of my time and money
everything about this game is underwhelming
and the fact that it is a part of the mana series a series that i did not grow up with but have come to love in recent years makes it even more shamefulrather than being an actionadventure rpg like the previous games in the mana series dawn of manas combat is based around wonky physics that have you whipping barrels into little animals more often than notthe story was okay but alot of it needed to be fleshed out morei was incredibly disappointed by how traveling the world worked
basically there is no exploration whatsoever which is highly prevalent in previous mana games and one of my favorite things about rpgs in general
its more missionbased gameplay
you select story missions from a map screen and are then sent to a somewhat large but closedoff mapbut ive saved my biggest gripe for last the length
i beat this game in a single afternoon
i was expecting an epic tale that would last for  hours but ended up beating the entire game in under  i was left feeling emptyanyway what im trying to say is dont buy this game
it is crapi loved both secret of mana and seiken densetsu  got it when it was an emulation
i was okay with legend of mana despite the fact that the nonlinear gameplay made it very convoluted to play and i really couldnt figure it outbut i hated this game with a passion
the puzzles and walking around in general were hindered by the screwed up overzoomed in camera angle that managed to make me dizzy just from trying to look around the fact that youre forced to use items or bang enemies into each other to get stats the fact that targetting is so horrible that you frequently miss when trying to do simply things with your vine and then after youve spent hours doing this crap you find out get this its reset after every level rendering your efforts worthless
the music was so annoying it put me to sleep and woke me up several times during a boss battle
how could you fall asleep during a boss battle you ask
well the annoying camera angles actually gave me such a headache that i literally nodded offthe puzzles were extremely limited and annoying
have a wheel that you need to spin
youd be lucky if you can even hit it due the bizarre camera angles and very limited controls
why have a vine whip if you cant use it to climb
compare this to okami where if you want to fill a water container you can if you want to climb with vines you can
heck if you want to paint on a wall you can and you can even fish
wanna roam around bashing into random people
no problem
i couldnt even seem to talk to people in dawn of mana from what i tried up to mortmont where i got stuck wandering in circles looking for a solution for a rather obvious jump switch puzzle much less figure out what the hell i was supposed to do with this money i had and they didnt even bother to properly save my gamedont get this game
you can do so much better
even shadow of the colossus which has maybe  or so real battles is more interesting by farbuyer beware  the product description does not describe some important aspects of the gamethis game secretly installs securom  a particularly nasty piece of software which can cause many problems for your computer
it communicates encrypted data to remote servers and is almost mpossible to eradicate completely from your systemeither missing discs were not included with this item or its damaged
i have been unsuccessful with the use of the single disc that came with this
it was a very large cover with only one disc inside with no paperwork or guidebook
the one disc alone does not add anything to the game for me
i only have the original content from the disc i have from the original game
a very big disappointment
not amazoncoms fault but it will probably make me think before purchasing games from amazon in the futuremost of these cables might work fine but the one i got was bad
the red channel wire didnt work
i dont know if i was just unlucky or they have poor quality control and a lot of them are bad
i didnt want to wait around for another one to be shipped so i went to the store and had to pay 
at least it was this nice monster cable one
monster gamelink component video and stereo audio cable for nintendo wii  oh and fyi i saw a bunch of reviews talking about this being a digital cable
component inputs are analog not digital
this cable will not give you hd ie
p ip but it will give you ed ie
p compared to the standard i which is still an improvement in resolution and you should see an improvement in general picture quality because you dont have all the picture information being crammed together on one wirethis game is so disturbing and depressing that it makes the movie darkman look cheerful by comparisonthis game is very violent and it makes mark of kri look like an trated game by comparisondont get me wrong i like violent video games i just cant stomach graphic or very realistic depictions of violence
this game is more disturbing than any horror movie ive seen lately ghostsif i wanted to be depressed or disturbed ill watch the newsthis game is not for sensitive people or those who are squeamishonly buy this game if you enjoy a blood and gory festparents dont get game for your kids or teens this game is rated m for a reasonthe executions  of what made the original great are completely censored
they put a heavy red and blue blur over the screen whenever you perform an execution and move the camera repeatedly
the end result is you can only see the outline of your character and victim and not what hes doing
this game is pointless now
thanks a lot to the esrb censorship advocates and gutless retailers who wont sell ao rated games for making sure this  year old couldnt play a gory video game
youve saved the world and cheated me out of 
this is the worst gutting of a game since the original mortal kombat on the snes where there were no fatalities
btw the graphics are awful by modern standards
not even worth a rentalwhere can i begin
first the graphics are bad somewhere between nintendo  and dreamcast this game reminds me of the max payne and punisher games but not near as good
i think rockstar rushed this game out too quickly for the ps knowing the ps was coming
the game pushes the point that its over the top bloody and gruesome which it is but its nothing new actaully ive seen worse in video games ex
shadow of rome trys too sell sex as well the game i bought the disc locks up and i have too restart the playstation ive had to do this a few times i dont know if its just mine  or its a problem with the game the story is not so good its been done a hundred times and they did a poor job its not terrible but its not good the controlls are a problem also theyre glumsy and akward im half way thru the game and have no desire too finish it if you like the slaughter and the carnage  buy shadow of rome if like first person shooters look around you can do alot better with your this is not near as good as first
the audio is really bad graphics horrible and controls suck
after playing this crappy game i just wanted to play the original
this game sucks
i didnt even finish it
it does not live up to the first one in any way
it seems like it was just thrown together using the prestige of the original for sell
i dont like this game at all
however it does have good ideasjust not developed enough
i love the first game
i was really looking forward to this onebutmanits really poor
no replay value at all
what a waste of time and cashthis game is just badfirst of allit has absolutley nothing to do with the first game at allthe storyline and the characters are completly diffrentwhy is there even a number  after manhunt on the cover
but besides thatjust like alot of other reviews saidthe kills are censoredwhen you pull off a kill on someonethe screen gets all blurry lookingso you can hardly even see whats going on
wtf
this is not like the original manhuntat all
the storyline is nowhere even as good as the original one wasin this gameyou play as a manwho just escaped from an insane asylumwith some guy who tags along with youtelling you what to dothere is a twist at the end of the gameabout this characterbut it was really stupidi would sayjust dont even bother with this gameand stick with the original manhuntits alot better than this nonsenseif your buying this game with the vision of the dreamcast version of k football in mind stop now and save your money
this game has some good points but it is not worth sixty bucks or good enought to rent
also keep in mind that i am not a madden lover giving k a bad name but a dissapointed consumer being forced to wait until  to buy madden as a last resorti was sent the playstation version  bad on vendor
i havent sent it back yet because the ups store has limited hours and ive been working  hour weeks
terrible when the wrong product is sentok first things first im not a fanboy of either madden or k
pretty much loved madden football up until  after that k took my attention with k which i liked slightly better than madden  the next generation maddens   and  were pure garbage which made me fiend for another k title
well i got it and itspure garbage lol
i couldnt believe my eyes
i didnt see this one comin folksthe graphics are horriblethe gameplay is horrible
it actually seems worse than k
come on people lets be honest i understand everyone has their own opinion but you dudes sayin this is a good football game absolutely cannot be playing the same game
are there two different versions
did i get the beta copy or somethinlolea sports in all honesty i think will dominate this year
if ncaa  is a sign of things to come usually madden is a little better than the college madden is going to completely smash k this year
i have to wait on the next k and maybe theyll step it up a bit
ive had plenty of games that werent good but this is the very first time i will honestly say i wasted  bucksthis is the worst football game ive ever played
the graphics are sketchy and the gameplay is exactly the same as nfl k
bringing legends back in a a game is a dumb idea
i think the idea of having fake teams fake stadiums and fake players would be a smart and fun idea
but if your gioing to have fake stadiums and teams make the players fake to blitz the league did it and it was fun
this game is very bad i think that k games should make every player fake its way more creative
if the dont do that the might as well just get off the market and quit wasting their and our timethis doesnt work with current ps firmware
i tried it with two firstparty controllers one thirdparty controller booting with controller plugged in etc
i also tried swapping converters to no effecti bought this primarily to plug in my ps ddr pads onto my psit works for like a few seconds then the system just decides to no longer recognize ityou can do a few things repetitively to keep reconnecting it but to me it is not worth itdont get the ps version
it has sound issues
every time you hear a sound it is followed by a low hissing buz
it gets very old very quick
i have now returned the game twice and still the same thing happens
i checked online and alot of other people are having the same problem
i run my ps through hdmi and see no reason why i should have to change that
i paid good money for this game and still it doesnt work correctly
i eventually got the  version and guess what
no problem
i am a die hard ps fan and felt like a sell out getting the xbox version but what the hell
it should work with zero problems
oh by the way
the game is pretty awsome that is  on the 
if you have it
i hope you dont have sound issues
and i almost guarantee that the people out there who dont have any problems with this version either have their system running through nonhdmi or have some over priced piece of high tech equiptment
but guess what
not everybody is going to dish out thousands of dollars for an ampliphier or some stereo
this system costs  and should work in the damn rain if it had toso to be honest i could care less about transformers  no offense to those who are into that whole scene but when i bought my ps recently this game was included and i thought hmmm this could be pretty cool i bet  hah
now thats a joke  this game is absolutely worthless and im upset because at the moment its the only one im stuck with
i cant wait to trade it in for store credit so i can get something else
i have serious trouble completeing challenges because of the awful controls and the annoying camera
and even if i did beat the level im stuck at now i doubt i would play any further because the missions and fighting are stupid anyhow  you get to chase these guys around town while endless numbers of busses and cars get in your way which fly away like cardboard when you hit them not even a scratch shows not to mention you cant even run over the pedestrians they just magically avoid your vehicle lame and when you finally get to fight another robot you have  attack button that does the same stupid combo over and over
this game was obviously rushed and gave me about  minutes worth of satisfaction becausea i just got a ps  b blowing up the buildings and transforming was fun for  of those  minutes the other minute was fun because i ended up playing zelda ph for my ds when i realized i was wasting my time with such a terrible ps gameto those who have accidentally or purposefully encountered this game i feel your painwhere to startwhere to startyou only get to play certain transformers on certain levels you hardly get to play optimus prime at allyoure cannons are pointless as must enemies just shield themselves and most characters need to be hit with something like a tree or a brickbefore they stop being invinciblesome levels are so frustrating youll scream eg theres a level here where megatron can be kicked around by invincible autobot characters which is just weird when youre blackout fighting ironhide hes hard to control easy to kill and trips over everything many levels are  minutes long and if you die you start againno replay value barely any play valuestay miles away unless youre a hardcore transformers fan why isnt bothered by anythingvery bad graphic quality and also game experiencethe game seems it was made for n rather than ps
clumsy camera dumb missions jeez i could go on
but rather not just buy the game yourself and get disappointed like mejust got it today  hour played enought for me
th release and they didnt got at least some nice gameplay
camera is bad ai is stupid
colisions are a joke
combat are repeatitive and boring
textures are poor as playing this game on ps make me feel i was playing gta liberty stories for psp but worst very poor graphics for ps
bad work indeed not easy to understand how people rate it with  starsthe game starts by installing  gb in pss hard drive and im thinking in remove it permanently my spider  is going to ebay for sure as pirates of caribean game follows the same poor path also bad
studios are just making money using movie waves shamea lot of graphics going on for a lot of nothing much going on
  not a lot of fun and a bit of a waste of timedefinitely for young kidsthe graphics are worse then the gamecube verison
like showdownlegends of wrestlingit has too many glitches to count
granted it is kind of cool to shoot webs with your hands but the novelty wears thin once you realize it limits everything you can do
you cant even shoot  webs at once like you did in sm  the overlall gameplay is mediore at best
i give this stinkburger a  out of i wanted transformers the video game to be as good as the movie but i was wrong
there is nothing good about transformers the video game
the graphics would be considered good if they were on the ps and theres not a lot to do with your transformer
all you do is punch and shoot
your not allowed to shoot people only buildings and vehicles
hardly any people talk through the game
the cutscenes are short and boring so you wont miss anything if you skip the scenes
i think its true what they say
most video games based on movies are trash
the only good games based on movies are spiderman and   dont buy this gamedont even rent it just get spiderman there are very few games based on movies that end up very good
often times all you can hope for is a nice average game transformers is unfortunately not even an average game
i see no point to going into a great detail about all the high and low points of this game other than the fact that the high point list would be pretty short
this game was awful the controls story mission everything
the only neat thing is changing back and forth from a vehicle to a giant robot and that isnt enough to carry a game
the characters arent fluid and everything seems forces
if you must run around as a robot and destroy things there are better games to do it in
pass this one uphorrible game
i could barely play  minutes and that was all i could do with this game
i am a true a long time rpg fan and i hate to say dungeon lord was much better than this game
and two world made me rethink recent fall out of gothic  like a game from heaventwo world is like a first person action rpg like gothic and oblivioni had a lot of hope and hypes about the game but my excitement shattered at the character selection choice
you have no choice but to choose one ugly human male
the character make over was awful but hey
who gives about how do you look right
the male portrait had an ugly teeth showing and i tried to change the lips so it wont show
but the damn designers thought that must be shown
i just could not change the way he looks and it was very frustrating
it was almost at a point i just didnt have a desire to play the entire game with this character
and guess what
your character will be visible through out the game during the cutscene and so onbut the game isnt about how you look so i force myself to ignore and drive on
well it didnt last long
there are absolutely no tutorial and there were no help to find
thats ok i will read the manuals later or i will try to figure it out on my ownbut this didnt last long either
fighting mechanism is awful
it is really really bad
you use wasd to move around but when you use s to step back the character actually turns around and move away from fight
i was forced not to hit s key during fight and i was gunho all out attack stance whole time
like someone explained earlier you start off with right clik fireball click click run out of mana
left click click click no defence just hack slash use potion
and please dont try using your bow
you have to hold left mouse button to relase but it also takes time to zoom
there is a quick zoon option but you need that holding for more damage
but by this time the animals like boars wolves are already hitting you and you force to release it early
and like i said earlier you cant do a stance and move backwards so you turn around and try to run
repeat the same thing
guess what
the pack of wolves are already coming at you and you just shoot the arrow left click
not
no damage
you try to hold on then you are getting hit and lose hp really fast
so guess what
you do right click for fireball and back to equiping sword then slash again
playing dungeon lord was awful with so much bug and no map but it was actually fun to play
two world is out of my world not worth trying more of my valuable timeim so glad i didnt spent more then a couple of dollars for this game
from the incredibly clunky movement to the nightmarish lag to the horrible voice acting  this game doesnt come close to comparing with the rpgs that have been released in the last  or  years
ive played games released in  that put this one to shame
i didnt make it more then  minutes before i was so disgusted that i completely removed it from my computer and will rightfully give this game away
please if youre looking for open ended free roam rpg fun  look up the elder scrolls series or for pure sandbox goodness mount  bladeand for the first reviewer who wants to say we shouldnt compare this game to oblivion
they shamefully ripped as much off from that game piled it up with some seriously lazy work and tried to sell it off to the rpg crowd saying it was like oblivion
so yeah im thinking we should compare them and when we do two worlds cant even begin to hold a candle
save your  and buy a candy bar  it would be more enjoyable then this gameand without warning you are thrust into steep activationcopywrite requirements andfor you who flame without realy reading a reveiw thouroly becasue your eyes and mind are lacking it is not so much the activation as the reqired internet connection for a single player game that gets sensible people upset
i am also offended that comsumors seem to take sides with the companies instead of fellow comsumors you only hurt yourselves in the end when big business takes over your whole entertainment periodwhy on earth any consumor wants to defend this is beyond reality why they flame all reviews to the contrary is beyond reality
why dont you look at the review of bioshock with the same rediculoiusand fashous comments involved yeah like personal attacks will change ones opinion
it not only allows hackers more area to down your system it now involves more insentive to do it as now your out  bucks because your linmited install is expired when you try to restore the system
plus if you do decide your pc is not fast enough to run this product and want a new once you cant install this copy of the game because as with windows xp youll get according to owr records you have already activated this on another computer rutinefor you who agree be a wolf not a sheep for you flaming morons grow up and ship outthis game sucks
you cant play this game using a controller so it is worthless to me
i am sorry i bought this gamethis is the first nintendo ds superhero video game that ive sold off
my kids were really excited to try spiderman  having played the gba games before
after the first day my kids wont pick this game up anymorewhywell the combination of button controls and stylus web swinging is just too much for their little hands
they are overwhelmed by the controls
ive read a bunch of reviews that like the use of the stylus but even those reviews admit that you get mixed results your intended move doesnt always translate on screenmeanwhile my kids were underwhelmed by the gameplay
youd think new york city is populated by  felons
spiderman doesnt meet anyone who he doesnt have to punch kick or throw around
quickly this becomes work instead of playmy kids preferspiderman friend or foeand frequently play together check out my amazon review i bought an extra copy so they could play together
much was made about the tobey maguire voiceovers but they didnt lend enough to this game to add another star
my kids liked theiron manvoiceovers betternow that the spiderman  movie release is a year old i cant imagine most kids would be intested in this title
i hope new superhero games are released on the nintendo ds just not games as much work as thisthis game was bad the story was too short the game got boring quickly the graphic was ugh this was a really bad game part and is way better
i liked part the most it was real fun and exiteing part was real great the quality was great the graphic was great and the storymode was great to kinda weird but it was great
i beat all the spiderman games and this was the worst game id ever played this was just a little upgrade from part but this had bad quality and graphic this game sucked i got ried of it long time ago boring and terrible gameokay first let me say that this game is wayyyyyyyy to long too many petty theif missions and the whole lizard thing and the dewolfe its stupid
not to mention that every single flipping mission is impossible to do you have to run around chase everything you see and catch people and defend stupid innocent  by standers and stupid stuff
the boss battles are as dumb as the missions why in the world would they make a boss battle where you have to fight more cronies and get your but whopped
if i wanted to get my but kicked i would play a fighting game
i thought spiderman was supposed to be strong and fast and stuff and the whole spider sense is the dumbest thing everoh and the whole button thing is retarded its like they seen god of war and thought hey i have an idea lets do that as well
it works for god of war not for spiderman
if you think your getting moneys worth from this game then god speed cause you will stop playing after a while and you have to trade it in
invest in the first one its the best game so far activison needs to get their act togetherit blows
this game is sadd it aint worth renting or even borowing from a friend
avoid this game at all costif you have played elder scrolls this game will leave you laughing
cheap voice overs bad graphics and very little online players mostly little kidsdont waste your time or moneywhen i finished playing the rpg game called oblivion i decided to sell oblivion a decision i came to regret so i can make time for this game two worlds for the xbox  its marketing department gave two worlds really good hype and made it sound as if it was going to be equally good or even better than oblivion
the sad fact is that two worlds is basically a broken gamethough it is open world and the map is much larger than any rpg currently available for the  console the game has tons of pop up visuals animation hiccups framerate issues and glitches that will cause your character to get stuck to invisable objects
the sound effect and voice acting have a timing issue some sound effect come with a delay other times voice acting from the characters start too early
the quest system is broken down as well
the animation hiccups and constant loading are very annoying and detract from the fantasya new patch was recently released that was supposed to fix a lot of the glitches in two worlds but the fixes were so minor that they barely made a dent on major problems the game has
and ill tell you this
no amount of patch fixes will ever correct the games stupid story boring side quest terrible voiceacting cheap sound effects and idiotic artificial intelligence
save your money because two worlds is not even worth a rentallet alone a purchase
the video game retail stores that i buy my games from all tell me the same story lots of customers are returning their copies of two worlds because it is so buggy and lame
the stores actually have a bunch of unsold new and used copies of two worlds and that has got to tell you somethingprosopen world gameplaylots of items and weaponsconstrashy graphicscheap sound effectscheap animationsterrible menu systemterrible voiceactinggame still crashesterrible aivery buggybad frameratelousy controlsdumb storyfirst review
you betwhy
because you shouldnt be suckered like mehow it happened i was standing in gamestop and saw two worlds had come out
sweet
called a friend up who i knew would have it and he was all about it so i went ahead and gasp bought it i knowshouldve rented first
i was all excited and first thing when i got home i put this in the  and tried to join a multiplayer game
failed
alright connection error try again
failed
this is getting frustrating
try again
failed
again
yes
connected
wait whats this
connection failed
dratso chalking this up to problems with connections which could very well be but somehow have my doubts i decided to play solo thinking i would get an amazing eyecandy filled fun game
wrong
the character customization consists of one choice of avatar with  different selections for hair hair color etc
that aside since the hero is supposed to be the brother of a missing girl i can semiforgive this i figured there would be some sort of this is how things roll in the two worlds tutorial
sureit consists of press x to equip your weapon and kill the two groms
wowbig thanks for the help there gameso with that out of the way lets get to voice acting
it would be alright if the audio didnt sound like pieced together strings of individual wordsphrases
the synching wasnt too terrible for my tastes but that william shattnercapt
kirk speak thing is really bothersome
how about that eyecandy you were talking about earlier
as soon as you find it let me know
i know theyre not even the same genre but god of war  has way better graphics than this xbox wannabe xbox i saynot even worthy of a  after it
trying to find herbs for alchemy
good luck deciphering the pick up icon and lettering through the clutter that is the ground design
ive never seen so many flowers in my lifeive seen some reviews saying once you get into the game its indepth and stunning
i dont doubt that but this game is never seeing the inside of my  disc tray againplease everyone just avoid this game
in this day and age we just shouldnt settle for something like this
my quest is do you want to suffer through the first couple hours of a game before it gets better or do you want to play something that is fun from the start
personally i would rather play something fun
even those games which are complicated and take a while to get into tend to be at least enjoyable from the start
if a game takes time to get into there needs to be an incentive to keep playing until it does
with two worlds i spent that time staring at my television in dumb shock that something quite this bad had managed to be released in the first place let alone get a special editionhorrible control frequent hitches and freezes terrible music and voice acting unreadable fonts and menus you have to squint to see no matter how nice your television are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to problem with this game
imagine you cant read the description for your new piece of armor because instructions telling you to press the back button for instructions to navigate the menu are obscuring half of it
are you going keep a game with a problem like that
i spent as much time frozen as i did playing the game and this was on a new  which has never frozen or even glitched momentarily before and still plays all other games perfectlylike many others i purchased this because i was curious
i saw bad reviews and knew that i often liked games with mixed reviews
the major review sites have for the most part said the game is good
i really do wonder if they are playing the same thing
i did not want and was not expecting oblivion
that is why i am writing this now
do not buy this game
if you simply must try it please find some way to rent it first
also if you played the pc version and liked it okay please get the pc version
it is better than the  one which is abysmal
i tried to enjoy this game i kept putting it back in the  hoping i could squeeze an itty bitty amount of fun out of my special edition
alas it was impossibleif only i had never opened the box so i could get my money back
i would feel guilty reselling it
if nothing else i have said has convinced you not to buy the game
admittedly this has some of the best extras ive seen in a special edition in a long time
too bad they come with such an awful gamehonestly the game is absolutely horrible and i am known to enjoy the worst of the games
but i will continue to play it to see if it gets better so far it hasntthis game lacks in every single way grapicsgameplayweaponsstory i sold this game  game sessions after buying it and will never waist my time playing it again
it was kind of fun to run around in underwear like a jackass after realizing there is no value in the game itselftwo worlds and dragon age that is all i really need to say i think
if i could score these games zero i wouldi rented this because of the comparison to oblivion on the back
now i want to the guy who wrote that deceitful review and find out how much he was paid for iti returned it the very next morning
id put maybe fifteen minutes into it the night before and ejected it in disgustthis game pretends to have character customization
itll let you shorten or lengthen your characters arms and legs and give him muscles
thats about it
oh you can change hair color
there are a couple styles but they all pretty much look alike
and thats iti thought maybe it would redeem itselfafter all fable could be rather linear but it was greatbut when i watched the first cutscene i groaned
it was terrible
i could tell someone spent all of five minutes on it before shoving the product on the shelves in the hope of making a few bucks before gamers caught on
the characters looked wooden and the voice acting was the worst ive heard in years
the writing was almost as bad
imagine characters who sound like theyre reading words off a medical chart while going out of their way to sound medievalexamplehail my lord
art thou the bounty hunter that wast summoned by mine village elder
aye that be i where be thy village elder that i mighte speakethe with himeth
and so on and so forth
its friggin painful
and the subject matter is so incredibly generic i cantactually that about does it incredibly genericin the first dungeonwhich i think is supposed to be a tutoriali encountered two enemies
the first in the game
ask any gamerthe first enemies a game throws at you are always set up to be impossible to lose to
the game just wants you to get your feet wet test the controlsnot here
i died seven times trying to kill the first enemies in the game
two hits from them was enough to kill me
it was like the game accidentally dropped me in the final dungeon instead of the firstfinally i managed to kill them
i dont know how because the controls are so loose its nigh impossible to keep your crosshairs on the target
pure luck and lots of respawning nearby
oh i forgot to mention thatthats six or seven deaths with my cumulative damage still on those two baddies
if this was a foreshadow of the kind of ridiculous imbalance id see later on it was a bad bad signmy next challenge was opening a locked gate
i found my lockpicks on the menu the horrible horrible menu but couldnt figure out how to use them on the gatethe menu graphics look like they were imported directly from a sega genesis
its half impossible to tell what things are in your inventory and all of the menu commands are counterintuitiveexcept looting
i figured out how to use potions
that was a major victorythis game pretends to be like oblivionhence that schmucks comparison i mentionedin that theres an overworld with several locations you can find and explore
also you can buy a horse
and that about does it for those similaritiesbut i had to mention them because the game throws them in your faceim very glad i only rented this and didnt purchase it
if i had i wouldve demanded my money backthis game was unplayabledo not buy this the controls are so rediculous and its starts way too damm fasti do not think there are enough words to say how bad this is
stay way at all costs
buy any other transformers game just not thisi rented this game and played as both an autobot and a decepticon for a mission or two
this was enough to occupy my time for roughly  minutes
by then i was already completely bored with the game
for a game based on a property with such an innate cool factor this game is excruciatingly dull
it really has little to hold ones interest for more than a couple of minutes max
while playing i just couldnt seem to shake the been there done that vibe which seemed to permeate every aspect of the game
i also found myself constantly fighting with the psychotic ingame camera
the controls were likewise clunky and pointing at enemies with the wii remote didnt seem to work half of the time
during a large part of the action i couldnt even see where i was going or who i was supposed to be fighting because my big lumbering oaf of a character was always in the way
just like the movie upon which its based this couldve been something great
instead it fails in almost every wayi am a big fan of adventure games in general and got this game on vacation this summer
i had only played it a few minutes when there was a dn and hl i expected this
in my mind that is mild language however that is not the extent of the severity of the language
immediately following these words was a gdn i really hate to spell it out but i am a christian and this type of language really offends me
i quit playing at this point so i dont know how much more language there was but judging by other reviews that i read elsewhere there was quite a bit more of the same type
other than the language this game looked very promising
the graphics were really nice and the voice acting was good just not what they were saying
just to be fair to the company when i complained to them they were really great about it and willingly replaced my game for a more appropriate fitas a note i would just like to say that i know that my opinion here will not be popular with some people but i stand by it just the same
thanks for reading
i hope this review was helpfullike some real rpg paper mario fans
we expected an rpg not a side scrolling mario bros game with bowser as a playable character
this is a terrible let down
but the n again its not the worst game its not for rpg fans like me its for little kids and those who enjoy mario bros a whole lot
my friend brought and i thought it was going to be one of those long and good adventure rpgs like the first and second one
i say if you have a little extra money why not buy it or rent it before you buy it to see if you like it
for those who want the original lets hope nintendo makes a better th one or settle for thisi am a huuuuge fan of the paper mario series
the first one being my favorite
i liked the thousand year door one almost as much
but this game was just awful
it didnt have any of the elements that made the first two games so likeable
exept that hes paperi dont recommend this gameanyone with a wii has to be sick of every game on the console being a mario wario paper mario playdouch mario toilet paper mario or mario party
my god
why buy a system to play only predictable rehashed mario games for  years agoif you like confusing puzzles and weird characters this is the game for you but if you want fun and mario characters this isnt the game for youit sucksi thought this would be like old school mario
its cute but i just dont get it
the pace is very slow kind of boring
going through lots of doors
not for me i guess i have a short attention spanthe camera angles really ruined this game
it seemed your character was always looking in the wrong direction when fighting
you also had to buy clothes before you were allowed to see themi was a huge fan of the first couple tenchu games on playstation
then they just kept on tossing out cheap ports packaged as new games
no innovation no updating the experience just the same old stuff with slightly new level maps
now with the xbox  they have released yat another cheap port of the same old game
the graphics are awful for a  game the controls are clunky and slow the level maps are ridiculously lame looking and undetailed the bad guys are just as stupid and dense as they were on the playstation  i wish people would stop buying these games so that the developer would be forced to take a hard look at the franchise and either stop making it or properly update it and make a good game
the first couple were so fun and tense real white knuckle gaming
then it just got boring
not taking advantage of the potential on the  is just stupid and i feel sorry for people who basically threw away  on a game that is not worth dont bother with these
they are crap they barely fit into the controller ports and you have to force them to fit and then they dont work or barely work at all
pieces of junkdont have much to say bad game play and no easy setting
slow online play and small amount of people to play asthis is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game
i find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting
all games should have a very easy option
i suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficultthe game was fine until act  and then it became unplayable for me because it was too difficult
i thought the rest of the game was great
because this was frustrating rather than fun i give it a  star
if they had a very easy selection so that i could actually play the game i would have given it  starsi bought the guide from amazon and it helped a lot
i would now rate it  stars but amazon does not seem to allow me to change my ratingive been playing this series since  and i have to say it is completely unplayable on a console
as much as i would like to say it conforms well with this format it sadly does not
with the control system set up as it is there are a numerious formats for every structure and unit and within that are enumerious commands
all of which are displayed in miniscule text
and im playing on a rather large screen
if youve played dead rising and tried to read the text on that game well this text is slightly bigger
and i mean slightly
furthermore with dead rising most of the text you have to read is useless
most of the text in this game is vital to playing it
absolutely and i mean that with the most serious nature a gamer could level do not purchase this game for an xbox or any other gaming console
this is a computer format game only
given that on a computer this game would be great
if you dont believe me about the xbox level of play please save yourself some money and rent it first
youll be glad you didif this game allowed you to use a usb mouse and keyboard it would probably be quite fun
as it is the console control setup is terrible
it is very hard to successfully move and select troops and it is nearly impossible to group them
i give this zero stars
i bought it used for  and i still consider it to have been a waste of moneyi found this teen rated game to be very offensivenot only is it cavalier about the mass taking of human life butthey even have the characters act out as sultry types whoexpress sexy emotions when they kill someoneea likes to press the envelope with bad language
this gamemade me want to vomit from the ai commentarieslets get this out of the way first i love playing lotro
i enjoy it so much i decided to add a second account and thought id purchase the special edition assuming that the extra items would be worth the additional cost
i must say that i was very disappointedit is obvious that they midway tried to copy wows collectors edition which is a nice and worthwhile special edition but midway did it completely on the cheapthe map of middle earth that is included is all but useless and printed on very cheap lightweight paperthe exclusive ingame item you get is only useful  hope at very low levels if at all and takes a full hour before it can be used againthe soundtrack cd is a real pain
it includes the narration from the games cut screens so you have to hit skip on you cd player almost every other track if you dont want to hear all the game narration over and over
why didnt they just put the songs on cd like wow did on their collectors edition
it would have been much betterthe dvd on how the game was made is ok but nothing specialthe back of the box also says exclusive
full color special edition manual
translation its the same paper manual you get in the regular game but some of the pictures are in color woot
if you were thinking beautiful color hardback book like in wows collectors edition think againall in all great game but dont bother to spend the extra money on a special edition copy of the game just get the regular and have a great timehopefully when midway releases its next expansion later this year it will be more of a class actsounds like a lot of other people have had good luck with these cables and i thought i would give them a shot for  bucks thats with shipping but the set that i got are utter crapall the connections seem to fit just fine in all the places they should none of the wires are bent or bulging or clipped but they still intermittently drop the signal sometimes giving you just sound and no video or just nothing at alli have other component cables for other devices that work flawlessly so i would doubt its my tv and the standard composite wii cables dont ever cut out so i would doubt its the wiifirst time i started the wii up the signal died before i could even launch a game took all the wires out checked everything over for kinks or breaks plugged everything back in and it worked for  minutes before going to a black screen again
fidgeting with the wires without unplugging i was able to regain sound but no picturethats all it takes  minutes and i am  sure their destiny is the garbage heapnot even worth the effort to make a return which is probably exactly what the seller is banking on but oh wellthink im just going to continue to use the standard composite cables as theyve always worked and the picture quality improvement from the  minutes the component cable was working is too little to justify paying anything for ithopefully other purchasers have better luckhello im about to purchase this adapter but i wonder if it can be used on the nintendo dsi
thanksit shows that it is same charger that comes with the system but when you get it its the wrong one a shorter cord and not durable in the least
it stopped working in a wks time
thanks for nothingi bought this for my new nintendo ds i got it in the mail about a week later
i used it and the first time i used it it wouldnt workthis game is essentially an expensive drink coaster
i bought this game in november of  when i was stuck at my inlaws house with just my wifes windows  laptop and needed a halo fix
the installation process was fine but when i wanted to start the game it asked to input a windows live id or create a new one
unfortunately my existing id didnt work and neither did a new one i created
after searching the internet for help i discovered that not only does microsoft no longer support the product it may have even removed the ability to play at all because youre trapped on the start screenwarning do not buy this game
i bought this when i upgraded my pc to windows  and had been wanting to play it but couldnt because i was using xp
when it arrived i went and installed it first thing
it installed fine and accepted the key
but when i went to bring up windows live for games it said my key is invalid and to reenter
i did this several times with no luck
i called microsoft support and they told me the key i had was already in use and that they no longer support this game and to figure it out myselfthis is completely unacceptable
if you are going to put drm in a game you should always support it or stop selling the game
so in sort what microsoft told me was we got your money too bad  offi will never buy a microsoft made game
i was thinking of buying a xbox but now that is never going to happen
when the ps comes out i will go with it insteadso this is what pc games are comming toi warned  years ago that pc gaming was becoming obsolete but even i did not dream it would get this badbesides the secrom you have to join live and social club to just play offlineto play this game i have to remove the disk and reinsert it because there is no game iconthen i have to press  buttons to start where i left offthere are no on screen indicators to give hints which way to goyou can easily get lost in this game because every thing looks pretty much the sameyou go through a door fight a bunch of creatures then you go through the next door and basicly fight the same creatures on pretty much the same setthe old halo was a much better game than this onebut that goes for all the new game remakesthere has not been a good gta game sence vice cityhalflife  was not as good as halflifefarcry was great but farcry  is a disgracethe highly praised modern warfare was a big disapointment to meagain i say pc games are going to become obsoletethe big game manufacturers are promoting there consolesthy are even trying to perfect a mouse and keybord to use on there consoles for us die hard pc gamersi will probably get flack over this review just like i have in the pastbut by now everyone should see which direction pc gaming is headeddown and outm big brother are pulling every trick they can to get us to buy windows vista
halo  is a prime example
you want to play the game
get  vista
not likely
with so many people going back to xp from vista this game is doomed from the off
just take a few minutes to read the disastrous reviews for vista all versions and upgrades and youll see just how bad the situation is
people are now actually demanding xp before buying new pcs and laptops so bad is the reputation of vista and its growing
remember windows me
vista is x worsewhat a disaster
ive been looking forward to this game for quite a while now and if the graphics are anything to go by nothing much has improved
if m want to alienate their loyal users they sure are going the right way about itif youre thinking of getting vista to run this do yourself a favour and buy a console instead
it will cost you less in most cases and youll still have a pc that works properlyno minimul requirements listed so that automatically draws a one star review from me
here they are
windows vista
 ghz
 gb ram gb hard drive free space
nvidia ati x or above
internet connection is needed because of windows livefrom the install disk megahertz processor speedon my new  bit vista quad core it cruises along at  megahertz but can go up to  megahertz
ive found no short comings at megahertzs
i just wondered if i turned up mine from  to  would this shorter my processors life time
sorry about  being so cold blooded about it but when any manufacturing company post a for sale product on any web site i feel they are obligated to include all information found on the original box
how else can we know our systems will run itbyeupdate july i should have know halo went the same way serious sam went
serious sam upgraded to a better engine graphics and ruined the entire game
halo has done the same thingthey up graded to a better engine according to them and took out all the fun and entertainment
of course it looks like better graphicsbut who cares if its not fun enough to play through to completion at least one timebyeactivation
activationcmon
i paid you my money so now i should be able to installuninstall as i need to
take a lesson from valves steam with them i dont feel like im being punishedi played the st couple minutes that ms allows you with out activation and decided it wasnt worth ituninstall goodbyedid no realize that this game was so old or i would not have purchased it
the graphics and interactions are very bad but the game is playablethis is an xbox game and not made for pc playing
the keyboard set up does not work more than half the time
i have tried to customize keys to play like halo one and it fails to set the commands to the assigned keys
for instance the screen tells me to hold the r key to switch weapons and when i do it does nothing
i set the command to another key and it still says hold the r keyi have the mouse sensitivity set to insane fast and it is still annoyingly slow even with a razor gaming mouseafter  hours of play and trying to work with the few commands that do work i uninstalled the game and threw it in the trash
total crap in the opinion of this heavily experienced fps gamersystem infopentium quad core sli ea gig  gts gpus gig dual channel ramupdate   this review is pretty old and now that were in  and im on even better hardware ive had a chance to revisit halo   i still ran into drm issues with the reinstall and if you already have games for windows live youre going to find installing halo  nearly impossible ill post details in the commentsbut if you can get it going in windows  things do get better
in the past month or so i only lost my savegames on the live server twice and have only had it crash itself once
that said here is the original review
i hope it is helpful for youi bought halo  for the pc excited about trying it on my brandnew vista machine
i have had it for over a year now and have yet to be able to actually play the game all the way throughi went through the agony of having to create a live account and then having the game not see the account but not let me log in because im already logged in
i experienced the unfun joys of having halo  randomly tell me my savegame file is corrupted and i have to start again
i had updates crash the game my license key invalidate itself and after unanswered support emails it took me multiple calls and over  hours on the phone to get someone to fix the problem
they had to do this by removing my license key issuing me a new one and telling me id lose all my achievements and account info
that wasnt a great loss since the program would regularly log me into live then say you are not logged into live
you will not be able to have any achievements
sorry about that
a lot of the messages i get in halo  say sorry about that
sorry indeedby the time i actually got the game to work with shuddering framerate and random dropouts in sound i was just angry
angry at all the sorry messages angry at the hassle i have to click through just to load a saved game and angry at the constant savegame level resets
i see new microsoft games for windows titles and i feel id be stupid to put risk putting myself through that againi bought or rather bought since they didnt actually sell it to me halo  over the xbox version since this version obviously has higher graphic settings plus has achievement points which ironically the xbox version lacksunfortunately it also contains activation
i assume since its published by microsoft that it works however windows and offices arcane activation rules worknot only doesnt the product description tell you that i cant even find a warning anywhere on the back of the box
as soon as i cracked it open i was met with a big card talking about activation
gee thanks microsoftso if you want to play halo  play the xbox versionsince im stuck with it i plan on playing itwill post an update when i do
im slowly working my way through the halo series after playing the solid halo reach and now halo wars which while no age of empires was still surprisingly funedit wow now im discovering games for windows live cant log in from my new system for some reasonnewest client just will not connect
so much for at least getting points from thismy  yr old son hates this game
he played for  minutes and asked is this it
he spent  of his own  for this game and i felt so bad i have him the  back
i think from now on we will rent games before making a purchase
so far i have  wii games that are pretty sorryif you have a single brain cell and a memory problem you will love this game
your single cell will enjoy the one button action and your memory problem will hide the fact that you have been shooting at the same five chickens for duration of the game
which is endlessyou may also like this game if you are accustomed to sitting on the porch in a rocking chair with a shotgun in hand ready to shoot varmintsoverall simply the worst game ever releasedi read a review stating that if you picked case  you would win the 
i was skeptacle so i went to a local used video game store
they had a used copy so i asked if i could use it they allowed me to
the other review was right
i picked  and i picked the magic case
the game is very predictable and is also very slow moving
there is no fun in this game at all
the graphics are not the best but they are not bad
other than that the sound is good and basically the game play is the same as the show
if you can live with predictability get this game if not its no dealthe only thing that is good about this one is howies voice
the rest of the game is slow visually not even close the graphics of any other game
it is so slow that you think it is stuck moving from one screen to the other
as far as the mini games only the safe guess is even close to kinda fun
i was so discouragedthis doesnt work literally
what a pos
im contacting amazon but unless they want to send a ups guy to pick this up im not making an effort to go anywhere to ship it back or using ink to print a return label
ill eat the  and use the experience as a lesson
in case someone thinks i just got a dudits so cheaply made i can tell with a  drop to a carpeted floorit would quitthis controller was horrid i think it worked for a full day before it became completely unresponsive and was worth more as a paperweight i would recommend staying as far away as possible from this third party item as possiblei bought this game and boy was it a waste of moneyif you wanted a game where you can squash bugs and have a good timethis definately is not the game for youthe whole game you are in the darkvery hard to seethe controls are hard to maneuver and it is very slow pacedtrust merent it before you buy it or you will be as disappointed as i washonestly i have reviewed this item  times and each time my reviews do not make it on here to warn others to not waste their hardearned cash on this junk
it took  minutes before we were done with the reading
blah blah blah it goes on and on and on
then we get stuck right at the very beginning
just horrible game with a stupid premise
a japanese game that should have never been brought hereplease stay awayif you thought this game was going to have the same control scheme as wii sports baseball you will be disapointed the batting is more like wii sports tennis and it  is extremely difficult to pitch field and bat it is truly a workout it makes my arms sore i actually traded this game in the next day i highly recommend renting this game st before purchasing this gamelogitechprecision wirelesswell its far from precision
first off the directional pad is extremely flawed constant lagging and at most times it doesnt even registermy biggest problem is  of the main games i purchased this for dont even worklittlebigplanet and killzone i just cant tell you how upsetting this is to me because its the only reason i purchased it
i cant even return the dang thing now because its openedive read other reviews on other websites that say they have the same problem with the same gameshuge bummer
i give logitech  thumbs down and  huge middle fingers straight upps
logitechi want my money backi bought this controller a few days ago and just had to take another trip back to return it
when i hooked it up with the ps it worked fine on the menu of the ps
however when i started a playstation  game it wouldnt recongnize the controller no matter what usb port i put it in
so i tried switching to another game same problem
it wouldnt recognize the controller as even being hooked up to the station on a game
if thats not bad enough the instructions were no help whatsoever
 stars what good is a controller if it doensnt even work
and a  dollar paperweight is all it would be for all of us who still have ps games
now im a big fan of logitech controllers i was completely impressed with their ps controllers wonderful they lasted for several years
but honestly logitech was a real dissapointment here with this controller
it looks like they rushed it out to try to get ahead in controller production
the controller lacked several things that is neccesary to a ps controller
a code of numbered lights on the controller to tell you what number it is paired in i personally dont want to spend the afternoon calculating the seemingly random number of blinks on the usb adapter to figure out where the controller is paired
second as someone also mentioned no sixaxis control
i think it still has the vibrators in there instead
third no bluetooth
a usb adapter will take up precious space and if thats all you used you could only get  people to play on your ps instead of being able to get more pairing with the sony controllers
overall its a big dissapointement
spend the extra  and get a standard sony controller its better than sending it back to wherever you bought it fromon the back of the box to sigma it reads the real reason you bought a psi think notlets start off with the beginning scene where a ninja jumps out and comes at another ninja both of them look basically the same and your ninja needs to defend himself and kill the other ninja
how you ask
who the hell knows the game starts off without telling you muchthe game play is pathetic controls are iffy combos are weird to executegraphics wise the game isnt half bad but if you look at the biceps of the first boss you think youre playing on the psx or somethingenemy ai whats that
cause i dont think it was incorporated at all
the enemies just mindlessly swing at you really all of which are easily dispatchedoverall in my opinion this game stinksif youre an old fan then i guess youll like it ill stick to old school ninja gaiden myselfthis game is very fun
however i give it a one star over all because of the way it was marketed
i own and love ninja gaiden black
i bought this game because i kept hearing about all the added content and improved graphics
the added content is quite lame
this game actually has less to unlock than the black version besides a few added cut scenes and a couple of addition boss battles that do nothing to enhance the story they only provided me with irritation this version has very little to offer
in the way of graphics
i was very disappointed
its debatable that the graphics  are improved at all over black
thats not good for a next gen system
the cut scenes which i love actually were worse because they took out the pretty cgi and used in game graphics
the difference wasnt that apparent but when you look close there were many more jagged lines where before they were smoothi will say that if you own a ps and have not played ninja gaiden black then deffinately pick this up
its very funwwii fps games have been around for years and years now most widely popularized by the medal of honor and call of duty franchises
in fact so many have been created thats its now incredibly easy to tell a good wwii fps from a bad one
hour of victory clearly falls into the bad category
so many bad elements combine to suck the fun challenge and skill out of this horrible titledeveloped by nfusion interactive and published by midway hov attempts to set itself apart from countless other titles by letting you play as three unique soldiers an aggressive tanklike commando a highjumping sniper and a covert stealth operative
the paths you take to progress through the levels is dictated by who you choose
the commando can push heavy objects out of the way the sniper can launch grappling ropes to climb tall buildings and the covert operative can cut through barbed wire fences and pick locks on doors
its a decent gameplay element that promises to offer diversity and experimentationin reality things immediately take a nosedive
for one thing the levels are all extremely short
you could beat the entire game in under three hours
the second problem is its lack of incentives
you can gain almost all the achievements just from beating the game with all three characters on the easiest difficulty setting
given that the enemy ai is extremely poor and they do little damage to you its possible to just sprint right by them without firing a shot
a third problem is bad controls
theres always a permanent white crosshair circle in front of you
you cant turn it off and it never shrinks expands or goes away
when you aim down the sight its not accurate at all and causes you to move as slow as molassesperhaps the biggest problem however is that you end up playing through the levels the exact same way with all of the characters
almost all of the levels are strictly runngun assaults
to that end the only character that really works is the commando as he can absorb the most damage
there are only two other levels where youre forced to play as the other two characters and they end up being the best in the game
in one youre able to make better use of the covert operatives stealth abilities like hiding in safe zones and performing silent knife kills
in the other the more expansive level design and tall buildings feel right at home with the sniper who can use a grappling hook to reach higher vantage points and snipe enemies from above with his sniper riflethe graphics are absolutely hideous and given that theyre powered by the amazing unreal engine its just incomprehensible why theyre this bad
nfusion definitely did not utilize the engine properly at all
the backgrounds of the levels are blurry muddy jagged and distorted
textures are constanly popping in and out of focus and the character models all look like weird bugeyed zombies
the sound is surprisingly decent however with some songs on the soundtrack evoking that good ole patriotic feeling and the weapons sounds are loud and distinct
finally the health system is incredibly unique
its regenerating but the catch is you have to stand completely still for your health to fully regenerate
this makes for some tense moments as youre sprinting away from enemies hoping to gain enough distance to fully healhour of victory had so much potential to be a standout wwii title with gameplay diversity from playing as three completely different soldiers with their own styles
however terrible graphics really poor level design bad gunplay no incentive to test your skill and extreme shortness all combine to render the minor positives worthless
for hour of victory it was an hour of failure insteaddidnt really like it  certainly not what i thought it was going to be
the graphics and game play kinda suckedi was never able to play it as it is not recognized by my xbox region wtf its been several years since you had region codes for dvd and cds
it seems to be a great game love all related to wwii
its a shamevendors and amazon should write in the specs if game or sw is restricted with region codes
i have read all the box and see no disclaimer
shame on youin  years of gaming i have never played a game with worse controls
the game is extremely easy but what makes this game so frustrating is the controls of the onscreen players is atrocious
the ridiculously bad story the cheesy graphics and the horrible gameplay overall make this honestly one of the worst xbox  games i have played
avoid at all coststhis is a very poorly developed game
the graphics to me seem alot worse then call of duty  which was a launch title
the gameplay is simmilar to call of duty  except the controls are worse and the ai sucks
its just a bad game so please dont waste your money buying thisi am deeply disappointed with this game
i have played all turok games in the past and was interested in this one
the game started very well  interesting environments cool weapons a very innovative buttonreactiontime way to kill dinosaurs with a knife
i said whoa
im gonna like this gameunfortunately
towards the end of the first third of the game it became insanely difficult
and trust me i am no stranger to difficulties  i beat ninja gaiden beat the final boss in gears of war alone may i add
but this one just became unfairly difficult  there were stages were there were snipers and rocket launchers up front and as you try to get a better position and aim vicious dinosaurs would start ripping you apart from the backthe game uses the call of duty health system however your health runs out in seconds
even enemies with simple handguns shooting you from five hundred feet away would do the same damage as if they were shooting you at point blank range
there were cases where i would finally find the hiding point behind the rock and i still got killed right through the rock
so you die and you die and you die and you die and you die and you die well you get the pictureif i dont like a game i usually put it away for good
this one pissed me off so badly that i went and sold it for a fraction of its cost  just to get some of my money backshame
the game had a very good potential which alas wasnt realizedwow
i guess they figure the graphics are a bit updated so they can pass it off as a cutting edge ps issue for the new year
bzzt
this is a straight terrible game
all you have to do is play the demo dont bother with the game if you are really that interested
game itself is nearly worse
rfom like controls another game i thought was very dissapointing
sound is like voice overs doesnt match the action
i was bored killing dinosaurs after about  kills but i went on so i could give it a proper chance
your partner in the game your guide throughout the maps has archaic unatural d movements
ive been dying to rent uncharted what st or nd best game for the ps for ages yet its never in one copy everywhere sometimes none yet they have like  copies of turok at every blockbuster
like sticking a knife in my side this game is an embarrasment
they should pay us  to play the demo
shame on you turok developersturok has always been a series i found an absolute horror to play
none of the games were ever any good and with this new next gen iteration i expected little to change and hey look at that i was spot onplaying as turok you traverse a dino infested planet with your group of unbearably cliched space marine muscle man buddies as you look for a way to escape and in doing so youll find yourself often reaching for the power button as you attempt to escape this awful gameit has slow clunky controls godawful ai in both the enemies and allies poor level design that offers zero freedom and zero variety crap weapons that seem to randomly change how much damage they decide to inflict every time you fire and a storyline so banal youll wish you wish you were watching matrix revolutions again instead of playing thisi can think of practically nothing to recommend about this game seriously
the visuals arent the worst ever i suppose and you force some small fun out of the online if you really try to but any game that forces you to look for enjoyment in any way is obviously a failure right from the off
this game sucks
so much so i can barely stand to write any more about itavoid it avoid it at all costs
there are far better games out there for less money than this so you have no excuse folksdo not buyturok sucks
period
the save points are horrendous
the graphics are not up to par for next gen the enemies are faster than oyu and never miss when they shoot at you
when you get hit the screen goes blurry and by the time you get your bearings youre dead
the weapons are outright lame
it takes so many shots to take down enemy soldiers
if you like fpsers like cod resistance and bad company you will hate this game
everythin g that makes those games great is utterly absent from turok
what a waste
frustrating beyond beliefhis is yet another awful fps  the graphics are gritty the controls are twitchy and the bad guys look like they have a weird haze around them
it also has an annoying save mechanism which pauses the gameplay at totally random moments when you least expect in order to save your progress
i played the first level and turned it off
avoid this onei bought this game for the ps and let me preface that by saying that many magazines and websites said that the ps version was the best releasethat said this game is horrible
its virtually unplayable even on the ps because the frame rate is terrible
any little sort of action and the screen slows down and becomes choppynot only that but i played it for about  hours and im halfway done
let me see i played gta for  hours and im only  finished
probably played  life  for  hours to complete thatso my point is that to begin with this game is only average but factor in the frame rate problems and the length and you have a  or  star game at bestone thing that really upset me was that blacksite wasnt even as good are the original area  for the ps in length story quality and graphicsvery stupid game very bad graphics i think that it look worse then any other original xbox game too shorthonestly i was expecting much much more from this game then what it wasthe graphics are of decent quality
thats really the only positive thing i can think ofnow the story its kind of dull
one real twist that i noticed and wasnt exactly expecting until it happened
it has a very linear story which is mainly unbearable and its made even worse with horrid voice actingthe sound effects are so unrealistic
the m carbine which is your main assault rifle has a very muffled firing sound
it sounds like a lot of peanuts being thrown against a wall and popping out of their shells
grenades have a very generic explosive sound
the alien weapons a massive two choices of alien weapons sound a bit annoying the more theyre usedoh and that brings me to the amount of weapons you can use
its a whopping six 
human weapons are as follows m carbine mk pistol javelin rocket xm marksman rifle
alien weapons are as follows energy shotgun plasma riflethe world is very linear as well
theres a certain extent of free roaming but youll end up going in a circle almost every time
at times when free roaming the game lacks a general direction of your next objective
it can be annoying at times
when you reach your objective though the maps become even more linear
you have boundaries along a very set path that you cannot jump over or move around
theres also a lack of cover that can be used in said situations  which happen oftenmainly i advise not buying it unless you want easy achievement points for your gamer cardthis game is bad
bad bad baddity bad
i hate it with the passion of a thousand suns
heres why it crashes
constantly
it would crash at random moments whenever the game tried to load the extremely detailed environments
 there are a million load sequences that interrupt the flow of the game
and the load screens are repetitive
and the hints the game shares with you are useless
reload frequently
thanks blacksite i never thought of that
 its linear
at one point the resident tough guy character quotes star wars cause ya know the area looks like one of the chasms on the death star
when a character points out how linear the game is you know theres a problem
 the enemies are boring
theres one actually freaky alien and its telling that the thing is showcased in all the art advertising the game
all the other creatures look like they were ripped out of starship troopers
theres also the stupid exploding monsters which are a tired staple of fps
did i mention that one of them is a giant tower that slowly rotates and farts out alien bugs
 squadbased tactics
sure that amounts to telling people where to go they never listen and telling them whom to shoot at because its not obvious
 nondestructible environments
sure the fuel trucks can be shot
there are crates you can break but theres nothing in them
the environment is largely static
 theres also a rail game component
with monsters that shoot projectiles at you
ive never seen this before
all thats missing is the shoot me in the head game
 you cant affect anything the game doesnt want you to shoot at
you can empty an entire clip into your allies heads shoot their vehicles and basically act like a moron without affecting the game
and when i get bored i can really be a big moron
 you can jump about two inches in the air
there is no purpose to jumping
you cant scale any environment except to slowly fall down a zipline like youre on an elevator
in the one area where you can fall to your death the final boss battle your dead body stuttersteps down to the ground
this is a fabulous piece of code let me tell you
 its short
i mean really short
even for me
i tried to play the game on a much harder difficulty but the crashing actually drove me so insane that i wanted to at least get my money worth
so i played it on easy to get it over withthere are some redeeming traits but none good enough to make the game worth buying
its got some interesting environments including a battle in a suburban neighborhood
at one point you receive air support from a chopper flying overhead while youre duking it out on the ground
and the rail gun battles while rote are at least scripted to be exciting
theres also the amusing ripped from the headlines dialogue
none of that saves this stinking fetid pile of excrementin the era of bioshock halo  and gears of war blacksite is proof that graphics alone are not enough to make a great game
the developers should be ashamed of themselves but i cant tell you who they are because while i was forced to watch the end creditsthe game crashedi got this game on pc because i was hoping that it would have better graphics than ps
usually it always has better graphicsi even bought  a controller for my computer just for this game so i got real excited i love tomb raider i am one of those people who played the st tomb raider in  and got hooked ever sincewhen i installed this game i was excited and couldnt wait
turned it on and i was blown away from the beautiful graphics
it was amazing until i started to playnothing worked
controlling her was impossible and i mean i am a tomb raider nut i know all her moves and have no issues with the controller
my computer has g memory so its impossible that i was short on memory
she didnt jump right she didnt grab and the easiest things took me a very very loong time
it was soo frustriating cause you cannot focus on the game if you have to figure out how you can make her do things rightthen after mins
i was really frustrated and thought this is ridiculous but i made it so i thought i can continue finally but then the next issue came she got stuck and i had to replay again
i did replay  times and then i gave up
it was extremly frustrading cause i couldnt play this game at all it was impossible to controll her
i had no fun playing this on pc so i had to buy ps version
the graphics are not the best of course especially not on my hd tv but it works
i can play and enjoy this game because i dont have any issues controling heri cannot recommend thisget it in ps or xbox version otherwise you will be hardly dissapointed
its just a waste of money and timethis was touted as a hidden object game but it is not
i didnt find it appealing at allthe game itself is a bit lame nothing more than an average shooter with no surprises at all
but what really p me off is that i coudnt play at x
the default res is x
when i first launched the game i succesfully changed it to the desired x and started to play
after a while i closed it
when tried to play again i noticed the resolution got back to p
ok got it set to fhd again and when clicked on accept it crashed to desktop
 times i tried  times it crashed
i had to swallow the default config to be able to play
patches wont solve the issue
so wtfif your native res is x and the only thing you expect from a shooter is shooting go ahead
otherwise dontthis game not working i recommended dont buy this disk because is not functional dont waste your time and money in thatthe game was bought used and did not work so i had to call them to let them know the game did not work
once i was on the phone the lady got all my information and sent me a lable to send the game back to get my money backi didnt think the game was much fun at all
in fact i tried to return it the next day and ended up having to take a cheap tradein on it because i wanted to get rid of it so badly
the back of the case made it sound exciting save your city from fire
turned out to mean rebuild the city afterwards etc and i was really disappointed
i also had a lot of trouble figuring out how to do anything
i guess i was expecting it to be more like other games id played in the past such as sim hospital and sim theme parktake it as an xbox that something so proprietary and stores so very little to be so expensive
i had this for about two months before the whole console fried in the red ring of death came upon the whole system and almost took out the tv tooi have recently bought an xbox  slim and wanted to transfer my save data from the xbox also a slim that my friend has so i instantly thought to buy a memory card for an easy transferhowever the description clearly needs to state that this does not work with slimsthis memory card is made for the older xbox  the old clunky white onesim a new xbox user so i never made the connection that i was supposed to use a usb or a converter cableuntil nowsadly im  shorter and i will never be able to use this memory card
i cant even give it much of a reviewi wont say anything negative about it because i havent even used it
but i will say that the buyer did ship it really fastso theyre trustworthyi bought one and every time i try to save some data it doesnt transferyour profile on a xbox is where your data is saved you cant save a profile on a memory card only the data on the gamewhich is meaningless if you cant log into that same exact profile on another xboxso another failed useless product and giant middle finger from microsoft to the public playersthis was perfect before the slim came along do not buy it now
its considered outdated technology
do not buy unless everyone you know has an older model xboxwow what an utter dud pokemon battle revolution is
i cannot stress enough the embarrassment that nintendo should feel at the completely lackluster presentation or the monotonous single player mode
and while it is fun to play online i can already do that in the diamond that i own
but anyway lets beginthe good graphics  it is fun to see all  pokemon illustrated in this game or at least  although i think darkrai shaymin and arceus are there as well
the d graphics are cute though hardly spectacular although they are so similar to the designs in pokemonxd to warrant exceptional praise
i would have at least hoped that the characters would be more sharp than their gc predecessors
nonetheless the pokemon are colorfulthe bad gameplay  boring
monotonous
ultimately pointless
the oneplayer game is one of the most painful gameplay experiences ive endured and ive played alundra 
the fact is the developers spent about five minutes actually thinking of this game voices  annoying
the announcer says the exact same thing after each attack
come on now ingame extras  ok im happy that i can get a magmortar and an electavire but only after entering a special code  you dont even unlock them through the game and they even have the correct natures
and yeah a pikachu that knows surf is kind of nice hearkening back to the days of pokemon stadium but lets get real
pokemon stadium  let me play fun little minigames with my friends and let me play the ds on the tv
would that really have been that hard to introduce here
the fact is this games extras blow chunks
seriously
you can beat all of the trainers and guess what
you get to fight them again
hooray rental pokemon  are you kidding
in stadium i could rent pretty much anyone including mew and similarly for stadium 
here
i get one of the worst starter sets imaginable and i actually have to win with these losers to get other cards unlocked
the fact is this game is nigh unplayable without your own copy of diamond or pearl
even then it stinks but dont even think of believing that this game can even remotely stand aloneit should be clear
this game is terriblein the past pokemon has had games like pokemon stadium or colosseum on home systems where you battle pokemon on your tv and you can play minigames and quizzes with your friends
this game will let you battle but not with your friends and there are no minigames whatsoever
although the battles by yourself are fun you can do the same thing on your ds so this game doesnt really bring anything new to the pokemon experience unless you get all excited about d pokemon fightsthis game sucks and i really regret buying it
ive played pokemon since red and blue and enjoyed the console ports with games like stadium
its really shocking and disappointing that theyve never done anything like those games on the wii and then hand us this piece of trash and people act like its golden and it doesnt even have pokemon for games like black and white
every time i think of playing this game i bust out my n instead and play something that is actually fun
if you want to have pokemon battles on your wii buy colosseum for gamecube
youll be happieri dont know what to do
i go into battles and win them and so on
what do i win
i get money and can buy things for my trainer
and so what
i dont care if the trainer has a hatprosgraphics are beautifulconshey we have a wii mote to use
why dont they use itno storytoo easy unless you play it online but again i dont feel rewarded when i win a gamethis dvd has  games but most of them are more suitable for kids or teens than for adults
also some of them have appeared in other games like wii play
it looks like the game producer just tried to cram as many activies as possible into this dvd
then they used it as a selling point
that tactic fails beause most of the games are not entertaining at allim glad i borrowed it from my frienddo you enjoy watching a hundred dialog screens between each second gamescreens like hi im dr node press a button welcome to big brain academy press a button we are going to have a lot of fun press a button first lets register press a button lets see your score press a button your score was  press a button great job press a button try to get more next time press a button heres a bronze medal press a button lets see your score again press a button what a big brain you have press a button i havent said anything informative yet have i press a button isnt this cute
press a button not tedious at all press a button you like having gameplay constantly interrupted right
press a button its like sitting in traffic
press a button you drive for  seconds press a button then sit and wait for me as i chew your ear off press a button and you cant even just hold down the a button press a button you have to wait for each text box to pop up press a button and only then can you skip it press a button okay next game
press a button no wait i changed my mind press a button lets show you a crappy navigation scheme based on a school hallway press a button seems like the only qualification of the gamemakers who designed this press a button was their agreement to sleep with the men and women at our hr dept
press a button okay lets play
the brain games themselves are fun but the hassle of getting to each one exceeds the pleasure of actually playing
this complaint is similar to that of wii fit where each exercise is punctuated by intro and outro dialogs that destroy any rhythm you might have built up
it seems like a lot of wii games do this which is why i dont buy a lot of wii games anymore
wii big brain academy will be collecting dust on the shelfusing the ds browser feels exactly like trying to surf the internet with dialup and a very old computer
every page loads painfully slowly with a counter telling you just how many images are left to load
you never realize how many buttons and icons and pictures are on the average web page until you try viewing them with the ds browser
forget about youtube
forget about video of any kind
i thought the ds browser would be a great way to read email or do some basic surfing without turning on my real computer but in the time it takes the ds browser to load one page you can start your pc and have viewed  pages
please do not buy the ds browser
you have been warnedthis game is one of thee worst racing games i have ever played the controls are pitiful and i would say a atari racing game had better controlsthis game is horrible and i cant believe that people are actually giving it  stars
do not listen to them
this is on top of my list of worst games i have ever played
controls are horrible gameplay is bad the ai will only shoot on you and not focus on any of your teammates and on easy mode you die within  seconds after going onto the battlefield
it is just a horrible game people giving the game  stars were probably payed to say that stuff
worst  i ever spenthated it
it is gone already terrible game
never will buy one of these again oh well at least it was cheapi called logitech today  and they said they do not make any more the one they are selling is  years oldso you do not have the warranty on itit was missing a part that even logitech  does not make any moredont waste your money on this i used it one time and it looks worse than the regular one is not compatiblebought a new tv and had only one component connection
i needed to reduce some cable usage anyway and thought i might as well upgrade one or two while i was at it
this definitely improved the picture for my wiiupdateafter using this for a couple weeks picture started to show in only red and green
tested cable by running directly to tv and on a secondary tv and effect still remained
connected other systems to same ports and they worked fine
sending this one back and spending the extra money on an actual nintendo branded cablei had to buy the official from nintendo onethis makes tvs to blink and the quality of the game gets totally degradednot recommendedthis game is a waste
no single player campaign and its boring as hell
i regret even renting it
go buy medal of honor airborne instead
that game is a million times betteri saw this game online and got caught up by the potential story prior to this i had no idea an rpg ever existed for shadow run
so im clueless as to the history of this game
that being said i noticed there was no single player story mode right away i played for about  minutes and have not played it since
honestly because i have no sense of history for any of the characters the game is boring
if youre debating on picking this game up passsony is selling these multiplayer only games for ps for like  dollars like warhawk
its way too much money and not even that much fun
a big smelly ripoffi fully enjoyed the way this game plays
the tutorials were complete and the game concepts were really good toohowever then it came time to play to be honest i havent managed to play a single complete multiplayer match
the reason
the game has a system called trueskill which matches players together
at first it didnt seem so bad
in principle it was a great idea
however i soon realized that it doesnt simply match you up based on your skill
it actually interferes with the match
players who do too well often find themselves switched to the loosing team in the middle of a game
or if an entire team is doing too good the game will split the players up and create an entirely new gameif this game wouldnt stop matches mid way through and simply matched players up at the beginning i would have loved this game
however if i cant even finish a single match without someone being tossed around well that means winning is essentially impossible
oh sure you can win a single round within a match but the game has a system where  based on your performance in a round  you earn money to buy upgrades for future rounds
so really this interference messes up allot morein the few games where i had really good team coordination going i had allot of fun
but it was usually in those games that being tossed around was the most annoying
its like the game just says nope
we cant let you have too much fun
adding to the annoyance the preferences page is very limited
i would have liked to be able to say i prefer playing this map over this map and i would have liked to say i dont like being on the defensive so never place me with rna  but not
the game does not give the player any say at all as to which game what kind of game and what objectives are played
it is entirely randomthere was however one plus with the multiplayer if a team mate is a burden to the team players can call a vote to kick that player
so at least you have some say over who you are playing with
but still i would have liked something more of a favorite player list to form teams that work well for you and fight with those teamsit was also a plus that i could mute individual players who use the mic waaaay too much but sometimes i dont want to hear any mic at all
it is a bother that i have to go in and mute every single player if i am every in the mood to just not hear itits just so frustrating that after  days of this i shelved itso i give this game  stars for fun because game play is simply put extremely enjoyable but give the game overall  star because the match system makes it almost impossible to get and more than  star of enjoyment out of itthis game was made for a cool  multiplayer experience but there is none
this game is awful
if you want a cool multiplayer game get halo or gears of war
please dont buy thispc games that are built from the ground up for the pc play very well with a mouse and keyboard
there is always a learning curve attatched to them
for players new to the pc wasd layout it can be overwhelmingi just finished a game that required at least the right half of the keyboard the number row and a mouse to play
that game took me a few days to get used to but the game played flawlessly even though i wasnt
the controls  do become automatic and players lose themselves in the character they  are guiding through the virtual worlddont expect that to happen with this game
this is just another console game mapped to computer keys that doesnt behave well at all
like gof before it the game becomes tedious and frustrating
manufacturers save money this way
they didnt spend any money on this game  why shouldyouits pretty to look at but we gof pccd rom survivors are fairly united in thinking but who cares
you dont have to take my word for itthere is an online demo available
i wholeheartedly recommend you try the demo before you purchase this turkeythe game will respond much better in its true written formthe console versionthe older potter games are much more funthe graphics are dated but the games are actually fun to play on the pcthat they were written from the ground up for
wow
 that must be why the boxed set of the early games sold so well
they would be wise to bring them back some one should tell ea that
they havent figured it outea didnt exactly learn their lesson from the gof
the control suckswhile an improvment to gof its not worth buyingi have wasted  days of my life playing this pointless boring game i do not know what everyone sees in this game i kept playing just thinking it would get better but no it doesnt the graphics are great but the gameplay sucks you just have to stand there during endless talking scenes and when it is over guess what here comes another talking scene you feel like you are playing a movie rather than a video game please rent this game before you buy it i am so glad that i did thanks for readingwell i really really didnt like mass effect  i didnt even go thru half of it as i was so bored and sometimes so frustrated with it  but  mass effect  rocks 
i love mass effect  i am so glad i picked up the two games all together because otherwise i would have never given mass effect  a try
anyway i understand why some people gave mass effect one or two star only i couldnt believe it until i played it
but again go and order mass effect  you wont be disappointedsupposedly its the game of the year ummm really
you spend hours fighting weak enemies with awkwardly controlled weapons and walk about twenty miles to each mission and the story is really bad too thats a brief summary
they really hand out those platinum hits title like candy dont theyfirst of all if youre buying this game because you think theres nudity in it dont
because there is no nudity
as for the game mechanics they are absolutely atrocious
the storyline is sleepinducing
the controls are almost impossible to get used to
the characters are as uninteresting as they could possibly be
please dont waste your money on this gameit seems halfbaked
its a bad shooter bad driver and the story is blah
wheres the excitement
long loading times walking around exploring make it even more boring
cut scenes and long loading times before every battle make you want to put the game down after a few deathsi get a spaceshipoh wait i just point and click on a planet  i get a gunoh wait i have to level up instead of just getting better with it  theres something exciting i get to do in a cityoh wait i have to talk to him go here go back go back to the first place go back to talk to him and go back againloadingwow i got  xp  i realize some people like this genre and overlook its flaws but a game should make you want to play the game instead having to fantasize about what you think it could beif i had to say good things about this game i would say the talking system is innovative and the idea of exploring planets and shooting the place up is intriguing but it doesnt quite come through in this gamelet me say knights of the old republic is one of my favorite rpgs of all time
the way they meshed turnbased combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched
but this game was boring as hell
i played it for over  hours and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in
sure the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first  minutes or so but after a while it was like watching a movie i had to also direct instead of just enjoying it
generic scifi themes also abounded lacking the cohesiveness of the star wars universe for an underlying premise
i would say bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them but awful at trying to come up with an original concept and executing it in an interesting fashiondont have a wii anymore but if they had it on xbox i would like to have one again yai shoulda followed my gut instinct and boycotted madden  first of all its  percent the same as last year and the much hyped player abilities wich they claim are new are just last years player roles with new icons and you can see them on the field of playthough being able to see them on the field has made making adjustments easier as you can see whos covering who or wich members of your oline are gonna plow threw the d easier it still doesnt justify the price nor the hype generated for this gamethe rosters are soarly wrong the bears still have tank johnson who was released months ago and replaced by darwin walker months ago and yet this simple fix was not made i am sure there are other holes in this roster as wellthe menus and over lays are reused from last year they just made them bigger and a black when you score and are about to kick a field goal you see st and  at the top in white over field goal in orange wich was last years lettering at the topai and animations have been improved slightly not as vastly as ea would lead you to believe some of the new animations actualy cause gameplay problems where the animation was inapropriat at the time
some players still walk through others the running back still stubbornly runs into the oline untill he tripsthe graphix are tweaked colors and edges do seem more refigned but given the hardware out for pcs there is no reason why pc gamers are stuck with psxbox graphics
easpecialy since even mid range budget cards these days are equal or even better than xbox  and psone bright spot is the hall of fame mode you can now play as one of the players from this years draft including this actualy makes me play this aspect now
though the layout of the appartment is troublesome in some spots as clickable items are too close and with a mouse you tend to click the wrong thing half the timesoundomg this is the same dreary commentation as last year nothing new was added heck they still call devin hester  number   this guy broke an nfl record and a super bowl record and is the first player to ever have the ingame speed of  and you cant even say his nameagain i shoulda knew better though shame on me this is the last madden i am gonna buy for a few years always happens play a few years get tired of minor tweaks every year and basicly paying for a  roster updatei will say the game is fun but as i notice every minor detail and it sinks in i get the feeling i am playing last years game and am already starting to get burnt outthe menu system in this game is simply horrible
in order to make it flashy  cool looking the programmers used a menu system which shows the text flying up out of the background at high speed hovering for a second  then flying forward at you through the camerathen while youre waiting for the game to load which takes awhile it uses the same flashy flying d text nonsense to flash stats at you
every menu in the game uses this annoying system and theres no way to choose a less headacheinducing menu systemit may be a great game i dont know since i can never play it for more than  an hour without getting a headachethe player reviews for this game have been some a great game but mostly terrible
why is that
unless you are a hardcore nascar fanatic you will be sorry you wasted  on this game
st the car handling is one of the worst i have played unless your have the steady hands of brain surgeon this game is next to impossible to controll and no matter how you set the sensitivy of your controller it will make no difference
as some have said it handles like a  lb balerina
as you spin out and that is less then  lap the yellow flag comes out and you are watching the cars drive in circles at  mph
you can put the accelerator to the floor and the cars just drive right past you
there are wrecks but they stop  seconds into it the instant replay it a masterpiece of not being intutive
the graphics are medicore
i could go on and on
if you dont want to waste your hard earned cash try the demo or rent it
for me i would burn money before i would give it to ea again
ea just needs to stick with ruining football and nbafor all the nascar fans out there who have been waiting for a next gen game ea has disappointed againtheres no just race mode so you always have to mess around to get into a game
the game itself is very hard as you must constantly follow someone to pick up speedthis is a horrible video game
the graphics are horrible the point of the game is very slow and boring
i would rather watch the grass grow then to sit and try at this game againdo not waste your money
baseball games on the pc is a thing of the past for some reason
i thought this was a break through but it isnt
it is a simulator of owning a baseball team
you dont play anything
you just look at statsvery lame and very boring
i couldnt even give it away once i got itterrible my son bough this with his own money thought he made a good decision but it quit working after  monthsthese game makers are killing me
the games are too hard and when you smash a controller into the ground it breaks
im not impressedi like the controller layout itself with exception of the dpadthe buttons have to pounded pretty hard compared to other controllersbesides those small complaints the controller layout is really goodthe main problem is that ive owned  and of those  only  actually works without being plugged in of them died within a month of being owned  and was hardly used in that timeontop of that none of my  controllers hold a charge for more then  hoursafter being fully chargedand turn themselves off randomlyso until microsoft fixes those issues its a one stari just got an xbox  and it is great
the controller that came with it works perfectly
i bought another controller to play with my friends and the controller turned off after  minutes
i turned it back on and the controller turned off after another  minutes and it kept doing that
i thought maybe the batteries that came with the controller were messed up so i changed them
even after that it kept turning off every ten minutesthis is an overprice pos
you should not buy this and show ms that you will not take this financial beating from them
they analyzed this hard drive and decided that it costs around  dollars to make
that is a  price mark up
stop letting ms tell you what to pay and demand better servicei was looking at the best option to getting a  and i was thinking about just getting the arcade with a hdd
i expected for it to be overpriced around  or something because it is m but this is just ridiculous
i upgraded my pss hdd to gb for less than 
why is this one almost  dollars more for gb less
that is just plain ridiculousi own both a ps and an xbox  and like both
however i can buy a western digital wdbevsrtl scorpio  gb sata inch hard drive for less than  to upgrade my ps
so what is up with microsoft making us pay  for a  gb drive
oh and did i mention that if you try to use a drive other than theirs you void your warranty which is a bad thing with the s three rings of death possibilities
also you can get kicked off of xbox live if you mod your box
i might be willing to pay this much for a harddrive that was  gb but this price is far to high
im not buying this harddrive untill its priced at  or less or until they release a  gb drive at this priceunless you download alot of stuff and and dont wanna delete it dont bother otherwise this will be a needed item
this is a worthwhile upgrade to your system if you like downloading the xbox live stuff
whether that be new content for the games you play arcade games new old xbox titles or demos
with this much space youll pretty much never have to worry about space on your xbox   you can just keep everything
the only time i can see that you would need to watch your space is if you download alot of shows andor moviesold review on may  ultimately its like zeph greenwell said
heres my two cents thoughif youre wanting more space anyways instead of buying this just wait until there are plenty of the xbox  elites on the shelves and then sell your current console for  profit and then go buy the elite
before any taxes thats a difference of about 
a bit cheaper than just buying this thing
this way you not only have more room you have the bigger badder version of the xbox still though i feel its utterly wrong from microsoft to pull this stuff especially the xbox  elite out after we fans of the console waited for so long out side of stores to get ours
im lucky to have spent on five hours in the freezing rain on launch day
for shame microsoft
for shamei initially became interested in hard drive expansion because i keep running out of space
i had downloaded all the dead space animated comics pretty cool btw but each of them are pretty hefty in size
i have a couple xbox originals stored on there and some demos of upcoming games i want to play etc
i figured i could grab some extra storage for around 
i thought hey its just a proprietary dropin hard drive
it cant be that expensiveholy crap this is outrageous
let me put this into perspective for a mere  more you can buy a completely new xbox  pro
granted itll have g less storage capacity but i find it hard to believe that this little hard drive costs over half as much as it does for an entire  system with controller
seriously ill save the money and just delete stuff and redownload it when i want to playwatch iti bought a wii not to long ago and it was the greatest
the games are so fun to to play with the next generation motion sensor controls
but the graphics were not that great on the wii
so i saved up for the xbox  elite and bought it for the hidef graphics
but when i plugged it in i thought the vaccum was on
this thing is so loud its ridiculous
the graphics are great but this thing is loudi did nothing when it tried to intensify or perpetuate interventionism
but its latest ventures are the straw that breaks the camels back
before i launch into my rant permit me the prelude caveat that its loyalists are tools
like a hammer or an axe they are not inherently evil or destructive
the evil is in the force that manipulates them and uses them for destructive purposes
that evil is microsoft who wants nothing less than to confiscate other peoples rightful earnings
let me quote to you from the words of my attorney microsoft truly needs to stop living in a fools paradise
i like to think im a reasonable person but you just cant reason with hideous psychics
its been tried
they dont understand they cant understand they dont want to understand and they will die without understanding why all we want is for them not to spam the internet with unsolicited testy email
microsoft is obviously trying to win support by encapsulating frustrations and directing them toward unpopular scapegoats and unless we act now itll undeniably succeed
microsoft is not above the law
and thats all i have to saywasted money on this item was able to sell it for close to what i bought it for
ended up building a high end pc for around  this thing just doesnt compare unless youre on a budgetother reviews are correct this elite system suffers from the same technical malfunctions of its predecessors
my unit was manufactured june  and now in  has completely stopped working because the dreaded rrod
im not even a heavy gamer maybe  hours per week and the system was completely ventilated
my drive door opening mechanism is also faulty and will often not respond to openclose commands
its now back at ms with a    week turnaround time
yayas an aside  this will be my eighth or ninth
xbox  console
after the first  repairs on the original i ditched it for a year and picked up the elite thinking it was redesigned and refined
nope
apparently all they changed was the color its still the same piece of junk inside
to mss credit tho ive never paid a dime for any repairs and even got a free game and xbox live extensions over the past couple years but im getting sick of having to send these pieces of junk in every couple months for repair
too bad bc its the best gaming system out therewhen it works
i think once the new one comes back its going on ebay for a psi bought  xbox machines for my nephews for christmas a haloedition and a pro
theyve been sitting on their shelf since christmas now
one machine has been exchanged  times and still locks up after  minutes of play time
the other one has been exchanged twice  it doesnt work either
it takes about a month to get your hands on a replacement  which doesnt actually work any waysmicrosoft admitted that they are having serious problems with their xbox
so shouldnt they recall them until its fixed
apparently not
theyll let you sit there with machines that dont work for a month and then give you your monthly replacment that doesnt work either
then your kids get to sit there for another month with a machine that still doesnt work for more than  minuesfor the most part i like microsoft but come on
 months of two xbox s not working and im still waiting for a replacement for either one
this is ridiculous guysi have the elite and the ps and as of so far i have to say the ps is the way to goreason being microsoft cant fix the  diffrent problems they have in there systembut did that stop them from releasing itnoare they fixed now that the elite came outnothe system is a piece of are the games fun and extremly awesomeyes they are if you can get your system to play themi have had no problems with the ps as of yetive had several with my brand new elitei wish i could just get my money backi cant believe i spent that much money on garbageand for those who dis this review because you happen to have gotten one of the few xboxs that actually workim very happy for you but put yourself in the shoes of a owner who is trying to play games on a brand new broken elite right out of the boxmicrosoft sucksthere is a big chance that after you buy this expensive faulty system  in a couple monthsit wont work
if youve got money or time to waste go ahead
i see red rings in your futuredo not buy this console for christmas
the retailers are trying to play the suppy  demand game to artificially jack up the cost on this system
i guarantee you that this elite system will sell for  cheaper after the first of the yeari am disappointed that amazon is a part of this marketing strategy
they did the same thing with psthis is the exact same system as the gb and arcade just with black paint it still prone to breaking and still is supported by the same terrible customer support as the others
the system has some great titles but with the high failure rate its just not worth it
i owned  of the gbs and this system is no better
everyone should be informed just how bad this system is made and how unreliable both it and microsoft are
do a quick internet search for broken xbox  see how many hits you get that all have ligitimate people complaining
buying one before when this info was a bit more hidden i could understand someone making the mistake  but at this point your either just that uninformed or asking for a problem
the  was the worst investment i have made in the last  years of my life
buyer bewarethe battery pack worked  weeks and it fit slackly in the controller
waste of money  do not buy at allcharger works but battery discharges in  minutes or less  i bought this kit because i need to play hours and hours with the wireless control but i play  minutes or less and the baterry drainson other sites these batteries lose their charging ability and usage to soon
you find yourself playing with the wire connected which if fine because the wire is long
i would use batteries but that would be more unnecessary garbage for the planetupdate use rechargeable batteries from sony or sanyo their so much more better
you do need a battery charger thoughyou can only charge your controller when it is plugged in and the xbox is on
unless you enjoy being tethered to your television by a cable when your batteries are low or keeping your xbox on just to charge the controller i suggest you get some rechargeable aa batteries and a dedicated wall charger
those batteries are multipurpose and will always be charged and ready when you need them for anythingnot just for your xbox controllersif you are into designing games be advised that the play  charge kit does not let you play and debug xna games on the pcamazon says i bought this on may   and i used supersaver shipping so it probably arrived a week or so later
today is april   less than  months later and after being fully charged this worthless piece of environmental pollution cant even power my controller for  seconds
literallyive hardly played at all in the past two months because my controller another cheaply made microsoft product broke and by the time i got around to fixing it id gotten out of the habit of playing
but even then this battery wasnt holding a charge very long
inexcusable microsoft simply inexcusablethe cord still works but if microsofts batteries are this bad ill just use rechargeable aa batteries
a pair of microsofts junk batteries costs as much aseneloop new mah typical mah minimum  cycle  pack aa nimh precharged rechargeable batteries
the eneloops are not junk and for the same price i can have two charged backs and have four aas to use in other gadgetsthis is definitely not worth the cost  in less than  months the light on my play and charge cable quit lighting up and it would no longer charge any of the batteries
it works only if you use it while plugged in
from reading around i can see that plenty of others have had the same problems with them quitting working very quickly
considering this has microsofts name on it and is an official xbox item i would have expected it to be higher quality and to last longer than  months
very disappointedi can get many more aa rechargeable nimh batteries of higher capacity for the price of this pack i love the hybrid type
unlike this pack they can be used in other equipment too
i charge them seperately in a wall charger and when the low battery warning comes on it takes a few seconds to pop the old ones out and swap them with a fully charged pairnow ill take blame for this having not done the research prior to buying
i had installed a game that requires a controller
i own an xbox  controller wireless and since i didnt have a wireless adapter for my computer i decided to buy this kit
unfortunately this does not allow you play with it
the description of the item says recharge your xbox  wireless controller while you play
which i then assumed that with this product i could play on the pc making the wireless now a wired
nopemicrosoft needs to explain in the description that this does not enable plug and play for the pc
i did some searching after an hour of switching usb ports uninstalling and reinstalling i still need apparently a wireless adapterwell that was a waste of 
my fault for not researching it before hand so i wont return it
being able to charge it this way is nice and all but now i also need to buy the adapterbought it to replace another one i had and after a week of use it burned out and stopped charging the battery
i even tried two separate cords and batteries but they wont chargei saved myself the frustration and threw these away and got the rechargeable battery packs instead from rd party seller either energizer or nyko i think its calledi was looking forward to my first sam  max game and purchased this sam  max season one which is supposed to work on windows vista and xp
i have an xp and it refuses to load
i cannot even get to an exe file on the disc to open it the long wayof games ive played the games that have the hardest or impossiblest times loading are games by the adventure company of which this is one
may be time for me to steer clear of this brandi didnt find anything special about this game  me it was just another madden game
not a must have unless u dont own any madden games and u just want  play madden
wasnt impressedthe controls are bad in this game a big pet peeve of mine is difficult controls i dont wont to know the learning curve for figuring it out either i know how to play video games
this game seems fun and has some original missions to do around the park
i lost interest after the third mission because it takes forever to try to pin the controls down call me lazy but i bet the tony hawk skateboard controller will be easier than this trashpop this game into my  console played it once the next day start i was about to play it a second time when a message pop out saying please play this disc in a xbox  console pop it out pop it back in a couple of times and it still says that
i mean come on man wtf
 i just got this game luckily it only costs  bucks never going to buy a game on amazon that is in acceptable conditioni was excited to finally get my first madden game since  and what did i getnone other than a horrible game
the gameplay is slow the announcing is absofreakingloutely terrible i feel i am watching a crapy game with the mute button selected
fortunately i bought the game with a buy  get  free deal i consider this to be my free game because i got rid of this game quicklythe quality of ea games has gone down hill
why is it that only ea can make college football games
i am a huge fan of college football and i did like to play the football games
but after ea sad performance in  i will no longer buy their football game and unfortunately they are the only one out there
what ever happened to  studies
i think it is time for competitionthis game really sucked
how in the world can this game be worse than the ps version of madden  in graphics and in gameplay
first of all the player faces are not like the real players
the animations arent fluid
plus it reminds me too much of nflk which came out a in  i was so dissapointed i actually wrote the producers of madden a letter telling them to change the game or it wont sell like it should
needless to say i traded this game in
unless they change the game i will never by another madden game for the ps againthe only thing i found good about this game is the player videos for the hof players
as far as the game itself there iswellnothing
i will definitely be offloading the ps edition and giving the ps edition a try i understand its more like madden 
everything that was added over the years to make the game better has been stripped down and left out
all of the change for the sake of change sucks
for such a high tech machine every aspect of this game is slow and jerkynot just the game play itself
i got the ps just for this gamewhat a disappointmenti am tired of the madden sires
nothing changesits the same stuff every year
i would never again buy another madden gamei was a huge fan of ncaa  i dont understand why this game was even released though
there are zero improvements over 
it is virtually the same game
i was willing to overlook some of the flaws of  but ea has apparently decided to make this series a cash cow and just keep cranking out the same game every year for more money with no actual development
 suffers from the same randomness as 
you can play this game for months and not get any better at it or see your win  increase
the problem stems from the utter randomness of the passing game
there is no way to defend against the pass and you are left to just mash buttons and pray
sometimes that doesnt even work as your qb will take many sacks thanks to unresponsive controls that fail to pass when you press a buttoni didnt just shelve this game i threw it out it went out with my trash last week
i recommend the madden series
you have more control over the outcome of the game which is the whole point of playing the game vs watching one on tv
if you insist on the thrill of gaming at least save yourself  minutes and flip a coin instead
if it comes up tails you lost
there i just saved you a half hour you would have spent screaming at this game as your  ranked team loses for the th straight time to iowaif you own  definately save your cash
just skip to  or just keep playing ive been playing the games of this series for years
previously it was not uncommon to go through a game and not have a penalty called
now in a bizzare reversal ive permanently shelved this game because the playability has been destroyed by too many penaltiesin the options screen there are sliders for the penalties
when i noticed a disproportionate amount of holding penalties being called i adjusted the slider down
i just shut the game off just now after the th holding penalty was called in the first quarter alone with the slider at unbelieveable
this game gets a big fat  star and two middle fingers
hopefully my nerdy video game dreamworld will be rebuilt by madden  as the college game will serve no other purpose than to provide draft classes for my madden franchisei have been playing tiger woods for years and i was so good i could beat all the players including super tiger woodswhen this game came out i couldnt even keep the ball in the fairwaythats how sensitive and how much they changed the controls of this gamei dont know why they had to change this so muchmaybe its the new controllers compared to the old xbox controllers which i prefer since i have big handsalso when you go online everything is just so confusingi play other online games and never have a problem but with this game there is so many things showing and it just looks like a big old messhard to make any thing outkind action adventuredifficulty level momreplayability lowpacing boringaudience noobswhyyou enjoyed the heck outta dmc  and dmc  need more of the same and dig the fashion designswhy notits a slow repetitive uninspired buttonmasher as my friend would say a game where you triumph not by skillful maneuvers or clever strategy but by simply punching the attach button allot
the first dmc was a masterpiece of dark creepy gothic horror with heartpounding action and whiteknuckle tension
it was fun to play and cool to watch
it was very empoweringthe second dmc was worthless but the third was somewhat ok and again in this fourth one you just just run around what looks like a european tourist village and shootchop seemingly endless legions of monsters that arent in the least intimidating rag dolls and marionettes that just pop up out of the floor until the game decides youve killed enough and lets you continue to the next mindless meleedmc  has none of the edge of the first and third
its like its trying to be its own game which is not why we buy itthe movement is unnatural and the camera is maddeningthe story is uninterestingthe sound effects are stockthe objectives are all too often unclearit fails to make use of a fraction of the pss awesome power
it looks like a ps gamenotesafter a week both my son and i gave up on it dusted off the ps and played  and  againverdicthalffinished game that misses the point of dmc completelyplus hours of gameplay is no exaggeration but youre a better person than i if you can get more than an hour or two into it without wanting to spike your wiimote into the tvzack  wiki is a puzzleadventure game with a heavy anime flavor although the tiny amount of voice acting is in english its obvious that the actors are speaking their lines phonetically sea rabbits becomes seerabito for instance
not that i mind except that its sort of incongruous with the written dialogue
other reviews have compared the gameplay to oldfashioned pointandclick adventures but honestly i dont think i would have made that connection if i hadnt read it beforehand there are inventory items but you dont keep them from one level to the next and theres almost no plot to speak ofto be fair there are good things about the game its certainly original and aside from the issue with the voice acting the characters are pretty endearing zacks facial expressions are a hoot and captain rose is adorable in her animegirl wayunfortunately the thing that cripples zack  wiki is the gameplay itself
the designers made it possible to die for instance that wouldnt bug me except that way too often the thing that kills you is something that you never in a million years would have seen coming unless you either worked on the design team or you possess the gift of second sight
occasionally especially in the flute of the growlin goblins level the thing that kills you is the wiimote misinterpreting the motion youre trying to make or not make in this level theres a crankoperated gondola thing that sometimes keeps going even when youve stopped flailing your wiimote
whats worse the game seems intent on punishing you and punishing you dearly whenever you do get killed not only do you lose all of your money and points but unless youve got an expensive platinum ticket you have to go all the way back to the beginning of the level
theres a hints system but not only are the hints even more expensive than the platinum tickets they seem to have no bearing on the progress youve made if youve made it halfway through the level and you buy a hint youll most likely be told something that you figured out for yourself twenty minutes ago
plus as you already know if youre reading this we have an internet nowadays why screw around with ingame hints when you can get all the hints you need from gamefaqs or any of a million other places
id maybe understand if zack  wiki was made back when there was no internet to be had but the things only a year old
its especially dumb when you realize that you can access that very same internet right from your wii
and yeah you can go back and replay levels to recoup your losses if you want but why not make it reasonably possible to get through them on the first try instead of artificially lengthening the gameplay by making you repeat everythingto be honest i have no idea who the designers had in mind with this one the overall tone suggests they intended the game for younger players but im a fullgrown adult and i cant even get through more than five minutes with my sanity intact
i havent beaten the game yet and ill probably keep trying but at this point its more like a vendetta than anything else
plus it seems a shame to waste the money i spent on it although i have a feeling that ship has already sailed
i should point out also that i totally saw the plot twist coming
be smarter than me and avoid zack  wiki at all costshow do i put thisi am a huge resident evil fan
minus the dumb movies they totally screw up with their own themes i really think almost all the games are just awesome i have  on gamecube and plus the others
this has to be by far the worse one of all
as i was playing i was wondering if many of you thought the same and you did
it was just like playing house of the dead when things just pop at you and all you do is shoot
i was impressed with the graphics but thats just about it
the voice acting
i laugh my booty off
here i am fighting off gorillas and your asking me how did i escape from prisonlol
conversation start in the strangest times
i am more intrested in fighting zombies then telling you how i escaped jaillol in any case i brought the game and got half way and sold it on ebay for  i brought it for  i admit at times you were at the edge of your seat but to me this was more of a rental then a own
like one review said i would rather go to an arcade and put a quater in then pay  dollars for it
sorrythis re just doesnt do it for me
i will be renting this its just not enough for me to own itrails rails and more rails all we need is loops
i dont remember touching the directional stick at alljust enjoy the ride and shoot
if you die no problemget ready to shoot the same zombies over and over and overround and round we goit sucks
i got rippedoff and now i have to sell this garbageits unbalanced boring its really like testing your own coaster in thrillvillepretty much automatic just let the computer take you yes youre in cruise control baby
and the looser award goes to umbrella coaster chronicles
if you still feel inspired to buy this game after this review just give me the  dollarsi need a new pair of shoesill start with the good
graphics sound and the fact that it works sometimes
i wont lie there is some fun gameplay
but thats it
the difficulty for one thing is rediculous even on the easy setting
and apparently headshots dont actually count in this game
the average amout of headshots from any angle is  to 
more than once i shot a zombie at close range directly in the head with the shotgun and he didnt go down
the characters and bosses have unblockableundodgable attacks and the quick action dodgecounter is completely broken
it may work  out of  times
i couldnt believe it was actually worse than the darkside chronicles
id suggest this if you want a challenge but since it really doesnt work theres no point at all
omfg
what the hell is capcom doing
id say ignore the other reviews and stay far away from this garbageim a longtime veteran of resident evil having played every installment since the first one in  and completing most of them with a rankings
believe me when i tell you im a veteran
ive read the books seen the movies yadayadayadathis game is horriblefirst of allcontrolsthe controls are difficult
using your target is like the equivalent of catching a fly with a fish net
the game talks about hitting the critical areas
ive discovered that if you are not hitting the critical areas you are either hitting air or youre just wasting ammo
dont expect the game to tell you where the critical areas are except for the millisecond blink of the white light in your fishnet so youll have to botch it on your owncontrolling your gun and your person are as i recall more difficult than the original resident evil with the bizarre camera angles and tanklike characters
dont get me wrong this isnt a challenging game its just a stupidly designed malfunctionary controlled game that makes it unnecessarily hard to playdifficulty on top of the underdeveloped control system the difficulty of the actual enemies are like trying to escape a zippered sleeping bag while sinking to the bottom of a swamp
helpless is the word as youre surrounded by unfathomable attacks
your partner does not help you at all as they do in resident evil zero
ill have you know i tried and failed at the game on easy mode finally reaching stage three after four hours
dont expect the game to get any easier just more frustrating and less exciting
like watching wallpaper
moving wallpaperbosses are stupid hard and unless you are hitting those critical zones you are wasting ammunitionpickups not plentiful not visible
just hidden and sometimes sparkly
in a game that requires lots of ammunition you sure are shortchanged of it
that is unless you can somehow ace your way to burst open boxes within the  seconds youre in a scene grab ammunition and clear a screen of zombies and gorillas while youre treasure hunting
you might be fortunate if you can find a first aid spray or a green herb but be warned  youll need one again after another  seconds of battleenemies heres a tip  aim for the critical zones or you will be screwed
really
did i mention you have about  seconds to make your ideal shot at a moving target before it attacks you
nine out of ten times you will be attacking enemies in multiples
so aim sharp shoot often and hope that you dont get your face mauled by an angry gorilla
those things are meanso to sum this up this game is unbelievably hard
never in my life have i had to repeat scenes and levels with such complacency and frustration as i have here
the learning curve is a steep one and unless youre a sharpshooter youll be widdling away at this game for a few hours before you get the hang of it
with the lack of health items everdropping ammo count unless of course youre using the pellet gun they call a samurai edge and the poor shooting system youre sure to be frustrated within a few short minutes of playafter numerous wasted hours and a wrist that is throbbing ive concluded that this was a waste of money and really  the experience wasnt even that thrilling starafter playing resident evil  on our wii system and thoroughly enjoying it we were excited to experience resident evil  the umbrella chronicles
it may be that we just dont enjoy rail shooter games but both my husband and i really disliked the game
so much so that we went out and bought a playstation  system
there just arent enough good games available for wiiafter ac the ac series took a serious nosedive and this entry is a perfect example of the ongoing low quality of the newer titles
the story lines have gotten ohsoinane and the characters  especially their dialogue  seem like theyve been created for threeyearolds
but we dont play games like this for the story were looking for realistic action and this game misses that target big time
instead of stressing actual battle characteristics the developers have created impossible situations really flying aircraft carriers
that simply do not engage the player
the graphics are fine but the incredibly goofy missions just make this game look silly and the sheer implausibility of the situations a plane with a payload of  missiles
make ac a throwaway
the uneven degree of difficulty of opponents creates frustration because you dont know from one mission to the next whether youll be battling nitwits or supermen
i would advise all but the undereight crowd to avoid this gameubisoft you have become so bland and well horrible over the past  years
i dont understand why your stock is priced so high and i dont understand why any fool would buy into your company after a stock split
maybe you guys have been using too much nectar
yet another bomb
vegas  was also trashfirst off this review is based only on the fact that i ran into a glitch which forced me to have to start completely over
what happened is i just finished memory block  woke up from the machine didnt talk to the girl or doctor ran into the bedroom found the code card slept then shut down the console
thinking that it saved at the checkpoint like usual well when i reloaded the game i was in the room main room with no npcs in it and nothing that i could interact with
doing some further research i realized that many others were having this exact same problem and that they were forced to start a new game because at this point in the game you were supposed to talk to lucy or you could also pickpocket the doctor
you also were supposed to look through lucys computer but when it loaded me in i was unable to do anything
i have researched for over  hours and posted videos following the problem and every solution was to start overstart over a broken gameno thanks
if this doesnt help people for a game review at least i may help someone from running into the glitchgood luckman this was just painful
i appreciate the desire to tell a good story but when i sit down to play a video game i want to be an active participant and slogging through those cut scenes was dreadfully dull
and then when i could actually play i found myself travelling from village to village doing the exact same thing ad nauseum with a main character who was supposed to be an acrobat yet moved like he had rheumatoid arthritis
it was a beautiful game there was just no there there
avoid and if your curiosity is getting the best of you start with the notmuchbetterbutatleastplayable ac iiive heard a lot about this game and rather than buy a ps or xbox  just for this game i went for the pc version
buyers beware if you are purchasing the pc version please check the ubisoft website at for system requirements the game will install fine on windows  but the video will lag unless you have a nvidea or ati radeon video card i have an integrated driver in my laptop
so while the game looks great i couldnt play itin a nutshell this game sucks
the controls are so terrible the missions are all the same and the camera angle constantly has no idea where to look
in other words when your getting attacked by  or  guards you cannot see what you are even fighting and thanks to the control layout cannot fight back anywaythe game is also very boring
everything is the samethis is a great game however it comes from a terrible company
i say terrible because they apparently did not even test game through on the ps format before releasing it
this game freezes glitches locks up your system untill you have to manually cut off the power before getting it up again and it is not just my experience go to the ubisoft boards and see the   yes i said  page thread on the forums about freezing problems under the assassins creed section
refund
nope
will the store give you a refund
nope
since when have you been able to return opened mediadont buy this game for the ps
i promise you will be as angry as i am
it is an awesome game but it is unplayable on this systemsee my review of me ii
this game stinks if you cant figure out how touse the controller
i also bought all of the guides
guess what
they dontaddress the controller problems at allfor those that are unfamiliar with the tale of sisyphus he was the tragic figure in greek mythology who was condemned to roll a giant boulder up a hill only to have it roll back and then repeat the task for eternity
this game is basically a similar scenario
from a visual standpoint it is beautiful considering it is an older game
from a control standpoint it could use a lot of work but again this was developed a while ago and im sure the newer games in the ac series have improved upon this
now for the game and story itselfrun around avoiding trouble pick a pocket or eavesdrop climb a tower kill somebodyrepeat
you do this once and you find yourself doing this over and over and over and over and over again
i seriously couldnt even finish the game because i found myself so sick of doing the same worthless garbage over again
in fact more often than not these mundane tasks take longer than necessary because you cant walk  feet without alerting the guards and you have to spend the next  to  minutes trying to find a place to hidesave your money and start with the second one
from what ive heard it is a million times betterthis game was very disappointment to me  the story of the game not as you will expect to be  the game play is very boring very quiet the action on the game is minimal the special move of the main character is the same it will not change or upgrated so you will feel you doing the same thing over and over   the graphics is normal  i cant say no more  there is alote of grate game on ps so dont waist your time for this one i dont see why this game received so many accolades
i thought it was pathetic and boring
i disliked the controls and that was enough for me to dislike iteveryone is right about this game
it does get boring quick
the graphics are ouystanding but thats about itgreat graphics but you have the same boring objectives in each town
you will spend a majority of your time riding from one town to the next while completing similar killsstealsboring repetitive goalsat  bucks it isnt even a rent anymore
wait for ac
i hear it wont be as repetitive will have better graphicsgraphics already rock
so save your  and dont waste your timethe graphics of this game are its only strong suit
you will not be able to enjoy them because the game play of this title is completely busted
i dont understand the high praise at all and wonder if i accidentally got the wrong game included inside my caseyou are tasked with killing people but you first have to search them out through the city
easy right
wrong
the cities are massive and you have to do various menial tasks in order to find clues that will lead you to the person
ok that acceptable too and had it stopped there this might have been a different reviewbut no you are not allowed to step foot into the city because everyone knows who you are ive heard of this thing called a disguise but not alistar or whatever your name is
its set so far back in time maybe disguises werent invented yet
so to blend in with the crowd you will have to play frogger and walk around endless swarms of people who just walk the streets all day and night
collide with a single one and they will start shouting at you and the guards will run over and kill you
remember if you bump into someone on a crowded subway you sure as hell better prepare to fight for your life against the police you rapist
anyway the only way to avoid people is to constantly walk around holding a which makes you put your head down in shame as the developers of this game should and walk at a snails pacehowever you will still have to content with constant beggers who will walk in front of you nobody else
and harass the hell out of you and make you walk even slower
but you cant even give them money to get them off your back
you just have to contend with them
also for unknown reason there are also people balancing jars on their heads and trying to walk the crowded streets
if you touch them and they seem to follow you to
they will drop their jars and the guards will rush over and attack youthat seems to be the conclusion for everything in this game walk to fast  a guard will kill you bump into someone  the guard will kill you stable your horse outside the town but have the crappy ai make the horse still follow you and have it trample someones store while you are in the city  a guard will come and kill you
climb up a wall a guard will see you or even be waiting on the roof
and kill you
stay out of the mob fest that is the town and just ride your horse through the plains trying to find anything good about this god forsaken game  and a guard will be randomly posted in the middle of nowhere and kill youoverall if it isnt obvious i highly recommend that you stay away from this game
it is horrible and i have no idea how it is a player choice game
it is innovative yes and the story seems to be really good though i only was able to experience  chapters or so before rage quitting but the gameplay is mediocre
absolutely mediocre and frustrating to the point of screaming at the gameperhaps the newer versions are better ac ii or brotherhood but i will never know because i refuse to buy another title from this series
the real assassination happened to my wallet when i shelled out  bucks for this
someone kill meim gonna tell you straight up this game sucks the graphics are superb but the gamplay fell flat on its face the most fun part is jumping up buildings
other than that you get in a lame sword fight which is reminicent of any button mashing game mainly the x button
dont waste your money
now i remember why i stopped playing videogames you spend all your money and the return sucks
now youre out  dollars and your stuck with this sucky game that you can tradein for  dollarsgot all of them and ac is the worst of all skip it and start with ac ii that is with ac brotherhood the best of the franchise
ac revelations is average ac iii is amazingbesides halo  this was my most anticipated game for this year
i kept checking and checking websites wanting to know the release date for this game because they kept pushing it back
anyway once i got my copy and immediately played it i feel in love with the game
after about  hours of playing i was ready for something new
this game had so much potential with its breathtaking graphics and fighting elements
why did they ruin it by making it so repetitive and mundane
in order to assassinate someone you must first investigate the surrounding area
the investigation is the same for every assassination
talk about lame
why would i want to do the same  things every time pickpocket someone overhear a conversation interrogate someone which is basically punching them until they talk your ear off kill some guards for an informant then hell tell you what he knows killing the guards was so simple that it was boring just to do it
then to top it off the assassinations werent that great
the trailers of the game make the assassination look beautiful a thing of art
the assassination in the game turns into a slugfest with about  guards and then you get to the main target and chop him a couple timesi bought this game thinking i would have it forever so i could play it whenever for instant gratification
after beating the game once im headed over to eb games to trade it in
do not buy this game it is a rentalthe idea behind this game is great however the execution was a total bomb
the game is soooooooo repetitive that you will want to just be done with the game after the first few missions
its that bad
you get intel then go assassinate someone over and over and over and over again
i mean what the hell is that crap
thats not fun
the only good thing this game has going for it is the story graphics and all that wall climbing stuff
that is it
this is a sorry excuse for a gamepros  good graphicscons everything else
poor controls very repetitive there are only  or  things you do in the whole game climb buildings kill soldiers and then climb more buildings long boring cutscenes that you cant fast forward through and the worst voice acting i think ive ever heardi reserved this game about  or  months before it came out
all the previews and reviews made my anticipation grow
when i finally got it and played it at first i was a little taken aback by the twist
but i got over it figuring the gameplay as altair will be great
not so muchgraphics are extraordinary
very fluid easy to use controlsbut thats where it ends
the game is extremely repetitive
i expected more indepth swordplay control
once you get the counterattack move you are basically unstoppable
no need to run and hide
just counterattack your opponents and kill them with one move
the ai is no smarter than any other game out in fact there are alot dumber than most nextgen games like call of duty  for example
they rarely attack simultaneously
they wait for you to kill thier comrade then its their turn to be countered and killed in one moveall in all im very dissapointed
i think most of these reviewers were anticipating the game so much they have convinced themselves its a great game and dont want to belive how bad a game it really is
or maybe the graphics are so good they dont notice how shallow the game is
if anybody wants a barely used assasins creed game check for mine on ebay
im going back to call of duty  and ill wait for gta
assasins creed sucksthe assassins creed game series is my favorite despite two incredibly horrid titles
the original game this one is horrible
half the time you have no idea what to do the eagle vision is useless  of the time the gameplay itself is maddeningly slow and frustrating u have to creepwalk with your head down a lot
in later titles you get fast travel and several other very nice gameplay elements like skipping the ridiculous cinematic garbage
this is the only title where you have to guess repeatedly to figure out what to do next
really this one and aciii the american revolution one are an utter waste of money unbelievably frustrating slow and confusing gameplay
do  not recommend
one of the worst games i have ever played
thank god the later titles are so amazing except ac of course
this game is just excrement
the rave reviews defy understanding imo
i had to resort to googling how to progress on several points and even in the cheat sites the advice is just start climbing stuff until you find an unmarked viewpoint then it will tell you what to do next and open the map
really
that is just ridiculous
i have never had to resort to google and youtube to play a game on the basic difficulty setting
the only satisfaction i got from this game was in utterly destroying the game disc and then the case and all little booklets
just throwing it in the trash would hardly have sufficed
this game pissed me off to the degree i would have lit it on actual fire if i had lighter fluid handy
thank goodness this was not the first ac game i tried or i would have missed out of some truly great games because this one is so bad i would have never played another ac game ever
im annoyed i have to give it one star as zero stars is not an option
it deserves nothing in the star category
negative five starsfirst off i was very disappointed in the complete lack of immersion of ac
from the box i thought i was buying a game set in the s
but no the ridiculous concept is genetic time travel regarding a kidnapped bartender so expect little digital garbles a virtual reality theme and instead of health points the synchronization meter instead of simply loading a save you are loading a memory etc etc
in other words there is absolutely no sense of immersion
and never mind the worst opening of a game in gaming history
i seriously got a headache and had to stop looking at the tv  in general the fuzzy digital trippy stuff was hard to deal withthe story isnt worth talking about but worse there is no real gameplay as far as im concerned
you may push a button here or there but i honestly made it through most of the tutorials without much looking at the screen and just mashing whatever button they asked me to
you can climb even the hardest of wallsbuildings with little effort
there are quests where you just have to climb up the same type of tower over and over
it wasnt fun the first time but you have to do it a dozen times over
at least you dont have to climb back down  you jump into a bail of hay
wow games have come a long way ehcombat wasnt any more fun
the fact its a stealth game simply drags any action on longer than need be
the assassinations were irritating and guess what thats the game
i decided id try skipping the assassinations and the climbing quests since it wasnt any fun  well theres little else to do in the game
thats itand now for the worst idea in a game
ever the gentle push button
yes theres a button used just to gently push people out of the way
yeah its as exciting as it sounds
if the gentle pushing gets too heartpounding of an experience theres always the blend button that has your character hold his head down
thats almost as exciting as gently pushing people out of the way and several steps more exciting than say reorganizing your sock drawer or filing your fingernails
i found holding the green xbox button for several seconds ended up being more desirable
the shutdown console option solves many of acs problemsalso get used to looooooooooong scenes where the character youre puppeteering just stands there in clouds doing nothing
seriously
just wait and something trippy will happen until the next dreammemorywhatever loadsi cant imagine what the developers of this game were thinking
id be wary to ever get another ubisoft game  maybe its just the montreal groupi put it up for sale the day after i bought it
other than the graphics i cant say a single good thing about it
want a stealth game
this isnt the one
so  star seems generous but its the lowest you can choosebut hey being sadistically tortured is more fun than this waste of plasticprosgood graphicsjumping from high buildings is funconseverything elsethis game is the most repetitive and completely pointless game ever
pretty much all you do is climb buildings and kill people
thats it
theres some good gore in the game and good graphics both of which do not a game makethe plot on the other hand is a complete ripoff of the matrix just with the other world being ancient times
the voice acting is absolutely terrible and some of the characterization is terrible tojust rent this game dont buy itid be tempted to buy this game at the nowlowered  off price tag if it wasnt for one thing the game has no subtitles
ive never played it and refuse to because of the laziness of the company not to add subtitles at least during cutscenes
there was an article on ign stating that the developer just didnt have time to put them in
thats a direct quote
this is unacceptable
video games are becoming the next great medium much like movies were in the s to s
its a multibillion dollar industry
deaf and hard of hearing gamers demand equal access to media just like mandated closed captioning on tv
this affects hearing gamers as well
imagine youre playing at night and need to be quiet so as not to wake others in the house
youre not going to have any idea whats going on
or maybe you have loud roommates and cant hear the game too well
welcome to our world
deaf and hard of hearing gamersand those who can empathize unite
boycott this product
show developers that this form of discrimination is unacceptablewhen i first got this game i really liked it
i liked the story and found the game challenging
i bought the nd game in the series before i finished this one and decided to check it out
the second game completely blew this away in terms of game mechanics and story
i did not get back to finish the first game until i completed ac revelations
i decided i would finish this game while waiting for  to come out
after playing the other games it is easy to see where the ball was dropped on this
first of all it is way too repetitious
go to damascus ease drop pickpocket take out a couple minor targets collect a few flags talk to your contact and complete your main assassination
go to jerusalem repeat and rinse they obviously rushed this on to the shelves
my recommendation is to start with two and go forwardubisoft has been selling a broken version of aomthe titans that is not recognized by the eso server and there is no solution
ive wasted hours trying to get this to work only to have ubisofts support department tell me that it doesnt work online no matter what you do
avoid this defective product like the plague
where do i sign up for the classaction lawsuit
anyone knowthis is from the email they sent me after a number of messages back and forthreplacement cd key requestdiscussion threadresponse via emailjason    pmjoelunfortunately the ubisoft release of this game is not compatible with the original release
there is no way to play the expansion online
customer by web form joel sassone    pmthank you for the cd keys
unfortunately when i use the titans key to play online i get the error message there is an updated version of age of mythology that is required to play
when i click on the button to update the game however it claims to be up to datehow do i get a working version of this game that plays onlinethe game i have received the actual cd image of the game is black and white and when loaded into my cd drive the disk isnt recognized
i have tried two other laptops and the same thing happen
i think this was a cd was a label print image printed on the cd but with a blank cd
dont buymany reviews here complain about receiving a compositesvideo cable rather than the purely svideo cable that is pictured
i saw some recent reviews that claimed they received the correct one so i decided to try ordering it to avoid getting a crappy cable that poorly splits the video between the composite and svideo leads
unfortunately what i received was indeed a crappy compositesvideo cable that poorly splits the video
whats even better is that i cant process this item through a normal return
feven though it got terrible reviews on the advice of many people who claimed it recieved an unfair rap i picked up two worlds collectors editionit is the worst  game ive ever played even with the patch it runs like with crap with stuttering and slowdown
i tried installing it to my hd but it didnt help
the faces look terrible as well
the dialogue makes me ill the interface is a direct rip from the pc and is horribly cumbersome to use on the box
the text is small and bleary even in hdi got killed by boars and wolves and maybe some rocks toothe collectors edition is also terrible
i bought it because i heard you get special codes for collectors edition only weapons
but apparently thats just for the pc version
so all you get is a crappy box worse then the regular edition box a paper map a tiny tabletop rpg book nobody will actually play and a behind the scenes dvd with no actual behind the scenes just random crappy gameplay videosdo not buy this gamei made the mistake of purchasing this game before seeing reviews or playing a demo of any kindi got it the week it came out but got frustrated and bored very very quickly after getting into the gameas most reviewers before me have said graphics definitely arent nextgen hidef by any stretch of the mind i wouldnt say they are downright worst i have ever seen but its not anywhere near where the graphics should be on a i dont mind games where you cant take  hits before being killed
i loved rainbow six vegas
but this game the absolutely most by far frustrating thing in this game is when you are seen and if you do not manage to unload an entire clip into the vampire before it gets to you you have almost a zero percent chance of living they hit you once and it takes off  of your life
almost immediately after they first strike you and knock you back you are hit a second time and it is game over and time to reload the checkpoint and probably have the same thing happen againi will admit i havent beaten the entire game yet
i played it for a while when i first got it but then put it away for a while due to frustrating gameplay
i have started it back up but only because since i paid  bucks for it i might as well complete it before i turn it in for something elsealso as i mentioned it does tend to be extremely boring at times
i wouldnt consider it an action game or at least not a very good one because there is hardly any real action in the game asides from your character being killed
rest of the game is slowly walking sneaking around town and avoiding all you see
so if you want to kill a lot of vampires dont get this game
get rainbow six instead its still one of the best realistic actionfps games ive played on the  or even get bioshock or stranglehold if you like actionif your still interested in the game because you enjoy the whole stealth concept
try to find a demo first before buying to make surewhat happen here
this is game that could have been really good
the premise was great
what a waste
frist the game was just to hard
what is the point of having a weapon when its ineffective
i died more times in this game then i could count
i would stand a better chance of surviving a round of rushn roulette
this was supposed to be a squad based game but you were mostly solo
the voice overs sounded very scripted and poorly written
the whole game took place at night and during the rain hence the rain in the title
the vampires themself moved like they had some type of muscular disorder
they were wobblyshaaakyand slow until they found you and then all of a sudden they were flash gordon and could leap on top of three story building
there were no check points or saves so you when spent  mins playing a mission and died you got the joy doing all over again just to spend another  mins and die the same spot
i shot that undead freak  times and he still came at me full force
this could have been a real worth while game and might have even spawned a series but alas it was anything but fun
the only good aspect was the multiplayer
that was kind of fun
the only problem was no one playing itas i said before what a wastethis game is just ok i played it for about an hour or so hoping it would get better but to say it in short it is gonegive your money to a publisher that values you and their own product
ncsoft doesnt deserve your money and it will only break your heart when it closes your game and your characters are taken from youthe purpose of these cards is to allow people to pay cash for game time
since you cant pay with cash on amazon that defeats the whole purpose
if youre going to buy game time online use plaync its the same price or cheaper and you dont have to wait for delivery or pay extra to have it sooner
if you dont want to use a credit card go find these card in retail outletsthe inability to control the camera angle and zoom is unacceptable for a game for an advanced platform and for a game that cost so much
if this was a  special it would make sense
you cant control the camera angle at all you cant zoom in on objects or so you can even see your character
i have just started this game and probably will not finish it
there are times that the character is so small on the screen that it blends in with the background and i cant even see where it is forget about finding ladders to climb or treasure cheststhe incredibly long cut scenes are an annoyance and the story doesnt really existi just finished morrowind so this game was an incredible let downi have only one good thing to say for this game it is visually stunning one of the most beautiful games i have ever played
everything else i have to say about this game is negative
the characters lack depth and bore the player to tears
characters motivations are either unbelievable or nonexistent
the dialog is even worse than the characters
it is repetitious the obvious is stated over and over and seldom contributes to the development of the plot or of the characters
we soon find ourselves wishing chopin would just die and end it allin the beginning of the game we are told polka can use magic but she is terminally ill since only terminally ill characters have magic powers
we expect polkas magic to be a key factor in the game but in fact she  never has need of it
polka as one of the lead characters should also be one of the strongest characters
instead she is a powerless wimp who ends each failed attack with the words im sorry
since there are a total of nine playable characters one soon stops playing her
however it is necessary to level up all the characters because the game will suddenly force you to battle using a character you have not chosen to use
by leveling up all the characters we soon run out of necessities such as  floral bouquet
to replenish most needed items we must get them from treasure chests because the local shops do not sell them
treasure chests are few and far betweenthe battle system is horrible
in the later stages of the game when we play a boss the system attempts to make the boss more difficult to beat by constantly moving it in front of your player characters so it becomes impossible to control them because we cant see them
each turn is time based
nearly half of each timebased turn is spent approaching the monster which has been moved away from the player character during the monsters turn
the monsters of course have distance attack but only two of the player characters do and their distance attacks are very weak
to replenish lost health points or to revive a character during battle requires that another character lose its turn
we are never allowed to know how many health points belong to the monsters so we never know our status in relationship to themthen there are the musical sessions
unless we read music our chances of success with them are slim and nonethese are just a few of this games low points
unlike the typical xbox  game eternal sonata is completely two dimensional
there are no side quests either
in my opinion this game is not worth 
wait and buy it used at your local game store at a price appropriate to its lack of qualitythis is not a strategy game
i have rifle man getting killed by pike man and archers moreover i have panzer tanks being destroyed buy horse archers and mace man the idea of the game is to get better technologies than your rival however it really doesnt matter how far ahead you are
when the enemy attacks and when theyre far behind in technologies its still one to one per unit
the games units are far more effective than yours are
again this is not a strategy gameordered thix xbox and received in good time
problem is that when my son put a new game in that he got from amazon also this is what happened
he played it for about  min and it stopped
he took the disc out to reload thinking it just froze up
well the cd had a big grove scratched it it about a  inch wide and the whole way around the disc
when contacted they said send it back and they will check it out
they emailed back and said it isnot doing anything and will refund money but not replace the ruined game
i think that their machine ruined it they should replace it
will never order from them again
my son used his own birthday money christmas and chore money to buy the xbox and game himself
not a good experiencealright ive had this console for about a year now everything that it says it does it dosnt
it is not quiet infact it is really loud and i have to turn up my tv to watch movies cause the noise is so distracting
my new xbox is coming in the mail in  days and it better be better than an elite
im hoping the slim is a lot better in quality and sound
 problems im having with the elite is
the disc tray stopped opening and now jams when half way open
freezes constitaly which sucks durring mw
really loud and annoyingoutdated price i was looking for a cheaper price on xbox s here at amazon but they are  plus over most other places
this one is for instance is  over the same system bundled with relet me start this off by saying i have been a loyal xbox consumer for quite some time bought the original system at launchtodays experience with microsoft has been an absolute eye opener as far as the quality of their products and their complete lack of service overall
i have had my  system for a few years and bought the elite and newer models of the systems to avoid the problems that everyone else was experiencing with their consoles
this morning i went to turn on my  to experience the dreaded red ring of death that i have heard about so many times from so many of my friends
so i called microsoft to see if i can have it repaired only to get the answer that my warranty had expired mere days ago
they did however offer to repair the system for half the price of a brand new system  the new xbox  being released in a month retails at  with no mention of an upgraded warranty after this one would have gotten fixed
naturally i decided to decline especially since i had a backup system upstairs my fiancees
i got to play one game for about a half hour and decided to switch to a different game low and behold a second system broken in one day this time the drive door would not open not to worry this system was made later and should still be under warranty right
wrong the answer the technician gave me for this system is because this is a different problem the warranty does not count for as long so essentially two broken systems in one day
please be very cautious when buying any products from microsoft in the futureps all the way
i was an xbox fanboy for the longest time until i went through  s due to rrod and had  hardware failures on original xbox
no more xboxs for me sticking with what works my  ps blu ray d game consoles that havent had a glitch at all including my launch day gb which is coming up on  years old and gets used frequently
now thats how it should be microsoft
the only complaint about the ps that i have is how long it takes to download psn content and updates but other than that ps is the way to goi bought this for like  bucks used at gamestop and i brought it home and played it
as soon as i started playing it i realized it sucks
it is no fun do not buy this or rent this
i returned it and got lair
which is betterwell maybe i just dont get these  games but i gotta tell yathey all suckhorrible graphics and three of the worst games everbut hey
you get three of them
so great value
sarcasmi wouldnt buy this is my life depended on it
unfortunately i did but it and i gave it away the very next dayhackers all over on team fortress and if you can get this on the computer i would recommend it greatlyive been playing the game a few days now  but one thing made me post this  star review right now  i just spent about minutes battling and moving my way up but there werent any save points  after  minutes of battle i got killed andare you kidding me i started at the checkpoint from minutes ago and have to redo all of that 
 starfrom the moment i started playing this game i knew i had made a mistake
the first flaw i noticed was the utter lack of online game play
this game absolutely lends itself to online game play much like animal crossing
why ea chose not to pursue online game play is beyond methis game could have been a lot better if it had even the smallest bit of online game playthe second flaw i noticed was the utter lack of character interaction
players of the sims who are used to the interactive character relationships should not expect the same from mysims
character interactions are limited to such feeble actions such as laugh converse and cry
and this is further limited by the fact that you can only engage in such interactions while youre trying to fill in their friendship meter
after that character interaction is reduced to nothingfinally the actual game play is severely limited
theres absolutely nothing to do in this game
i got bored of this game  minutes after i started playing
first they had me meet all the residents
then they had me plant flowers
then they expected me to single handily restore the town to its former greatness by making it beautiful and attracting more residents and tourists
sound familiar
if youre thinking animal crossing then youve nailed it
if youve played animal crossing both for the ds and gamecube and sucked all the fun out of it then you shouldnt play this game
your animal crossing game play experience has already opened your eyes to the stuff these type of games try to feed you
this is probably why i got so bored of the game after  minutes of game play because i knew exactly where everything was going
mysims much like animal crossing was trying to trick me into becoming a slave of petty and repetitive tasks such as planting flowers talking to people and making them happy and running endless errandsi was expecting something different and creative from ea
i had hoped that they could turn the lame animal crossing concept into something fun and interactive
however im not going to find that in mysims for the ds
hopefully mysims for the wii is a little better
at least the build it concept where you build the townspeople their homes and furniture is something new that we havent seen in games like animal crossing and harvest moonthey could have done more for this game i bought this about last year for my brother so we could play across pc and xbox live and not only is the community dead theres no dlc to help make the game better and the latest and final patch removed the codec that allowed me and my brother to communicate so we couldnt speak to each other
ps this game isnt friendly to different operating systems other then windows vista
my brother had to lower his settings on his powerful computer just to play a mediocre gameenemy territory quake wars doesnt break any new ground
after playing similar titles i found this one to be medicore at best for some
there may be some out their who like the alien ie
strogg part of the game which is one of the few things that i liked
i guess i will list what i consider to be the goodies in the game
first all maps are available you can play either side you can practice with the bots
strogg has mech
thats about all i liked what i didnt like the sound is pitifull your weapons sound like the very first games on a nitendo or a pc with a primitive sound card
some of the vehicles you cant drive and shoot at same time
no st person view in the vehicles except for some turret views
a lot of these type of games can get repitive but are still fun i was bored in about  hours and wished i had held out for battlefield bad company and just rented etqw
the graphics are medicore to me the game looked like it was produced just to make money
just from looking at the amount of reviews so far two it doesnt look like a lot of people have gotten too excited by it
also some games the controller layout is pretty intuitive this is not one of those games
no melee you get a knife but by the time you switch to it or grenade well its too long to cycle through
also like all quake games its speeded up which is ok unless you like a more realistic game like call of duty  this one always sound like a herd of mice fleeing a cat
my suggestion is to try it before you buy it
if you liked the pc version you will probaly like the  porti purchased this expansion when it first came out and couldnt stop playing it
im in the process of tracking down which of my games have securom hiding in them
this nasty little trojan doesnt remove itself from your system when you uninstall the game
well this has the nastiest version hiding in it
too bad i really liked this game
i hope etw ships without securom hiding in it
ill have to spore that one too if it does
at least plain mtw shipped without itif you think this n controller is original you are wrong
they sell you this chinnese version with poor quality material wich even doesnt work
i just plugged it into my n and it made my n burst into fire
there was this smoke coming from the controler then the n stopped working
it burned to a crisp my n circuits
dont buy thiswell i ordered it it came and i was pleased to see that the zapper was clean and looked in working condition
however it wouldnt work when i plugged it into my nes it didnt work with the ever popular duck hunt game i have which i play on my  television set so i was disappointed
its the sellers fault for not testing the product beforehand
just be careful of who you order fromthis game did not work on any of my computers
therefore i cannot recommend it to anyone
buy something from the assassin collection and youll be much happieri was not able to download this game on a laptop that is less than yrs old
furthermore although i could download on another laptop only  mos old
 it was unable to play
it seems to me that moh could sell a lot more games if they would keep in mind users that dont have the latest technology on their pcs
ive enjoyed previous moh games but will now stay away from any new products from this companyi actually liked mohairborne when i could play it and despite it being just another normal game glossed with a new way to start each mission and despite it being way too short
i actually anticipated this game quite a bit during its long and drawn out production because like many people i am both a casual gamer and a wwii history nut
specifically ive read quite a bit about the airborne so was interested to mix two of my hobbiesill talk about the good stuff first
the game looks pretty good
the weapons details are better than most games but get pretty unrealistic at times
i kind of liked being able to earn new weapons as time went on and upgrade them
that adds fun in any game
i really despised finally unlocking the broomhandle mauser pistol and not being able to select it on earlier missions after beating the game
things like that are just retardedthe missions gave an open feel even though they werent but they were interesting and varied
and while not neccessarily historically accurate at least some of them were based on historical actions
ill not fault any game for losing historical accuracy because it is a gameand for the badi had a horrible time installing and playing this game
horrible
the worst experience of my life getting a game to work
the official forums and support pages were absolutely no help
they all said the same things which i tried time and time again to no avail
i finally stumbled onto comment posted on a forum on some other website that i cant remember that mentioned trying something completely different
that worked
horray i can playso i played through with only minimal crashes
the bad parts of the actual game were the same old things that bug me about most of these games
they have some spots with endless enemies spawning and very robotic ai
so the only way to advance at times is to bum rush and hope you dont die
thats annoying
it was way too short
the final mission was kind of cool but insanely unrealistic and not up to the hype that the plugs i read about the game hinted at
something about the biggest and most awesome wwii map ever
okay they made it big
but it just didnt make any sense at all
if its that crazy of an aa tower how did a c drop you onto the top of it
whatever
i just got mostly tired of spots that required too much luck to make it through
moh and i had some good times but they were plagued by frustrations along the wayso then i upgraded my hard drive
i go to install it again and it crashes my system
my pc instantly shut off
every time
and it didnt wait around either
as soon as i close the disk tray it dies
it doesnt reboot just dies
so moha sits on my shelf
im so glad i only paid  for itoh yeah and remap your iron sights button to mouse   it helpsany one want to give me graphics   could have been more streamlined but they were realy goodlevel design  decent too much reliance on the old infinite enemy spawns gag too shortstory   at best  no real developmentgameplay    at first till i remapped the iron sights buttonphysics   i guess nothing really special but you get to parachute in and that requires a little game physics right
bugs   any game you cant play is a crappy game
any game you have to jump through hoops of fire with sars rubbed all over them to get to work is still a crappy gamethat gives this game a failing grade of something like 
in college we graded on a curve and that would be a b but not the case here operation avalanche will never yield you anything more than a star rating on any difficulty
theres not enough enemies to earn you the points operation varsity your first encounter with the mg wielding soldier in the train yard on expert difficulty is nearly impossible to survive by making a run for cover before otherwise getting ambushed from all sides by the enemy if you choose to stay crouched behind the crate
that said a fivestar rating is extremely difficult to acquire unless you press esc and quickly reload your last checkpoint right before you die the enemy ai is flawed  by this i mean they shake convulse and twitch when you take the springfield and zoomin on static not dynamic enemy troops such as snipers or enemies behind cover some weapon upgrades are completely nonsensical such as the faster holsterdraw on the  pistol or the scope on the stg the reload on the pumpaction shotgun is ridiculous as per each shot the gun is pointed upward to jack out the spent shell and load a fresh one into the chamber
its poor form the bar rifle goes from bad to worse with the upgrades as the zoom increases when you aim down your sights and the recoil already bad as it is that bumps the rifle upward making it that much more difficult to deal with the mp submachinegun after all the upgrades comes with a  rnd magazine but the thompsons with the drum magazine only allows for  rounds
before the nd upgrade to the thompsons the muzzle flash is a nuisance and unrealistic as hell unless you were firing it in pitch darkness
a rnd singlestack magazine on the mp is a goofy upgrade the last two levels of the game every enemy soldier is packing an stg which makes it nearly redundant to take something other than an stg into these maps because theres no other ammo lying around anywhere save for a couple large green containers that will restock your supplies just oncethese facts aside at least the levels were unique and eyecatching
however that doesnt allow airborne to save facethis game is already dropping in price the first time ive seen a fps drop this quickthe why is simple it just doesnt deliver on any levelbots are dumb as dirt
mp maps are small and dark
if you fire you show up on radar and if you kill an opponent he sees a video of your firing spot and he re spawns and comes after you in seconds
with no voip your totally out of comm with your teammates
clanners using teamspeak or vent win over and over and over
not much funmp browser is the worst ive ever seen
long long wait for browser to finish a refresh and you cant use browser until done
lots of servers listed but no players on them
filters dont function
i installed the patch but didnt address any of the problemsan ok first time shooter for kids but no adult interestvery pretty if you have high end graphics
cpu intensiveunbeknownst to you this particular sims  expansion pack will install securrom a rootkit style copy protection created by sony to your pc and you wont be able to get rid of it
its been known to screw up hardware configurations left and right
nastythe expansion was really bad but the worst part is some kind of program called securom that installs itself on your computerthe problem is that sometimes when i try to start the game this unwanted program locks the whole computer and i cant do a single thing i have to turn it off by the powerbutton which is not healthy for a computerthis happens  times when i try to play the game and its not worth risking destroying my computer so im uninstalling this game and never buying a sims game againi was really excited to get my hands on this newest expansion pack in the sims  franchise
unfortunately it didnt live up to my expectationsim running windows xp with more than one gigabyte of memory which according to the requirements on the box should be more than enough
it isnt
i experienced the worst slowdown in loading times
even pets wasnt this bad
to load the game took nearly five minutes
to load the neighbourhood took another five
then it was another couple of minutes to load a lot
i thought that my custom content was perhaps slowing things down
so i got rid of all of it
i didnt notice any difference
i cant imagine trying to run this expansion pack with the recommended minimum  megabytes of ram
im not sure the game would ever even loadi took my sims on two vacations
for the first i took a single woman to twikkii island
i noticed how slow it was right away
with all the other sims wandering around these vacation lots theres bound to be a bit of lag
i had her visit the beach
it rained and the gameplay grew even slower
i had her visit some ancient ruins
the game slowed almost to a stop when she encountered a hot springs it mustve been the steam animation
it was just too much for my computer
plus each time my sim walked to another lot there were more minutes of loading timefor the second vacation i took a couple and their child to the mountain vacation destination
by this time the loading times were really starting to annoy me
i only had them visit one other lot and i made the mistake of having the mother and daughter play on the log roll
the mother got completely stuck and i had to look up how to free her using the debugging tool
a search of the bbs on the official site shows that i am not the only one to experience this problemi didnt bother having my sims visit the far east destination
by the time i got my poor glitched family back from their vacation id had enoughthe developers seem to be using their customers as beta testers
thats fine if they tell you that
but when i buy an expansion pack for my favourite game i dont want to have to avoid certain gameplay experiences until a patch is released
these issues  if they are as common as they appear to be  should have been addressed before the games were finalized and shippedive uninstalled bon voyage
ill go back to playing with the setup i had before
and ill seriously think twice before wasting my money on the next piece of memoryhogging garbage thats released under the sims  brandi sent a message three days ago never heard back i want my money back really bad because im not able to use it and i didnt just spend like  bucks for nothingthis game requires a anti piracy download known as securom its been known to disable cd burners slow your pc and even disable it purchase at your own riskbought this to adapt my old ps pelican joystick to my ps
does not work at all
i have one of the  gig pssdont waste your money
i bought one off a seller here st one functioned one out of every  times i tried to use it even then it took ten minutes worth of fiddling with it to get it to work
this is with multiple ps controllers
just received a second one from the seller today guess what does not function at all
i dont know if its bad luck or just crap
 adapters  barely works the other doawas not as it appears in the preview images
the first time i tried to disconnect a ps controller from it all the wires ripped outtry and get this game to work in vista i dare youwith gb memory an  gts video card and the game looks like quake back in  what the hell is going on 
no patch no support no help go  to hell if you think im recommending this turd to my friends
puarfswarningi bought crysis as part of a package with crysis warhead and crysis  and found out the game has problems when using hdmi output
i am not able to run the game on my projector via hdmi and have no problems running other modernday gamesits a know issue with the crytek issue that people have complained about in the past but crytek has never bothered to fix it based on my research on the internetanyhow avoid this title if you are running a pure hdmi output to your monitorsno one has mentioned that this game is copy protected by securom that that will install a virus on your hard drive you can not removealso because there is limited game play anyone would be a fool to buy it usedso much for reselling it on amazoni sure wont buy one used or notthis whole limited play thing is designed so you can not resell the gamewhat a rip offi have a decent pc and have run many games
this is the first program i could load it would begin get about  minute into the introduction and freeze
i followed all of the suggestions even had someone with far greater computer skills than i load it and the same thing happened
i was disappointed but returning it was not unpleasant and while it did cost a few bucks it would not preclude me from considering another
do pay attention to the previous complaints about a system hog
it isbought the game and the dvd wont even load on a win bit pc
makes it look as though its empty
its not empty and started to load on an underpowered xp
take a long look at all the negative comments here
they are overwhelmingly technical issues
they are overwhelmingly unresolved
either the ultra advanced technical issues get you or the security will
it doesnt look like its possible to return
if youre looking for more frustration in your life this is the game for yousteam
gotta hate it
i have a satellite connection with hughes
i have mb of highspeed bandwidth before the fair access policy kicks in and slows me down to dialup speed like a virtual bungee cord
you get two dvds with a pile of data  like gb
on them but steam just has to download everything off the web
why even sell a physical box if you are going to force us to download it all anyway
i am pretty sure the games rock but i may never actually know because i have to download so muchnow hughes has a time they allow us to update without it costing against our bandwidth and if you could set steam to update at that time it would work
i wouldnt be mad but no there is no way to control when it updates only how fast
the cake is a lie
if it were not for steam this package of games would be so perfect
god hates steam and so do i only the truly fortunate uber  with true cable connections can ever just ignore the problem valve shoves into peoples laps by selling them virtual product in a physical package
may gnats fly up the nose of all valve staff and half suffer dice sized kidney stones for this annoyance
gestures obscenely and storms offedit ok  years later and i have cable
while i still despise intrusive drm schemes steam actually gives something in return patching i have over  games in steam now and depending on which games i have loaded on my hard drive patching is automatic
its nice to not have to search for a patch download it from some site that may or may not want an email address to spam you forever and ever
just automatic updating
good stuffno disk needed to play
click a shortcut and play a game
no searching for disks to slap in your rom to play a game
almost makes it worthwhile by itself imho steam friends and community service is awesome
all your friends see where you are playing online and join you or invite you to play with them
a simple app that works great server listing and game matching
pretty neat and simple server listing where you can save or black list servers to your list steam store is a great place for good deals on games plus an endless list of free demos to choose fromso while i still dont like that steam owns your game and gives you permission to play read the eula srsly and if they ever go out of business or get sold the terms of service can be changed any way they see fit
you are not buying games
you are paying for the right to play the games for an undetermined amount of time
they reserve the right to stop access to those games at any time and you agree to it all if you install steam
if you can get past that they are greatalso bandwidth
cable web access is a must
you will not be happy with anything less than m dsl
every game you buy will be completely downloaded from the web and patched before you can even play it
if you have a disk for the game chances are it will only have steam on it
offline mode is only good for a few days at a time
steam is miles ahead of the ea games online store but it has a huge bandwidth demand with new gamesi loved hl
i loved hl e
this episode however is both uninspired and frustrating
too many missions which are thinly disguised timed missions
you know wave after wave of mobs are thrown at you and if one makes it past you through one of the areas you are guarding have failed and thus get to restart
the plot that is being advanced is well about as original as as an mstk movie
your new weapon is a mine you must fire with the grav gun  so it sticks to a mob and then switch to another wep and hit the mine so it explodesbtw if the mine gets hit by enemy fire even when it is in your grasp it crumbles
also if you miss and land it near the mob the mine merely shatterswow
what a great innovationand this is the wep you get for one of the timed missionsthe last boss missionsadly also this entire episode only takes about  hours to finish if you explore a lot
you are not getting a lot of content for your dollarthis is the star wars galaxies of the hl franchisethis game uses steam  a digital distribution digital rights management multiplayer and communications platform developed by valve corporationsome of the problems with steam privacy  steam collects information from users without notifying the user at the time of collection or offering an optout
this leads many people to consider steam to be a form of spyware
steam is a worldwide delivery system yet it allows publishers to geographically restrict where a game is available and at what price
many people have found that in regions outside the us games are either not available or are sold at grossly inflated prices compared to the us
to play a game that uses steam you must connect over the internet to the steam website and create a steam account
so if you are without internet access you will be denied access to run your game
also steams internet servers are not guaranteed to be running at all times so you will also be denied access to your game if their servers are downi like game software owning what i purchase
valve software and steam the internetbased registration process prevents me from ever buying halflife anything anymorei was one of the few lucky ones to get steam to work on my pc when i purchased halflife  but then i realized that i bought a licensing scheme not a gamenever again no matter how good the gameis supposed to bei bought the orange box three days ago
for some reason the games are trying to download themselves from steam rather than installing off of the dvds
so far only the original half life has installed
this is after leaving my computer running nonstop for two whole days
occasionally the install craps out with the steam servers are too busy
try again in a few minutes and i start the install againif the games arent finished installing by tomorrow  hours after purchase i am sending this back for a refundi got these game for the multiplayer aspect of the game and team fortress is the only multiplayer that comes with it i think they are being a little dishonest whyle selling the gamegive me a freakin breaki go in and buy a box and i want the games not the software to download the game
i should not have to upgrade my line of communication in order to download a game
also i should not have to be online or in online mode to play a gamethe games once downloaded i awesome and i like to play them
but i will never buy another steamvalve box of download softwareonce they go belly up how do i get to keep my gamesmikeah the big title that started the digital rights management fiasco that ruined the entire pc gaming community
gone are the days where you could buy a game enjoy it for a while then give it a friend or donate it to charity
now you must purchase games sightunseen for  dollars and they will act like they are doing you a favor by letting you play the game you paid for
if you decide to move dont have internet access or play the game in a way they dont agree with they will not hesitate to not only deny you access to the game you paid for but every other game you ever purchased through steamthe same problem no listed minimal requirments no listed notice that an internet hook up is requiredand broadbandnot even on the boxanyway refer to my review about fear
 for a more indepth explaination
sorry for being such a stick in the mud with you gamers but this is all i can do to make the producers of these programs straighten up and give out all the required informationanyway as far as the orange box goes i still dont know what the minimal system requirments are even after looking inside the box
futher the fact you have to have a internet connection isnt listed nor is the fact you must have broadbandsodespite having a new computer systemmy system wont run these games because steam requires internet connection and broadbandi dont have broadband and my server cuts off after four hoursi really think all of us should get together and give everybody who doesnt list all requirments the one star middle finger
after all the people who make these programs know the requirments and they know we need to know these requirments the only reason they dont list them isthey want everybody whether you can run it or not to buy their gamegreedif anybody can prove me wrong im more than willing to edit this review and the one about fear i wont try to change the star ratingbut i would update what ive said to the factual trutha good start would be if you had the orange box and you could find the minimal system requirments listed and point it out to meanother would be if you have  dialup and managed to installupdate and run this program
if you have broadbanddont waste our timeonce again sorrybyeorange box is region locked like no other game before
if you buy this game in one country and bring your laptop to another country theres a good chance steam wont let you play it
this isnt mentioned anywhere on the box or in the license agreement its just a nasty surprise you get
so if you buy this game in the usa and take a trip to japan with your laptop chances are you wont be able to play the game because steam will detect youre using a japanese ip addressright now valve is locking this game down by country but next they may lock it down by state or even city
sorry you bought the game in los angeles you cant play it in san diegonegative five stars for a defective product
valve stole my moneyive been shopping on amazon since the late s
ive been playing video games since the early s
between the two ive probably bought over  different video games through amazon for a dozen different game systems and computers
the orange box is without a doubt the worst game purchase i have ever made here
not only do i feel completely cheated not only do i feel as if i am in fact owed several hundred dollars in frustration fees i actually think my overall interest in video games has been damaged by this monstrous piece of marketing vomit masquerading as a playful gamer utopia
that is how ridiculous this piece of trojan horsed garbage isthe culprit is a smarmy little ferret of a program called steam
i dont know who came up with this but i hope they get hit by a bus and buried in a fire ant den
simply put steam is an orwellian nanny program that requires you to basically convert your computer into an internetenabled marketing survey to even access the games you own but that steam controls
once upon a golden time when you bought a game you could put the cd in your computer and simply play it perhaps with an activation key
but with steam you have to set up an entire account larded with nefarious third party vendors just to have a fighting chance of even downloading the games that are supposedly just included in the orange box
fantasticand guess what  there is no mention of steam anywhere in the orange box
none
the entire instruction manual for the orange box consists of a single twosided set of control instructions for the actual games
i guess they just forgot to print the oh by the way you need officially licensed steam spyware to install or play any of these games suckers lineri have never been more disgusted and embarrassed by a purchase before and ive been to amsterdam
i strongly encourage everyone to give deep and abiding thought to whether they really want to pay  a pop for the privilege of having customized spyware run roughshod over their computer
i guess this  game  if you manage to navigate  layers of watchdog control game deal really is too good to be trueill never buy another steam game never never never
it will simply not install from dvd on xp
according to the web it used to but it no longer works and forces you to download the entire  gig game
be prepared to wait for hours and hours for something you paid money for already my download took  hours
to enter the activation key the easy part you must do it manually via steam the setup program just disappears after you specify english language leaving no hint of even this first step
what a horrible experience even with a simple fast pc setup
ill never never never ever buy a steam game againwhat a huge waste of money
for the love of fps gaming please wait until the bargain bin
okay here are the pros and consprosnice graphicsgreat concept if executed wellcons you do the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and overhave i made my point yet like playing an fps game with full cheats on limitless ammo never ending onslaught of critters with no real reason i agree with another reviewer like a flash game which would be free no strategy period at all the worst runngun overload getting to the second level iswelllike getting to the rd levelrepeat ad nauseum holy crap i would have paid someone  to mug me outside the store just so i would not have the money to buy this posinteresting idea if they would have built a story strategy the real urgency to stay alive level design more sneaking scaring and more survival tactics this could have been so much funbut alasnotmy one star is merely for how long the installation and waitto play the game took once i got it and not the actual game itself
i have a k connection and it was the longest wait ever on a game installationthe only drawback i can see to this game is the lack of variety in weapons
the things like molotovs gas cans propane tanks are very coolthe gatlin guns are fun  although not quite as useful as you would imagine if the hordes happen to be comnig fro a direction the gun wont point  lolfor a horror movie fan like myself its a great game
id say the hunting rifle is my personal favorite especially when zooming in and going for head shots it looks like something right out of the new dawn of the dead or romeros diary of the dead
the hospital level really reminds me of that movie
i would say if you enjoy pc shooter and horror movies or even just into zombie flicks or  days later then this is the perfect game for youthe only thing more horrifying than the zombies in the game is the steam co steam is an online service offered by valve corporation
they take total control over the game itself and you cannot deal directly with the valve co they have no phone numbers well one dead one
no one to contact but steam on line
i have found they will not help you with any problems
i wish i read the problems other people had before i bought the game
this is a real answer they sent mehello ma staff member has replied to your questionwe will not be able to assist you with this issuethe thing is i sent them the problem and this was the response
they will not answer any more 
great game but do not buy it for pcsteam or not it still forces you to connect online and register the copy then its yours
you cant sell it now even though you paid for it
steam is like securom just dished out differently but it is still a draconian drmi wont buy iti am an avid zombie lover
love the movies love the games love the books love zombiesso i picked up left  dead thinking it might be a bit more exciting thandead risingthis is probably the most hollow game i have ever played in my lifezero storyline zero character development and unbelievably repetitive gameplay
enter area shoot straggling zombies incoming horde attacks kill horde kill smoker right after horde attack ends
the single player is a jokethere is no scrounging for weapons food or ammo
almost all ammunition is gotten at checkpoints theres no objectives to complete
your character can take about  punches from regular zombies before dying yes punches
these zombies dont even bite all they do is claw punch or kickthe multiplayer mode is barely fine and gets boring real fastthe versus mode is just aliens versus predator with better graphicsif you want to get an idea of what this game is like without wasting your money play boxhead more rooms and imagine what multiplayer would be likeas for the difficulty levels yes extreme is hard yes it requires more team work but does it change the overall premise of the game play
no
its still just you and your friends spraying and praying a bunch of bots
so if that your idea of the a good time then by all means go out and buy it and then be sure to put down  more when your copy becomes obsolete in a few months
go valve
way to protect that bottom lineive been playing medal of honor since the very first game on playstation
this is the only game series ive played where each successive generation is worse than the lastwhere to start
first of all weapons
i remember being able to use the garand very effectively in medal of honor and medal of honor  underground the latter is still the best game in the series in my view
now it is nearly useless because enemies run at the speed of light
singleshot rifles have next to no chance of hitting anybody unless youre very far away and they dont know youre there or the enemy is just two feet in front of you
and the enemies of this game have a horrible kamikaze god ai that will allow them to rush you disappear out of the sight of your hyperactive camera and knock you out while youre spraying bullets into them at pointblank range
lets say you have a good high perspective from which to snipe your enemies
your character will refuse to move to a place where you can actually you know see the enemies
and if you happen to get a good spot sniping your enemies your allies will gleefully rush to your spot and protect the enemies by blocking your scope right at the minute you press your trigger or stick their big bodies right in your path of retreat so you cant move
artificial intelligence apparently only apply to italian and german enemies and not to allied troopsapparently somebody at electronic arts confused himself with a filmmaker because this game is chock full of visual tricks that make it a pain in the behind to play
when you get hit by a bullet the whole screen shakes and turns white so that you cant see whos hitting you
when you use a sniper rifle the scope is blurry for the first two seconds so if youre being fired upon youll have to wait for about  bullets to finish hitting you before you can even start aiming
when youre outnumbered the game will experience lags so that youll suddenly teleport to a few feet from where you were completely disorienting you
and heres one of the worst parts  if you get a weapons upgrade within a level say a grenade launcher for your rifle the game will go into slowmotion for  seconds and  get this  automatically switch you to the new weapon without your consent
since these levelups can happen while youre fighting  enemies in front of you the slowmo makes you a sitting duck because all commands such as switching weapons or reloading are disabled while the slowmo happens
thanks a lot ea for forcing me to switch to grenades while im fighting closequartersevery single cut scene in this game is in real time
ive tried mashing every button available but theres no way to skip them
so if youre replaying a mission to try to get better scores or weapons upgrades you have to wait through all the movies you cant just skip ahead
this feature is moronic in the extremebut the part that infuriates me the most is the checkpoint system
ive been replaying the lower levels of this game repeatedly convinced that i just needed time to build up my strategies get used to the game improve my weapons and maybe then airborne would be more fun
but the checkpoints in this game are completely screwed up
even with autosave turned on you can complete five out of six objectives in a level get killed and then suddenly youd find yourself descending on a parachute again losing  minutes of game progress
what the
ive tried everything such as frequently using the save last checkpoint feature but this glitch seems to happen at random on one game id be able to continue from the last completed objective and then on another id be sent right back to the beginning again
nothing is worse than having to replay the same tired parts over and over while you try to get past that one superhard section near the end and thats exactly what this game doesit saddens me to remember how much fun i used to have with the medal of honor games
and the last three medal of honor games ive tried to play have all been too much eye candy and visual toys no funapparently there is no telling what you will actually get if you buy from this seller
i got a  watt power supply and it wont work in my xbox
i bought it because everybody else complained that they wanted the  watt xbox power supply but instead got the  watt version which is the one i needbasically there is no telling what you will end up getting if you order from these people
im returning the  watt and hopefully ill get a refundi ordered a new power supply for my xbox and it worked for only  days before it died on mesaid it was v blew as soon as i pluged it in
got a replacement from the seller and same thing on the second onethis game is no better than the origional
the fact that they put persians and yanks in it doesnt make it more enjoyablethese were the worst wrist straps ive ever seen in my life
absolute garbage quality
i wish i could give it  starsi have been a sudoku fan for about  years now
i do well at solving the difficult and fiendish puzzles in the new york post sudoku books in my opinion are the best sudoku books out there
i thought id divert from these puzzles and try a shot at platinum sudoku after reading some of the reviewsso far ive spent about  hours playing and have only solved  puzzles
the puzzles are frustrating and challenging
the easy mode is not that easy and ive barely scratched the surface on medium mode
the numbers in draft mode for guessing numbersis so small that you have to get out your reading glasses to see what youve marked
also the default font is incredibly hard to read and to get used to
unless you unlock some new fonts by completing several puzzles theres really not a good font to select
that alone makes the puzzles difficult to complete
one of the things i have to agree with many other reviewers is the stupid girl and guy that supposedly pumps you up and makes you feel like youve accomplished something after completing a puzzle
give me a break
it would have been nice to have the option to turn this feature off similar to the music optionthe graphics are okay but thats not what a good sudoku puzzle is all aboutall in all this game will be on my used games to sell list
my friend has ultimate puzzle gamessudoku edition and this beats out platinum sudoku by far
im also sticking to the old school version of paper and pencil with a real eraserthis is a well designed game that seems designed for young children
my six year old granddaughter enjoys it but comments on the ugliness
why did they feel the need to inject the sinister mood at so many points
one character says you only see the real me at night
whats that supposed to mean
there are many examples
it would be nice if they gave a simple start up option to configure the game for young children thus blocking the inuendoi picked this game up a week ago
i saw a video review some gameplay and it peaked my interest
i really enjoy animal crossing and expected this game would be the same
some folks had compared the two
the first thing i noticed was incredibly long load screens and so frequent it became annoying pretty fast
i cant accurately say if that gets any better as the game goes on
it was just too frustrating and i really couldnt get into the game itselfagain my review is based on first impression and very little play
i dont plan on keeping the game
rent the game before you buy is my best adviceit is a total waste of money
the design of this game is very bad
poor graphics make it hard to find evidences
navigation is difficult
the cases are not interesting at all
this is one of the worst xbox  games i ever havethis game promised to be a realistic shooter designed by the army itself that forced players to use tactics and teamwork in order to succeed ostensibly to offer average gamers an appreciation of what its like to be part of a real military unit
sadly the game utterly fails to deliver on that promisei would start by saying the graphics are lastgen but lastgen graphics would surely be insulted by such a statement
characters and environments remind me of shooters from  or  years ago no jokesound was hit and miss with the weapons fireeffects being pretty good but voice acting being horrible
in the interest of realism npcs call you by a nickname you choose from a list
good idea poor execution is this games mantra as the result sounds more like a voice you might hear on an automated phone menu your hold time is five minutes
the straw that broke my patiences back was the incessant panting your character produces even after only one or two stepseven worse is the frustratingly sluggish gameplay
movement is jarring and imprecise
when starting to move from a standstill your character must first windup in a fashion i simply cannot describe
the accompanying screen jerk made me want to vomit from motion sickness
maneuvering in tight quarters simply isnt possible
the menu system is shockingly overcomplicated actions as simple as changing weapons require a series of clicks and the resulting animation takes forever
the hit detection is an absolute farce it took me  tries to hit a stationary cardboard tank with a rocket launcher from only a few feet away the game simply did not recognise the first  hitsthe real knife in the back has to be the campaign which is actually just more training
you shoot bad guys your allies dressed in costumes with paintballs and the cheesy drill instructors follow you around barking your objectivesthis game should not be played by anyone anywhere anytimethese games are absolutely horrible
i have never played a game as bad as this in my whole life biggest waste of money and time do not get it save yourself the troublei really love mystery and puzzles games and when i bought this and played it i was very disapointed
i even tried playing other pw games but sadly i found them to be lacking in creativity good graphics and storyline
i think it is because it is a capcom game i have never liked their graphics very much
the most annoying thing was the constant jerky movements in the game
i traded this game in for a better gamei tried the demo but couldnt get it to install on my pc
i got a copy from my local library to try the full version
you cannot install it until you set up a steam account online
plus this had been borrowed before
only one person can have an account associted with a product key
do not buy a used copy buy a new one or you will have a useless copy
i already contacted steam and they said they could not reset the keys
buyer beware
buy new
i look forward to playing this game
i like what ive seen but not sure if it will be a pc version or get a  and its versionthis is my review after playing the  version and then trying the demo
lost planet is a pretty good game on  and while its fun factor can be argued its graphical quality cannot
it looks spectacular and offers a couple of new innovations in gaming that give a breath of fresh air from all the mediocre fpssfirst of all let me blow this idea out of the water right now that playing this game with a mouse and keyboard is more fun
its not
its less fun
im a pc gamer and agree that most games are more fun with mouse and keyboard
not this onesecond the graphics looked crappy on my pc but its not new or anything
however it should look better considering the great graphics i get on games like company of heroes and world of warcraft
my fps was way too low for these kind of graphics
its very nonoptimized for pc
it almost seems like an advertisement to buy a new windows vista pc so it will run better
it started out the game in some ridiculously low resolution i didnt even know existed
i have an old monitor and play in  x  but who uses any less than that
apparently the creators didnt know much about pc gamingthe port of this game from console to pc was not done well
even in gamespots full review they mention how the controls arent shown onscreen for the pc in other words it will say to enter press a or press b like the console version so you have to enter the menu to find which keys to press
are you freakin kidding me
the pc is a huge market and this is the amount of respect they give pc gamers
on one hand its kind of a good thing for console games to come to pc to give people without a  a chance to play
however they should put a little more work into it
some people are worried that the microsoft connection will be the end of good pc gaming and this game just worries me more
usually games port from pc to console  and while i would love to be able to play a few games on pc like ninja gaiden the fact is a lot of innovation happens on pc games and we dont want to see the end of that by rich lazy microsoft just making games for the  and porting them to pc in substandard fashion because its better for business
maybe they will get better about this over time but after playing the  version id say try this one before you buy itthis is a pure waste of money
the fact that the analog stick is on the same side as the dpad is dooming for the psp
lockon replacing looking up down left and right is stupid
yes the customization is cool but i was expecting an at least decent game
lucasarts battlefronts    are amazing
this however is a sham
shame on you lucasarts use your time for battlefront  or force unleashed for xbox  rather than this the game is fun and my  yr old really enjoyed it in his ps
it will get to a certain spot or certain areas and the game will freeze or play erractically
he really enjoyed the concept though but the game is terrible for trying to actually enjoy and will frustrate those who try to play it
i have no issues playong other ps games so i am not sure what the problem with the softwareon this is
the priceis good but really does not matter if it is unplayablethis was a really bad game
nothing real about it
nothing fun about it
if i could i would give it a zero out of  cause this is not what they said it was going to be like they made it look more real and fun while advertising it but never believe what you see cause this is not true the game sucked i thought when the first one came out it was bad to and what i was hoping for was improvement
the only difference is the story line and the rides everything else was the same boring and let me seeboring
when the first one was bad i was hoping for a second on and we got it but it was bad to
if they make another one they have no mind cause they should know by now that they cant do this and the third one well it wouldnt even cross my mind ti buy it
this game was bad and dont buy it
save your moneyplease tell me i am dreaming
seriouslyif you satisfy all of these conditions then this is your game you like extremely shallow games you want to have a reason to reduce you computer into metal shards you want to look at cheesy animation and graphics you like spending  for a pile of junk you want to use it as a prank birthday gift plenty more but i dont feel like writing for the sake of this gameget the point
this game is horrible
do not buy this gamethis is the worst game i have ever played besides bionicle the only reason i am even bothering to write this review is so all of you buyers can be warned of this game technically this doesnt even qualify as a game games are supposed to be fun
i like the empire earth series and the previous games were really fun but this on the other hand is quite the oppositegraphics gameplay story  there is nonesound presentation length  after two hours this will be off your hard drivestability major problems major lag i have a very good graphics cardscore   downright horriblethis game is garbage compared to ee and  what was the developer thinking
i cannot tell you not to buy this but if your a fan of the gender you wont like itshame because the lack of popularity of this game may kill out the ee linei agree with every negative comment made by the other users and cannot really add more complaintsstay awaydanif you loved the first empire earth you will hate this game
it is not fun boring and i had to deal with a million different glitches and other problems
i also had a problem because it was too slow
once you get into the game like most of these types of game can be lower because every nation has expanded and more units are doing something
however this game would take hours to load
this might be my computer but i have a windows  and a xp both doing the same thing
you should save your money on this gamethe web is peppered with users who cannot get this game to run on their computers and tech support is non existent
both xpp and vista are having issues with the game and there are many suggestions to fix it on the web none seemed to work
i run and xps  w vista business premium and the game would crash any time i picked a menu choice from the main menu
i would get a reloading resource and a stop functioning error
bad programming and worse support
demo worked finethis game is a drag unless you are a serious strategy and tactics buff
my nephew  hated it for the slow play and lapses in actionnba live  is the worst basketball simulation game out right now
its really easy to just give it to ur best player and have him drive in for the dunk or layup and its the same way for the ai its impossible to guard a dunk
i just played as the lakers against the celtics and the final score was  to 
both teams had over  points by the end of the rd quarter
besides the horrible gameplay the menus are terrible
the dynasty mode does have a lot of cool features but its still difficult to manage ur team because the menus arent fluid
ks menus are always very easy to go through
also u cant improve a plyers stats through dynasty like on k
the graphics are pretty good if u like comical disney graphics
the players look like they are all  foot and have huge heads and they look ridiculous running down the court
if ur looking to buy an nba game get ki read the reviews that said the game would not go past the load screen and ignored them
bad call on my part
dont make the same mistakei downloaded the ps demo on this and couldnt believe that anyone would release something this bad with all the great stuff out there now
this is great for the kids but come on how can you get into this after cod bad co ghostrecon and assassin
if you can more power to you i like to encourage progress myself not regression
ill save my bucks for the guys who put something into the game
i tried to find some good points but just couldnt
rock n roll babyi forgot to review this game long time ago when i bought it the story was so boring this game is like a really really bad version of gta the game was so buggy and what noti tried to play the game but it would freeze up so i didnt get to playthis game is a mediocre third person shooter
the game itself is kind of fun but for most people the game will not run unless you turn off the internet to your ps
this is because pandemic being the wonderful developers they are make it check for a ea tos agreement before allowing you to enter the servers and view the initial ea tos you are supposed to agree to
the only get around i found for this is to purchase a god awful game called army of two and agree to the tos on that game and then immediately proceed to play mercenaries
this is a lot of work to play a game that is not very fun to begin withthere is no way to play the game since ea took it offline
i would not buy this game if i had to do all over againmy advice is not to buy this game it is not worth the moneyit got me bored right after i played the first few minutes
even though ive wasted hours on it i dont want to continue to play it
one word to describe it is garbagewell the online server is going down next year and the idiots never offered lan supporti was excited about this game until i played the demo
the graphics are good but overall game play is boring
those of you that love diablo  you will find this game lacking the intensity
overall dont waste your money or try looking at call of duty  demo or timeshift demo
those games are better fpsif you want a lot of headaches then buy this game outright
if you want to be smart about it download and try the demo first
different people like different things so you may love this game or hate it gameplaywise
what is not in dispute though is that the game is definitely buggy
that point has come through in review after review so do youre self a favor and install and play the demo first
i expect well see a patch and a rerelease of the demo in the near future due to these issues
but testing your system out with the free demo will give you the headsup as to whether or not the game will be stable enough with your driverssystem specificationsi played the game completely through and in the end decided online play was worth a shot
being an engineer had many perks many interesting flying drones to do half the work for me as i mercilessly slew thousands of demons reminiscent of the good old diablo  dayssomething told me i would get more out of the game by logging in to the online server
but for some odd reason the hellgate london website would not run from any of my consoleshellgate london has no customer support or online play
that is unless youre a citizen of south korea
so if you love hellgate london any more than i do move to south korea and apply for a citizenshipdo not buy this game
sellers wont dare mention to game has no online support all for good reason
they want moneycirca  graphics and character models that look nothing like the quality in the cutscene movies think unreal you can only configure a few of the controls no voice acting on most dialog you read and flip pages boring linear levels that are not even atmospheric or spooky in rd person lame ai
i guess if you like fiddling with complicated character attributes and inventory this might be for you
this will be in the clearance  bin in about  monthsthats right you read and click your way through all the hellgate dialog just like the bad ol days
this issue seems to be oddly overlooked in many official reviews so i thought id lead with ithaving not been adequately warned myself
frankly i think it should be written across the game box in  point text
the text should be red and flashing
they could use the money they saved on voice acting to install leds and a little watch battery so the flashing could warn more peopleits  and scrolling through endless text boxes should be a deal breaker for a  game but heres the rest of the bad news in case you still carehellgate plays like a raw diablo stats engine stripped of everything that made the diablo games engaging
the developers seemed to cut every corner they could generic story boiler plate environments npcs that just stand around like lifeless mannequins animations that look like they came from  side quests that dont play into any larger story and are rewarded with the same crap you just purged from your inventoryjust buy something else or theyll make moreive never written a really bad review like this
there is always something worthwhile with these games
this one though is astonishing
it simply does not run  ever
i envy those who have played through to tell the tale
but i have never had such a miserable install so many bugs and patches that simply did not workea should be embarrassed
the error messages are simply too bizarre for words
this is  for goodness sake
no one releases code this nasty anymore
the patching mechanism simply does not work
you are forced to create an account otherwise you cannot have access to support but i already paid the you cannot download the patches you have to use eas miserable updater which does not work ever on any computer
i was shocked at the amount of codesoftware quality issues i see on the hellgate forums
i have never seen anything like it before
it seems like a large percentage of people simply cannot get the blasted software to workenough said
i never write reviewscommentary like this
i leave that to the naive  year olds who dont know how the world works
but this time i am seething with anger over this total waste of money and timei have been playing pc games for over  years now and this is quite honestly one of the most disappointing videogames i have ever played
on its own merits hellgate would just be completely mediocre and dreadfully dull but due to its infamous production history developer troubles and distinguished pedigree the game manages to underwhelm at every possible facet of playnow thanks to a public ip struggle and the recent layoffs of all the developers at flagship studios even that pitifully substandard gaming experience is in jeopardy
give this game a wide berth and just stay awaygrabbed  copies for my wife and i on release day a year ago
we tried playing for about a month
the party functions were just horrible most of the time we would both jump into the same zone only to not be able to see eachother
atleast  bugs found a night with casual playit might have been entertaining as a single player but not for the  i paid for itnow that they are shutting down the servers which is true i got the announcement from them its more of a fancy coaster if anything
you wont be able to download the patches and the single player game will be horrible without themhorrible graphicslousy controls you can find a better game online that is freedont waste your moneythis might be a fun game to play but everytime i get to the title screen the game tries to connect to the server  freezes up
i have tried at least  times  have now given up on itmercs  was one of my favorite games of last gen this game is a complete mess and is loaded with bugs
im really sad this game sucks so hard but i really hope they try again
seriously i loved the first one sooooo much that i would buy anotheri got this for a friends child who lives in paris
he couldnt find it there so he asked me if i could
well i did find it on amazon got it and sent it to him only to find out and i didnt know this before that france uses pal system while the us is ntsc system
i didnt know xbox has such issuesps doesnt
so be careful when sending it overseasthis game was just horrible
god drank beer
bad controlsnever went great
glad i sold it away
get minecraft insteadif ed wood made a video game itd probably end up like raw dangereverything about this game is bad often times in very funny ways
like how the bland voice actors refuse to say your characters name or how every one looks japanese yet is usually blonde
the dialogue is also hilariously cheesey horribly timed and executed with almost no enthusiasmunfortunately the bad is also present in the controls gameplay and well just about everything important for a good gamei cant tell you how hard it was to control your character whether it be lining up your character to respond to the environment talking to people even grabbing and pushing a cart i ended up having an easier time pulling it but since they didnt bother with a pulling animation my character ended up moonwalking the thing into the dining hallthe game does have its charms usually the result of that good old japanese quirk factor i love being able to have the ingame compass icon be the citys cat mascot or a pedometer that actually keeps track of your steps or the customization options are nice you can wear a ton of weird clothes as you save people from disaster and the dialogue trees allow you to be a total jerk to just about everyone if you wantbut that doesnt save this broken frustrating gamethe disasterrescue concept seems like a pretty cool game idea and its certainly one thats underused
but raw danger is just painful to playi have been meaning to do a video review for this
but time is short and it is sliding bylooking at the wii ad you would think this game is going to be great fun at partieserhhh nope
this game either has controls that are too sensitive making the game impossible or too vague making you wonder what the point isusually i can pull something positive out but really this game just ticked me off as yet another lame attempt to harness the wii controllersave your money and pass on this onethe controls are not accurate
i cant adjust my aim
the movements are limited
as a result a lot of times i lost because of the control not because of my skill
most of the games play almost the same
for example you either throw balls or throw rings
its boring
circus games is much betteri purchased this game for my family based on the reviews on this site and i must say that i am very disappointed with this game
my family and i enjoyed games like wii play and wii sports and believed this game to be the same based on the reviews on this site
however this game was a major let down
with this game your characters are limited
in fact you cannot create ethnic characters only caucasian ones
apart from that the only games that my family and i enjoyed were skeeball hoops and the power hit game i plan on taking this lame game back to the gamestop first thing tomorrow and exchanging it for the playground game  for all those who are considering purchasing this game know this if you enjoyed wii play or wii sports  this game does not compare if playground is as lame as the carnival game is i will be sure to leave my remarks concerning that game as well found out after playing thisit wasnt what we wanted
its aimed more at the younger generationwere in our mid s
we traded it for wii international winter sportsit would be a good one for kidsthis reminds me of the time i went to the carnival all those years ago for my eighth birthday
the ferris wheel was broken the roller coaster went at a snails pace and the hot dog i ate made me vomit all over my mom true story
this is a collection of minigames for the wii set in a carnival
that sounds like fun doesnt it
with over  minigames youd think this game would be a decent purchase
youd be wrong
of the games i played and i played all but two half of them played completely broken football throw another fourth had decent gameplay but completely mindless ring toss and onefourth of the games had some fun elements to them balloon darts
the customizable options at the beginning of the game will make you yearn for your miis and the graphics are nothing to write home about
i wouldnt reccomend this to anyone except someone who has absolutely no other party game to buyi hate this game we thought it would be a good game for christmas but its just horrible
the controls and games are just plain boring
the gameplay doesnt even compare to an actual carnivali would never recommend this game to anyone
its just plain boringthis game flatout sucks in every category except menu music
everything else is sega saturn quality
dont buy this game
buy nhl  by eathis game sucks
this game sucksi am very disappointed
i never received the product and after numerous attempts to get a response from the vendor i was forced to file a claim with amazonthese games are very hard to play and figure out
most of them you almost have to cheat to finish them
just like on one of them you have to set you alarm clock to a specific time to catch a late night cluefirst of all we hit a brick wall in the middle of this game
we finally gave up and downloaded a few cheat sheets
even with the cheat sheets the game would not let us go any fartheraside from that you have to cook breakfast lunch and dinner for the guests at the lodge over and over and over again
talk about monotonywe gave up on this game and we dont miss it at allthis is probably a very good game but i wouldnt know it because 
while all the other nancy drew games work fine on my computer this one wont play
it turns out that i have the wrong kind of driver
one of my computers wont do anything the other one has a totally scrambled picture
i cant return the game since its opened except for the exact same game which wont helpyou should check the tech support page of herinteractivecom post titled driver card  and follow the instructions to see if it will work on your computer before you buy it
considering that i just threw  down the toilet i thought i would warn others who dont have the newest computer
for me the game stinksi hope you can get the game to work on your computer
it looks like funit is a spelling game where they flash the words to you before you type them and the words are never read out load to the player
then they make everything timed so there is pressure to go fast
for someone who is learning a new word and learning to spell it actually hearing the word is pretty critical
this is what spelling is aboutyou hear the word and then write it down but in this case the developers took a few short cuts
my  year old son reads at a very high level but i wanted him to recognize words he hears so this game really falls for megraphics are pretty weak games arent horrible but nothing to write home about
overall i think it might be good for someone with a good vocabulary trying to refine their spelling and just have fun playing a game but i bought this as a educational game for my kids
it might be fun but i dont see much or any educational value in this gamewii bowling from the original wii sports included with console is much better game play
better graphics are not enough to overcome weak gameplayseriously dont waste your money on this game
its absolutely pointless
the graphics are horrible and its difficult to configure
i wont recommend to anyone
i got rid of it
sold it to my friend for a dollar which its not even worth
its cheap yeah but not even worth it
at alli was thrilled to find a game for the wii that garnered very high praise for its graphics realism and intuitive camera movement
however after playing a few rounds on all the different machines my disappointment rose to disgustwhile the ball physics are very realistic its impossible to shake the feeling that the game is deliberately screwing you by making you lose a ball immediately after one small burst of success
while i was able to get the multiball activated on several tables it would only take a few short seconds before i lost one or all three in very quick succession
the fact that this occurred across multiple tables only fueled my disgust to the point of actual angerthe fact that there is no camera option that would remain fixed above the entire table is a huge flaw especially given how fast the ball can move and how easy it can be to lose track of it amid the flashing lights and bright colors of the boards
turning off the reflections did not help
the fact that the lights in the boards are reflected in the ball is a cool effect but it confuses the eye quite easily and gain makes tracking the ball very difficult
an dimmer option for the lighting on the board or to remove the reflections from the ball would also have been very welcome optionsi was also underwhelmed by the resolution
there seemed to be pixellation everywhere which was exacerbated when the camera moved again making it more difficult to keep track of the ball
i dont know if antialiasing is too blame or not but it seemed to me that many of the boards were just not at a high enough resolution to properly distinguish the ball targets and other detailsthe techno background music in the arcade is quite annoying and i was also disappointed that many of the voice sounds for the games seemed muffled and unclear
i couldnt understand anything from the gorgar machine and this was after i had turned off all other audio except the gamethe ui in the arcade is also overly complex requiring multiple buttons to be pushed just to move to another machine
needless and irritating
i also didnt need the voice announcing the name of each pinball game every time i pass it
i can read disembodied voice so shut the hell upfinally using the nunchuk and wii remote just didnt feel right at all
the intensity of play would often result in button mashing instead of button pushing and my fingers would get sore very quickly
i also worried about the extra wear and tear i might applying to the controlsits true that i had high hopes for this game as ive always enjoyed pinball albeit never being particularly good at it
however the extraordinarily quick and easy way that you lose balls across all the boards felt even more anthropomorphically spiteful than when i played actual machinesall this game made me do was regretfully wish that there were still some arcades in my area because this lame digital tease made me want to go out and find the real thingi think its impossible to control these cars with a controller
perhaps a  steering wheel might help but who wants to spend that kind of money
this is the last racing game ill ever buy a waste of money and my timethe game has an update which changes the game play where now when you take a shot the player is moving towards the basket as if he is taking a running jumper
the game originally did not function in that mannerclunky and confusing controls
controls that dont work as prescribed
hacknslash sorta game with no hacknslash
steer clear of this debacle
i got a good hour of game play and only did the first part of the tutorial if the tutorial is longer than an hour or if the tutorial confuses the player then that should be a clear signal to the developers to just stop
it definitely got this player to stopi am a real big fan of all the soulcalibur games until soulcalibur ledgens was introduced
first of all let me make one thing clear this is the worst soulcalibur game ever if you are planning on buying this game please dont pleassssssssssssse dont
dont be a victim like me who fell into that trap because of the game name title soulcalibur i went and buy the game that was the worst choise i ever made in my entire life
i think that soulcalibur should stay the way it once was as an head to head fighting game
i hope that this review some how reach namcobandi message board so these game develpers can see what crazy mistakes they have made
all other soulcalibur are great but i cant say the same for soulcalibur ledgensoh yeah let me talk about the wii nunchuck  remote its a good innovation but not for a game like soulcalibur what were the developers thinking the nintendo wii has a classic controler which would have work well with the versus mode
this game need to be taken off the shelves for further modifications
namcobandi please keep fighting games where they belong and adventure games where they belong i think that this was a bad step for you
i know all the fans of soulcalibur would agree with me and for all who were having thoughts about buying thisthis game is an insult to all other soul calibur games
it has very poor graphics and online is a joke
the original characters are very ugly in this game and so are the new characters
the games plot doesnt connect to other games in the series and doesnt make sense
no one who is a fan of the soul calibur series will like this game
the wii should stick to games by nintendo and not try to create a game from a very successful series
if you buy this game you are not a gamer and you never will be a gamerdo not buy soul calibur legends ok
trust me buy soul calibur iv or iii instead
if you like this kind of game buy dynasty warrior
its a much better version
soul  calibur legends is overall a horrible game
dont buy this game if you know whats good for youfrom controls to boss design this thing is a good argument vfor video game abortionjust so you get the right idea you cannot play this game with anything but the wiimote  nunchuck the nunchucks accelerometer is the single most used control in the game reread  if you honestly dont understand why its so bad that the single most important function of the game  accurate dodging  is using the stier accelerometer in your nondominant hand you dont know anything about fighting games holy crap
this entire game is hack and slash with dodging
if dodging were actually capable of being done accurately
but i digress on the dodging
your right arm will fall off
there is simply nothing to do you just walk avoid stupid obstacles like blindcorner rolling boulders lolol so much fun
and flail your right arm around like a lunatic the designers of this game thought a good way to design boss fights was to make bosses have toggleable invincibility
let me explain how this works
whenever you get close enough to attack a boss they will become invincible and all your attacks will be repelled
im not even kidding either
thats actually what you will face if you buy this game and attempt to play it
you will literally be sitting on your couch trying to clear a boss fight carefully dodge all the boss abilities or at least attempt to see  and then run up to him and start flailing your right arm only to hear the parry sound and notice you did absolutely nothing
soul calibur a game based on combos and traditional d fighting game mechanics employs bosses that cannot be comboed for more than  hits
seriously astoundingly terribledo not play this gamedo not buy ita spinoff to a successful franchise is almost never a good thing
the games are usually weaker than the main series and theres usually not as much effort put into them
there are a few exceptions but not many
soul calibur legends is not an exception
in fact it may very well be one of the worst video game spinoffs to hit the scene in recent memorytheres not much of a story here
you get to watch a cutscene take place and get an introduction as to whats going on but from there the story becomes a confusing mess
it almost makes no sense
that aside youd think the gameplay would be something to admire but that may very well be the worst part about this game
theres really not much to it and sometimes its just downright unfairyoull go into a level by selecting a character a two companions
you see some of your favorite soul calibur characters like astorath sophitia and taki
youll even be able to play as lloyd irving of tales of symphonia fame
the controls arent bad here
by swinging the wii remote youll be able to do horizontal and vertical slashes
youll use the nunchuck to move your character around
you can also block attacks perform charged attacks and strife around
the motion sensor controls of swinging the remote for sword swipes feels a little tacked on at times though
it isnt that which is annoying about the controls
whats annoying is that there is no challenge to the game whatsoever
if you simply swing the wii remote horizontally or vertically like a madman youll have no problem fairing in combatyoure also approached by the same enemies over and over again
this wouldnt really be a problem if there were a variety of them
its basically the same three things over and over again
worse than that however is the level design and camera
the levels are horrible in their design
there are traps that come from no where and sometimes the camera just doesnt work well enough
you may round a corner and the camera wont work out well enough for you to be able to see yourself before you take damage
level designs are also boring and uninspiredthe game is reduced to being nothing more than a hack and slash
and itll mostly consist of you swinging the wii remote in a craze
theres nothing challenging here at all
the level designs and gameplay as a whole are repetitivetheres also a two player coop mode but that cant save the gameplay at all
theres even a versus but you can use the same madman waving technique that you used in the actual adventure to do battle
in short its boring
if you really want to fight against a friend itd probably just be better to invest in one of the main series gamessadly the graphics arent stellar either
much of the game is pretty ugly
character models arent so bad but everything is just downright ugly
even by the wiis standards it could be better
the voice acting isnt too bad but the dialog and written script are absolutely horribleeven if youre a big soul calibur fan legends is not a worthwhile game at all
if youve never played soul calibur before dont let this game be your first foray into the series
pick up one of the games from the main series and pass this one byits just my opinion but i dont care for these games at all
they go through a lot of trouble to make them realistic with actual weapons very good graphics and then they set it up so that the enemies can for instance take an inhuman amount of damage
i shot one of them in the chest  times with a  cal pistol at close range and they didnt drop there is something wrong with that
i even shot one of them in the head with a sniper rifle blood came out the back of his head onto a wall and then he shot me dead
the player can take similar damage
plus by the time youve beaten the game youve either saved and loaded several dozens of times or youve gotten shot several dozens of times
either way its not very realistic game play at all which is a fault of quite a lot of first person shooters in my opinion i know im in the minority opinion as far as that goes
getting shot should probably mean something though if you like realism
i would disagree that the ai is good
the enemies reflexes are sometimes way too high and as another reviewer pointed out the enemies are often psychic
the three games get progressively worse
silent assassin is all around a much better game than either of the others
blood money is an absolute joke
its hyped up graphics and visual flare trying to make up for shortcomings galore
yet another problem that i have with many other recent gamesyou know when i witnessed the local kids playing resident evil code veronica x you have no idea the level of dread i felt for the future of the series
these were kids who started playing the series once code veronica was ported form the dreamcast to the ps and instantly shunned the original resident evil games on the playstation one of these kids the leader of the idiot team of course was only one year younger than meunfortunately my dread became vivid and has stayed vivid onward
resident evil is never going to be the unique little adventurous ultra gory atmospheric little alone in the dark ripoff i remember it as because when a company considers three of the most broken overly action packed laughable additions to the series as essential then something is very wrong
the atmosphere that the resident evil that was introduced in  thirteen years ago is never coming back and its all thanks to its socalled sequels that were almost entirely dedicated to nothing but actionseriously look at what they have resident evil code veronica x the port of the all ready overly action packed jerkfest with a john woo gunslinging leonardo dicaprio dork and a one dimensional antagonist with the addition of a character who magically survived the previous games by a continuity error that was later explained in umbrella chronicles in that classic five year old because i said so excuse solely so said character could be the equivalent of the terminator meets the matrixthen theres resident evil outbreak the first online survival horror game ever made and quite  possibly the worst second only to outbreak file  with more of those random cameo characters the developers loved so much they had to include them in the game by snapping the continuity in pieces
add to the broken singleplayer game play with some of the most obnoxious enemy and friendly ai ever made and some of the most atrocious enemy designs made and youve got pain elemental in one gamethen youve got everyones favorite blend of hollywood action slop and campiness resident evil hey thats literally how its spelled a game where the only fear youll get is laughing yourself to death he moment you see the so called terrorists youre fighting
i just need to ask what are game developers obsession with playing the role of alpha male in games
does a game become an instant classic when you have a to baby sit a foxy young woman in loose clothes who cant defend herself whose first lines are literally dont come
im serious thats the first line she has
you know what happened to games where you have to rescue a woman who screams those words at you
the latter game proves one thing about our generation of horror gaming if i ever need money and i know how to develop a game ill just rip off splinter cell and metal gear solid throw in some heads popping every time the character so much as breathes on them coupled with rag doll physics have some pervert in an overcoat sell you nasty things you can fit on to your gun in exchange for illogical fetchquests and minigames throw in maybe one or two monsters and have you defend a hot foxy woman in an iron lung and call it a horror game
id make millionsi bought this based on a couple cool still shots from the game and the fact that mickey rourke was voicing the main character
what a piece of garbage this game is
i honestly cant believe a game like this got put into production
zero skills required
zero fun
zero playability
this game is wretched trash
dont even rent it
dont even read another review on it cause this game isnt worth any more of your timewhy do they do this we are in the ps era not nintendo  eraand who ever created rogue warrior have some nerves and the audacity to put a  price tagsome nerveswow
what were they thinking when they made this game
i dont mind prophanity in games but they just use it waaaaay too much in this game
the kill scenes are pretty cool but there are only three or four different scenes so they do get boring after a while
the graphics are mediocre at best
i wouldnt wish this game on my worst enemy thats how painful it isthis game is laced with so much profanity
it actually gets boring after awhile
once you beat the game if you can even bring yourself to buy this horrible game theres a song that plays over the credits that strings together a bunch of mickey rourkes lines into a neat arrangement of swears
its nice to see that the developers actually had a sense of humor about this
unfortunately that does not mean this game was good by any stretch of the imagination
on the hardest difficulty it took me about three hours to beat it
its the same repetitive thing over and over shoot a bunch of guys with horrible shooting mechanics that makes you wish you were playing something else
stay away from this horrible game
if someone gives it to you as a gift act insulted
this games badness insults humanity as a whole
thank you and as always comrades have nice dayi wouldve loved to see what the earlier incarnation of this game wouldve looked like if that had been the version to be released
zombie studios had originally envisioned the game to be a stealthy squadbased tacticle shooter in the vein of the rainbow six series
the story had demo dick and his squad trapped in modernday north korea after a blown black ops mission and they had to work together to escape the country
running on the unreal engine it had the opportunity to showcase amazing immersive graphics
sadly none of that worked out
that version of the game was scrapped and the reigns were handed to another developer who completely butchered the final product in the enddeveloped by rebellion and published by bethesda this version of rogue warrior is an extremely short extremely easy and extremely linear fps with many elements that are completely worthless
you play as demo dick marcinko the most lethal navy seal alive whos sent on a black ops mission to north korea with two other soldiers
when they land nk soldiers end up killing the other two men leaving marcinko completely on his own
of course being the egotistical jerk that he is he ignores orders to abort the mission and heads off on his ownif viewed as a completely straightforward shooter that solely focuses on killing as many soldiers as possible rogue warrior is actually pretty decent
it plays like most other standard seventhgen shooters you have regenerating health you can pick weapons up from dead enemies and you can sprint for a limited time
theres also a cover system where you go into a rdperson view and hide behind an object which allows for increased protection and accuracy as well as blindfiring
you always start each mission with a silenced pistol the only weapon in the game that enemies wont hear when you use it and an mp submachine gun
you cant find any additional ammo for the latter so its best to ditch it as soon as possible
the other enemy weapons are plentiful and include assault rifles shotguns sniper rifles grenade launchers and heavy machine guns
i didnt find any issues with hit detection that others were complaining about
all the weapons handled really well and each was appropriate for different combat situationsthe best aspect of this game without a doubt is the interactive kills
theres loads of animations where marcinko makes excellent use of his massive rambo knife
he sticks enemies in their heads snaps their neck slashes them multiple times and even throws them over ledges
it honestly never gets old watching them especially when marcinko forces the enemy to shoot themselves in the head with their own riflewhat ultimately destroys this game in the end is its massive potential that was just wasted
there are countless elements in the game that have no value or worth whatsoever
stealth is a joke alongside your regenerating health enemies cant hear your footsteps so you can walk or sprint right behind them without having to crouch
to add to the stealth aspect occasionly youll come across a fuse box that you can shoot to completely knock out the power to an area
this makes the enemies go into a confused state where they stand still and supposedly cant see anything while you can equip nightvision goggles for an advantage
it really only worked on the first mission in the later missions enemies could still see you clearly which made shooting the fuse box worthless
you might as well not even bother with them at all
a third aspect is that the pistols have infinite ammo
this means that its possible to beat the entire game using only the silenced pistol and completely ignore all the other weapons
finally you are actually able to shoot out light sources in this game which makes an area darker
however since it has absolutely no effect on your visibility to enemies its again other element that is absolutely worthlessthe graphics powered by the asura engine are actually nowhere near as bad as everyone says
while its true that the texture quality may not be the best the dynamic lighting is amazing and atmospheric
locations are bathed in different colors and patterns from light sources
like i said earlier you can also shoot out the lights if nothing else at least it looks pretty even if its worthless in practical terms
the sound is stuffed to the brim with fbombs as marcinko spews them out with almost every single sentence he says
its extremely awful but funny at the same time
the physics of the enemies when you shoot them are also very entertaining as theyll jerk and spaz around before limply flopping off a ledge or roll down a staircase head over heels to the bottomif rogue warrior only consisted of the straightforward coverbased shooting gameplay and the interactive kills it probably wouldve gotten a lot less hate than it did
with the inclusion of elements that offer absolutely no authentic benefit to the player however this game falls into a black hole that it can never get out of
coupled with its extremely short length and complete lack of replay value rogue warrior is one of the most disappointing titles ever released in the world of gamingi dont know if you guys have heard of a little game called rogue warrior for xbox  and ps but its gotta be the worst game of this generation
certainly the worst ive ever played
im not just talking about the critics here
im talking about how the gamers felt
hello kitty island adventure scored even higher than this game
yes the critics such as ign gave the game a  the worse this generation
but as a gamer i give it a  out of  why
the  goes toward the end credits sequence
its actually so terrible its good
but truth be told rebellion just doesnt care
rogue warrior took  hours to beat and cost 
retail value for a game thats broke
the ai was so bad i cant even describe it
and it had such a strange weapons system you could shoot a guy from  feet away but the computer automatically randomized your hitmiss ratio so you may get a headshot or may not
its not about accuracy it randomly generates a hitmiss ratio
i hit a guy from  meters away but missed him with the gun pointed straight at his head
im telling you after that experience i do not trust rebellionfor the sake of not getting robbed do not purchase this game
i used to respect bethesda until they published this gamethis story is about the birth of seal team sixhowever it is no where near as effective or as honorablebuy it from the bargain bin so you wont be too upsetremember back in the s when every celebrity had to have a video game
from tim allens power tool pursuit to shaqfu these games sucked and obviously tried to bank on the celebrity status to move the games to the fans
that is what rouge warrior is like a retro dollar bin game coded by first year computer science internsi was looking forward to this game
i liked most of the rogue warrior series when dick wrote with john weisman and bethesda games are normally top notch
but this one slipped though the creative qa process
here are a few of my observations the enemies are stupid
their backs are turned most of the time and i can clomp up to them no stealth and do a kill move which is a cut scene to a poor graphic close up shot
there is no health status bar no character development the weapon action is just sad
i can shoot someone with a silenced    yards and score a one shot kill yet i can empty a nearly a full clip into an enemy in the same room and they are still standing
oh and grenades
yeah they do not work hardly at allbottom line man does this game suck
certainly gets my vote for the worst of  i would only buy this if you like demo dick so much that you have to have everything with his name on it you collect crappy games and this would look great next to outpost you like to hear folks say the f word because although rogue warrior is a crappy game with the controls and playability of a tofu sword demo dick has to cuss alot to show that he does not listen to orders and is his own one man a team without the cool vanthen i would buy it used since you can guarantee a used disk will not be played muchthis game is horrible
this is definately an adult title since the game uses the f word every five seconds
i think the only thing the game developers worked hard on in this game is how to incorporate every curse word known to man and use it every five seconds during the gamei want some of the stuff the other reviewers must be drinking because for them to walk away from this game and even consider giving this festering pile of dung anything more than one star let alone  or  they must be out of their mindsfirst off this is an extremely short game
it plays about  hours or so with no replay valuegameplaythe ai is horrible you run through linear maps through  missions and there isnt too much to it
expect most of the enemies to have their backs to you so you can easily kill them expect no sound detection for the stealth so you can run around behind an enemy and he wont even notice and expect to miss most of the shots you shoot given the shot detection is flawed
its frustrating to play this gamemultiplayer gameplaythe multiplay gameplay is horrid
you can only really play deathmatch and given how horrid this game is you cant even find people to really play withgraphicshorrible outdated graphics only add insult to injurysoundthe main character curses a lot but besides that nothing is too great about this gameseriously this game is horrible
please at the very least consider checking review sites before buying anyone this as a gift
the average metacritic review is  and most review sites barely give this anything over 
its a horrible game and i wish i had waited for the reviews to come out before i ordered it
consider yourself warnedbefore buying brain age  i read about it and saw commercials for it so i was pretty excited when i recieved it as a gift
however the novelty wore off for me after about a month
it soon got to be too boring and tedious
i would definitely recommend renting before buying
i wish i hadthis game is somewhat fun at times except for the special infected
the tank hunter boomer and esspessially the smoker
one hit is all it takes it doesnt matter if you have full health health packs full ammo super guns etcone grab and your toast
your character who can be lit on fire survive explosions fall from heights if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying just lies there like a  year old girl and gets owned by the special infectedits pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating
your whole group could be knocked down not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games overthat is amazingly stupid
why the hell cant your character fight back against these lame enemies
the temp
invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame its a glitch maybe but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them
the tank teleports threw walls not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isnt enough
computer controlled smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes doors and walls
hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned
skill is not required or achieveable in this game they will get you every single time
when you get once shot you die due to the moronic ai players that stand there and watch you get lamed its maddening
the bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows teleport through doors or walls and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level
they also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots
i usually just gun them down and take their health packs when i need one or they steal them using means beyond physics
the harder the difficulty the more useless they are
this game also has hovering molotov cocktails
if a horde is running at you and you throw one into it the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by zombies taking damaged before the fire kills anything
i put zombies in quotes because these zombies dont eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks
left  dead also has bloodthursty fire yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you even sometimes when its invisible it still damages you maybe its infected too
the dlc was a total joke and made valve look tired and lazy
survival mode sucks you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die
millions of zombies multiple hunters multiple smokers multiple tanks raining down on you until your deadwow so much fun to die in  mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you
the pc version actually has new campagins made by fans since valve is too lazy to make them
ld ii still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc
ld ii was a major step down from ld which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself
if you want a real zombie game killing floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and thats it
also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in kf when you have full health you can go down fighting
in ld you sit there crying for useless clepto ai players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills
this is a pathetic retardedly glitched broken frustrating piece of garbagetrust be get killing floor
ld  builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordesits virtually unplayable
ld  is simply a  dollar update that should have been part of ld  but valve say fit to abandon ld after  half assed tiny dlc patchdo you like mindless shooting games
i dont and that is all this game is
there is no plot and no storyline of any kind
all you do is move from safehouse to safehouse killing zombies along the way
there is no explanation given as to why there are zombies running amuck and no backstories explaining who these four people are and why they are together
the zombies run at you fast and from all sides but there is nothing you havent seen here before
there is very little monster diversity and very little weapon diversity
there are no objectives or missions no sidequests no character or story development nothingi found the game extremely boring
the single player is short and easy
you can beat it in one day
there isnt even an endingthis game is for people who dont want to have to think at all
the multiplayer i havent done yet and have no desire too now
there are no special moves or abilities in this game
the aiming is anything but precise and you practically have unlimited ammo
it makes absolutely no difference which character you usethis is one of the worst games ive played on the im tired of xbox making games where you have to keep turning to see whats behind you or to the side of you or you cant see anything except whats in fron of you due to the over the shoulder view they use on almost every gameturning so much really gives you a headache and motion sicknessother games that do this are halo  and call of duty gamesthe game cube had redone resident evil  and  and the  one was also great those games had high quality graphics and i could play them for hours and not ever get headaches or motion sickness like i do with these  gamesthis game is unplayableclearly a lot of people really love this game
im not saying theyre wrong just that i personally dont get the appeal
i love playing offline shooter games bioshock gta fallout  mass effect halo  etc
and got this because of all the star ratings on here but i quit playing after the first couple of missions or whatever they are called
unlike other games i mentioned there seems to be little or no strategy involved
its just an endless repetition of walking around and then wildly blasting away as fast as you can
wheres the fun in thatthis review might come as a shocker for some since everyone seems to love the game
i loved the first half life
let me give a quick reason why which will help explain me hating half life  half life one was violent good story fun long different levels
half life  is none of that
the game feels very pg
i dont know why they toned down the violence but they dida lot
the story is boring add on to the first half life
its not very fun to play you just feel like your trying to just finish the gamei beat the game twice
i loved the first so much i tried making myself like this onebut it didnt happen
there isnt anything special about half life  i guess if your new to gaming and need something to break you into first person shooters with no violence and ok for little kids to playthis is it
i really dont have anything good to say about half life  it has its moments but really fell off for me
in theory if you liked the first game you shouldnt like this one but for some reason people still dothis is not an orange box
this is actually a video game despite the description of it being an orange box
i was in desperate need of an orange box to complete my halloween costume for my son but now hell have to go as a toilet seat again this game is a generic arcade style game
it is boring and repetitive
knowing what i know now i wouldnt have taken this game if it was given to meat first glance turning point fall of liberty looks like an interesting game
there are plenty games out there that take place during real battles and campaigns of world war two but here we have a what if scenario
what if winston churchill didnt survive a fateful car accident that he had while visiting new york in the folks at codemasters seem to think that the third reich after conquering europe would launch an invasion of the united state eastern sea border in this game took only seven hours to play and i whish i had those seven ours back
its as the angry video game nerd saids a tish load of kucf
the game feels like it was rush out with chucks of content cut out becomes they didnt meet the ridiculously short deadlineyou control a new york construction worker dan carson who seems to know how to use german weapons knows something about hand to hand combat and how to wire bombs this is never explained
like master chief and the marine in doom you are fighting this invasion single handedly your npc resistance fighters and national guard soldiers are killed within five minutes of their introduction at least they provide you with ammo for american weapons because it doesnt show up anywhere elsethe controls are hideously stiff making movement and aiming abysmally slow and even jerky its like trying to move around underwater
the graphics are not as sharp or as detail as they could be yes i know this game came out in ought six but halflife  came out the pervious year and that game is still beautiful todaythe game is also plagued with various video bugs that are never fixed unlike other games that routinely update their games codemasters has no update patches for turning point
there seem to be jump cuts in the video when you reach a draw point there would be about a two second freeze then a wall or a door would appear right in your face and a nazi would spawn right behind you and club you to death
the only ragdoll physics is when you kill some one the fall to the floor or onto a table and then freeze with their arms and legs at ridicules angels
theres also lousy hit detectionthis is a massive shame because on the surface its a great idea of a game
alterative world war two
but codemasters doesnt take advantage of the games setting and there doesnt seem to be to many history buffs over at the codemaster officewhat about the japanese
wont weve still gone to war with the japs in 
and developed the atomic bomb
maybe carson is a veteran of the war with japanno mention of japan is every made
in fact there is no back round information about what is going on aside from the death of churchill
the player doesnt know that after conquering the british isle in  the reich goes on to conquer russia and most of northern africa and the middle east giving german access to lots of oil that they trade to japan allowing japan to conquer the rest of asia and making the uss trade embargoes against japan redundant thus no pear harbor attack no war with japan thus no war with germany
and no nukes for the usnone of this appears in the game it is only mention in publicly material and the games profile page on wikipediathis is by far the worst game ive played in a long time
the graphics are at best decent the story line is cool but the game play is terrible i dont see what other players see in it or what games they have played lately but this game is not exciting at alli have never seen a star wars movie
i know i should be burned at the stake
truthfully it never really interested me a life full of pop culture references and ribs gave me a basic idea and understanding of what they were aboutso when i got this game included in a bundle with my xbox  i was interested to play it and possible learn a little more about the storythat was my goal for playing it and judging if it would be successful
i couldnt have been more disappointed
basically you drop into a bar with no explanation of controls or where you or or even who you are
instead youre instantly walking around with a bunch of lego people who all look the same
nothing in the area was able to be interacted with and none of the people would talk to you
whats even worse i found out i could attack the people but they suddenly produced guns and tons of armored people stormed in and started attacking mei finally figured out i was in some sort of hub area and proceed to the door in the north west which lead to episode i
some scrolling text went by in true star wars fashion but it didnt say anything useful
it didnt explain who i was or where i was goingim suddenly dropped into a strange conference room
without all the people i learned that i had an ai controlled partner that i could switch to who seemed to be better than the main character
upon attacking the chairs they would shoot out coins that i was collecting for who knows what reason
shouldnt i be collecting legosi played further pushed through this level which consisted of getting a bunch of strange robots and making them stand on platforms in order to open doors and finally i was entered into a jungle level where i was saving jabba the hut or something
there was a huge warinvasion going on and it was pretty cool how everything was going on around me and the enemies didnt always pay attention to me because they were doing other thingshowever i still rate this game a  because gameplay was juvenile walk jump attack get character x who is the only one who can do y then switch back to character a because hes the only one who can do b and if you were hoping like me for any sort of story youll be sorely disappointed
i dont get why all the lego games are so critically acclaimed  maybe its meant for people who know the story of the game theyre playing or maybe it is meant for children who enjoy mindlessly hitting things and getting coinsthere is no way to say this strongly enough  play the demo first
the controls are laid out poorly and dont work particularly well anyway and the camera is unforgivable
this will ruin the game for more than a few players
play the demo first
youve been warnedwhat a rip off
microsoft should be ashamed of itself
there should be a warning lable on this one like cigretts
dangerous to your mental stability
if this were the only game i saw i would never even start playing video gamesthis game has no redeaming qualities at allbecause it cost  i have been playing for hours and can still not understand that dumb tree
i want to use the spider but i cant figure out how it works
i am on the third story line and still cant do anything
i simply randomly press every button and twirl every analog stick and things happen but i dont know why or whatreally we need a warning system so we dont buy garbage like this
really amazon you shouldnt offer games like this to your customersbetter forget this one
not even worth a  bargen basement left over junk box salesome reader reviews said the game is better but you have to play most into the game to know which it is so bad
simply playing it for a few hours dont tell you the real storydid sillicon knight got a group of artists but forgot to make the game
the graphics look very nice and force you watch unskippable the death scenes over and over
every few steps the game throws at you tons of enemies nonstop
most levels look and play alike like the game developers simply copy and paste the same level repeatly
there are only a few lines recorded for your squard and the same lines got repeating over and over
your squard random disappears but they are still talking
there is no way to adjust the audio in the game the audio option doesnt even exist
the explosions are ultra loud which is played continuously
there are so many stupid things in this game to point its not even a game but rather the artists want to force you to watch their art than playing the gametoo human looks very promising on the surface and the more your play the game the more pointless and boring it becomeswhat an amazingly crappy game
there is so much wrong and frustrating about this game that i dont even know where to start
how do you push a game from release several times over and still release a stinker such as too human
im sorry but the team over to microsoft games took one from the page of the makers of alone in the dark over to atari with too humangraphics subpar at best
ps at its worst
for whatever reason when you venture into cyberspace the graphics take a jump through time back into the s with flat grounds and environments
why doesnt the water movecontrols okay however i cant tell you how many times i started swinging my weapon around while trying to adjust the annoying camera with the right analog stick
another page from ataris alone in the dark
why on earth did they do this
you have two other buttons that arent even used
arghh
frustrating
swinging your weapon with the right analog stick is absolutely miserable and singlehandly takes away any fun that the combat has to offernote to game makers halos controls were great and spot on
follow what works and has been testedgameplay omg
repetative
the same enemies over and over and over again with the occassional new one thrown in to say that they atleast tried to spice the game up
just wait until you try and target a floating enemy with a gun while  unkillable enimies flatten you in two seconds
oh and dont get me started on the valkiyre cutscene everytime you diespeaking of dying although you dont have to restart the entire level when your character perishes youll soon wish you did if that meant you could skip the annoying valiyre cutscene
what were they thinking
did they want to punish the player for spending final thoughtthis games is a renter at best but if you want to buy it wait a few weeks itll be in the bargain bin by theni will never understand what posses compainies to release complete piles of crap like too human or alone in the dark
id rather have the game scrapped completely and be dissappointed but still have my in the end its your choice but if youre on the edge about this game then rent it firstive broken this into two sections depending on how obsessive you are about finishing a gameshort haulinteresting game if you are going to do a few runthroughs without caring about completing all the achievements
the art is good and the story is interesting
the camera being out of the players control is quite annoying although i probably didnt die too many times because of it
you get a lot of loot drops which are useful as you character levels uplong haulthis is one of the most aggravating games i have ever played
im truly sorry i ever picked it updying constantly is ridiculous
it amazes me that with all the effort that went into this game that some idiot decided to make it so frustratingly difficult to get through a level without dying
probably the same idiot who decided to claim that unreal engine  didnt work and tried suing
you can look up how well that turned out for themloot system turns into boring weeding through crap
majority of drops are garbage to be thrown out
unfortunately one of the achievements is based on getting rare items and is just the worst stupidest excuse for grinding
charms
i cant believe how much time i wasted sorting through through them to see which quest was done which was most appropriate for the next room which needed other charms that werent completed yet etcreaching the maximum level is extra frustrating because the game becomes harder than everframe rates issues
you can see the frame rate lag at times
maybe it didnt on earlier xbox operating system releases but it does now
this is a real problem at times because you can feel the controls become so sluggish that you cant retargetthis game looks great but plays terriblethe first thing you should know is that this game has a godawful camera angle to it
i was constantly recentering the thing or would be walking in one direction only to have the camera angle change and my guy would start walking off to the side
when fighting swarms of enemies its impossible to see the people hitting you from behind your character and thats even after messing with the cameratoggle moving it as far away as possible
its just not smooth at allsecond this game is trying to be some kind of actionrpg but you constantly collect so many pieces of armor or weapons or gems or whatever that you find yourself going into your equipment menu all the time to see if that thing you just picked up is a better piece of armor then the one you are wearingthird the game makes no sense
after watching the movies and whatever  i have no idea who i am or what im fighting against
i was at the point that when a nonsensical cutscene came along i would just pick up my phone and check my emailfourth theres zero challenge to the game
sure you can level up and get better armor and weapons but you dont die in the game so whats the point
when you die you have to sit through this annoyingly repetitive cutscene check phone for email again
and just start right off near where you died
so you find yourself just holding down the trigger or holding down the right stick to attack over and over and over again until you die
come back to life  repeat  hold down trigger until you die again
its not funfifth the voice acting is laughable
many cut scenes dont quite line up and the dialog is atrocious
many times while playing your team will say the dumbest stuff think thats the last of em
yeah  ive killed  of those enemyrobotalien whatevers and im sure that was the last one
medic
 a theres no medic and b you never die anyway so what are you crying aboutsixth your team is lame
they do very little get lost most of the time and make no sense in their existence
either they die off they get reborn at random times
or get lost or just completely disappear
oh but dont worry youll still hear their annoyingly repetitive dialog constantly even when they arent thereit looks like a decent game  a lot of thought went into the weapons and graphics and stuff it just plays like utter garbage
i won it in about a week or so and plan on throwing it out
im glad i paid like  for it used
this is easily the bestlooking worstplaying game on the xbox  everi truly detest this game you cant save the game where you would like to stop it will take you back to the beginning of the level without giving you a clue thats going to happento go through the game all you need to do is mindlessly mash the buttons and make timeconsuming brainless treks back to buy new armor and weapons and you will proceed through this game without failthe only redeeming quality it has is that it is gorgeous but it is utterly mindless and requires zero skill mash the buttons get bounty buy weapons and armor and go back and mash more buttons
if you die wait  minutes for the angel to restore you and mash more buttonslack of instructions and a very brief walkthrough left my young sith running around trying to figure out how to execute anything more than the simplest of movesthe camera is never where you want it to be and the targeting system had me wasting all my force energy levitating droids and rocks while enemies pelted me mercilessly with blaster fire
i made it about  hours before i threw it in the garbagei agree with many of the other lackluster reviews in that this game feels very unpolished and buggy
the graphics are nice barring the occasional texture flickering but thats about it
i highly reccomend borrowing this game or renting it before you buy
i havent played the demo but im guessing if youve played the demo youve pretty much played the entire game
total waste of moneyi bought this on launch day because it seemed like it was going to be a decent game
i saw the videos of the gameplay and they looked pretty cool and i heard good thingsthen i played itthe plot was terrible and further pushed me towards leaving starwars behind  altogether
i saw the new starwars movie the animated one and if you have seen that you should know that that had good writing compared to the storyline of this game
the love part only kicks in at the very end of the game and basically consists of hey
we survived stuff
lets be in love so basically george lucass idea of love
it amazes me that he is marriedthe graphics were ok some were better than others like the ingame maps were decent but then you find that you can walk through most objects that arent walls and it kind of ruins it for you
the character models are horrendously done and they remind me of the facial graphics in final fantasy x remember how they were groundbreaking but completely unlike any human face and the eyes look like plastic puppets with animatronic cardboard cutouts of eyes
the gameplay wasnt as bad as it could have been but nowhere near as good as it could have been either
some enemies have an attack pattern that is just fast enough that by the time you get knocked down and start to get back up again they have already started a new attack and knock you down again so you cant do anything about it
the cinematic finishes make you look at the bottom of the screen for button cues so you can either watch  the part of the cinematic that corresponds to the first button and then the failure caused by the fact that you missed the next few buttons or get all of the buttons correct and see the cinematic out of your peripheral vision
bosses were all easy
all you do is figure out its weakness and get it to low enough health to do the final button cue combination which keeps popping up until you do it right
the one hard part of the game i played through on the next higher difficulty to normal is forcecrashing the star destroyer that was a spoiler so watch out because just when you get it angled the right way tie fighters get close enough that you have to stop and kill them before repositioning it and try to bring it down againoverall this was a poorly made game that was overhyped and you will probably still buy it no matter how many bad reviews you read because hat is how the starwars franchise works
let me just leave you with the knowledge that you will get nothing out of this gamei believe this game does actually have the honor of being the worst game yet made for nintendo ds
i had the misfortune of renting this game on the day it was released and i actually had high hopes for it
being a big godzillagiant monsters fan i desperately wanted this game to be for the ds what godzilla destroy all monsters was for the gamecubei was sorrily disappointed when i found that this game in no way makes use of the capabilities of the ds
really this game looks like something that should have been released for the original nintendo system
the graphics look about as good as graphics did in  and the gameplay consistes of a neverending assault of cookiecutter clone enemies constantly sapping miniscule amounts of your energy
this game is the penultimate realization of frustration
think cheap shots uninspired opponents and a ultrarepetitive gameplay
this game honestly looks and plays like one of the games you can play for free at the flash arcade website
the only good thing about this game i found is the music
i would not recommend this game for anyone other than nintendo ds or godzilla completionists
you have been warnedi admit i have relatively high standards for fps shooters
i play all sorts of them and have played them for the better part of a decade including tf hlhl quake  unreal every single one and all sorts of off shoots absolutely love cod right nowstop reading this and go buy it if you havent already
my disclaimer is that i didnt play much farther than maybe  minutesyoull understand why in a secondthat said i cant believe this game was even published
id seen previews and read about this coming out granted some of that came in the form of newsletters from codemasters so i was hyped a bit
id switched from cod to cod when the latter came out so i hadnt played a wwiithemed shooter in a little bit and i was getting twitchyi tossed this in the dvd drive and installed it then ran the puppy to find a standardissue console port complete with no mouse support in the menu system huh
im a programmer and it always boggles me how it seems so hard for them to add mouse support to the menu systemthe rest of the game supports a friggin mouse
 checkpoint saves and lousy graphics
even the control scheme suckedi felt like i was running i was running through molassesthe graphics were datedthey reminded me of medal of honorfrom five years agothere is no such thing as a headshot since even with a nicely aimed shot to the head it took three or four shots to take down an enemy i know youre trying to make it hard but cmon
at least if it was to the chest or leg or something id deal with it better but reallyloads of immovable objects must have used a lot of superglue or something and a complete rails experience no choicesjust one way to go through each levelput all together youve got a game that either needed another year of development work or one that should never have been published and written off as a loss
do yourself a favor and save your money forcall of duty  modern warfareor better yet get thethe orange boxand get three games and to expansions for the price of an expansioni play a lot of sub par to bad games
i consider myself very patient and forgiving with most titles when most people tend to write them off and unplayable
as a testament to this i actually finished this game
now while that may not sound like much of an accomplishment trust me it was
this game is quite bad all around just shy of being unplayable
my thoughtspros i struggled with some of these interesting alternative history premise albiet terribly overused
nazis win wwii and invade the us  not very original but still an interesting idea nonetheless great opening level of descending a skyscraper being constructed while the germans destroy it outstanding musical score composed by the amazingly talented michael giacchino lost medal of honor call of duty cloverfield etc
honestly this is the best part of the game and i still felt bad that his name was tied to the title very short trust me its a good thing in this casecons awful and unforgivable framerate issues lag and slowdown throughout the entire game
firefights with multiple enemies onscreen and various explosions is when its very evident
the game will literally slow to a crawl
whenever the action heats up the game slows down
perfect
note my machine is far beyond the required specs for this title
 extremely lackluster graphics for a  game
poorly rendered textures on nearly every level
some wall and ground textures and deplorable flawed weapon targeting
many times youll clearly shoot someone yet the bullet never hits them
items often obscure shots when they clearly they shouldnt terrible weapon sounds
weapons and sound effects were often crackling and overly distorted little to no effort put in from the xbox port
the icing on the cake is when theyre asking you to perform certain tasks in the game they tell you to press this button and show you a diagram of a  controller instead of the appropriate pc key
laughable lazy and emabarrassingto sum things up this game is a sad buggy mess and near impossible to really enjoy
there was potential there but i have absolutely no idea where the developers left it
clearly it didnt end up in the game
i think i bought this game on clearance at target for   and i still felt ripped off
avoid this title unless you have absolutely nothing else to play and possess the patience to endure all of the abovethis game will not run properlyit runs for about  seconds then stops and starts again then runs again for about  secondsthis game looked like it would be very good
it had an intention grabbing storyline  nazis invade the usa
however although the storyline was good the graphics were very much out of date  more like the games in the nineties
the maximum resolution was x and any decent video card could handle a lot more resolutionthe game play was very linear  you could not deviate one bit from the path the maker intendedi would not recommend it if you want games that graphically are more realistic  like crysis or frontlines fuel of waroverlord for all the hype and ballyhoo just doesnt get it with me
the interface controls are all wrong to what im used to and the game seems more suited to be a video game than a computer game
i always use the right mouse button to move the player forward and go right and left by moving the mouse right and left
even in games that have keyboard commands for movement instead of the mouse you can alter these to use the mouse or at least some of them
the game itself might be all right if there was wider use of the mouse in what ive mentioned above
unfortunately there isnt and you cant switch movement commands to the mouse
im sorry to down the game but i gave up joy sticks and keypads a long time ago when i moved up to real computers and have no desire to use them with computer games again
theyre fine with game machines but they dont make the grade with me when it comes to computers
ill probably sell the game since i have no intention of playing it and regret i ever purchased it to begin withbad voice acting
juvenile humor
boring storyline
annoying control scheme
get the picture
even at the rock bottom discount price its a total waste of time and moneyi was looking forward to playing this it sounded like an updated version of dungeon keeper its not
instead youve got this avatar a big clunky knight in armor some kind of gnomelike adviser who never stops talking and some minions who never stop chattering like a bunch of monkeys with a footballyou go out on missions to recover artifacts but you can  only get things done by using the minions to do your bidding
but youre restricted to using controls which dont work or are physically impossible try this one hold down both mouse buttons move the mouse to  guide your minions through a path and simultaneously click the center mouse button to indicate your targetim guessing that this might work somehow with a console but try doing it with a mouseand if you release any buttons or stop moving the minions immediately go out of controlor objectives that require ten minions to move but youve only got sixand they never stop chattering and the gnomelike guy just keeps repeating himselfafter ten minutes its no longer funny and after twenty minutes its painful
send me the postage and you can have this one for freea total waste of money
it does not work on my pc
just ended up deleting it from my machinei am sorry that i wasted my money on this game
i was hoping it would be a good horror type game like fear because when i saw the name clive barker i thought hey why not good god was i wrongi am trying to think of one positive thing about the gameit unintalls fastplease clive stick to the moviesa fps with goofy quick dodge commands needed to complete the game
very linier game play  again with these parts in the game that require a quick dodge climbwhatever that must be completed to play the game
stupid
the game sells itself as scary creepy fps but the reality is that it is about as intense as super mario bros it was a waste of cold cash for megame seems entertaining
a new concept as all the races are very differentokay maybe not an entirely new concept see starcraft iii got the game recently feb   so likely no new patches coming in after reading about petroglyph studios and that it was a stepchild of westwood studios
with high hopes i installed the game and here is what i found game has excellent graphics
better than sc
has very different races so expect to play for a while
is very buggy
i am stuck at mission  have played it  times but each time i reach near the end the game freezes and forces me to restart the computer subtract  star game is associated with games for windows live
i guess microsoft was trying to go after steam but failed miserably
the live client updated the game roughly  times before finally patching the game
even after patching the game i got the error in   stars very annoyed with     starso overall  starsinstalls securom
this is one of those copyright protection programs that you may never be rid of
many people have had issues including myself with starting the game because incompatibilities between securom and other software makes securom think the dvd is a copy
do some reading and you will also see that sega offers no solution
its been  months now still no fix
do your self a favor and try a game that does not have these frustrationshail flaviusi wasted enough time trying to play this sorry game so i wont waste much time trying to review it
this game had a great premise and some good ideas but the gameplay is just too clumsy
there are much better games out there
try faces of war insteadmask of boredomnote this main contain spoilersim not exactly sure why this game received a higher rating then nwnbaffles me really
mob is a terrible game with a boring storyline
the companions in this game were just as boring
they didnt interact with each other like in nwn
most of your companions were way too serious and acted more like stone animations then letting them come off as real peoplefurthermore later on in the game you soon find out about most of your former companions in nwn
most are either dead or missing
i found this to be a rather brutal way of just eliminating them
the companions in nwn i grew quite fond of them because of how much they interacted with each other and they really came off as if they had real feelings
with that i was really ticked off ammon came up and said oh by the way your former lover casivir is dead
this was rather heartless of the developers
youre only able to interact and grow your relationship with him towards the end of the game and now you found out he is dead
i really did enjoy my female character being involved with casivir
they should have allowed him to live and allowed you to try and find him at some point
maybe in the future they will bring him and have more adventures with more of your former companionsthe world you are in this game looks too dark and depressing and youre forced on some quest that in the end doesnt make any sense leaving numerous questions unansweredagain i still say they should have allowed your character to continue on adventuring through neverwinter instead of being in this boring land and with this boring story archi do have to agree with people the spirit eating bar is rather annoying and really becomes the focus of your game then actually being able to do other things
also the new rest system they have in the game ticked me off i preferred the rest in nwnlooting is this game was crap most of the time you end up getting essences off the enemies you defeat basically forcing you to craft items
look i dont like crafting its too time consuming
i guess the developers were taking the lazy route and didnt want to come up with any new items for the gamethe end of the game made me somewhat happy i got the good ending seeing as to how i finally was able to go back to west harbor
but once again it didnt make sense
it said at the end if you choose to take back up the role of knightcaptain or find some other adventure is a tale for another time
oh yeah my character just saved all of fauren got a sliver shard ripped from her chest got some spirit eating curse on her and nearly died because of it and too add found out most of her companions are either dead or missing including her former lover
yeah im sure my female character is so looking forward to finding something else to screw her overbottom line watching paint dry is more fun than this game
the developers need to look at fable and oblivion for references
i know theyre trying something new but honestly its just not working for meif you look at the one and two star reviews you will notice a constant complaint  the combat
it is truly awful try the demo and see for yourself
it is unlike any other rpg you have to click at the exact moment when a silly flash happens on the sword it is based on twitch reflexes and is like an arcade game
just the combat alone makes this game a must not buy because like in all rpgs combat is a main focus of the game
lets just say even the developer knows this design was a total lemon and will be changing it for the witcher  quietly though
unless you want to be play an arcade style rpg skip this there are many other rpgs with real depth and good combat mechanics than this availableas i was decived by the witcher  pc game now so even more
did not launch was not installed
can not play
patches did not work either
nor instructions from the offsite worked
dont want to spend all my time downloading
buyer beware
if it is not the enhaced edtion  dont buy
i have a very decent ltthe game is well forgettable
you are not missing anything by not playing this that is if you can even install it firstsome mindless fun but not really much to warrant writing an indepth review forwent to install it on windows  and when asked for the cdkey it was nowhere to be found
just a blank spot where it should have beenin my books that is an instant one star review right therei really did not feel like going through customer support and emails and registration to get a product key for a  game
found a crack for it installed it and it played fine boring and repetitive but played fine
it did not feel like it was made with a single player in mind and felt too much like a multiplayer game with some pretty bad ai at thatbottom linei would have asked for a refund if it was over  otherwise it is a meh killemup game
in all honesty i would say to just skip iti was highly anticipating this game especially after seeing the online videos
i picked it up day  and have had it for almost  month
i tried really really hard to like this game but its not happeningi guess i didnt really comprehend that it is a remake of an old game
as a result all they really did was spruce up the graphics and soundbut the gameplay and controls are terrible
i am mostly comparing the game to recent castlevania games i played on the gameboy advance gba
on the gba games your character could do slides get whip power ups double jumps in the air and so on
in this game all of that is removed so you can only jump and whip over and over and overmy biggest complaint with the game is the presentation of the levels is just boring and seems pointless
everytime you scroll off screen you are in a new room which loses the feeling of being in a specific part of the castle the enemies just attack you at regular intervals and show no real ai of any kindfor example on one level an enemy speared me from above which made me fall back through a hole in the groud when this happened i was suddenly in a new room with swamp creatures
so i ran to the left to avoid them the screen scrolled and again i was in a rd new room
all this in under  seconds
i felt totally lost and had no idea where i was in the game
so you slowly begin to drudge back to where you were but it just feels old
with the lack of double jump and slide attacks i feel too limited to dodge attacks effectivelyin a nutshell it feels like they took the original bit nes castlevania and improved the graphics while sadly throwing away all the cool improvements to castlevania games over the yearsonly nostolgic people who loved the original castlevania games will like this game
if youve played the more recent ones you will be let downthis game was absolutely terrible on so many levels
really boring
you run around in a one dimensional world swinging god knows what
terriblei really wanted this game and i guess my expectations were higher than the quality of the game itself
the game play slow choppy and the character moves like he has cement shoes on
if it wasnt for the fact that sotn was part of this konami would never had made a dimefun
zerosince i cant properly rate this ill have to rate it here in the commentaryhow much fun is this game
zero zero zero zero zerohow do you rate this game overall
zero zero zero zero zerothe story may be fine in my opinion of what little ive seen in this bought game but the game mechanics itself is awful
youre allowed only a set of a few turns on every map and ill understand that if the maps conditions require it
like if i have to get out of the area before backup for the bad guys show up and suchbut every sticking map has this turn limit in it
i truly enjoyed the psx final fantasy tactics because the creators knew of that idea and limited the turn limit to a few nerve racking stages
good lord those darc idiots didnt have the common sense to have a menu selection option to shut down this insane conceptltim a sucker for all things star wars so i really wanted to love this game
id enjoyed knights of the old republic and this was just going to be the same thing only better right
nopethis game is set in the star wars setting we all know and love and the visual and audio effects for the lightsabers are fantastic but the gameplay element of the game is absolutely atrocious
its a bad game with hideous camera and controls problems that suck all the fun out of playing
you spend more time wrestling the controls than you do slicing and dicing stormtroopersfirst off targeting
unbelievably this game is worse at targeting than zelda for the n
yes its that bad
you have no way to control what you are targeting other than facing towards it
no cycle through targets button as is common in other games
this leads to the very common situation of you wanting to force grab or force choke an enemy right in front of you but the game decides that really you wanted to pick up a box behind the stormtrooper on the complete opposite side of the roomdodging also worse than in zelda
its so bad that its almost unmanageable
in order to dodge you have to have an enemy targeted much like zelda
however instead of simply locking on you have to hold down r forever as long as you want to have the enemy targeted
this quickly becomes unmanageable with the number of other buttons you have to hold down for lengths of time such as r to grab
and you have to push the joystick and l and still be holding r to dodge
ridiculousand the game seems extremely sluggish and inconsistent in reacting to your commands
i had gotten used to the precision and speed with which the game reacted in drakes fortune or assassins creed
here half the time your double jump command doesnt even execute the double jump
this is a shocking flaw given that super smash brothers for the nintendo  managed the double jump flawlesslythe platforming sections of this game are atrocious
it would have been much better if they had been left out entirely
prince of persia this is not
its not even drakes fortune
its just a clumsy inelegant imprecise mess
you cant have a platforming game without ledge grab yet this is precisely what this game does
there are far too many one way slippery ledge to death situations
remember the sands of time in prince of persia which let you rewind
yep no such thing here
instead you get to start over at the nearest checkpoint
and its usually not obvious which ledge you can safely land on and which one you cannot before you leap
terrible design flaw
especially given the fact just the merest nudge sends the character plummeting off to one sidein fact just the forward momentum of executing lightsaber combos can send him hurtling off the edge
this is a terrible design decision
if you use attacks and get to close to the ledge in real platforming games the character grabs on and doesnt fall
the platforming here is as bad as it was in the original d prince of persia and thats saying a lot
the designers wanted to get cute with making you use your force powers to lower ledges you could jump onto but the whole thing is terribleits not made any better by the camera
theyre trying to provide a nice cinematic experience by zooming the camera out and putting it in a fixed position in many key scenes
sometimes it works great
more often its an absolute mess
frequently you cannot see your character at all being hidden behind a protrusion or even by the body of the person you are fighting
its like the tested half the fights to get the right camera angles and just made poor guesses for the other half
having a triple a title like this with camera issues where you literally cant even see your character is unforgivable
the inability to easily see what is around you is also bad given the area of effect attacks several monsters launch where a spot on the ground begins to glow and if you are standing near it after a set amount of time it explodes and you take damage
its entirely possible to be near enough one of these spots to be hit but it doesnt show up in your field of vision
indeed the game seems to take delight in arranging the camera angle so this occursoh and that leads us to another unforgivable omission one i thought the games design industry had long ago accepted as standard but force unleashed is a step back in so many ways
you cannot skip cutscenes
this is abominable especially given how many cutscenes there are often some right before a tricky platforming session or boss battle you must watch over and over again each time
the cutscenes are visually impressive but i dont want to have to watch them half a dozen times
speaking of cutscene failures there are cases where a cutscene is split
theres a custcene then you can control your character for a half second including taking damage from foes then it goes right back to the continuation of the cutscene
i cant believe this is intended and its a rather glaring flawbut the biggest flaw in the entire game is the abomination of raxus prime
this is literally one of the  worst levels i have ever played
the color palette is painful to the eyes and the level design is insipid and uninspired
raxus prime is supposed to be the junk pile world so there just random heaps of black and yellow debris everywhere funneling you down a narrow linear path
the colors are atrocious it looks like someone vomited over a pile of chewed up legos
everything is just a kaledeiscope of yellow and black near objects distant objects ledges you can hold onto ledges that just send you to your deaththeres no real discrimination or attempt to draw a visual contrast between important elements and the background
moreover this level is home to one of the absolute nonos of gaminga miniboss battle without a save point afterwards
combined with the aforementioned terrible platforming compounded by the uniform black and yellow vomit pattern of raxus prime it means you may have to repeat a boss battle two or even three times if the games jumping engine betrays youeven navigating the menus is an exercise in tedium and frustration
each and every click you make takes you to another loading screen before the submenu shows up
ive never seen this before and it really slows things down and breaks up the flow of playin short this game is a major major disappointment
the visuals aside from raxus prime are superb the soundtrack blaster sounds lightsaber hum are all terrific
but the gameplay is severely lacking almost across the board
if like me you loved kotor and are looking for more of the same dont bother
watch the movies again instead
or find a friend who has played the game already and get him to show you the unlocked cinematics
dont waste your money or time on this onethis is both the worst star wars video game ive seen on any platform and the worst ps game ive owned so far
its a great concept but while the demo is fun and polished the game itself is not
it suffers from poor level design and a number of outright bugs save files not actually saving where they claim to forcing you to replay large sections of the game every time you come back to it invisible walls and floors that have you walking on air and bouncing off of nothing and poor camera behavior that often makes it impossible to see what youre doing
on top of this there are numerous wtf am i supposed to do here moments where it is not at all clear how to move forward at alli played this game for about  hours which because of the stupid savestate bug was probably about  hours of actual unique gameplay then threw it out
i only paid  for it and i still feel ripped off
avoid this game and be wary of lucas arts games in the future because clearly their quality isnt what it used to beive got to stop ordering games before reading lots of reviews on them
this is a great example
i preordered this game thinking it would be the best star wars game
i was wrongprosnice graphicscool force powersthe apprentice has some nice costumesconsway to short about  hours longway to easyoverhypedyoull never remember the combosthey offer you force powers that you dont needno reason to replaydlcthe reason i put dlc as a con is that several weeks after the game launched lucasarts released dlc
i wouldnt have a problem with this if it was free but it wasnt
they could of added the content to the final game but no they wanted to make more money
i absolutley hate when developers make games then release dlc that couldve been put in the final game
they released a few character packs missions and costumes charging up to 
another thing i absolutley hated was the part where you bring down the star destroyer
in the trailer from e or whenever they showed it as you being able to bring it down in seconds
that wouldve been really cool
but in the final game you have to bring it down literally inch by inch
and not just that enemy ships come down every few minutes so you have to stop destroy them start bringing it down again destroy the ships again
it could take up to an hour and was just terrible
i wound up selling it to buy an acually good game like resistance  so do yourself a favor and just avoid this gamethis game could have been so much better if the controls were actually good
the controls of this game is what makes it bad to play
the defense is unresponsive the attacks are too
the targetting system is also a problem
i suggest you rent this game to see what im talking about
only a very hardcore star wars fan would say this game is good
if it were not for the poor controls and camera angles this would have easily be a contender for game of the yeari paid  dollars  a game that could of been carried on the ps
the game sucks
no story line no backgrounds on none of the characters
they dont even tell u why u runnin around killin people and shootin signs  points
i dont get how any true gamer would like this game
theres nothin wrong wit simple games but this game is horrible
if u like this game then this must been the first game u ever played in yo life
listen to me dont do it
u got other games like uncharted heavenly sword kane and lynch call of duty and many more that put the club to shame
if u already got those games play them again before u buy the club
i hate this game so much i dont even go to the real club no moregraphics are good enough but its for kids so gameplay is much more important
the game got really boring for all of my kids age  and down
i tried it as well and it just doesnt hold your interest level
the cues are not particularly helpful and there is no immediate endgame to it
spend elsewhereive thought with the reviews that this game has ill be a fine game but is not
poor design terrible sound not fun
i dont recommend this game at allevery time you play a lego wii game for a long time it freezes and is probably why my old wii console died i lost every little bit of data because if you put the disk in another wii console or wii u you lose all your data because it froze so much or maybe it was i had it for four years but it still freezesi got this expecting it to be like the xbox version i like that one but this one was very different on all catagorys
i couldnt  even finish level  it was so confusing boring and hard
the controls are frustrating the graphics are horribleand the way you look at the character your playing is very inconvenient and you cant change it
dont make the same mistake i didthis game is boring stupid pointless and has the worst controls ever
i would recommened renting this one if you think you must play it because its just a total waste of moneyi just rented this game and glad i did
i found that i had to shake my controller so much that i could have broken my arm just to get it to work
and even with all that shaking it wasnt enough shaking anyway
some of the games like the javilen and dream race and the swimming one was ok i played with my brother and he won a race and was on the phone at the end so he didnt even really have to do anything just to play it
others require you to push combos of button and shake at the same time and sometimes it just got frustrating
then theres the loading
it loads the area then shows the scene and then goes to each character to tell you who you are
theres just too much flashy stuff before getting to the playing
just get to the playing part of the gameover all i didnt like this game rent it first if you like it then get iti actually like the winter one betteri have two super mario fans  for the st time they said they dont like it soi had to try it  i think the game is frustratingnot my kinda game i rather play other sports wii gamesone of the worst ever made
cumbersome controls on the wii frustrating save options
just a waste of timeany songs you download with this game will be tied to the machine you downloaded them to
they cannot be redownloaded or repurchased on any other machine with the master account you used to purchased them
this is a serious problem for anyone who makes a significant investment into additional songs especially if you ever have to replace your psthere are multiple postings in the psn newsgroups about this problemwish i knew about it before making my purchasethe game is tons of fun but consider investing elsewhere if there is an alternativethis game sucks because the graphic are cheesy the controls layout is bad and many glitches    this is more like watching a trimmeddown horribly rendered poorly scripted version of a movie  only it costs more and takes longergameplay is virtually nonexistent
you dont really do much of anything but guide the characters down short paths engage in minor buttonpressing battles and press sequences of buttons to manipulate objects for some odd reason
walking across balance beams is exceptionally slow and tediousmost of your time is spent engaged in ridiculous dialogs which cannot progress until you play three or more extremely poorquality mini games such as push the balls into a hole avoid the balls match the symbols and so onyour pan discovers symbols throughout your journey which make it easier to answer questions using the alethiometer
keep the target to the center until a button symbol appears then press the button and then go through that two more times for the answer to the question to be revealed allowing you to pass on to the next pointless activitygraphics are minimally detailed
not much to see and it all looks similar
enemies include the dude in a tall hat the dude with antlers on his head the flamethrower guy in an underwater helmet the witch and the bear maybe one more
each class of character comes in only one flavor and is barely articulated  its patheticaudio is the only thing cool about this game although at points it gets choppy and cuts out on occasionis this what the gaming industry is coming to
what a waste of programmers time
what a waste of everyones time reallythey had it at wal mart for  so i thought id play it through
absolutely dumb game
im not sure how others justify a five star reviewmi play  no lee estos juegos no los compren es perder el dinero y es una lastima a mi me encantaba crashmy silver controller came with a ps silver set that was a gift to me the controller worked fine for a week or sothen i put in a gamegrand theft auto  and for a few minutes it was ok but then the horn in the car would not go off so reading the info in the game i found out that the left controller stick operates the horn in the in car mode so i took a old controller from my original ps and used it and all was finei had gotten a warranty on the whole thing when i got it so the store said that i must return the whole unit and replace it with another oneeven when i explained that it was just the controller they said to bring back the whole thing so i didand now i have a brand new ps and it has a nicer controller alsoand it works fineseems there were some silver controllers that got past quality control at sonythis game was my  year old sons who is a star wars fanatic and he really didnt enjoy this gamei see all these reviews and i wonder
why are those little kids playing electronics
so my little  year old begged me for this game and when i bought it for her she said it was so so so so so so so so boring
i dont recommend it to anyonethese batteries do not not hold up
ordered two sets twice but they give out very quickly
went back to using aa and in the long run its really cheaperdeceptive merchandising  states that it will work with all nyko chargers
i thought that my kids were charging it wrong but it simply will not work with an induction charger
very disappointedthe plug of the intercooler  ex is not compatible with the new xbox  resident evil
the plug had a straigt plastic line right beside the  electrical pins that hindered me from pluging it in
i went with the black cooling stationi bought this cooler and loved it form the getgo plugged in easily and stayed put then a few weeks later it started making noise loud noise
i unplugged it and took it apart and the fans were pretty well shot
i have read about swapping out the fans for much better performance but im too lazy for that right now so i will just buy another type of cooler and be done
stay away from this coolerthis shooter is dull by the standards set by other wii shooters
it isnt creepy like the zombie shooters it isnt quick and cute like link crossbow or the chicken games and it isnt a lee marvin movie like most of the wwii shooters
its just a ripoff of target terror
after ten minutes i was shooting hostages for causing the game and on my way to trade in the gameim a huge fan of nancy drew and wanted so badly to love this game
alas it was not meant to be
by the time i figured out some of the minigames which you can beat by randomly banging on buttons nancy is solving the mystery and its overthe dialogue screens become really boring with the same image flashing over and over againthe one thing i found fabulous with this game was that nancy in not so many words told her boyfriend she wasnt giving up solving mysteries to dote and spend all of her time with him i had to laugh the original nancy drew from the s packed her dads revolver they kept that same spunk by letting the boyfriend know it wasnt always about himlike the previous reviewer im hooked on the nancy drew pc games and preordered this one
there is no challenge to this game at all you walk through rooms and everything that you are supposed to see is highlighted
the mini games that you play to make characters more willing to talk are extremely easy
it might be an ok game for a child but if youre an adult and want something that even remotely resembles the her interactive pc games dont waste your money on thisive been a nancy drew fan since i was a small girl
ive enjoyed playing all the other titles for the pc and enjoyed playing the one that came out in gba form
i was really looking forward to this game with hopes and expectations that they had done an even better job than they did with the gba game
sadly i was let truly let down due to their lack of use of the touch screen which for a game like this would have been great and lack of a good sleuth challenge even my teenager says it didnt challenge
i hope that if they create more nancy drew titles for the ds they do a better job
but for a small beginner like my niece age  it was fun for her even when we had to read some of the bigger words for her
maybe they should find a way to get some of their pc titles to ds format for those of us who truly enjoy nancy drewdont like the graphics or movement of the various people animals etc
the tutorial is not the best
after numerous tries to understand the game i uninstalled it and put it on the shelfi picked this game up from my local used media store for 
i played through the tutorial and decided that my time would be better spent on a different game
the controls are definitly as complex as the other reviewers state and to me felt incredibly awkward and i often found myself doing something i was not trying to do
the step by step is ok in the tutorial but once they turn you loose for a mission you have no idea what you are doing
or at least i didnt
im sure you could get used to them but it certainly wasnt my cup of tea
if you are going to invest in getting good at a game there are better games to get good at
also from checking around on message boards that i find reputable the online play is nearly dead with only hardcore players remaining just waiting to eat your lunch
ill be selling my copy hopefully at my next yard salethis game is dissapointing for me
i bought it for arcade mode and to use with the lightgun
i have several setups for the lightguns and most light gun games are really fun this one isnt at all
for example bad guys shoot you endlessly you cant even see them and yet they take a lot of hits from your thompson to go down
positioning say a rocket launcher is difficult from the perspective they give you as well
overall i would not have bought this game if i had rented itid actually rate this a half a star if i couldthe controls on this game are terrible and there are no options to reassign the buttons
game play is just annoying when you can accurately control your character or your aim
i bought this game to play coop and it is ok for that but really annoying to work your way through the level the agro is just a dumb ideaa lineal game a simple history very easy game  points at least bored game i prefer cod mw i and iithe seller claimed that this used game worked but it didnt
tried it in  different xbox  consoles
returned it and bought one that did work at gamestop for this is a great game
the rating is for the sellerthis has to be the worst need for speed ever i have played nintendo cube games pc games ps games and other nes games on wii an this is the worse dont waste your moneythis game is garbage
i buy racing games to race not to spend all my time in ludicrous menus
this game is the epitome of really dumb games where the producers seem to think you want to spend all your time setting up cars tracks etc and not racing
basically you only get  races and to get anymore you either have to setup the races yourself or progress through something to get more races i gave up before i got there
if you want to race try something else if you like to spend all your time tweaking and fiddling and menuing then you probably will like this game
me i hated it after about  hour
overall boringi played nfs most wanted and it was the best thing i ever played
so i looked forward to pro street and i thought it was absolutely terrible
dont waste your moneyfor the pc and ps this game is awesome
ive seen it with my own eyes
i realize that when a game comes out for a certain system in this case ps that they have to cut back a little when putting it to a different system ps
not owning a ps i got it for my beloved psdissapointment
it looks like absolute crap
even the animated menus have been shot down to a lame still image
i was shocked
i felt like i was playing the first gran tourismoi knew that they changed their format to real pro street racing and got away from the free roam city driving which is fine but i cant believe they cut back this much to put it on ps
this system can handle much more than this
when i saw it on pc it looked great and the damge was amazing but on the ps version you can slam it into the wall all you want and all you see is paint scrape
what the hell
a warning to every one only get this game if you have a good pc or a ps
if you want a good need for speed game for ps get need for speed carbon
its a fun and challenging game with good graphics and sound
but a word to the wise
dont buy cars you dont need
save your money for the end
youre going to need it
its frustrating if you dontanyway booo to you ea for ruining a good game for those who dont have new systemcomplete waste of money
bought it impulsively
wont be able to get a refund so i will toss it in the garbage
no surround sound
cannot use siaxxis sp
controller to steer
cant figure out how to set up second player  the box says its for  players
the name of the first player doesnt show up on the racers screen
there has to be a better racing game out thereplease dont buy this game
i played the demo and it sucked
there will be plenty of racing games soon enoughthis is one of the worst video games i ever playedthe reason why i bought this game is because i thought it will be awesome like need for speed hot pursuit nobut instead it was all changed i couldnt even think about this gamethe only thing i thought about this game is the  i wasted it on it edit peice of crap game i cant even play it without having the disc inserted
im trying to burn some dvds so i fugured i would play the game while i wait but uhh nope
need to insert the discive already installed the game why do i still need the disc
this isnt a windows  computer next thing they will be asking me to insert the floppy into drive agraphics are okay but the game is stupid
all it does is talks and talks and talks and it doesnt even let me race
it just keeps explaining things
i just want to race the card shut the stupid host up so i can playnot only that but it only lets me play  race track over and over again
ive been doing it for  days straight taking first place every single time because the computer cars are so easy and i even had it on hard modebut it will not give me any more cars or tracks it just keeps making me do the same thing over and over againgraphics are okay but the rest is stupid
buy something else with less talking and more racing
i thought i was buying a racing game not a dvd moviethis game suuuuuuucked  what happened carbon was great and most wanted was awsome this game sucked really really bad
listen all im saying is good thing i rented it for  and didnt spend  like ervyone else remember you cant return it after you open it so listen to me
dont get thisadjectivenot necessary dispensable inessential needless nonessential uncalledfor unessential unneeded unrequiredaddsuperfluousredundantandfugeddabouditi thought that this would have been a fun accessory set for the wii sports package but on reflection i should have used the money towards an additional controller or nunchuck instead
the pieces dont fit together well and it requires some patience to get the threads to line up properly
the base that holds the controller feels flimsy and if you use too much force to unscrew the attachment itll probably break
the base is uncomfortable for small hands especially for the baseball grip
you lose the vibration effect
in baseball you have to take the controller out of the handle to pitch or else look rather silly pitching with a bat in your hand
it doesnt take long but its something you dont need to do if youre not using the accessory
youll need to take the controller out of the padded sleeve before using these accessories
and then put it back on when youre throughthe bottom line is that these accessories add nothing to the wii sports experience and youre much better off keeping things simple and using the regular remote controller on its ownamanda richards march  i dont know how well the other sport controllers work
but these didnt work so well for me
controls feel and movement are just fine
the screen sensor will work very little or not at all
i really liked the golf club but to finish a course i had to use the screen sensor point and click
i would need to remove my controller from the golf club at the end of each course because the sensor beam could not make it threw their cheap set up
same with the bat
the tennis racket is very bad
im surprised that they didnt receive more bad reviewsthis was my first experience with a wii and the description led me to believe this product was essential for the sports experience
you do not need to buy this to use the wii
first youd have to buy one set of these for each persons remote
so if you have four remotes and try to play fourplayer games youd have to buy four of these sets
second theyre a pain in the butt to switch out if you change from say golf to tennis
they do nothing to enhance the playability of the game  on the contrary they can get in the way especially if the play area is a bit small
id suggest passing on it until youve played the game without them then buy them if you feel you really musti bought  sets of these attachments
i couldnt get the golf clubs to work so i havent tried the others
actually you can do the stuff with just the wiimote
im going to try some of the others again but i already think the sports pack is more trouble than its worthflimsy build quality
cant be used lefty
very annoying to take in and out of various pieces
but worst of all  what really kills this thing  is that it ruins the gameplay
the connection is just not nearly as good when you put these instruments on the controller
responsiveness goes way down and that just kills the gameplay and renders essentially uselessnice idea but not well constructed and actually ends up being a hindrancei was excited to get an item like this because i always wanted to use my gamecube controller to play my games on the pc
i was very excited to get this product until it kept causing my pc to abruptly shut down about  of the time
the first time it caused my pc to shut down i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt cause i figure i had outdated built in drivers
but than it occurred  more times with the latest driverthis item should be pulled from amazon because it is very harmful for a pc to just shut down abruptly and this faulty device causes it to happenone last thing i have actually developed a fear of unplugging usb devices because of this product
even devices i use everyday that have never been defectiveugh i have to put together  words for these thingswell they suck
they fit the controllers like hell
i mean they really look crapy they didnt add to the look of the controler at all
it was easy to see defects in there molding process
i would not buy honestly youd be better off buying th controler in the color you want
i gave all four of mine away to buddiesand they just tossed them in the trash so i guess your call lolfirst off i received it in this cheap little clear bag about  by 
no brand name or sku  on the bag or anything but the biggest disappointment is that they werent the same covers
it had no side grips like the one in the picture
another problem that the skin covers the lights on the front of the controller
there is a skin that sony sells at target which is sony licensed that fits a lot better has an opening for the front lights and is way better quality
it sells for beware it seems like eforcity has a few schillers working on the ratings of their products
if you dont believe me look at the history of some of their ratings to see for yourselfi really was looking forward to playing this game
the splash screens were not click through type so you have to sit and endure always
never made it past the opening part of the game start as it went through a very long story board type opening then stops each and every time on a wide white screenonline found out that many people have this problem
some found solutions
i tried them all nothing worked
bummer as it really sounds like it would be a great game to play
no official help online or supportthe mechanics were serviceable and the atmosphere not bad though the dated graphics didnt helpthe problem with this game is that after a couple levels youve killed the same zombiewithabroomstick and scarynursewithhugebreasts a hundred timesif there had been a bit more variety i might have made it further but its just such a dud
it really makes you think i have better things to do than thisive played this game when it came out years ago
i was hoping to see something new and original in a sort of a post ww environment of soviet russia
it actually reminded me of painkiller
but do not be fooled
the game starts with a somewhat well done level and may give an impression that it is something really well done
it is not
the further you go into the game the worse it gets
it is as if it was a project for one programmer who just had to have the job doneyou go from location to locationwhose themes depict something out of soviet propaganda poster heavy industrialization and begin encountering more and more absurd enemies
you are attacked by zombie like old women patients in psycho ward
you speak to a man whose eyes keep rolling in its sockets
then you got to an abandoned zoo where dinosaurs not unlike veloceraptors attack
depressing imagery out of place metal soundtrack very frustrating gameplayif you dont believe me check some videos of the game on youtube
ive warned you
this is not worth you are empty is really empty for me
i paid the big bucks for it but it will not run on my system and i have a monster system with dualcore gt gig memory  terabytes of storage dual widescreen flatscreen monitors and every bell and whistle that i could stuff into a full tower
it seems to have a problem with my asus motherboard and we cant quite pin it down
and im a retired microsoft certified systems engineer and i cant even get this piece of trash to run on my system
ive talked to the atari folk but that was a waste of hours and hours of telephone time
i feel as if i was ripped off on this one and just shoved  down the drainwhere to start with this game
death to spies could have been a good game but it fails in every area except for the original ideayour character is assigned to counter intelligence missions within the soviet union during ww ii
youre tasked to assassinate or kidnap german agents and generals steal or photograph blueprints and plans and other counter intelligence related missions
unfortunately the idea for this game is about the only good part of itthe installation process is quite easy and straight forward in my opinion
it states that the game is compatible with windows xp but it did not run very well at all on my machine and it has more ram and a better video card than the recommended system specsonce you get the game installed it all goes downhill
the training mission is outright ripped off from another atari game for the ps
getting your character pointed in the right direction and moving properly is a chore and ive got an optical mouse that has no problems with other games
once you complete the simple tasks of running over boards and climbing a latter you get to learn weapons
youre stuck in a third person mode and aiming is a disaster
even with a good mouse and turning down the sensitivity in the game options the aiming reticle jumps all around the screen
i finally gave up on the training mission and went into the first mission of the campaign
this is where the problems with aiming are at their worst
no matter what i did to aim at certain soldiers i wanted to kill in order to steal their uniform i never could hit them for some unknown reason
also the graphics were very clunky
instead of simply taking steps the enemies would basically glide all over the screen and were suddenly on top of me
but then they didnt stand there and shoot at me they glided on past only to somehow locate me again and shoot from behind after looking for me for a couple minutes even though i was right out there in the open
nothing could fix this game even after i turned down the graphics to their lowest setting
at that point i quit
i simply could not stand this game any longerstay far away from this game
its a glitchy horrible messi didnt have high expectations for this game to begin with but i did not expect it to be this bad
this game is like a horrible throwback from the s with bad graphics awkward controls and lame movie clips
even the training sessions that you start out with were so boring that i literally had to force myself through them
the idea behind the game isnt bad but the way it is implemented isi found it very hard to keep playing this game let alone try to enjoy it
i know im being pretty harsh but i really think they could have spent a great deal more time polishing it upproslots of weapons to choose from even from the very beginningdecent sound effects including ambient noise like birds chirpingconsbad graphics bad controls bad clips bad overall designvery little fun factordifficult to play even on easy modeconclusion  i wont be playing this game again
i wouldnt wish this game upon my worst enemy it is that baddeath to spies is easily the most frustrating pc game i have ever played
i can understand making a game challenging but this game far surpasses challenging and moves into ridiculous
here you are a ussr counterintelligence officer who is trying to infiltrate the nazi party
the game does have great graphics gameplay and is extremely faithful to historical settings
but overall this one is just too time consuming difficult and annoying for me to deal withnot recommendedwhen i got the game i immediately started feeling like this was going to be a bad experience mainly because the game is called death to spies
then after the long installation process i proceeded to play
the opening intro grabbed my attention
the cutscene had some nice lighting and environmental design but i felt like the characters looked cartoony
then i played the games opening training missionafter i got used to the clunky controls i became frustrated just trying to get my guy to move
jumping over obstacles was ridiculous shooting was harder then ever
the mouse controls are awful and i have a logitech mx laser mouse
the character design is horrendous and the graphics overall look like oatmeal
the colors are all drab and dull and nothing looks vivid or jumps off the screen
i played the game for no more than  minutes and couldnt take it anymore
stay awayno kidding
the worst of the worst of adventure badness
im quitting the game  through because i cant find my way around the park
i can see where i need to go but the green arrows dont let me go therethe few puzzles are easy but pointless  easy that is except for the part where for no real reason you have to navigate to the other end of the park and back
good luck doing that
ive seen that tunnel of terror one too many times
screw it its not worth it
the story is hackneyed and i dont give a hoot about the charactersthe only good thing about this game is the voice characterization which is exceptional
other than that  i wouldnt play this game for free
literally
this was a gift and im throwing it awaydelaware st john the seacliff tragedythis game is fun and you will be playing for hours with this pc gamea seller is trying to sell this game for  bucks first off the series is still on tv it has not really gained classic value as of yet
second its for the wii an recent system not to old
three over all a great game however you can get it at gamestop literly for  bucks new or well around there people really have no sense of valuing nor do they really understand some things as old as they are just dont have the market for deep pocket buyersi did not like this game
the kart was very difficult to control but the game was also very boring on top of that
i tried it twice and then sold itour son got this with some money he saved up
he was excited after playing mario kart but after playing the game for a few minutes it became clear that this game is just terrible
its beyond difficult to control the cars and go around the very bad tracks
my son got frustrated very quickly and after playing it myself for a few minutes i can understand
save your money or kids money and dont bother with this terrible gamethis game was truly terriblethe controls are horrible and the game play was nothing like real boxingi love wii boxing and thought this game looked fun when i bought it
i should have looked at the amazon reviews prior but i was at a store and excited to play itcomplete waste of money
youd have more fun watching your  swirling around in the toilet bowl when you flushed itpros graphicsgraphics are at least somewhat realistic  comparable to the ps almost
its much more realistic  better for the eyes to watch to know how to move speedmovements of the fighters are much slower then wii boxing or victorious boxers which makes it more realistic  strategy more important
it is very easy to track  see when a fighter is about to  is punching you or blockingcons no music only a few grunt noises only  boxer choices to start withone being very overweight  hairy though give points for graphics i didnt want to choose him nor fight him because it was too realistic
lol unresponsive to normal punches  blocksi did the tutorial it worked there but in the ring
nope
i couldnt do a body block for the life of me  head block took several attempts each time
instead of fighting i just started experimenting  counting how many times the game responded to my punching  out of  times
sometimes only  out of  times even for very slow good form punches lack of punching choices there were no hooks  i forget if there were uppercuts i think so but i think i got it to respond x to do that though i made repeated attempts in my game response experiment
there is only mostly jabs  punches  holding down b or z for super punchesjabs rd person viewyou are too far away they should have made the camera closer or seethru like wii boxing for a more realistic feelwii boxing  victorious boxers revolution are much better with vb being more responsivereal fighting but harder to see with drawn graphicsage of conan was a long time coming but its drilled up as too little too late
the strong majority of its unique content never made it through and what surfaced was a weak collection of genre basics with a halfcooked melee systemthe launch is probably the worst in the mmo genre since funcoms last title anarchy online
everything in the game just about is bugged into nonuse
stats arent even functioning
yes stats
skills do not work feats do not work amd processors and ati cards are left to rot classes are wildly broken or imbalanced its a mess
all of the promising pvp features talked about
nowhere to be found
theyve clearly released a product that would is alpha state at best and dug themselves consecutive years of patching just to catch upi would suggest as a long term genre fan to wait for warhammer online or blizzards next world of warcraft expansion
there is absolutely nothing of interest that made it through to the final conan release and youll be waiting in the cold a long long time waiting for the patches to fix it alli bought this and was excited to get it
after i got it i thought it was going to be like any other computer game where you install it download and apply a few updates and then play
i was sadly mistaken
the game took a while to install maybe longer than it should have
it took up more storage space on my local c drive than it said it would
after it finally installed it ran  updates before starting to run a big update that was  gb to download
downloading a  gb game update
you have gotta be kidding me
i have yet been able to even play this game because of the big updates that it wants to download
i dont have time to wait for it to download that big of updates
 or  gb updates are acceptable but 
i dont recommend buying this gamethis is less a review than a warning
first of all buying this game in used condition is utterly pointless  unless you want to buy it as a coaster because thats what youll get
once activated its useless
welcome to the world of modern pc gamingone another note trying to get this game patched is a matter of utter frustration
ive never experienced such a problem trying to patch a game
disconnect after disconnect
the patching program is clearly unstable
do a search for age of conan patching problems to read more storiesi think this game had great promise but failed to live up to itthis is a mmorpg
even though reviews and product literature makes reference to a single player campaign in addition to mmorpg game play in fact there is no independent single player mode
you must still create an account with the mmo outfit use their internet servers any time you want to play and accept a recurring charge against your credit card in order to get started
additionally there is no option for enjoying the free  day play you get with a new key
you must sign up give a cc play and cancel when the  days are up in order to avoid a charge
how lame is thathail flaviusmost people who give this game high reviews havent played it past level  the beginning island is fun and done well as it was originally suppose to been a single player game and that is what the beginning island is all about
not long after you leave the island you begin to realize the game is incomplete and out of balance mathematically
what i mean is you only travel back and forth mainly between  areas
then you then realize your armor stats most skills you have are uselessly weak or broken
armor pretty much all looks the same and only stat that means anything at all is the defense stat the rest of stats are useless
for example like  to slashing damage when you are doing  damage per swing
game is a hyped up rip off full of lies by funcom wait and buy warhammer if you are looking for a good new mmothe gameplay of age of conan really has potential but unfortunately the entire experience is marred by the most technically inept implementation ever
the installation goes refreshingly fast but that is where everything starts to fall apart
while the program occupies  dvds worth of content you will immediately log online and download almost  dvds worth of patches that take hours to install
pray you have a fast fast fast computer and really high speed broadbandonce the system is installed things start out ok  it is not as userfriendly an introduction as world of warcraft the current gold standard of rpgs but youll figure things out quickly if youve played an mmo before
continuing to play however is hitormiss
i have about   friends trying this game
every one of them has had frequent crashes
on my system the game freezes after about  minutes of play  guaranteedthere is no customer support for the product
you can email funcom but dont expect to get any reply at all
ive posted in the forums and no one has reported ever getting any reply to a question whether its about a technical issue or possible fraud capturing passwords
this is just unacceptablethe game advertises on the bos to be directx  compliant yet its been announced that directx  support will not be implemented until the fallthis game is not worth your time money  or frustrationif you want the worst of mmo experiences this may be it
annoying storyline difficult user interface and an unsophisticated client baseuninstalled and canceled in less than  hoursi purchased age of conan two days after its official launch
i played it for the duration of the initial free  day subscription you receive when you purchase the game
 be wary of reviews that only mention the area designed for new players or extrapolate upon very minor features such as character creation
these things while strong in this game are going to account for but a tiny part of your overall experience
my review focuses on aspects of the game that will affect your enjoyment from day one right on through day thirty  namely stability content and customer service
to start ill focus on the stability and quality of the application itself age of conan is extremely unstable being plagued by bugs that will crash your system for a variety of reasons
the game client has a lingering memory leak that has continued to wax and wane in prevalence since launch
as of the writing of this review the stability of the client is still very poor and the memory leak is still very pervasive you can verify this by visiting funcoms official forums for age of conan
i attempted to use two separate highend systems both different architectures one has an amd  bit cpu quad core with a nvidia video card the other is a dual core intelbased system with an ati video card
the intel system runs windows xp pro sp and has  gb of ram
the amd system runs vista premium and has  gb of ram
both video cards are current generation and are capable of running other modern games at the highest settings without issue
i tried running the client with my drivers and firmware fully up to date attempted using different versions and a wide variety of other modifications but could never run the game with any semblance of stability
to qualify i am a very well paid it worker with over ten years of experience
i am currently a network engineer and work with everything from storage area networks to basic system analysis and administration for netware and windows servers and occasionally linux
i know full well what im doingnext regarding the advertising of the product age of conan is missing much of what is promised on the box including technical features such as directx  if youre not tech saavy directx is an application programming interface for mutlimedia  graphics and audio
directx  is the latest and greatest version
directx  offers more powerful visual effects and cleaner more detailed graphics
this game only supports directx  large scale playerversusplayer combat is not fully implemented
endgame raiding content meant for large groups of players is generally inaccessible to the average player
more on lacking features laterregarding game play the virtual game world is not well realized
many of the zones sections of the virtual world you adventure within may look large and expansive but only a very small area is actually navigable you are confined by invisible barriers into very small tracklike spaces
and unlike other mmos where players can travel freely through an immersive persistent world age of conan is heavily instanced
that is only a small number of people can be in any zone at the same time
when more players try to enter zone a new instance is created which is a copy of the zone in which a set number of players are allowed into
so although there may be  people in one zone there may be four instances of that zone with only  players in each im using arbitrary numbers as an example it varies by zoneagain back to content the game is very light on this
aside from the very polished starting area that guides you through your first  levels there isnt many fun and compelling activities
the quests are very formulaic and pedestrian kill x amount of y bring them to me and quickly dissapear at higher levels forcing players to grind repeatedly killing the same creatures over and over again for hours to advance in the game
the crafting system a staple of the mmo genre is severely lacking
it does not reward appropriately for time spent feels largely incomplete and for lack of a better word is terribly boring
the developer is constantly making adjustments to how the character classes function which is frustrating to players as they are forced to keep respeccing modifying the abilities of their character skills which costs money
accruing money consumes considerable time
you get the picture
many core game mechanics such as character stats think the standard strength intelligence wisdom do not actually work
all of the gear your characters can use look similar typically some form of a kilt and is some hue of brown  of the time i promise you i am not exaggerating
i could literally go on all day in this section
suffice to say the game isnt very fun as much of it is missing or does not function correctlyand finally there is virtually no customer service ingame petitions for assistance routinely last for twelve hours or longer without being responded too and more often than not are deleted with no notification and no reason given as to why
to compound problems the developer funcom openly admitted on their official forums that the majority of customer service both ingame and moderators on their web forums currently consists of volunteersa fair warning to anyone thinking about purchasing this game
buyer bewarei was so excited about this game but it has dissapointed me for the following reasons the game was released when it wasnt even  ready gameplay becomes boring after  month of playing huge patches every week one of the patches was  gb
 very buggy and patches sometimes create more bugs
 pvp is terrible level  can attack level  without a warning
 no customer service because staff are busy completing the game and making patchesthis game will die sooni typically know what im doing when it comes to electronics
and messing this up would have been hard for anyone since its a matter of connecting the charging cable from your ps to the device
which is what i did
the blue light in the device would light up but the charging indicators on the controller never came oni have returned this product and ordered an energizer branded charger at twice the price
hope that works since the next logical step is for me to stop being a cheapskate and just buy sonys official ps charger for the instructions were horrible but its on par with the poor quality i expect from suspiciously inexpensive electronics
they even said if the four indicator lights of the ps controller show no response it means this charge station is defective
its pretty telling when the manufacturer tells you the device could potentially be defective
actually all the instructions are pretty succinct let me give you the full text below
line  under function cracks me up
and i have no clue what reset button theyre referring to on line  of using stepsfunction
the dual charging station for sony ps controller is used to charge controllers of ps game console
two controller grips can be charged at the same time
this charge station can be used with a ps ps console or any usb charger v output using a usb cable
this charge station has beautiful and exquisite appearance convenient to furnish and useusing steps  turn on the power of ps ps console or any usb charger
get this charge station connected with the usb port
plug ps controllers to this charge station and press the reset to power on
wait for  seconds until the four indicator lights of the ps controllers glisten simultaneously
it means ps controller is being charged
if the four indicator lights of ps controller show no response it means this charge station is defectiveattentionthe maximum charging current is ma when two ps controllers are being charged at the same time the maximum charging current is makengo legend of the for those of you who arent too keen on reading though a whole review to see the overall feel of the game here you go its a simple game rent it and if you love it buy itif you love itif you cant find it to rentdont bother really dont bother
even if your very temptedive played the st kengo years ago when the ps was just entering the gaming world
ah the primitive days of next gen bouncer kengo twisted metal black ect ect
the days of simple pretty and moneywasting games
at a quick play through the game one thing is clear graphics aside this one was obviously meant to be on the psthe battle system is configurable yet the moves are still simple  combos that you interchange
and actually fighting is a dull few moments usually ending in alot of enemies yelping to death
the majority of them just crowd around you gawking untill theyre quick demise
the controls are slower than wanted and very simple  vert slash hor slash scoot slowly or attempt to grind your sword up to the enemy
the swordgrinding was a good idea but poorly played out
swordgrinding is just push pull break away or try to shove and attack
the boss battles are just some slightly more agressive enemies with fancy clothes
one nice feature that it has is a instakillmajor damage movement you can take out any enemy withincluding a bossor even yourselfthere are some features that make this game unique compared to the usuall samuraifightinghackn slash genre feature is that you gain experience
cool right
no they ruined it with the fact that whatever experience you dont use is thrown away after each fight
and like it would matter the only thing you can use xp is for secret moves that are just simple strikes for your  combos
oh wow i unlocked the tigers fang wave technique
oh wait its just a diagonal slash  ive found that after  or  battles worth of xp usually  or  new techniques i have enough moves to do what i need you play as real famous samurai from the past
this is one of the major things that got me interested in even playing this game
how many samurai games out there blow their horn about loving samurai yet they dont even have a real one in them
thumbs up for that feature fighting mutiple enemies a feature i think really makes or breaks a fighting game for me
so many times i play through soul calibur or  insert fighting game here im siiting there stuck chopping up one loser when i could be doing it to  at onceone feature about this game i really didnt like was that during the main story mode your stuck fighting a bunch of  hit kill nobodies who every now and then do get in a lucky shot and then going straight up against a boss might or might not be able to instakill you
sucky thing is when they dobam you have to reload and start the whole fight over
and man seriously its like re chopping firewoodpointless and boringother than thatgraphicsare slightly better than pssound well its japanese music and japanese voice so depends on the personcontrol yikes someone was sloppy when they pulled this one together
workable yet very lackingreplay yup theres alot of that different modes lots of usless moves to get and more characters to use themfun factor hrmm its ok bit dull most of the timei was not to impressed with this game and i dont have it anymore
my friend i gave it to dont like it eitherafter reading all reviews on this website as well as others and there being almost equal amounts of good reviews vs bad i decided to try it out myself since i was on the fence about this product
first thing i noticed was that the wires got in the way a few times
more importantly was that the mouse was not very smooth or accurate
the movements were very jerky at times
when i say at times i mean one second it jerks too much while other times i have to lift the mouse to move the cursor all the way to the other side of the screen
often times i just want to make a slight movement and the cursor jumps almost  of the screen
this makes targeting enemies far away very difficult and cumbersome
the sensitivity control is a joke as is the mousepad that is not stable on your lap
you would be better off using the table
i played cod with this hoping to better my average kill count but it didnt do anything but frustrate me
now granted i didnt get a higher kill count nor did i get less than with the standard controller but i felt i worked harder to get the same kill count
not worth 
not even worth  but for  it may be worth it as a gimmick peripheral but not for serious gamers
i wish logitech would make a mouse to go with the good keyboard they make for the ps
id be happy using the wasd keys than the cheaply made controller splitfish has made
please please somebody make a decent usb mouse for the ps
if it worked like a pc mouse id gladly dish out  for it
shame on splitfish for being more concerned about being the first on the market rather than the best
since there is virtually no competition for this type of controller for ps they have deviously cornered the market at the consumers expensegot it and it doesnt work
wont update firmware
tried emailing and calling splitfish
no answer
money wasteddont buy into the hype of the positive reviews for this device
the manufacturer is notorious for planting fake reviews for their products since their products are not good enough to garner positive reviews on their own
having said that this device is terrible
even if you can forgive how wonkily the mouse translates into onscreen movement i cannot forgive the fact that this is a  mouse that feels like a freaking toy made in a chinese sweatshop
even if not for the flimsy plastic that i could shatter with my teeth it would still be a uncomfortable handcramp inducing device and the mousepad may as well just be a piece of packing material
the only thing about it that is constructed competently is the nunchuk but im guessing that you arent looking at this page because you are looking to drop  on half of a ps controller
you can use the mouse on your pc but theres no conceivable reason youd want toif you want to use a mouse with a console do it the right way and get yourself a xim
your computer handles the movement translation process which is a million times more accurate and smooth than anything that they could hope to fit into this cheap little toy and depending on who you buy from it will be cheaper as well
youll also be able to use any mouse and keyboard you want instead of whichever one fragfx feels generous enough to give you while keeping as much of your  as possible
at best the shark is a novelty and a novelty that costs  and is as poor quality as this one is not a novelty you should part with your hard earned cash fori am an adult and careful with my stuff but still i have been through four wireless headsets and all had the same problem after a month or two they just wont charge anymore
the store keeps replacing them and they tell me it is an extremely common problem
its really too bad because the headset is comfortable the sound quality is excellent both ways but they just abruptly die
microsoft used to have a reputation for excellent hardware but with the  era their reputation is taking a beatingthis could have been a good game but the developers dropped the ball with the game mechanics
instead of putting so much effort into the graphicsthey should have included a better interface to use
a big disappointmentthis is not a new harvest moon game it is a direct port of harvest moon back to nature which was released on the original playstation years ago
the game had a few problems then including really horrible and blurry graphics and a really messed up control scheme and hasnt been improved at all
do not buy this expecting a new installment in the series
i cant believe that nothing was done to make this a better game except a cute new package
essentially an old game that hasnt aged wellif you want a new harvest moon game get innocent life or one of the more recent console versionswhat draw me to this game no pun intended was the fact that you could create your own character and other elements in the game
sounds fun nothat is not as fun as it should be mainly because you are limited to the space proportions and templates that the game gives you
theres not that much depth in it and after an hour or two of playing youll just be doing things just to get them over withgameplay wise is boring jump here shoot there and backtrack if you forgot something
this is the most annoying aspect of the gameplay
in each level you must rescue three raposas and collect  torn pieces of a template
if you skipped one you wont be able to move on but the game doesnt even remotely tells you what section you may or may not have missed
making backtraging tedious and a constantthe game difficulty is very easy but in some stages is easy to die while jumping or flying mainly because when you jump or takeoff you wont be able to see the enemies coming right at you making you lose health or diestory wise you play as the creator you know god who must help a village to defeat darkness
this is how the game goestalk to mayortalk to some other raposatalk to mayortap on the flame of liferemove darkness from one sectiontalk to previous raposareturn to talk to the mayor you may need to talk to another raposa againgo through a gate and start playing
is really annoying the characters are dumb theres really no meat to the story
you never feel bad for them at a point i saw why the creator forgot about them they boring annoying and demandingafter reaching the beach area they say oh thank you the beach is great but were bored can you draw some toys for us to enjoy
hello the creator doesnt do that you do dumb citizenthis is the only game ive ever wanted to grab and throw out of the window smash it with a hammer and burn it
it is that badi actually thought i might play this game not just farm it for an easy gs but after trying to play the game i just couldnt so i started mashing away and few minutes later had my easy cheesy gs
i promptly turned around and sold it and recovered some of my money
ive since decided to stop being such a floozy when it comes to gsitem did not work on my ps or pswaisted money and time o  this piece of scrap
people dont buy this fake junkthe original title for this product was playstation  rca cable
i purchased it hoping it would work for my ps
however when i got it it did not work for my ps and miraculously when i get back on amazon to contact the seller the title of the product had been magically changed to playstion  rca cable
it was a scam to get people to purchase the cable because no one wants ps cables so im guessing they figured if we put ps in the title people will buy it
i have never had a bad experience on amazon until this
will never purchase from this seller againterrible cable the audio feedback you could hear from the tv is loud and nearly blocks out all game sounds very poor audio quality
video feedback is not good at all either
you see lines going down the screen that completely distracts from the game makes the visuals appear distorted
i guess i got my  worth
dont bother buyingwas not what i thought i was looking for something better i just wanted deer hunting not bear or anything elsebought this game for  buck at my pawn shop n going sell it at gamestop for store credit n hope get me enough stuffdid not like to hard to do 
             i know this review is coming a little late in the game but maybe i can persuade someone not to buy this thing used or at the inflated prices it is currently being sold for
it has nothing to do with dancing
its sort of a guitar hero type thing with you flinging your wii remote and nunchuck in whatever direction an arrow indicates while pressing the b and z buttons
there are also a series of highly unresponsive motion gimmicks as welli cant begin to describe all the flaws in this game but i will try to point out a few of the worst offenders
the graphics are shockingly bad
none of the celebrities or pros look anything like their real life counterparts
this looks like it belongs on a nintendo   there are clunking loading screens that break up the action
this never looks or feels like dancing with the stars
the music selections are awful ugly and poorly performed and because of the weird nature of the difficulties in this dance you will find yourself having to replay some of the very worst tunes over and over as you try to get that score of   you will be very tired of hearing the same song over and over again as the judges randomly give you scores of  that hardly match up with their words of praise
the controls suck
they can be dangerous too as you smack yourself in the eye with the wii cord as you flail about haplessly trying to do the wave and get the damn thing to register your movement
the scheme of having to press the b and z buttons to register movements is also outrageous and bewildering
for a much more enjoyable hand eye coordination game download musclemarch from wiiware for five bucks
the difficulty level is wonky meaningless and altogether broken
you may fly through every dance and suddenly you are presented with a ridiculosly difficult series of movements that will leave you stuck on that dance until you either throw down the remote in disgust beat it or commit suicide
the dancers have no response whatsoever to your movements
they will dance just as beautifully as ever if you dont even pick up the remotes so essentially they are just a video playing in the background while you respond to a bunch of arrows and icons
you do not control the dancers in any way
the judges reactions make no sense and bear no resemblance to the scores you achieve
they have a very limited number of comments that grow stale after three or four dances
all the judges look like left over rejected extras from a low budget remake of night of the living dead as they stare blank eyed into space with their dark green complexions
too bad this isnt a resident evil gameeverything about this game fails so miserably that i cant believe it was ever authorized
i understand this was an early wii release but it should never have made it out the door and onto store shelves
i picked it up used for cheap but i see it is starting to go for quite a bit since it is officially out of print
if you see it somewhere run away
it isnt good by any standard has nothing to do with dancing looks awful and has broken controls
one of the absolute worst and an insult to anyone who enjoys dancing with the stars
i despised iti played the first soldier of fortune game years ago when my parents werent looking
the graphic violence and realistic combat at the time were fantastic and a distinct departure from other games of the timefor this outing into the sof world however it seems the only aspect of the game the designers tried to get right was the violent detachment of limbsthe ai is horrible  teammatesescorts enjoy crossing your line of fire and charging headfirst at enemies
enemies frequently ignore your presence until youve dispatched half a group  in the first level on hard a pair of terrorists ran out into the street in front of me and turned the wrong way allowing me to cut them down from behind easilywhen the enemies arent being stupid theyre busy being omniscient
dont bother equipping a silencer on your weapon as it seems that shots fired from it attract more attention than an unsilenced assault riflefrustrating gameplay mechanics boring level design a campaign you can beat in  hours shoddy graphics and a deserted online community round out the poor experience making sof a game i havent touched in the months since ive bought itskip this onethe first thing that you should know about this sof is that it was not made by the orignal games developer ravensoft
instead it was made by losers who have no business making gamessoldier of fortune payback for the xbox  is a first person shooter fps where you play a mercenary that belongs to a company called the shop they send you trekking to countries in the middle of war or small battles against small military rogue units
the action still has the blood and gore which the series is known for that aspect of the game is done well
you can target specific body parts on enemies and when you shoot them they will react and bleed profusely
in addition to enemies bleeding you can blow their limbs off their heads also explode like water mellons
sometime the enemies can be wounded and they will automatically pull out their pistols trying to get a revenge kill in cod this is called a last standso payback sounds like a solid game no
i bought sof on the faith that it would be a good purchase because i have been a long time fan of the series
the last two games were considered excellent multiplayer games coupled with a decent single player story mode
payback however is a lost cause
and i was thinking to myself there was no way that the developers can make it worse than the previouse versions because this is afterall a nextgen title
they proved me wrongthe graphics are worse
the character designs look outdated and jagged
the animations have a few hiccups with framerate
the enemy ai  whose only strategy is to run and shoot at you
they will rarely seek cover or try to flank you
there is no way the ai can employ much strategy against you because the game is very linear
and because of that very fact you dont have many options for tactics either
the worst offender for me though is that all weapons sound very much alike
from the shotguns to sniper rifle smgs pistols and assult rifle
they used the same sound effects for all of the guns
maybe the developers thought we wouldnt take notice of the identical sound effectswhich is wackedmultiplayer is also lackluster with only a handful of maps and even fewer game modes
the maps dont look bad but their sizes are much too big
since there are only like four people online youll be hard pressed to find a full room of players and even with a full room the maps feel much too big requiring players to search out each other for the fire fights
that spaciousness also creates moments without action and boredom
youll also be hearing people commenting on the fact that the older soldier of fortune is still better than this itterationif i can convince just one of you people to save your money and not buy this junky game then my mission is accomplished and i have fulfilled my new years resolution
lets just hope that the original developers make a comeback and show us how its doneprosblood and goreragdoll physicsconsstupid aiugly graphicsboring single playerboring multiplayerbad controlsdumb storydumber voice actingdumbest sound effectsbadly designed mapsweapons dont feel rightwith all the good fps games on the  there is nothing in this game to justify a  dollar price tag
i couldnt have been more disappointed in a title as i was in this one
the story is pointless the ai horrible the voice acting and level design all just as bad
you spend the majority of the game waiting for a wave of bad guys to spawn and run out in front of you
you then normally shoot those bad guys by aiming at the first one and firing a couple busts
then you move on to the next spawn point occasionally some bad guys will spawn behind you and usually at the end of the level you get to fight off a couple waves of bad guysthere is a good selection of weapons when you start each level and you are allowed to customize them to a point but since almost all your enemies throughout the game use the ak you almost always finish the level with it anyway
which works out because there is very little difference between how the weapons handle and fire
it feels as though they are all the same with different skins on them
the level designs are incredibly linear
you will also spend a fair amount of time hung up on door frames barrels and anything else you can think of
your highly trained mercenary is unable to jump over any real obstacles
the only thing this game has going for it is the huge amount of blood and violence but it really isnt enough to carry it through
the good thing is the single player campaign takes about four hours to make your way through
the online play is nothing at all spectacularif you are willing to deal with all the bad you can lose yourself in the pointless bloodshed for a couple hours
though i would recommend a rental in that case just so you dont feel so bad about throwing your money awayi play lots of games and wanted to play some cheap filler games between the big releases
i picked up this game on the cheap not expecting much after reading numerous reviews
the most common thing people said was its a generic shooter and does nothing to stand out
this is  true and while theres nothing wrong with that the game is just plain blah
generic is not the word im talking about i mean so mindnumbingly boring i could not wait until i finished it so i can get rid of it
its that boring to meif youre looking for a cheap fps shooter pick up frontlines fuel of war instead
that game was a ton of fun and kept my instrest for two campaignsthis game is mostly frustrating and sloppily designed making little obvious use of the wiimoteyou may be thinking eh shell like it for a little while but youre wrong
the controls take a while to learn and if anything its worse at the beginningremove all the andunder cheapo games from your shopping cart and get one good  game instead or youre just wasting your mosey and your childs timei bought this game and didnt get a chance to play it because the seller i got it from gave me a copy that was made in austria
i would really love to play it thoughthis game was not good at all i got what i paid for it only had about  games and they were not funsome games that are  or more players force you to use one remote having to hand it off for every turn
this gets very annoying especially with the wii wrist strap on
cup game is too difficult
cant use your own mii have to use one of theirs from limited selection
selection grow as you earn points but progress has been too slow to be any fun
this could have been done a lot better but they obviously cut cornersthis game is very buggy
several times conan got stuck in the air after jumping next to the wall
once i had to reboot the game because he got permanently stuck in the air
during the elephant boss battle after jumping to the upper corner of the rock the camera got stuck pointing below and cant see conan
and the controls are terrible because it frequently have problem with jumping at an anglethis game is a lot of pointless button mashing until you get to the boss battles which are frustrating pointless button mashing
the game was visually interesting and i didnt mind the sometimes frustrating controls until i reached a boss battle that was nothing but watching it tell me which buttons to push and then repeating it over and over dying again and againdont waste your moneythis is the worst game i have ever played
if i bought this from amazon i would ask for my money backthis game is so unbelievably frustrating that i quit playing half way through
i know it was made in  but the game mechanics are terrible the boss battles arent good at all theres glitches the story and dialogue arent even entertaining maybe for some people it is and the combat is pretty lame
this game might have been a decent  back in  but now in  do not waste your money on or even rent this game
there are a ton of other games out there to try out and play
this is not one of themwhat a disappointment
im surprised the reviews have been good or mild about this gameit wasnt that great at all
if you can find it cheap goodbut i wouldnt pay more than  for this item
im a huge conan fan the movies and books but this game was a let downgraphicssound the graphics are slick clean and fun to watch
there is a lot of gore and fantasy violence so kids beware
the music is great highfantasy orchestrainspired conan stock music
sound effects are appropriate satisfying and balance with the musiccontrols the controls were easy to learn but challenging to master
there are many many types of moves you can do with different combinations of buttons
the controls were responsivegameplay this is the area where conan falls apart
you earn points to learn skills and new moves great mechanic works fine and you get to beat up the bad guys with your new moves
so far so goodhowever you have absolutely no option about quest mission locationnada
strike one for metheres not even any special secret areas to explore
you cant decide to wander off the beaten path not even to take a different way to the goal its all leadyoubythenose linear gameplaystrike two fighting the boss enemies is repetitious tedious and frustrating
you cannot defeat a boss with any of the cool new moves you learn in the game you can only defeat them by knocking down their health and then doing some combination of buttons as a cinematic plays
if you mess up the boss gets half their life back and you rinserepeat until you dont miss a single button during the moviestrike three out
 i finished the game on normal difficulty in just under  hours
i explored every building tower path and cranny i could find i died about  times
it still only took me  hours
if youre a hardcore gamer then dont expect much more than thattake carepurchased smackdown vs raw  one of the best most flexible games i had ever seen the custom wrestler capabilities and variety was endless
ai engine had some issues but even with that still the best game out
i couldnt wait for smackdown vs raw  all they needed was to fix the ai and enhance graphics
major disappoinment they fixed the ai by removing all of the customization available in 
very disappointed not worth it
definitely a major step down from 
i would give it  but amazon requires at least  starits a sad day when a tractor company tries to leech the success of an awesome game like harvest moonit seems more like a promotional piece than a real gameif you want to play a game where you farm go for harvest moon or better yet rune factory both by natsumeoriginally i was thinking as i played this and read prehand reviews wii users get screwed over and after playing the xbox version i can definitely confirm thiswith each vast step forward the wwe seems to take with regards to its new games they always manage to slip up when entering the realm of next gen consoles and totally fumble but this time its inexcusable
match types are quite literally only singles hardcore triple threat tag and last man standing match
and to think you had table matches ladder matches cage matches tlc matches and hell in a cell matches in day of reckoning  nintendo versions predecessor in the roster is quite large but still sparse in a way as it misses out on some of the promising young talent and instead keeps several superstars long gone from the company including sabu sandman chris masters forgiveable since he was just released a week or two ago jtg and shad gaspard who
cryme tyme
oh yeah the racist joke steph found funny and king booker tconspicuously missing from the roster are the likes of brian kendrick and paul london lance cade and trevor murdoch hornswoggle deuce and domino viscera big daddy v matt striker balls mahoney kevin thorn the miz thank god hardcore holly little guido nunzio etcthe create a wrestler mode is unchanged thankfully with a wide variety of options to recreate much of your day of reckoning and day of reckoning  cass over again with better graphics
female wrestlers will have to be humiliated by having a separate mode though identical called create a diva modestoryline mode in the game is called main event and consists primarily of you joining either raw or smackdown because apparently ecw isnt worth joining and receiving random challenges via text messaging no joke
umagas message to you raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh
and subtitled i will beat you to death with your own arms
one hell of a language that samoan
full of subtlty
you start out weak no matter what superstar you choose and have to spend points training and recieving massages to relieve fatigue
you have to do this after every match because otherwise you start new matches with the same fatigue level you had last week because in the crazy world of the wwe weeks pass like secondsgod help anyone wishing to make themselves a finely crafted wrestler with only the best moves available or a skilled high flyingtechnician
in true wwe fashion as with john cena and the great khali you only have around  chooseable moves
the rest are preset based on what wrestling style you choose your superstar as
there is no way to choose the moves you do regarding punches kicks etc
and the movelist available is flimsier and shorter than wrestlemania xs
the only good aerial attacks being a moonsault and two versions of the swanton bomb both equally sloppy and capable of breaking your neck if the game didnt turn at the last momentnot that youd really need to pick your moves much
in the ring most all of the action revolves around the same system as wwf warzone and wwf attitude only shortened considerably beat your opponent down till their health bar goes down into the red
once its in the red you can do your finisher as many times as you want
whereas warzone and attitude had several layers of health bars to beat through this one only has half of one meaning a match can literally be over in two minutes or less with enough punching and three or four finishing moves in a row
the wwe must have been so ashamed of this they removed the timer showing how much time there is in the matchyoull be counting your matches by millisecondstypical problems already complained about including no running
the controller is actually quite fun but even the game totally fumbles that mess
the only way to punch and kick and dropkick etc is to swing your remote around and the only way to counter a move is to do the exact same move as your opponent at the exact same time as them
this is easier than it sounds as the only real moves are done the exact same way hold a and b and swing in some direction so repeatedly hitting r will do nothing for you
minor moves are also done by swinging repeatedly in some way
the manual doesnt bother to detail this for you and the games onscreen instructions can be vague or simply not there
for example there is seemingly no way to release an opponent when preparing them for a death valley driverlike maneuver
swinging in any direction will only make your character spin like a retarded topi think that about covers this latest wwe abortion
the same sort of watered down action you get on wwe tv these days dense and unexplained controls almost impossible reversal system dirtpoor storymode inability to run and most damning of all a healthbar system of combat which renders everything but the most damaging moves and a finishing move obsolete
why bother trying to irish whip an opponent or use a high flying move when you can just punch the crap out of them till they go red then do nine or ten finishers in a row on them for a pin
the average match length so far for me has been about a minute and a half
if i manage to work the ai into having a semidecent match this can stretch as far along as  minutes or slightly moretotal failurethis game is so far off from even a ps version its ridiculous
for a series that boasts tons of options the wii version is totally empty of any at allthe matches last  seconds you have i believe  match typesi beat the season mode which is a joke at best in an hour and never played the game againserriously if you want a wrestling game buy any other game for any other system
pro wrestling for the old nintendo was better than this gamethis game is trash
you only have  matches to choose fromsingletag teamhardcore way  knockout
the hardcore matches are the worst because you only have  chairs to use
the careerstory is so easy to beatfinish
i mean i beaten it  times
the wrestlers in this version of svr are wimps
they only last like  to  minutes
the only way to make the mathces longer is to have a  way bout
the only good thing about this game are the sample caw superstars  divas but even then that still wont save this lame game
i give this gargabe a  out of ok um featuring ecw
um yea sure
so many things wrong i dont know where to start
ok i went online to look up some codes or something because the game just seemed to lackeverything
i wanted to know how to go backstage
how to find tables fire  barbwire bats regular batsanything besides two chairs which are offered only in hardcore matches and are just lying outside the ring
the codes i found had to deal with gm mode  mode and some shop or storeum cant find those either
just stick wit dor day of reckoning  for gcwii this is a fun new experience but uhdont mention the reversalshow to reverse swing your arms and hope your character blocks a grapple or strike
if that doesnt work just have to get beat until opponent stopssubmission systemjust move the knob up or down and theyll submit once their gauge is lowyayyay with sarcasmthq has never recovered since going to gc
n still has those no mercy and wrestlemania games that i used to love so much
will thq ever get all of those moves and taunts backmain pointdont purchase this wait til next yr when theres backstage tables elimination chamber fire and just about everything thats more than an ordinary  count fall matchps
i love wrestling games tna save usthe cable did not pass an a proper signal on to the analog tv i connected it to
i had a similar cable older used on another tv
i tried using that older cable in place of this new one and the signal was passed on properly
thus i knew this cable was the problem
the two cables were virtually identical but the newer one this one had a far less quality feel to it
i only paid like a dollar for the cable so it is not worth sending back
i bought a new cable locally at x the price and that one works
i cannot recommend this cable even at the price to anyonethis game does nothing but cheat
the game consistently strings multiple turns for itself bashing in your hitpoints like a barbarian at the gates of some place they ransacked i dunno
i got up made a sandwich came back and it still wasnt my turnoh wait let me explain this game for you
its bejeweled
with magic
you cast a spell and ding the enemy and then it casts a hundred spells and you die
and then you repeat
and sometimes youre unfortunate enough to win and continue the horrible plot which only forces you to play more matching games against the computerits so hoodif youre really in the mood for a good puzzle game get something else
i highly recommend guess wholooks worse than the other version and if you have an xbox  you can get a better looking version of the same exact game for only 
this version is really a joke
the control setup is totally messed up as well
dont waste your moneyi purchased this game for my wife because she was obsessed with the nintendo ds version
the wii version is a major disappointment and a major piece of programing trash
starting off with character creation you cant even make a custom name for your character because when you create your character it changes the last letter in the name to a so instead of a character named amy the characters name is amathe text in the game is so small you have to be sitting  feet away to read what it actually says
very disappointed that this was a huge waste of a gift i though was going to be lots of funomg
what a horrible game
i wish amazon would allow a score of  where to start
first the graphics just plain suck
very difficult to read
controllers sucky again
the game does not use the wii remote properly difficult to move around the game and difficult to make moves in the short games
why bother making a game for the wii if you dont take advantage of the technology the system has to offer
music thankfully it can be turned off
horrible port waste of money
i feel very ripped off and am taking the game to a used game store after owning it for less than  hours
wish i would have read the reviews here and not been attracted to it at best buyblows air into the the intake vents of a fat ps however there is no way to fasten it and get a tight fit
it just kind of dangles off the usb portwaste of moneythe fan seems to fit but when i plug the usb into the ps the fan doesnt work
the fan will power up if i use a usb hub but then its not on the ps
so basically this is a worthless fan
also i have the ps  gb fat system which it says its for
ive sat and fiddled with it for at least an hour which is also a major drag because my time is worth at least  bucks an hour
so all in all i dropped  bucks for the fan and wasted  dollars or more in time tryingfailing to set it upthis item is a piece of junk
please do not waste your money on this
i got this a few weeks ago and it hardly cooled my system down any
it was hard to get it to snap onto the front of my ps which i had to use tape to hold it in place
after a week of looking at it just hanging off my ps i just decided to throw it back into box it came in and throw it into my closetdependent on securerom and even despite its age and ideal system requirements to be played on netbooks and similar lowpower equipment the vendor has failed to release an official workaround for the drm
unlike blizzard who long ago removed the cd check from starcraft  warcraft iii and westwood that actively distributes iso mounting software for their earliest titles these folks use securerom to actively block the user from running their legally purchased game on netbooks  nettops
im not unwilling to deal with reasonable drm restrictions but bottom line i was unable to play this gamethere are other better titles in the genre including several netbookfriendly contemporaries
go with them or find this in a downloadable form to avoid the crippling drm if youre hoping to play this on the only currently available hardware appropriate for a game of this age
if notif you own a real machine your moneys better spent on newer and better received titlesmy  yr grand daughter played this game with the help of older girls and wanted the game but since christmas has played very little
very realistic and hard for young childrenhi im autistic adult gamerpersonally i think they could of done better with the game and graphics on imagine babyz
this game is not worth the  dollars i paid for it new unfortunately i could not find this game used heavens know i which it was used
its frustrating but eventually you figure it out
this game is not really worth it though if anything its creepy i mean a babysitter who just stays in the house all day with a stork on the chimney yeah a just a little creepysave your self the money and just get imagine babysitters the graphics and gameplay are way more better than this onethe old game dungeon lair with dirk the daring is far better than this poor excuse of a ps game
dont waste your money unless you enjoy game play that only prompts you to do the press x now kinda thingnote even when you press the given button per the on screen prompt there is no garantee that the game will act upon itthe epic poem of beowulf is once again recreated but this time in the form of a video game for the xbox  beowulf has a hack nslash gameplay similar to the dynasty warrior series
you lead a small group of thane soldiers while fighting creatures in the kingdom of herot
the game follows the movie it is based on somewhat loosely
there are creatures you kill and places to explore not seen in the movie
fighting new creatures and going to new places in not all it is cracked up to bethe biggest misgiving about beowulf is its shoddy controls and bad camera system which fights against you through out the game
in certain levels beowulf controls fine but other times he moves sluggishly and the button pressing on your controller are not always responsive just adding to the frustration
as you play beowulf the mighty monster slayer you will punch throw stab and smash enemies either with your barehands or with  shields and swords
weapons are easy to find as you venture through the levels
other times you can steal your enemys weapon by pressing a button sequence on your controllerand this brings me to another giant flaw within the game the constant button mashing is tiresome and boring
your soldiers help you fight off some of the enemies but they expect you to do most of the work
with button delay responses and constant pounding your hands will ache really fast
there are also several sequences that force you to use the button rythm match game press x then y then a etc
if you are not good at those rythm type games you will have a very tough time in this one
you will die a lot and realise that beowulf is not mighty at all but more of a wimpprosexcellent musicexcellent sound effectsbloody and brutalconslast generation graphicscheap animationsterrible controlsterrible cameraboring levelsmindless button mashingmy hands still hurtthe movie is betterbeowulf is wimpy in the gamespecial powers are crappypss god of war still rulesive never played a game this mind blowingly bad
i couldnt even get through more than  or  minutes before i just had to turn it off and get rid of it
this game makes shaq fu look good
it makes et feel like it has great gameplay
its just a bunch of minigame repetitive tasks which dont even work well to begin with
do not buy this awful awful awful gamedo yourself a favor and rent this game before you decide to spend your hard earned cash on itgot the game and played it for about  minutes and the game freezes at the exact same point every time
when you get to the second scene of the game it freezes at the point after you get the first weapon crate save point
tried installing the hard drive and the same problem persists
god awful way to release a game with a bug this badthe game play seems great but i can not enjoy it because of the extreme level of profanity in the game with no way to turn it off
i understand it has an m rating can not believe that they would expect for most of the consumers not to find it overboard and offensive when it comes to the amount of profanity in the game
if they dont put an update to switch it off then my copy will be up for grabs or garbagei hope the new blacklist game is way better then this splinter cell i feel like i need brain surgery after play it an also wasteing my money on itthis game would of made a lot more money if it was on the ps as well as the xbox and would have been better i feel more in control on a ps graphics are slightly better bluray sixaxis they need to leave games that were made popular by sony alone sure make games but dont limit what was a long played series by a lot of people to one system just to make more money for their platform
xbox fanboys already have their over rated exclusive halo games which is an xbox original i am okay with that but what if  years down the road sony bought out all rights to halo making the game no longer available for xbox
oh yeah forgot your  words
gears of war yeah you have gears of war too but the only xbox exclusive game i am envious of is the fable series and its not the money maker for the xbox platform
people i made my original review short because i didnt think it deserved a long review and at that time apparently unlike all of you i didnt have the time so i was surprised so many people commented on it and who worries about grammar on these things until some english teacher comes along to use it as an insult because its all they got next thing you will tell me is that i have run on sentences lol so what
and seriously there are a lot more xbox fans talking trash about ps than there are ps fans talking trash about xbox i just prefer ps simple as that
i revised my quickly typed previous review because i didnt want to reply to people individually as for the little guy down there who said it was an xbox exclusive no it wasnt i played it on ps way before xbox was out maybe microsoft as in computer but xbox no it wasnt even until maybe the third and probably least fun pandora tomorrow that i saw the game on xbox
and last but not least it is not that i can not afford to buy an xbox  i like how everybody likes to brag they have all  systems lol
i just dont see the point in buying a system for  or  games it will just sit there collecting dust after i finish playing fable  and  well just  and  since i finished the first one on a friends system and splinter cell convictioni mean really dumbed down
im not going to complain about the press this button to win mechanic or as they call it mark and execute because it is optional
i also wont complain about the fact that they are playing as a sequel to double agents terrible story line because there is already a good trilogy from the original  what does suck is that they have taken out many mechanics that made the series good
the game promotes a running and gunning play style while completely disregarding hiding bodies and has removed any kind of shadow system
in a way the new one is fitting because hiding is now black and white in a figurative and literal sense
this game totally blows please bring back the old splinter cellits just not a stealth game anymore
they wanted pure action and took so many of the great stealth elements from the oldits just sad to say the least
splinter cell conviction is by far the worst in the serieshazefor a game that took a long time to finally arrive was promoted as a halotype game and cost an arm and a leg to buy haze totally disappointsfirst off i love first person shooters but am not the best at themthey usually take me  to  times to finish compared to other players
i finished this game in about  hours in the single player campaign mode
im not a big fan of online play but reviews of hazes online modes lets me know im not missing anything
the single player campaign if you could call it that included about an hour or so of useless crappy cutscenes that could easily have been cut out of the game to increase its valuei kept uselessly trying to click through themyou cant and ended up doing other things until they were done
playing as a mantel soldier with nectar is extremely brief and when the game set me up to play as a rebel i thought that this all must have been part of the tutorial or something because the first part lasted only as long as some games tutorials or demos do
i just thought they wanted you to see how to play as the different characters before getting truly into the game
the stupid storyline is forced inane redundant childlike unnecessary and just plain worthless because the game is short short shortthe result is charactersif you can call them that form ideas too soon to make sensethey like you they hate you and i just hate them allthere are really only  characters you talk to for more than  seconds
some of the graphics were good but the location is ridiculously stupid and uninspired
theres one cave area that looks like it was taken right from oblivionit was that familiar to me
comparing it to halo is sooo depressing since halo takes place in space which immerses you in the futuristic feel has many types of enemiesnot just  that are truly interesting and creepy allows you to drivepilot different vehiclesnot just a few of the same type gives you choices for weapons gets you involved in a story and takes time to play out
anyone who thinks this is just a wonderful game has yet to play one or is just being protective of the ps
i love my ps dont have an xbox and i cant tell you the depth of my disappointment
compare it to a game like resident evil  or god of war games created for previous game systems and it doesnt even hold up
drakes fortune which was somewhat short in and of itself did the jungle better did the graphics better did the storyline better did the cutscenes better
did i say the game is short
shame on you ubisofthow about a refund
i cant give this more than  star because i wouldnt even suggest renting it
such promise such garbageok heres the skinny i only paid a  for this game at my local gamestop it was a special the store was running regular price was just  but they had selected games for half off  and on top of that im a member so i get a extra  off any preowned games
that brought the total to 
well i decided to give it a try because one the price was cheap and two many people gave the game a bad rap i always want to give it a try before i judge it
well this game was suppose to be the halo killer as they label it
this game to me was just flat out boring
just the game play seemed like it was very well thought out people were hard to see and very hard to hit with gunfire
the ai wasnt very smart to hide and attack
the graphics are fine not the very best but at least good enough to look at
i really didnt get why it was so must bad language in the game that really killed it and the bad voice over killed it too
if it wasnt for the foul language this game should have been rated for everybody or teen i dont know why it claims to be intense violence this game doesnt even have much blood in it i was very confused about the content of this game
the only thing that should make this a m rated game is the language
i am really have a tough time trying to find something good to say about this game but i really cant find anything good to say but i got it cheap
this story line is very strange and dull too like a year old kid came up with it
its that bad and as far as it being a halo killer lmao i think you get it by now
i think i wont play it again after i beat it
its just sooooooo boring and soooooo dull to the point its that i dont know why they even released it the game was going to be on xbox  and pc but i can get why they didnt release it to too many consoles but the game sucked
bottom line play it if you want but prepare to be bored and not very entertainedi wont go into a long review as a lot of people here have the bases coveredhowever i had high hopes for this game but those hopes were initially dashed when it took almost  minutes for this game to be updated on my system
that should have been a red flag right there
in all fairness though i would at least give it a chance
after the long initial setupyou are tourtured with long cut scenes that cannot be skipped along with crappy gameplay and repetitionwe have a saying in the beer world for a brew that is lackluster and its called drain pourthis game was a toss in the can
luckily it just cost a few bucks
i feel sorry for those of you who spent full price on this garbagedont waste your time and money on this
there is much better out thereawkward control set up even though you can change it coupled with annoying voice acting average story and weak game play
not to mention that even on easy its frustratingly difficult and filled with annoying cheap deaths
do not bother buying this game
its absolute trashthis game is really slanted toward you losing
good luck
fun to play but not all that fairsorry to be contrarian but i would rather have my money backthis game gets five stars for atmospheric graphics and sound
thats about the only good thing i can find to say about this game which i will not finishmost of the game is spent moonwalking your main character through eight to ten accessible sites
the main character moves with glacial speed and playing this game is primarily an exercise in buddha like patience as you must criss cross the town  timesthe voice acting is so appallingly bad it is actually interesting
i spent a lot of time wondering just how it came to be this bad
unfortunately the worst of it comes from the main character who is also the one who does the most speaking
the inflections of all the words and phrases are wrong  think william shatner as captain kirk to the power of 
oh
how
long
have you been
in saxton
no one speaks like this or reads like this so i wonder if they recorded individual words and phrases and spliced them to make whole sentences
its the only explanation i can figure outthe game is absolutely linear
not only must you do the next thing you must be sure to do it in the right nonobvious order or the rest of the game wont unlock leaving you to moonwalk fruitlessly about town repeating your previous actions and conversations in the hope that youll unlock the lucky sequence
fortunately 
every character is willing to have exactly the same conversation with you an infinite number of times 
and indeed you must select every possible conversational response with each character and hear every possible answer in the tree
save me some grief and just have them spew the entire thing when i meet them rather than making me jam the return key a dozen timesnot only linear but also buggy
the first time i met bob tawney he refused to talk to me and told me he was busy
i got on line and found out that many people had this problem you have to review everything in your inventory then have all your conversations again trying to figure out what unlocks tawney 
a phone call to the wrong number requires you to announce the solution to a mystery and there is no way of opting outit only adds insult to injury that the main character is a twitcant conceivably finish this
im glad so many other people enjoyed it but i have to say honestly that they must be more patient souls than i am this has got to be one of the most boring pc games i have ever played
its really tough to keep your attention up in order to keep playing it
this was so not what i expected this game to be likeits a typical third person point and click where you click an arrow for your character to slowly move from one area to another unless you double click the arrow
the characters are cartoonylike with not much detail to them at all and their movements are very very robotic and slow
the main character also acts like nothing scares him at all
he just seems intrigued by everything
there are also several conversations where you must select from a list of things to talk about and these conversations could easily lull you to sleepthis game is incredibly slow paced
i mean really slow paced
and the worst part of it all is that the game is really not scary
the bad third person character animations the long dull conversations the main characters reactions to everything the incredibly slow pace the bad voice acting of the other characters and the complete lack of a scare factor all add up to one not very enjoyable gaming experience
if you want a truly scary adventure pc game try darkness within or penumbra black plague insteada lot of people seem to disagree with me here but i find this version to be a big downgrade from the original
here are the differences broken into pros and consprosnew classes but theyre really not very good anyway and reuse animationsskills from the old gametwo new characters again theyre not really that good and not worth itimproved dialogue which i actually hated more than the old dialoguesome tweaks and balancing fixes which are actually a good thingnew cinematicsthe only two pros that are actually a good thing imo are the tweaksbalance fixes and the cinematics
however there was still something charming about the old cinematics so i dont mind going without themconsobnoxious slowdown that will drive you insane if youve played the originalimo the new writing is awful
i was excited to hear that theyd rewritten the dialogue to make it less confusing and better than the old poorly translated version
however to me its even worse
it attempts to use some old english language that is very confusing and cheesy with terrible grammar
they should have hired better writers for thisthe audio quality is downgraded
in a game with such an amazing soundtrack this is a huge issue for me
if you dont believe me get both versions on the vita and listen to them side by side with or without headphones
the music reverberates beautifully in the original game but sounds flat and dull in the new versionlower resolution at least on the vita
buy the original ps version and it actually looks better sharperfor some reason it seems they want you to have to click a lot more in this version to confirm movements and actions
it gets annoying quickly even after turning part of it off in the optionsthey also added some annoying confirmation sound for every piece of dialogue
i was never able to figure out how to turn it off and it wasnt in the original original had some nice pageturning soundsoverall this port is insulting to such an amazing game
if you have a vita and dont mind the lack of fullscreen just get the original game from the store
its cheaper anyway
i have played both on the vita and i was saddened to see how much better the original was than the new one after switching backi dont like srpg at all are boring cliched and overrated this one sure dont change my feel about sprgcamera is terribletheres no easy way to check the turn liststandard cliched in the way of the strategyrpg storyline same story of tactics ogre only more confusinglack of the difficulty balance blurry graphicbattle involve too few characters ramza is the worst main character everi know there are plenty of negative reviews out there already but as this will be the only one star rating im hoping i can get this message out quickly because im already sore at not having done this soonerfor anybody who has played the original final fantasy tactics on the psone loved it seriously loved it i implore you do not buy this game
of all the negative reviews out there bashing the games flawsthe lag on spells the useless new job classess etc
nobody is saying what really needs to be said
and that is as followssquenix ruined this game when they increased the amount of jp necessary to gain skills and go up joblevelsfor anybody who played the original we all known how hard the game could be and how very necessary it was to spend a good portion of your time developing and training your characters
the game can be quite time consuming in this one aspect albeit but it was quite fun and very satisfying not a word i use often to see the pay off in characters that could dish out the damage and hold their own in tough situations
your own ateam so to speak
the demand for more jp utterly kills
this experiencetake for instance the lancers jump abilities
the level  jumps only required jp to master
now they require 
and thats just one example
in final fantasy tactics the higher a characters job level the more jp they could aquire
simultaneously increasing jp required for leveling a characters job level and gaining skills makes it even more time consuming
it increases exponetially the amount of time needed to level your characters
if feels like youre getting cornholed from both ends
you cant gain as much jp and more jp are required to gain skills
agghfor instance i always like to get ramza the ninjas twoswords ability before his one on one duel with gafgarion
in this way he can use sword break two times in one turn and turn gafgarions game completely on its head
with the psp version of the game however it probably would have taken far too much time to develop ramza that far
i sold the game after i beat chapter one after realizing getting to this point would require hours and hours of training while my eyeballs slowly fell out of my skull after staring down at that tiny little screen for so long
wander around enter a battle ingnore the monsters and start doing all the thing us veterans do to gain jp like the squires accumulate only however much time you spend leveling your characters in the psone version times that by  and you have a rough estimate of how much youll playing and feeling like a nerd with no life
i am terribly dissapointed with this game
there is oh so much square enix or squenix could have done to make this better
giving access to jobs only the bosses had such as arc knight sorcorer assassin and many others
elmdors teleport  ability better weapons better jobs more missionsall of this forever out of reach it seems because the sadists at squenix saw fit to give us this inferior remake
shame on themi thought that since the game only had the words final fantasy that it would be a traditional rpg from squareenix
boy was i wrong
once again squareenix strays from the traditional rpg path and creates something new that makes this game feel more like final fantasy tactics
the cutscenes are amazing but thats about it
if you want an actionoriented game that relies more on clickandpoint instead of the traditional rpg style then this game is for you
if not you should look at another final fantasy title offered for the nintendo dsi bought this game expecting it to be a great game from the nessnes era that has been updated for a more modern console in the same vein as final fantasy iii
in retrospect i dont like ffxii because it is an rpgrts hybrid and the two genres didnt mesh well herepros most of the in game functions take place using the touch screen asit should be you get to summon classic ff monsters to aid you in battle and mostof them dont just vanish after launching one attack you play as a band of pirates arr
who are searching for treasureand will inevitably end up saving the world if square follows itsusual storyline all of the maps are strewn with treasure chests unlike in fire emblem you dont permanently lose a party member ifthey die in battlecons the random nature of some of the characters
one of them is acrocodile
why no squad system to make controlling your armies simple
instead youhave to do a square select to control multiple units
and this becomesa pain when you have large armies if all party members die its game over an rpg element that is reallyannoying in an rts you command your army using the touch screen but most maps are sohuge that it takes forever to go and issue a command you have to go and select the spawn points in order to summon newmonsters and then you have to give them orders once they spawn at the start of each battle you can only select  monsters to summonduring the battle player ais
all of your ais including your own party are pacifiststhat will stop attacking if you arent spamming the attack order viathe touch screen
so if you have to go do something off screen yourunits become completely useless the above flaws make it extremely difficult if not impossible to goafter the treasure chests without losing enemy ais dont suffer from the flaws that the player ais dothis was going to be a scathing review but the store let me return this for full price  so im a lot less angry nowlet me say that im a fan of the final fantasy series my favorite being final fantasy advance tactics for the gba
i wasnt crazy about any of the crystal chronicles
that said this game sucks
and i mean badlyfirst of all the gameplay is painfully frustrating
you have to use the stylus to encircle and attack enemies that are often offscreen
it takes so much dragging and swiping to get the screen to move and when it finally moves you and your foes are never on screen at the same time
on top of that the camera view moves so slowly that by the time you and your enemies are meeting everybody in your team is already half deadthen the characters are way too small to see
break out you bifocal reading glassesthis game looks and plays like it should cost  retail
its very cheap looking and poorly done
worst game everffirst off fighters are my favs this game is trash epic fail as bad as yu hakusho on ps dont be fooled i love bleach but to like this game would just be on the basis that i love bleach luckily i rented  for one so ill be not playing this and trying yakuza dead soulsthis item arrived in amazon worryfree packaging which was as advertised
once i began to unbox the manufacturers packaging the worrying started
i had read a number of reviews here on amazon and was reluctant to buy this product yet a strong desire to experience as close to real as it gets drove me to order this pro flight yokethrottle plus the matching pro flight rudder pedals both are saitek productsthis item appeared to have been previously opened as the usb cords were haphazardly wound up and not tied like brand new merchandise
the throttle levers were flimsy plastic and appeared to be warped or not  straight as you would expect throttle levers to be
the extra knobs to allow you to create a matched pair for throttles in a engine jet and a different color knob say for flaps were totally missing from my order
still i plowed ahead and assembled the units and plugged them into my highend gaming pc
a number of reviewers have spoken about the fact that the throttles do not easily return to the fully off position they stop short by design but you have to be careful not to take them too far down or you will engage the reverse thrusters
in actual flight conditions these things were a huge disappointment
they dont move smoothly and dont feel solid or heavy duty
the words cheap and flimsy come to mind but im just sayinof course like anyone who has been to the rodeo before i ran a full system image backup prior to installing this new saitek stuff
good thingi had a number of problems configuring the yoke and all of the buttons that come with it
i also run ez dok camera software and while i was able to configure the yoke to switch camera views during actual flight some of the yoke buttons did not operate as i had programmed them to
especially annoying was the fact that two different buttons on the yoke disconnected the autopilot cmd button on my pdmg ngx during flight
i tried but failed to solve that issuestill i wasnt ready to throw in the towel
however others have written about how the yoke while having a stainless steel shaft must have a very poor bearing assembly because it would frequently stick when pushing in or pulling out to ascend or descend the aircraft
handling the plane with these items was to put it bluntly  not enjoyable mildest polite words i could think of
the plane yawed incessantly climbed and descended and was near impossible to hold in level flight if the auto pilot was disengagedall in all this product pair the yokethrottle plus the matching rudder pedals left me with a good sized headache  and that was prior to trying to unassemble and rebox everything
not my favorite packaging by the manufacturer
the words chinese water torture come to mind but im just saying  well everything goes back to amazon and my joystick is back as my aircraft interface hardware
not happy
luckily my system is restoring from the backup i ran just before unboxing this amazon order
if you dont have a full system backup strategy you are living on a prayer as bon jovi saysi guess for  street for both saitek items i shouldnt have expected much and these products werentreviews are personal opinions and anecdotal in nature and keep in mind your mileage may varylooking at this game reminds me of another hasbeen that tried to infiltrate the pvp market and failed miserably
anyone remember shadowbane
the activities in this game remind me a lot of that one and because this one is also so pvp based it is already doomed to failure
the market out there is pve based
most and the majority of people buy and play these mmorpg games for the pve elements even guild wars massive population is pve based though some do delve into the pvp aspect but and this is a big but pvp is by choice and not forced and that must remain with all mmorpg games present and future if they want a massive subscriber base
the developers are in for a rude awakening if they think this game is going to hold a million subscribers with so much pvp the emphasis of the game
the american and european market just arent into pvp like the koreans and asian markets
linage i  ii really have that pvp market sewed upso in a nutshell i dont recommend buying this game unless you are a pvp fanatic because that is the main element of this one
this isnt a wow by a long shot since wow is dedicated to the pve element
its better than a guild wars in the pvp atmosphere but i think guild wars  is going to solve that issue as it too will have realm vs realm type atmospherewars like this but without destroying the pve game or forcing people to participate in the pvp element
as you can see the price is already dropping drastically from the initial retail
people are already trying to unload this as a lost causeafter having played most of the classes and features and checking out everything there is to check out with warhammer online i have say im completely disappointedfirst of all the graphics
wait til you see the character animations and faces youll cry they are that bad
the graphics for everything look like they took the  eq engine and slapped on better textures
all the items look blocky and from a game  years agothere is no character customisation because they dont care about the poetic or roleplay side of the game the whole game was designed for kiddies pvp who love to run around murdering others in a virtual environmenti cant believe that in  were still hand animating running and fighting instead of motion capturing real actors
wow eq and lotr are still light years ahead of the graphics for this game
even vanguard walks all over it visuallythe gameplay is standard mmo fare
if you like playing mmos youll like playing warhammer  if you hate mmos youll hate warhammer
its just another mmo nothing innovative
love em or hate embut playing warhammer just felt clunky and out of date
give this a major miss and stick with wow or whatever you favourite current mmo isthis game is just too picky as to how you do the goals in the game
i miss the old tony hawk games thps this game is so overrated
campaign was short
multiplayer was the same as halo  the missions in campaign that were ok are what kept me giving this a  star in the fun rating
i mean this game blows
its conflict desert storm with a different case and slightly different missions and characters
this game is such a disgrace to the cod series
i loved  and  this one blows
get army of twobioshockrvrv and put your  dollars to good use
see you laterupdatei know halo is unrealistic
i think everybody knows that
at least this game is somewhat realistic
butturrets overheat in this game
turrets dont overheat
ive shot turrets before and you have to reload them after  shotswhich you dont do in cod i think you know but they dont fuing overheat
wtf
why cant you take silencers off the guns
i know you cant do that in ao so dont tell me
but why cant you reach down and screw the silencer off
thats bsgraphics
sure they look great
but only if you  stay put in  room
then they all look the freakin same
okay have a nice day goodbyedo not buy this game if you dont have xbox live
its a blast and the graphics are good but you can beat it in a few hours
rent ittoo much hacker scum has ruined the online
they have invincibility and are able to go outside the map and camp the whole game
i wish death on them allwell i purchased the game and was not impressed with the graphics or controls
i refuse to pay for xbox live when pc is free so i purchased the pc version and maxed out the graphics and resolution and it like a different game
this version ruins the experience get it for pc the  version is a jokeit should be a fun and addictive game
however there are problems with the robotlike single player missions that plagued the earlier versions of codthe multiplayer should also be fun but it becomes impossible to even log in to the game because there are severe server problems
the servers have been down now for over hours
when they are up plan on much frustration as hosts that quit kill your ability to log into another game
the mp can also be buggy and can only be cleared by restarting the entire system
there are no hosts provided by activision infinity ward or the server provider who infinity ward likes to blame for its own online failuresif you are like me and purchased this game for the online content i prefer rofm to this for a fps single player game then you will be severly disappointed
a game like warhawk is more cartoonish but at least you can log in and see active games hosted by the company that made the game
they also tell you when their servers are down and when they expect them online againoh and there is the open mic problem
there is no switch to key the mic when you want to speak
therefore you are treated to every imaginable background sound to include the sound effects from other peoples systems
there is no way to turn it completely off or block the idiots or the occassional rapper who needs to incude you in his aspirations of the gangster high lifenot a fan
 minutes of playing and my ps stopped working
game play was great too bad it cost me the functioning of my psi was very disappointed to get this game home
i was late to the guitar hero party
ive never been musically inclined of course i love listening to music and never had much desire to try it out
my younger brother had gh ii and s
he was finally able to convince me to give it a whirl and i was hooked
living in different states and having traded in my ps for my ps purchase i was eagerly awaiting this games release
i bought it the first day it came out got it home and couldnt playthe guitar quite simply would not connect properly
i got it to sync but apparently suffered from a weak signal between the guitar and the dongle
i would have to hit a key numerous times before it would register with the game making it impossible to play
let me just say that activision using infared instead of the bluetooth abilities of the ps was a very bad idea
i dont know that ive ever been this disappointed with a video game
needless to say i returned the game and will not buy it until a different guitar is releasedwired or bluetooth
activision should be ashamed of the quality they allowed to be released to the publicits really hard to review an item when it doesnt work
when i tried to connect the guitar with my ps it just wouldnt sync
i tried everything but no dice
some might say you werent doing it right well trust me i was
im not new to video games or electronics for that matter
sent it right back
look it up on google
this product is known for having this issue
wish i wouldve done more research before purchasingthe song list is either your type of music or not
the game functions well with the song list
however this controller is the worst ever
it feels smaller than other controllers even though it is close in size
but it eats batteries
even when not being used it drains them no onoff switch you have to pull them out
sorry i listened to the other reviewers and got thiswhat a fun christmas day when the gift you buy your son does not work
the guitar will not synch
i have tried everything and looked online only to find there are multiple people with the same problemdo not buy this bundle do notthis game was on sale  and looked very interesting
my sons love all things egyptian especially mummies scorpions and anything else with a high creep factor
after looking it over i thought this game would be a stealafter playing the game a couple of times it was easy to figure out why it was so cheap
the controls are horrible
it was frustrating for all of us to maneuver anubis around
as for the actual game  it got tired quicksave your money and pass on this game
the concept is cool but the game is not
although my youngest did laugh himself silly as we made anubis unintentionally fly around
it was not as much fun for the rest of usof the wii games ive played to date anubis ii is locked in as the ndworst game on the platform to date
the only reason it isnt the worst is due to another conspiracy entertainmentpublished and data designdeveloped nightmare titled ninjabread man truly one of the worst games ever published on any platform which incidentally is nearly a carbon copy of this game same engine same music same godawful controls you get the picture
how this game was ever given the goahead is beyond me
the visuals are dismal the music and sound effects are poor and mindgratingly repetitive and the controls if you want to call them that surpass being merely unresponsive rendering the game largely unplayable
like ninjabread man there are no production values to see here
menus are plain theres no attempt to flesh out any storyline outside of the manual and the music has to be whats playing in the elevators of helli cant stress this enough avoid anubis ii like the plague
avoid anything developed by data design and take a good long look before you buy anything published by conspiracy entertainment
publishing games like this is what made the market crash in  and its currently hurting the wii software library as shovelware is a dime a dozen
i really wish nintendo would bring back the old seal of approval and take a look at the games being released before allowing them to be published
theres no way anubis ii or its ilk would ever see the light of day if nintendo would exercise a bit of quality control like they used to
what id really like to know is how games like this get a pass but others like xenoblademonado are overlooked for stateside releaseanubis ii has a budget price for a reason
this is above all the worst game to see the light of day for the wii yet thanks to its unresponsive controls ugly visuals boring gameplay and a grating soundtrack all combine to help anubis ii claim the aforementioned title
you play as the savior of ancient egypt or something in what would otherwise be called a platformer
as anyone who has played a video game in their life will know jumping is key to any platformer which anubis ii attempts to use with the wiimote and nunchuk and this is where the game fails the most
raising up the nunchuk barely works and in some cases it just doesnt while the tedious combat illustrates the games broken controls and boring gameplay all the more thanks to just plain bad movement
as far as the games graphics go the wii is far from a technical powerhouse but anubis ii looks like it was emulated from a first generation ps platformer
in case you havent gotten the idea yet anubis ii is by far and large the worst game to hit the wii yet and should be avoided at all costsconspiracy the developer behind this game had pretty much shamed the entire industry by reskinning  or  of the same game and releasing them as if they were different
anubis ii however actually has some more differences to it than just the graphics
anubis ii actually has completely different level designs with the exception of the intro level and theres actually more than  levels this time aroundunfortunately this game has even more problems than others of its caliberlike before you have to use a godawful control scheme
the z button is to jump and you have to shake the wii remote to attack if you dont want to jump on an enemy hoping youd hit it either way
btw the game never tells you you can jump with z rather does it want you to shake the nunchuck to do so
you can also do a shooting attack but not only do you stop dead in your tracks but it is as equally unreliable as your other moveswhile the levels in the other conspiracy atrocities may have been hilariously bad they were at least in a linear sense and not difficult to complete
here its a frickin chore
the arrow that tells you where the next platinum disc is still have to collect all  isnt even that helpful this time around
if anything it can contribute to getting lost in these mazes that the game calls levels
theyre absolutely dreadful and the environments are anything but pretty to look ati didnt immediately use this item after purchase because i didnt have more than two players at the time but when i did use it it wouldnt read more than slot a and b in slot one on the ps and in slot b it only read slot a and i tried over and over to try different things to try to get it to work but its useless for the purpose i bought it for
it has a made in china sticker on the back and feels very light and cheap
im not sure if i got a defective one or if this is what to expect from this item
i would have contacted seller but i think i waited too long to make a claim and i just have to deal with itoh it connected to my  series ps but other than that only the second controller worked and nothing else
whats the point
how do they get away with selling this crapi never received my game even though it says it has been delivered by ups
so thats a big one star from mewowwhat a disappointment
lets just push out a suckie game with problems and use a title that will ensure major sales
i couldnt believe the low amount of game play first of all and there is a glitch when fighting in the tunnels
if you use gernades to kill all the enemies in the tunnel after they use a flair to see where you and the leader of your squad the leader wont do what hes suppose to and will stay stuck in one place you can go thru to a certain point but will run into an invisible wall that wont allow you to go out the only exit for that tunneli went to wallyworld walmart and exchanged it thinking there was a disc problemnope same thing happened againthen there were other glitches later on and not sure if game was completed as by pressing a to get past the chatter the characters do so i could just continue fighting put me back just after the cave problemi cant see spending  on a piece of crap game that has problemswalmart didnt want to refund me they wanted me to contact microsoft and dice which made the gamethey have problems with games and i took a chance with mohwont buy anything they put out ever again
i hope that next months cod special ops dosent dissapoint and suck as badstay away from this game completly
too many problems and way too short of game play timei thought this game was better than cod but it turns out cod black ops ftwits already gone down to 
if that isnt indication enough that its a horrible game i just dont understand how games companies can play games like battlefield and call of duty and then make something that doesnt take what works and make it better
both medal of honor and homefront wasted a lot of time and money making a game that sucks in comparison
save the money and buy black ops or battlefield bad company this game is one of the worst games i have ever played
the sounds are terrible guns are terrible
online is the worst
dont buy this gamei sold mine to a friend for 
its terriblethis is a fine example of the greed ea and the gaming industry is headed tothis game could have been game of the year but instead it was released too early with few maps and many unsolved problems including uncontrollable snipping terrible hit detection system few and small maps and many other issuesbeing a bbc fan i was hoping for an improvement with this game and in fact it takes a few steps back in game developing and to my amazement they release a dlc pack only a couple weeks after the unfinished game was released
wow
maybe they should have left that pack in the game and spent some more time smoothing out all the issues it has
its roughyou will get very frustrated at the constant sniping and your life span will be only a few seconds all the time
in fact you will spend more time actually waiting for the game to start then in actual combat
worst letdown ever in a game for mei purchased an xbox  slim and a ps slim this year with the hope of some great gaming
what i got was low quality games full of errors rough and obviously rushed to release to increase revenue fable  medal of honor fallout nv i have no problem with them making money but i demand quality in the product
my only hope now is that cod black ops will be more like cod then mw or i may be done with the video game industry for good
dont buy dlc downloadable content from companies that release low quality games or games with errors and glitches until the fix them
if you support them buy buying dlc they will continue to release lower and lower quality games and try to sell more and more dlc
greed has taken over the gaming industry its up to us to say no
next they will try to charge us to play online on top of what you pay microsoft
all the professional reviewers are being payed
youve been warnedthe title of my review says it all
at every turn this game was obviously rushed and not polished due to call of duty launching on november the th
and no im not a cod fanboy i just know how the system works
a huge title that will draw a crowd is a daunting foe in the gaming world
dice knew that and rushed this game to get the maximum amount of salesthe good about the campaign the campaign is fun and creative
the visuals for night vision were impressive and realisticthe bad about the campaign the campaign was incredibly short and at times very aggravating
there were times where someone shouted directions at me and i could not hear them over the gunfire
then im left wondering if i should move up flank follow a comrade or stay put and defend
with the lack of good waypoints there are times where you are left confused and frustrated
maybe they were going for the realism of warfarethe good about the multiplayer i have yet to find one redeeming quality in the multiplayer
getting lots of pointless and well designed awards is kinda coolthe bad about the multiplayer i will sum up probably  of my online experience in this game with two words spawn trap
this game is so horribly put together for the online gameplay that it makes my head hurt
all of the maps with the exception of maybe  are so small that you simply need to post up around the other teams spawn to win
most of the spawns are in the corner of a map so you come around a building to mortar fire and sniper bullets
this means you have  choices
 stay put and do nothing but periodically die from mortar and rocket strikes
 attempt to run out in the mass confusion with your other team mates while you get mowed down time after time after time
the only time i had fun if you can call it that and racked up kills was when my team and i returned the favor and spawn trapped the other team
so you have  choices play like a jerk or get played like a jerkavoid this game unless you want to rent it and enjoy a fun fast campaign
other than that wait for battlefield vietnam or call of duty if you want a real gameim not even gonna waste my time writing lengthy review because this game is a complete joke when it comes to quality and quantitylaughable  hours long single player even on highest difficulty laughable explosions in certain parts of  st levels frame rate issues scripting glitches  manymultiplayer xbox filled with multitude glitchesbroken voiphorrible hit detectioncompletely broken spawn pointshorrible vehicle controlsonly  maps which on top of that are not playable in all modesonly  multiplayer modessemi hardcore mode that does not have its own playlists plus its not even hardcore random freezes slowdownsrandom suicides yes your character will commit random suicides from time to time ovarious other exploits that im not even gonna mention here in details see through walls unlimited ammovery limited amount of guns to play with and unlocksby the time you hit hours in mutliplayer time most likely everything should be unlockedthis game is a step backwards from previous titles by dice like bfbc that was rushed hardcore by ea to the retail market just to snag some of those call of duty players simply unfinished unpolished multiplayer with  many issues to forget combined with graphically and story decent single player
they might sold  million copies of this smelly turd but expect this title to die faster then some stars in our galaxy due to extremely low amount of people in mutrliplayer below k daily all that coming from a battlefield fan who thought this will be the game of  in fps shootersi was upsetand it was not worth the money that  paid fori am sorry about  thatyou get what you pay forwow what a disappointment
another review said they rushed putting this out i think they shouldnt have bothered
dont waste your money buyingif you think it will thrill you like the previous game rent first
i think most people will not buy this game after renting it and those that bought outright will wish they hadnt
its like a bad grainy cartoon that you step in and play a scene now and then
the graphics are horrible and the action even on the hardest setting well stinks
like the new halo nothing here is improved or even interesting
yup there are glitches a plenty to further ruin the game play
sorry fans i was as excited as anyone about a new game to conquerthis just isnt italmost impossible to join games
and its even harder to join with a friend  the play with friends menu is completely broken
its been days and every time i try to join a game i get the error the ea servers cannot be reached all other games work flawlessly
also the singleplayer ai is absolutely awful and the game is so scripted that its almost annoying
so if youre looking for a good multiplayer go elsewhere because the multiplayer doesnt even work
and when you do get to join a game the play is pretty shallow and the progressionrewards are laughable compared to other games
if you want a good singleplayer go elsewhere too
on top of what i said before the story is a mix of trying to be cinematic and epic and failing and boring repetitive pointandshoot sequences there is some variance though
really dont waste your money
i wouldnt buy this unless it was  or lesswell when it came the wires were cut so i tapped them and it worked
second you cant put on your lap it needs to be on a table or else itll screw up the fan
do yourself a favor and dont get thisit wont play games and i dont like it i had to go buy one locally and the one from u is collecting dustwhy the surprise
because they have changed the design and removed the external power brick
now that its integrated it supports v only and will work in the uscanada only
before you could have just swapped the power brick with the appropriate one and take it overseas
not anymorethe build also looks cheaper than what was manufactured few years agoi dont recommend this product to anyone
this gaming system didnt last long and its just too thinvery bad very bad came all scratched and dirty the article said it was new and it was not so  why i do not likethe sony play station  is better than this
i dont know why they still sell this
this is old and it doesnt have as good games
the games that it does have are all with bad graphicsthe ps was sonys second console and in my opinion is inferior to the xbox gamecube and dreamcastdesign the ps has a realy bad design it only has two controller ports it cant read purple discs and is unreliable at least it can play ps gamesgraphics the pss graphics are nothing compared to the gamecube xbox and dreamcast some games have decent graphics like final fantasy and armored core but even these games are nothing compared to resident evil remake on the gamecube or halo on the xbox even the dreamcast outshines the pss graphicssound the ps has decent sound final fantasys music is great and armored core has great sound but besides those two games thats about it for soundcontroller the pss controller is pretty good it fits right in your hand and the buttons are right where you need them if only it was more reliablegames the pss game library is realy disappointing the only good games it has are final fantasy armored core and gun griffon blazeoverall the ps is not a good console your better off getting a gamecube xbox or dreamcastto put it plain and simplethis is a total piece of junkfirst offthis console can easily overheatwhich can cause the inside to meltsecondlythe disc holder within the systemwhich spins the game disc is awfulyou have to make sure the disc is pushed down all the wayon the disc spinnerwhich is a painbecause even if the disc is slightly off the disc spinnerthe system will not read itthis means that you are putting your ps disc in danger on being cracked around the center holeand that will eventually happenbecause its happened to meand lastlythis version of the ps hardly ever reads dvdssome dvds will work just finewhile some will not work at alloh and the slim ps also will not play the older ps discs that have a blue back to themso overalli would highly recommend that you do not buy one of thesebuy the original ps console with the disc tray insteadi am warning anyone considering purchasing this system  dont
i bought this when it first came out  or so and it lasted  months before it died
it stopped reading any of the games i tried out
the classic disc read error message became commonplace in my house
sony would do nothing for me it was more expensive to get it fixed than to buy a new one
solike an idiot i bought a new one
my second ps only lasted  months and did the same thing
this time it would not eject my ncaa football game so i had to force open the disc tray just to get my game out
once again sony would do nothing
the warranty was only for  days thus the  month time frame did not allow warranty coverage
this was a very disappointing product as i had never had problems with sony products before
i enjoyed many of the games i played on the ps i just believe that it should last longer than  months
i bought an xbox and never had any problems with it
ever
shame on sony for putting a junky product charging  for it at the time and then not backing it up with a decent warrantyoverall  poorthe slim model is unlike any other console redesign the world has seen
normally a redesign is a way for developers to sort out the bugs found in the first version but lol sony just created more
the machine lasted a grand  seconds before shorting out and stopped reading discs
as much as i hate my original playstation  for being clunky and having the occasional errror message the slim wasnt much of an improvement
if you want th generation console fun buy a gamecube which will not break has great games and cost only  bucks for a refurbished model at gamestopyes the preview pictures look good and promising  but after buying the game and playing it several times  and still hated it the conclusion after just a few minutes of playing this is that its horrible
i cant think of a worse game ive played in my lifetime
its a good thing i didnt play too much for this game  or id be really piedit not that this was a bad game it just i didnt need the game and it is collectiong dust like some of my othersi bought this game thinking it was going to be funi was wrong
the gameplay was terrible and it was a waste of money
stick with wii sports bowling its the only good bowling game for wiii picked this game up in the bargain bin for  and figured even it was mediocre it would be worth the price
i was wrong
the game is truly one of the video games ive ever played
the graphics are fair but the gameplay and sound are horrid
the characters repeat the same lines over and over again after each roll
it gets to the point that you have to turn the sound off
the bowling game that comes with wii sports is much better than this game
avoid at any costwhen i first bought the wii i purchased an additional handful of games to go along with it
amf bowling pinbusters was one of the those games
it was moderately priced and so i figured that it would make a nice diversion from time to time
i set the wii up popped in wii sports which came with the console and played the bowling game which comes with it
i liked it a lot
i then switched over to play amf bowling pinbusters and tried playing that
i didnt like it not one bit
the game is boring each character has  at most  three or four comments they can utter after a thrown ball and they say one of them after every throw
so after about five minutes of game play i turned off the tv volume and turned on the radio for some background noise
the characters are uninspired the venues are tacky and you cannot use your miis in the game
if you want to bowl stick with the bowling game on wii sportsive played about  or  wii games now and i made the mistake of buying this one before renting itit is a truly horrible game except for maybe some cool looking graphicseven when you throw the ball straight the dumb program still hooks the ballthe pin sounds arent realistic the wii sports bowling is much more accuratethe characters catchphrases get old very fast and annoyed methe game doesnt use the wii remote to any advantage at all like wii sports doesall in all skip itthis is one of the worst atari updates i ever seen do not buy it you wont like iti bought this game to play the  classics
thats really the only reason i bought it
i think their reskins of the classics are bad
to make matters worse they make you play them in ridiculous amounts to unlock the  classic games which is probably why everyone is buying this to begin with
i had to go through the dicey process of downloading the one and only save game where someone had gone through the nightmare of unlocking the  games
so if you buy this go to gamefaqs and download the save game where someone did all the tedious work for youi owned an original wired fender rock band guitar
that one works awesome and i consider it superior to the gibson guitar hero iii guitar
however i just got my wireless guitar and the tilt sensor does not work
i went to the support website and forums
apparently many of the first batch of wireless guitars have this problem
although this is covered under warranty i will be without the guitar for approximately  days while they ship me a box in which i will ship my broken guitar back to ea
they will then ship a replacement wireless guitar
i would urge caution when buying because of this
hopefully ea and harmonix will rectify this problem and future production batches will have better quality
update days after sending my guitar in for replacement ea says all replacements are backordered and could take an additional  days more from their orginal  to  week replacement estimate
buy at your own risk
other wireless guitar controller issues have been reported on the rock band forums as well
i would recommend buying this guitar at a brick and mortar store where you can return it immediately if you have problems
the warranty replacement takes way too long
some people on the forums even report that their replacement has issues as well
its a shame because rock band is an awesome game
update after  days ea sent me a wired guitar controller to tide me over until my wireless guitar controller is repaired or replaced
the cool thing is i get to keep the wired guitar even after my wireless one is ready
i didnt call them and complain either
ea did this without my provoking them
update after  days ea sent me a replacementrefurbishedrepaired wireless guitar
the guitar performs as advertised
the tilt sensor works great as well as all the buttons etc  i definitely consider it superior to the red octane gibson les paul controller for ghiii which also works on rock band
downside for this controller is that it does not work on any of the guitar hero series of games
one minor complaint for ea  when they shipped my guitar they packed an inordinate amount of silica gel packs with it
some of these packs leaked small pieces of silica which fell inside the guitar and now make a rattling noise when i move the guitar controller
im hoping the wireless controllers out now are of the same quality i received in my replacement controllerwhatever happened to quality
the presser foot stopped working after i played a few games
were getting another one too bad it can be a fun game but its cheaply made
were thinking about getting the other drumset that works with xboxthis mic is of very poor quality
it worked okay the first day  starting on the nd day the game kept saying that no mic wasnt plugged in  we had to unplug it and plug it back in a dozen times
over the next few days it just stopped working altogether
there was no physical damage to the microphone at alllooking on different websites i see that this is a very very common problemim not sheree im her son using her account  but this game is fun it has pretty good songs but when i first bought it the multiplayer didnt work so i tried swithching out the drums with the microphone and i tryed all sorts of things then when i plugged in my drums they didnt work and nothing else did so i restarted my xbox  and then it wouldnt read the disc so i had to go back to target to get another disci just got the game i didnt get a whole new seti called best buy they tried telling me to estart it because the new disc of rock band worked but it still didnt read any of the instrumentsbest buy kept me making me restart it and put the connections of the instrument in diffrent slotsconnections for the controller or other things to hook upso i was taking to best buy over the phone nothing worked so i just took it back to target and my mom said you can get it when all the bugs are out and i know someone else who bought it but it didnt work either so im waiting until they starting selling stable s and i heard from people the ps s are catching fire from the glitches and mess ups in it and did i mention sometimes when i put int he rock band disc my xbox  would start rattling happened wiceso i recommend to buy guitar hero because i and everyone i know has had no problems with it and in the guitar hero world tourguitar hero its going to have drums with symbols on iti have a new vista pc that is  weeks old and this game just hangs during install
i searched for  days for a fix with no luckhad to returnfor the amount of hype and flash this game is a disappointment
after all these years you would think that developers would make a game more open ended and creative
graphics are not the whole package
for a real experience that can be played different every single time try operation flashpoint resistance and its many add ons
much more realistic gameplay
the graphics are dated yet the immersion is much deeper because it has more  atmosphere and sophisticated ai
dont waste your money on cod unless you like to play a game one time and sit it on your shelfthe worst game i have ever played full of bugs and just plain insults your intelligence
after playing your intelligence will be gone
horrible and a waste of timethis is not like the original soldier of fortune games
lame checkpoint save system that doesnt work correctly all of the time ie youll see multiple save game textual popups but if you die you restart at the beginning of the level in my experience
ridiculously unrealistic boss fights where  rounds need to be dealt to a single man who isnt wearing body armor in order to kill him
a drastically toned down body dismemberment system contrary to the advertising about this game being true to previous games in the way you can shoot parts of the enemy body off while you can shoot pieces off this isnt anywhere near as graphic as the previous sof games were
irritating doom style enemy spawns in areas youve already cleared ie on one level youll shoot a sniper out of a tower and as you advance over a bridge another sniper magically appears in the tower in his exact place and starts head shooting youthe level environments are very linear with little or no reward for attempting to explore out of the way areas and machine gun placements are poor and nearly unusable in their turn radius ie in one part of a level i grabbed a stationary machine gun hoping to mow down droves of enemies in a mindless one way fire fight and the tangos spawned so far to the left that the gun couldnt turn to actually shoot themi had to unequip the mounted mg and switch to a scopeequipped weapon to take them down before they killed mea poor tribute to the sof series is this and not worth more than  bargin bin price at that imhoavoid this game
its very buggy even with the patches
tons of problems
some examples you step off a platform and end up trapped behind its legs
you cant jump over crawl under or go around
restart the level the gun site is not accurate
often you have to aim a little bit off of the target to get a hit
hard to find the magic sweet spot when enemies are running after you the ai sucks
the enemies pretty much line up to die
the only problem is your gun has a bent site or something so you can sometimes miss a head shot from  feet away
maybe they did that on purpose to make the game harder and cover up the lousy aiavoid this gamei have three computersand it wouldnt work on any of themone pcthe screen was nothing but whitegreen and reddishthe other twoafter the game startedthe screens frozesoi couldnt play it at alldissappointed
i took it out and put it back in three times on each pccareful with this onelet me start off by saying that this is a nice looking guitar and is relatively better looking then the guitar that comes in the bundle and thats where it endswhen i first started using itit would work perfectly finefor like half way through a song then suddenly with out warning it shuts offi replaced the batteriesto see if that helps nopewith freshly replaced batteriesit does it againno buenoi would suggest that a guitar similar to the one in the bundlebecause this guitar will leave you playing the bluessave your moneywhat a dissapointment waste of money time
a complete rubbish
im submitting this review just now because all this months since april i have been tryin to make it work and it was a complete failure
do noy buy this awful thingi bought this because i love rockband and thought i would like this because it was under  now
i couldnt even play it
you have to have guitar hero guitars to play guitar heroim going to be completely honest with you guys these new spyro games cant compare to the original three on the playstation one
the first three spyro games are considered classic platforming brilliance with excellent gameplay and a magical world of creativity
but the new games have way too many annoying features and confusing controls not to mention the glitchy graphical problems they present
stick with the original three which are called spyro the dragon spyro riptos rage and spyro year of the dragon
the first three were you know funok with all these bad reviews i hop this new company that took over after spyro  will get the fact that they suck at this and need to change it back the way it was
i miss the old spyros where moneybags was there and hunter what happned to him and the portals to new worlds with mini games geese ive seen some companys turn a good game into a bad one when they got the rights to it but this is the worsti am a big spyro fan
i loved all of the spyro games because they were sweet enough for the whole family to enjoy
sadly this one is downright terrible
kids would be chucking their controllers in frustration because this games controls are bad and enemies are near imposable to defeat
if youre shopping for a good kids game do not buy this because its ridiculously frustratingokay im going to start off by saying that i have played  out of the  spyro games i know of
the first three for the original ps and enter the dragonfly as well as a heros tail
i found that i loved these games until insomniac quit being involved in making them and universalvivendi took over
a heros tail was better than enter the dragonfly which had so many bugs and not enough of the subworlds i was accustomed toi bought this game figuring maybe just maybe universal had listened to the customers who said they miss the spyro from the original games but no they didnt listenthis game is the polar opposite of the spyro games for ps in that all you do is walk a little kill some enemies walk a little more and you guessed it kill some enemies
theres no collecting of items just fighting
if i wanted a game that only involved fighting id buy mortal kombat which i loved back in the day
this game was so boring and disappointing i didnt finish it
it was a waste of my money and id sell it but i do not want to torture anyone with a game this boring
if you like fighting games then this is for you but if youve been a fan of the spyro series from the beginning youre probably going to say the same thing i did and that is that this game stinks
please universal listen to the customers if you plan on making anymore spyro games and if not then just quit making them because these last few games are horriblei purchased this product because it looks really nice and charges  wii remotes when you have them docked
at first this was an amazing product but now a few months after i have been using it the batteries that it came with for the wii remotes no longer hold a charge
after  minutes of play time the batteries die and have to be recharged
when i place them into the charger the light turns red which it should but then within  seconds turns blue which is supposed to mean charged
ive tried waiting a few hours with the remotes on the charger to see if it would work but still the remote dies within  minutes
i would never recommend this product to anyone i know or even to a stranger i feel cheated
the point of buying this product was to charge my batteries as my wii has never even gotten warm and doesnt need a cooler
basically i paid all this money for a large base that lights up and has no use to meworked in a month after that it just stop charging my controlleri have to sent this back to amazon to have a refundwhen i read this description station features a cool glow at the base with its own onoff switch
this switch also controls the fan onoff power switch
i was under the impression that the stupid cool glowing base could be turned off separately from the fan
it does not
it simply has  onoff switch that controls everything
we dont like pointless glowing things that serve no purpose
all we wanted was the fan and charger with the understanding that the blue light could be turned off
had i bought this directly from amazon and not one of their other sellers i would have been able to return this with no cost to me
but because i used the other sellers it would cost me over seven bucks to return it
combined with the  to ship it to me im better off tossing it on my pile of unused stuff in hopes of finding someone who could use it and never buy from the other sellers againthe battery pack is black and looks awful on a colored remote
not a huge issue for us but if something like this bugs you you should see the pic i uploaded to see what i meanthis misleading verbiage in the listing is very frustrating
why even mention that the base has its own off switch and in the same sentence go on to state that the same switch also controls the fan
i wonder who is responsible for these descriptions updatethe batteries that i received are lousey
first of all they are self contained disposable battery packs that snap into your remote
they did not hold any charge
i barely get a few hours out of a charge
im guessing that its because theyre old
finding replacement packs is a total hassle
they are not available here on amazon as of this writing
i did find them on the web but they were expensive
very expensive
between  per pack
we ended up getting a standard chargersanyo eneloop  pack aa nimh precharged rechargable batteries w chargerand just replace as needed
what a peice of junk
avoid this unit at all costs updatewhat
no negative stars available
threw it in the trash today
fan just died
seriously a piece of garbage
unit started to make loud buzzing noise then fan pooped out months of useim sure the backwards compatible playstation motorstorm bundle  gb  is a good product but i did not receive this bundle which i ordered from this particular seller gohastings
what i got was a playstation  that was not backwards compatible with horrible internetbrowsing software a controller with a broken left joystick a broken power cord and no motorstorm game not that i care that much about motorstorm anyway
gohastings never picked up this system which i did successful mail back to a po box in texas
because gohastings has not picked up their package or so gohastings claims i cannot get my money back
do not buy from gohastings who i will be pursuing for my refund money via amazoncom atoz claim amazon said they will investigate the sellerfirst of all the only consoles that i have ever owned are a nintendo gamecube and the ps
when i first saw the ps i knew i wanted it but at the time i didnt have enough money to get it
i didnt want an xbox because i hate the design of the controller and the rrd issues
and i thought a wii was probably to kiddish for me
at anypoint for the  yrs that i had it i loved it but it broke on me earlier this year
ylod issue
which is a huge problem from some of the blogs online
i read that quite a few people are having problems with this issue in the older models
what i dont understand is why sony only warranted there product for  year
im guesing that they knew there were some flaws in quite a few of them
im very dissapointed with that
luckily though i did get an added warranty with my product since it did cost me  at the time bought it from walmart
needless to say walmart warranty plans suck
i sent it in  times because of ylod issue and it came back twice with other problems
still waiting on refund or another ps
if you ever do decide to get one
make sure you have an extra warranty and dont buy from walmart because there warranty service is a jokei gave these to my daughter for christmas and they all broke as of last week
that is less than a monthhello im an autistic adult gamerthis is my review on mario party dsi rented this game from my local library for free for  weeks
the storyline was cute but when it came to actual gameplay i couldnt figure it out
glad i rented this game  didnt waste no money on itdo your self a favor save your money dont waste your cash on this gamei dont know what i was thinking when i bought this game
i guess i didnt realize exactly what it was
it is like playing a board game with yourself and against the computer who i feel cheats
i am trading this in to earn credit towards something elsecutesy graphics dumped on a game program that is lacking even by atari  standardseasily the worst video game i have ever playedboth stratigically and tactically the algorithms used for the units are so poorly developed as to make the game unplayable except for those people that are mesmerized by flashing lights and loud noisesbought it thinking it was its own game downloaded it and everything got it up and running tried to play a level and it told me i needed another game to play did this with every level
i believe this to be a dlc to the actual game which i had not purchasedi am a big fan of coh
after saw some negative reviews i hesitated to buy this
after a few weeks couldnt resist and made the purchaseafter a few weeks play i have to say its the worst game experience everthe installation went ok no problem
its the game play part
the game constantly hung and crash
it normally starts fine after a few minutes some times  minutes playing it just freezes upi tried many things upgrading driver reinstall etc no help
trying to send emails to thq no responsedont buy this game unless you want try your luckupdate on after many email finally got response from thq they basically saying i need unload all nonms services
so i tried and no surprise game still hangs
and i sent them all my dxdiag info per their request
that was three weeks ago
so far no response
and my game still hangs
i played cod bioshock hl on this pc with no problem
so its unlikely hardware problemand today i uninstalled this ps from my pc byebye
no more coh seriesi spent  for two months trouble
well guess lesson learnedi am on my second try installing this thing
the first time i tried i had to download huge patch after patch and never did get it to work
seems like it broke my original coh too
ended up uninstalling both games and trying just installing cohopbe aware that they absolutely require you to sign up for online gaming to get through the install
unless your idea of fun is fighting with the computer to get your game installed stay away from this dogtypical windows product
garbage
the first game was great this one takes a very long time to install then has a long updateeven over cable internetthen wants you to create an account online
since the game is not smart enough to look for multiple dvdcd drives it will eject you back to the desktop if the cd isnt in the drive that the game happens to be looking ati purchased coh and loved it and as far as i remember it was fairly stable
now with opposing fronts as soon as load a map it crashes and freezes my computer
this is a known dx issue that even with the latest update from relic has not been properly addressed
it happens to users with both nvidia and ati cards from the last generation xxx for nvidia cards if you go read the relic forums its a common issueuntil they fix this bug i cant play the game much less give it more than  star
however for the few brief moments that i was able to play i like the new british units
im a fan of defense and turtling up so the new british fixed emplacements howitzers bofors guns mortars  pndr atgun are an interesting new addition
updateafter the most recent game and nvidia updates the game is finally rock solid
this is the product that they shouldve released rather than the buggy version
the campaign missions can be played without crashing however the skirmish maps crash repeatedly
which stinks in terms of keeping the game around for replayabilityi could actually finish all the campaigns without a single glitch
the graphics and physics are incredible the new units are a hoot to play with
like i mentioned above im a big fan of the british
the  pndr and  pndr atguns and howitzers respectively deal out more damage than the american s and the priest can rain destructive power down on any part of the battlefield
the panzer elite doesnt feel as different from the regular wehrmacht as the british do from their american counterparts
panzer elite plays like a stronger armored force and thats about itif only they had fixed their bugs earlier i wouldve given them a much higher ratingi dont usually play demos which is where i went wrong here
thats my own fault and with that in mind i strongly suggest that anyone curious about this game do soi do however read reviews and i tend to watch game play trailers and the like so i do research my purchases
i also think i am fairly easy to please
that said its been a long time since i have disliked something this much and so quicklythe graphics are some of the worst i have ever seen and i have everything cranked all the way up
return to castle wolfenstien looked better than this years ago
not only are the environments utterly boring but they are rendered at a quality that is easily being surpassed by even the least graphicintensive games of the last two or three yearsgraphics are not everything though and were that my sole complaint id not bother with a reviewthere is apparently no such thing as enemy ai
get in front of the completely random assortment of demons most of which look like rubber toys with teeth and sometimes if they arent too buy roaming aimlessly back and forth they might attack
they can also apparently walk through any obstacle in their path should they choose to engage you including buildings and by walk through them i mean as if they are not there
not that it matters
i played for a couple of hours and fought dozens and dozens of utterly random monsters and never came anywhere near getting killedthe dialog is unbelievably juvenile and utterly silly and the character animations during said dialog are about  seconds long endlessly repetitious and look like they were choreographed by a two year old
if there is a story to this game i have yet to figure out what it isthe quests so far are also ridiculous extremely simple and highly unimaginative
i have heard people complain about the fetch this get that quests in other rpg style games like oblivion but this game is nowhere near the quality of oblivion in any way whatsoeverseriously i almost never post negative reviews but this is ridiculous
maybe i am missing something perhaps if i was nostalgiac for diablo i would get the joke but as it stands as a game on any level i cannot find a single good thing to say about this titledefinitely play the demo first
if it turns out to be your kind of thing thats great
i just dont get it at alli own all previous pc splinter cell titles
its a lot of fun to play
but to me the series has ended right here and nowhere i was trying to decide whether to get assassins creed ii or splinter cell conviction
i was more than willing to shell out
but when i read about this insane copy protection scheme i decided its time to move onsurprising as it may sound i want to keep my save files in my computer
i might want to back them up too
i might need that connection to do something that actually requires online access
and maybe im a little paranoid and i dont want your software to tell you what im doingthis is now a cause
ubisoft shouldnt a dime from anyone until they call off these customerabusing schemes
far from deterring hackers which they havent theyre putting customers off
my money is best spent elsewhereedited reviewafter trying to play this game second time i got completely disapointedpros not a bad idea for action gamecons awful controlsslow and bulky mechanicsa dumb idea is  to do a close kill to gain a multi kill abilityabsolutely no way to remain stealth but thats the only way to have a crowd controlso stupid to make a rail game with a tendendency of american footballanother dumb part is that sam has to buy things
and note this  he cant he buy himself a good bullet proof vest yea just like that huh ubisoft  there is no doubt you had the best game designers for this one the graphics compare to batman aa is so poorgloomy im running it on high and besides that i didnt see x resolution in the settings
batman looks much more excitingstoryline well i dont know what to say  i guess they just picked one of those good old commando ideas so not inspiring
eg
hitman games got cool storyline
ac  got great storyline
ac ii got okay storyline batman blah blah blahi played this game for two hours and went totally cold to it once againobviously this game is not worth a nickle but if youre completely bored and want some frustration maybe it would be a good idea to pay  bucks for itevery new game ubisoft is publishing requires a constant internet connection to play regardless if you are playing solo or not
if the ubisoft server is unavailable for what ever reason denial of service attack link problems youre on an airplane or you have no internet connection forget it you cant play and the game will abruptly haltregardless how fun the game might be this kind of drm makes activations look good and i wont even buy a game that requires steam
dont buy this game and better yet dont buy anything from ubisoft until they dump this stupid drm
i would almost rather have starforce again than put up with thismilitary members that are deployed are frequent gamers
may carry over their xboxs laptops pss etc to the deployed location europe middle east africa anywhere really
its one of the few things left to do that bring some joy from home and give us a chance to escape reality and just have funthis is the second game now ive found that require a constant highspeed internet connection just to play single player
the first i saw was assassins creed ii and now this one another highanticipated game
what in the world are these companies thinking
they dont even have servers that can handle the loads of people trying to sign on to the single player games so you may find yourself waiting hours upon hours just to sign in
then youll find yourself knocked off when the server slows down too much
 for thisas far as the military community hundreds of thousands of people are concerned  none of us can every play these games while deployed tdy or just traveling around the countryi can understand companies doing what they can to prevent copyright infringement but this is too far
youve alienated an entire corps of people and the hatred for this type of program requirement is growing drastically among the public
its time to wake up and release patches that will allow single player people to play these games with no internet connection at all
thats what install id codes are for inside boxes at installwake up steam and fellow companies that keep this internet requirement insanitylinear boring
i can run past a group of enemies without dying
no stealth necessary
easy even on realistic mode
this game sucksanother game not playing due to the garabage drm
ubi how many sales have you actually lost treating customers like you doi think my title to play
my internet connection here has been shoddy because of recent power outages from a storm
no game for me
cant play for long because i get disconnected momentarily and nothing not to mention ubi fail serversfrustration for many gamers such as myself hope that ubis way of protecting their games goes awayi know i rather support other companies that dont support such methodsyou cant even buy a digital download of this game from steam or directdrive without the same drm scheme
having an internet connection at all timesid understand if the drm actually stopped pirates
but it doesnt
disappointing since im a big fan of the previous splinter cell gamesid wait for the bargain bin on this one
or just get a xboxpsthis kind of customer abuse is only going to lead people to pirate
sad
the developers are the big losers here looks like they put out a very innovative and well made game only to have the suits screw them over
xbox is the great evilhave an internet connection  that is balls
i cannot believe these software creators
enough with the stardocks software for the cd protection  great as long as it doesnt impair the purpose of the software game
to allow game play among purchasers of the game
now we all know that as long as they are making money the server folks creatorsmanufacturers who sell the product will keep the server up and running
once that fat cash maker is old or forgotten and doesnt make money they will ditch the online players
that said how long do you think this game will last then with the online availablity
it wont
i really wanted to buy this game too
i have all splinter cell games and play the single player numerous times but this one has to use the online requirement just to play by yourself
that isnt right
sorry i cant condone such nonsense
aint buying it  literallyi have been a splinter cell fan since day   sam fisher isthe man
considering it took way too long to come out with the sequel i had great expectations
i am disappointedfirst of all  the drm requires the internet to be on at all times to play  this doesnt lend itself to being friendly for people on the goi think you get unlimited installs  but only one account associated with the activation coderesulting gradefminuson the game play side the graphics are good the gameplay is a little frustrating as the controls at least on the pc are not fully consistent with prior gameplay
the cover system adds some finesse but not enough to overcome the gameplay itselfthe single player mode is way too shortmultiplayer holds up to expectations but as i base gameplay on the single player mode it isnt enough to overcome the short but attentive gameplay out of five for gameplay if i could give a  i would due to drm internet required to play a single player campaign saved games are saving in some server and not in your pcyes you dont own your saved games anymorethis seems a big joke but its trueplease ubi just use steams drm its non invasive and it still protects your product
i would have bought the splinter cell package this week if you had not included this crap in your products
please remove itthanksi have every splinter cell game in the series for the pc
i have thoroughly enjoyed playing every one of them especially the original
i am utterly devastated that i cannot get this amazing addition to the series because it requires a constant online connection to play
how absurd  its also a single player game
i wanted to play this on my gaming laptop during my vacation
now i cant and i also dont want to buy it at this time when this version is clearly being offered as a rental onlyubisoft have decided to reward all of their decent honest and paying customers with an almighty slap in the face
this is a definitive example of where piracy wins
pirates will end up with a game that can be played without an internet connection and lasts forever whereas paying customers will end up with a game that requires constant checkins with bigbrother ubisoft and lasts only as long as the activation servers which i doubt will be very long at allyeah i heard the one reviewer dis all the people who gave a bad review without even trying the game and you do have a point but seeing as there are a lot of people who have had problems getting connected to verify that they have a valid game im going to avoid buying iti logged on to amazon hoping to find a new game searched the top  list saw this game said yum yum yum new gamethen read the reviewsan decided to pass since im antibig brother and this much effort into making people validate is bsfyi im always happy to buy my games but i hate being forced to prove my honesty everytime i want to play a gameif ubi is so worried about getting their money why dont they create an online version where players login into a mmolfps game
id subscribe since bliz is dragging their feet on this type of game and wasting their time still making game style games that are  years old starcraft iiboycott this horrible drm scheme
ubisoft is clueless lets just hope sales finally condemn them to stop treating us like criminals
constant online connection for a single player is ridiculousallot of people are seriously pissed at this game 
my suggestion to anyone reading this review boycott this game all my friends and people on the net are very dissapointed with the game i can understand drms that require you to register your game in order to get updates and such
but to go as far as to make customers that buy this offline game to have to have a online connection to the servers at all times in order to play is ridiculous
ubisoft should have learned from their mistake with implementing this drm on assassins creed  and how it blew up in their face
if this is their plan of attack for all pc games they need to stop making games for pc and just stick to console game portsthe game has many things wrong with it not like bugs but frustrating thingsdespite everything you hear about this being a fresh new direction for simcity this is not a simcity game this is a simcity failurejust look at how just a few months after its release its already being sold at half price  there are a plethora of used copies for sale for the price of a cheap keychainim not a veteran sim city fan at all but this game looked like an interesting take on the franchise  i thought youd be able to create interesting societies and see how people act within them
wow am i disappointed
and its not just me  all the users of gamespot are giving this star reviews tootheres just nothing here
there are social energies like authority and creativity and you create buildings based on which energies they create or use
it sounds fun  it is not
i dont feel connection at all to the citizens and the bad camera doesnt help that at all
also the graphics suck  things should be bright and easy to see from a good angle
instead theyre at a bad angle you cant zoom in very close and nighttime keeps coming making it hard to see
what the hellthe user interface is simply a mess
there are tons of buildings grouped together alphabetically instead of by a meaningful category system
this means if you want to build any building you have to scroll through and find the one you want alphabetically
that sucks
there are filters for creativity authority etc
for buildings but they display the ones that use and the ones that create the energy all together
not good
im afraid the bottom line is this game is just not good or fun
if youre an old sim city fan or even if youre not like me im afraid you are going to be disappointedif i could go back in time the first thing i would do is unbuy this game
it is terrible
its buggy it must have been rushed for christmas and tech support does not know how to fix it
even after downloading the updates im having the same major problems and the gameplay is so lame its hardly worth trying to fix it anywayi was really looking forward to it i wasnt one of those upset because they were messing with the sacred sim city format but i guess i should have been
i wasnt even upset by the goalless open ended gameplay but i should have been
i thought it would make it interesting but they got rid of the best elements of the game and they did it in a sloppy careless manner so that besides being bad gameplay it adds the frustration of crashing all the timei got bored just sitting through most of this simcity societies tutorial learning about all the dumb and dumber things you have to do just to have to build a city how lame
so after sitting through most of the tutorial i said forget all this boloney and i quit playing this game
now i dont care to play this game anymore
glad i only paid  for the sim city boxplus why cant they make a city game where the traffic can stay on the roadand just drive around and not disappear
with cars disappearing it does notmake for a realistic city
the cars on the roads are more realistic in citiesxl they should make a sim city game where you plant and harvest and store your goods and supply your stores and collect your money to save up to buy more buildings and houses to build your city and just let the citizens take care of themselves like in the game cityville except not have to play it in real timemy download insists that i insert the original supreme commander fa cddvddid i mention i bought this as a downloadive played a lot of games that infuriated me but this one has the distinction of being the only one that got me so horn mad that i ejected the disk and physically broke it in two
i just tacoed it until it snappedi believe ive played all the titles in the need for speed series and this one was a slog to get through
almost as exciting as poring over the works of immanuel kantthe general consensus of the reviews is that the storyline is unnecessary and boring the physics of the cars feels unrealistic there is no freeroam mode and the controls seem unconvincing and slow to respondid like to add a number of other things
this game is confusing
the menus are byzantine and i found myself playing for quite some time wondering why i wasnt progressing until i accidentally discovered that i wasnt even in career mode
you buy and upgrade cars but theyre nowhere to be seen on race day
instead you are given other cars which disappear once you exit race day
drag race is confusing  when exactly are you supposed to start
not being able to esc the cutscenes is maddening after youve seen the same sequence the th time
being a prisoner of race day without being able to save until you complete the entire thing just makes you want to shut the whole thing off and find something better to do with your time
reading the manual didnt help as the manual chiefly consists of such useless statements as in a drag race the challenge is to get the quickest drag time
theres no way to click out of watching your car get totaled which gets pretty infuriating after about the hundredth time
this is especially infuriating since theres not even any graphics for a damaged car  your car just flips over and over again without getting a scratch
i love how on speed challenge the lens flare is constantly in your face regardless of which direction your car is pointing
unfair how you start every race at the very back 
is this punishment
why not random positionwont install
locked up my computer then it corrupted the flight simulator x horrible got it with gold edition
calling microsofti owned a psp for a year
keeping in mind it took buying three to get a functional unit
sony sent me one that way preplayed scratched used and the mud disc drive didnt work as a replacement for the second onetotal bs
the psp also has alot of gameplay issues with freezing small easily accessable easily breakable parts expencive memory cards and basically nothing comming with itplus the lack of games as of late is a real downer
i traded this in stopped my woes and bought a ds so much better and more gamesthis is the unpandorizable motherboard and not a psp it is a psp im glad i asked my friend about his amazon slim pspi returned mine unopenedif you got stuck with this piece of  plastic look into the recent chickhen so that you can at least access homebrewthis is horrible
can not get the game going
other people on internet having the same problem
the company was soo afraid someone may copy the game that they threw in a very subpar protection program from the sony co
go figure
anyway the game will not run and i have tried everything
securom made this program
called and emailed securom several times the true culprit  a branch of sony they never answered the phone and i left messages or emailed me back but got my reply request returned so they did open the email
no wonder the game is being sold for 
i never had a problem that was this bad
dont buy this game
if you get it for a gift  burn itupdate  securom came through  and bent over backwards and fixed all problems we had
it took awhile to respond back to us though
they are nothing like steam  which are lowlife dogsuugh i still cant play this game yetwindows   bit which is probably why it wont work
it doesnt make a desktop folder after downloading the  cds  when i click to play it a message pops up and says an updat is availible for the game i click okthen thq website pops up at the main page
i find my game and there is nothing for iti find another website and download several patches for thisi have to make a folder on the desktop to make this a little easier but everytime i try and open a specific folder it says i  cannot and closes iti will update when i get somme time to trey and fix these issues
for now two stinky thumbs downuugh still nothing so ill just uninstall it from my computer to clear some space o my hard drive and count this purchase as a busti bought this game for cheap and still didnt like it
very dull secure this check point run a gun with out much need for aiming or talent
just dull and not funone of the worst games i have ever attempted to playfrontlines has to be one of the glitchiest most unstable games i have ever played
given that the unreal  engine is typically quite stable i can only assume that the development team used to create this pos was comprised of amateurish blind deaf and dumb baboonsit is no wonder that the game is on permanent sale on steam for but even that is a ripoff
i could have bought myself a beer for that and either way i would have been pissing the money away within an hours timei wasted  on this game and it is the worst game ever
i absolutly hate this game
there is no replay value no good story and terrible graphics
i give this game 
i know you may want this game with all your heart i did to
but it is not worth itthe particular control i ended up with didnt come as pictured but instead was a cast of the original and without the nintendo print on it
this wouldnt bother me if it wasnt much much lighter than the original controller as well as having a unworkable down and up dpad detection
this controller is worse than useless because it works only to get you into the game and frustrate you or your poor friend that you duped into playing on this controllermine wont plug in to my nes control deck either
the connector at the end of the cord that is supposed to plug into the console is too big
unfortunately this is a major problem that renders the product useless
too badit looks nice and the buttons feel sturdy etc
maybe ill hang it on my wall for a decorationfrom now on ill gladly pay a few extra dollars for a refurbished original namebrand product rather that try to save money with one of these cheap generic knockoffs
another lesson learned the hard waybeing a fan of hellboy i was kind of looking forward to hellboy the science of evil
however also being a veteran gamer i wasnt looking all that forward to the game simply because of the terrible history of licensed video games
well i didnt expect too much out of the game but what you get here may even be below your lowest expectations
hellboy the science of evil puts you in the shoes of the title character as you brawl through numerous hordes of baddies and take on the occasional boss
thats it
thats all you do from beginning to end in this game and it gets boring very very quickly
not to mention that the game as a whole is quite short quite easy and features some technical issues that all combine to make the game quite bad
the game features some bland environments and choppy animation and the clipping issues are more distracting than anything else
coop multiplayer is also available where you can play as abe sapien and liz in addition to playing as hellboy but it offers nothing to improve the experience at all
hellboy film stars ron perlman selma blair and doug jones lend their voices to the game but they all sound so bored that they just add nothing
no matter how much of a hellboy fan you may be avoid hellboy the science of evil like the plague
theres no challenge innovation or anything else to even come close to holding your interesti dont know why this item gets good reviews
seems like  of these comments never used a mouse pad in their lifethis thing is flimsy super thin and becomes wavy after a whilea mouse pad needs a certain thickness to keep its shape the other steelseries are actually great this is not this is garbageyoure better off sticking a piece of paper onto your desk with a duck tape than using thiswaste of  spend  and get something decent insteadway to thin
too large not stylishi just got out one of my ol cod pads to be honest with yacontrolling the games is just terrible
there are games that you just dont know how to play it
others are so silly that takes the fun outthe first thing to note about this game is that the camera angles and controls are awful
i didnt try playing it with other people because i am lame and have no friends but playing alone was rediculous and boring
if you are a solo gamer who is a fan of regular viva pinata games i still dont reccommend this
if you have a wii get a mario party game if you want to play something with friends or your kids
if you need a party game for your xbox  get rockband insteadits nice to have a good vintage cars to drive but the game its boring its not a game i would recommendwhat have they done to this game
ive never been a huge racing fan but r ridge racer was one of my all time favorite games
it was just crazy fun
recently i found project gotham  in a used bin and i bought it for 
it ends up that the game was absolutely brilliant
it was just like r only betterso after beating the game i immediately ran out and bought pgr  and also forza  even though forza was a different style racing game
anyway i put in pgr my hands twitching to race at ludicrous speeds once againafter  races i crashed my motorcycle and came in last
no big deal i assured myself
its all about the cars not the bikesi raced three races on easy difficulty with a car i was familiar with from pgri came in last every time
normally not being a big race game fan id have excused my lack of winning as a lack of skill
again not a huge race fanbut i had just annihilated pgr only hours earlierhow different did it have to be the perfect racing game
why even mess with success
i dont know exactly what was tweaked but it was enough to turn what had been a superb racing game into a complete suckfest
after a few more failed attempts at enjoyment i literally threw the game awaygood riddancemaybe i just dont like racing games but i think this game sucks
it came free with a package including a headset the microsoft one that last about a day before becoming a worthless piece of garbage a chatpad a year xboxlive subscription which to me means this game sucks so bad we have to give it away because nobody in their right mind would want to pay money for it
hey im going to take this one to gamestop and unload it for maybe  worth of store credit
brilliant
if youre into suck by all means buy this because its chock full of sucky badnessas many have already described this item is nothing but another nickel and dime attempt by microsoft
this product may do what it advertises but in reality if microsoft designed the hdmi capable xboxs better in the first place than this would not even be needed
i would like to think that it was a simple oversight on microsofts part but come on this is microsoft we are talking about
im willing to bet the poor design of having the hdmi port so close to the standard av port on the back of the console was purposely done in an attempt to get more money out of customers when they the customers realized that they couldnt use their nonhdmi av receiver as a sound source when using an hdmi cable with their microsoft could have easily just sold the extender by itself without forcing people to buy another hdmi cable
besides everyone who bought an elite console already has an hdmi cable that was included with the console not sure about the hdmi enabled pro systems and the fact is if you are even considering this kit in the first place then chances are you already have an hdmi cable as well
yet instead of just offering people what they need microsoft wants to only allow you have the extender portion if you buy their hdmi cable at a premiumif you are looking at this kit then the problem you probably have is that you want to use an hdmi cable in conjunction with your existing av cable perhaps to send the sound to your receiver that does not have hdmi capability
to solve this problem you have three options get ripped off and pay microsoft their ridiculous price for this kit when all you probably really need is the extender portion using a knife or a flat head screwdriver pry the gray portion off of your existing av cable which will give you enough space to use this in conjunction with your hdmi cable
search youtube if you need visuals
done correctly your savings will be  over option  if you are uncomfortable with  go to ebay and find out if anyone is selling the extender portion of this kit separately from the unneeded hdmi cable
you shouldnt have to spend more than a few dollars on it equating to a savings of    over option even if you dont already have an hdmi cable this kit is still a rip off
this is because hdmi cables can be had for a relatively cheap price
but companies like microsoft and monster will attempt to rip you off by lying saying their hdmi cables are so much better than everyone elses
its not uncommon for monsters longer hdmi cable prices to exceed triple digit prices
however the reality is all hdmi cables are basically the same and you wont notice any difference using an overpriced monster or microsoft cable than one that just cost a few bucksthe choice is yours all three options i described will solve your problem but only two are cost effectivethe hdmi av kit includes an hdmi cable which you can find online for about  if you look around and the xbox hdmi av adapter
the reason they sell this kit is because they designed the standard hdav component cable connector to be too big to work in conjunction with an hdmi cable so if you want hdmi video and optical or redwhite rca audio you have to use this adapter to get the audio connections into the xbox s rear portor so they want you to thinkthe truth is that this is just the same connector as the hdav cable component cable but it lacks the video connection and the housing is slightly smaller
no technological wizardry involved
its just a smaller plastic box and thus your hdmi cable will fit next to this in your xbox s connector portyou could spend the money for this if youre not very handy
by all means im sure microsoft needs the moneyor you could take a dremel to a used xbox  hdav component cable cut out some of the extra plastic and use that in conjunction with your hdmi cablei take no responsibility for your clumsiness or if you mess up your xbox  but i can attest to the fact that a cutaway hdav cable works fine for transmitting audio while your hdmi cable transmits videoso the choice is yours  for this thing or use your existing cable the one that came with your xbox  and a dremel and save yourself some cashmicrosoft overpriced crap
lol screw this crap
 star and it deserves it sooooo much
screw this dont bother
wastethis hdmi cable only works with new xbox cause the old ones dont have hdmi connectorthis is not mentioned anywhere in the product description
your console must have hdmi connectorsi defended the  when all the red ring problems were up and about well i shouldnt have
the xbox  has some amazing titles its just a shame the machine that plays them is a piece of garbage
microsoft has really screwed up big time
the original xbox was a classic i love mine
halo  and  dead or alive  etc
the list goes on of amazing titles
and the best thing about the original xboxit worked
you never had to worry and or hope that it would play your games it just did was it was created to do
with the  you have pop in your game cross your fingers and hope for the best
and whats with all the versions core premium elite arcade arcade pro i give up i truly do
i had my  for  months not even a yearand guess what i popped in a game and it froze i restarted and that giant computerized middle finger known as the red of death looked directly at me and mocked my very existenceto conclude i converted back to sony im soon buying a ps now that the price droppedi already own a wii thats a great system as wellmy initial review of the xbox  pro was a few days after i purchased it in november of  since that time i have gone through four or five xbox pro consoles with problems ranging from no video on the screen to the games freezing for no reason at all
in addition to the xbox pros failing i have also had to have two xbox elites replaced or repaired since purchasing my first one in january of   the problem with the elite consoles was that the shoddy dvd drives could fail to read game cds until after    tries of openingclosing the drives
in fact i have just boxed up my nd elite console to send back to microsoft
none of my xbox pros have lasted more than seven months and in terms of my xbox elite it will be my third in less than a yeari can go into every single reason why my xboxs have failed but why bother when you can just as easily go to the multitudes of message boards and read the horror stories of this extremely unreliable console
when i purchased my xbox elite in december of  it started having problems of not always reading game discs two weeks after purchase the only reason i didnt return it to microsoft then was because i knew all they would do is just send me a pos refurb
i dealt the with the problem for several months until finally it started freezing and rroding on me giving me no choice but to return it
now my most recent elite is doing the exact same thing in less than three monthswhat makes things even worse is microsofts customer support is absolutely useless
as with many companies that dont care about customer service their xbox support is somewhere in india and the customer service reps are hard to understand clueless unhelpful and sometimes even downright rude
when i was returning my th or th xbox pro console earlier this year the rep didnt even want to process the return because he claimed that my warranty expired
this was despite the fact that i had purchased an extended warranty plan through microsoft and had the actual print out of the warranty certificate that microsoft sent me
this idiot even tried to tell me that the warranty i purchased for my xbox pro console in november of  was for my xbox elite console which was purchased in january of  not only does it make zero sense that i could even purchase a warranty for an elite console i did not even own at the time the xbox elite console was not even out in 
i had to fight with him for over an half hour before i got the supervisor on the phone who agreed to let me send it back provided i included a copy of the warranty certificate
yet even after all of that the geniuses at microsoft still did not apply my warranty to my console so i had to spend another week straightening that out
with me finally sending a letter to the main corporate office stating that i have an extended warranty and i expect them to honor iti will admit when working i think the microsoft xbox  console oflffers the best in terms of overall game play and features but what good is all of that if the console breaks all the time
i am nearing  years old and i have bought tens of thousands of dollars maybe even more worth of electronic equipment and only once have i had to return something to the manufacturer due to a malfunction
yet in under two years of owning the xbox  i am on my eighth one
this is absolutely unacceptable and microsoft has proven that not only can they not make a reliable console they have also proven that they dont care
even after microsoft spends over  billion to correct the numerous problems with the xbox  console failure rates are still off the charts
heck i cant even get one that lasts a year
i have taken every precaution to ensure i am doing all that i can to help the extremely fragile console function properly but nothing helps
i dont plug it in to a power strip i always lay it horizontal
i ensure it has adequate ventilation but guess what
it still fails
i know for sure that if i dusted off my old  bit nintendo entertainment system super nintendo nintendo  nintendo gamecube or sony playstation the very first one that came out they would still work flawlessly
yet in two years time the amount of xbox  consoles i have gone through is more than the total amount of gaming consoles i have owned in my entire lifeas much as i love playing the multitude of fun games on the xbox  once my warranties have expired and they will no longer fix the console free of charge i am done with microsoft based consoles
if i am unable to fix it myself which i had to do with the first gen xbox then all of my games will be sold or donated
i am not really interested in the ps or gamecube so once my  bites the dust for the last time then its back to pc gaming for mein any case i will never spend another dime on microsofts extremely unreliable pieces of junk that they call the xbox  or any future consoles they plan to make
i urge potential buyers to think long and hard before spending this kind of money on the xbox  if you still insist then i suggest a replacement plan at the place of purchase i dont even recommend getting microsofts service contract as the reps dont even know how to handle that correctlyi have owned my xbox  for a year now and am having a problem with the console cd tray
the tray is stuck and simply will not come out
upon further looking into the problem online and through friends i have learned that  out of every  xbox  consoles will suffer a major problem within a year
the st and most common problem being that the console just scratches up and destroys every cd you insert the nd most common is that the console just shuts down and just dies and lastly my cd tray problem
i suppose i should be somewhat greatful that i have the less damaging of the  problems but all in all whatever problem you may encounter will just result in a  dollar waste of money
microsoft has been very well aware of these problems since the launch of the system over  years ago and has done little to nothing to improve the quality of the system
also lets not forget that the xbox  is the only game console where you have to pay a yearly fee to play online and the only game console that will not allow any business besides their own to make repairs
this means that you will have to pay about  dollars to ship a broken system back to the company and in addition to that a average repair fee of about  dollars so not only are they producing a cheap quality system they may also be profitng from it
just incase you wont take my word on these problems just try googgling it yourselfi bought this last year so the warranty on it was over  year warranty and then i get the  red lights so i decide to open it and try to fix it
it works for about a week and then it crashes again
then microsoft extends their warranty to three years right after i open it voiding the warranty so im stuck with a  paper weight
i had only put like  hours of game time into itit was fun while it lastedim the type of guy that likes to have the latest in technology so naturally i buy this system when it came out for sale but now  broken xbox later i give up this is by far the worst system available today in the market for no so much money more you can buy the playstation  and have no problems at all with this reliable system plus much better quality in games video and audio
forget the xbox and get a playstation  insteadwell were should i start today i went to turn on my xbox  ive only had it for  or  months and today i got the  red rings of death i mean what are these things made of to bad all the good games come for itflimsy manufacturing heavy and bulky
you have to pay for xbox online as opposed to the ps which is free
you dont get hdmi standard on all models or wifi
the only redeeming thing about this console is some games which predated the ps and most of them will be available shortly on the ps bioshock most notablyhalo  was disappointing and there is high failure rate about half of the people i know with one have had hardware issues
also no bluray with this
just save your money on all those extras and get the psi have had  xbox s within the first year of its life and i can tell you these newer models are just as unreliable as the old ones
buyer beware doesnt even cover it this console is by far the worst investment i have made in the last  years
microsofts customer service is terrible and they never send you a new console only used ones that from my expierence have been in terrible condition stains and broken parts of the case
though the real reason you should not buy one is because  of my  were all brand new from the store not used ones from microsoft
some broke in hours some broke in a month either way for the price your paying you deserve a product that works not this junk
i have since sold my  and will be looking elsewhere for my gaming needsi know its not an official nintendo controller but i at least thought it would work properly
both analog sticks cavein easilythis is a horrible controller the top left joy stick in broken and i have been very gentle with it
since the actual nintendo brand cost too much i am just going to get the  pack to save money
so disappointed with iti got this item because it was very cheap and looked exactly like the original game cube controller
i thought well even though it is a rd party controller it is still brand new cheap and is identical to the original
im sure itll last a few years
boy was i wrong
i seriously played with this thing for no joke less than  hours of game play
it was good while it lasted but once my character started running in only one direction i knew i wasted my money
i tried setting it down and picking it up an hour later just to make sure it was completely done with
turns out my character started running in the other direction opposite from where he was originally running
its a piece of junk
and i originally thought that maybe some people were just rough with their controller and thats why it got some bad reviews but no
i am very gentle with all my stuff and it broke alreadyi should also mention that this rd party controller is not as comfortable as the official controller because you need to press some of the buttons harder than others to get a responselisten to the one star reviews everyone
save your money and buy the official game cube controllers that say nintendo on the front of them
at least they will last for a few years and the buttons and analog stick respond betterthe controller looks and feels authentic and it worked for around a weekafter a week the cstick got stuck
now my wii wont even detect the controllerwhen i got my refurbished gamecube at gamestop i also bought this controller
right out of the box it was stiff and hard to operate
a few weeks later i spent some hard earned cash and rented super mario sunshine for the weekend
the joystick stopped working about halfway through the game
i tried to keep playing mario sunshine i could only keep it for  days so i was determined to get as much as i could out of it but i soon realized playing the game was hopeless without a functional joystick
i grabbed a screwdriver and opened the controller and got the most shocking experience ever
as i opened the controller gray plastic powder spilled all over my desk
i had to spend a whole hour cleaning joystick off of my desk
i went to the store and bought another cirka controller a few days later thinking that the broken one was a defect
it worked well for the first week but then the padding on the joystick came off and left me with a sharp point to use
i am never buying another cirka product again
i will be buying the original controller and using the cirka models for spare partsi absolutely loved this game when i first got it but i have had to reinstall it at least  times
for some reason it develops glitches and locks up my computerinitially i thought that the problem was with my computer but i now suspect that it is only this game that is the source of the shutdowns when i am playing it
i have currently uninstalled chuzzle from my computer again and for  weeks my problems have not returnedi bought this game from best buy about  months ago
they will not replace it because it is past their warranty period
i wish that i had known sooner that it was this game that was causing my problems i would have saved money on computer servicewhen i read the review of this game that stated if you liked the game and then there were none you would love this game i decided to give it a try
i really enjoyed and then there were none
i did not like murder on the orient express but what the heck  there have been other games that i have not enjoyed
evil under the sun drove me nuts
the main character hercule poirot had this stupid shuffle walk that i found extremely irritating
also i dont like a lot of dialogue and there is way too much for me in this game
i finally took it out of my computer put it back in its box and on the shelfso i give this game  a starthe third adventure company game based on an agatha christie novel evil under the sun is disappointing evidence that this series  never great to begin with  is actually getting worse over timepuzzles are few and far between and nearly all of them are simple inventory puzzles
as with the previous games you just pick up anything the game will allow you to take and tote it around ridiculously until you eventually have need of it
in a couple of cases the game even gives you detailed instructions for how to solve a puzzle
if you think that following instructions complete with diagrams is a lot of fun well this is the game for youotherwise you can just sit back and watch poirot walk around
there is no way to fasttravel between locations so much of your time will be spent walking
hopefully youll find that very entertaining because the pace of this game is astonishingly slow
the game is composed of eight chapters and the murder doesnt even occur until chapter five
until then most of the action comes from two new storylines created for the game a fifth columnist hunt the game takes place during wwii and a plot about a glowing green ghost that even scooby doo would find silly
and dont even think about skipping any dialogue  if you dont painstakingly work your way through the dialogue tree youre likely to get stuckbut far and away my biggest gripe with this game is the new ending
do not be fooled by this  the murderer is the same as in the novel
apparently the new part comes from the um action scene that follows in cut scene of course because heaven forbid the player have to do anything during the climax of the game
the new ending doesnt even make much sense really but i was so happy to see the game end that i wont nitpickbottom line this game is a joyless plodding exercise that never would have been made if not for the christie name
read the book instead
if youre looking for a good detective game check out the nancy drew series
honestly you could just watch paint dry and it would still be more fun than this gameim sure this game would be very enjoyable if the game company was not so selfish and money hungry that they wouldnt do something to protect their good name
the other two games were fantastic and this problem with the white screen is so infuriating im tempted to let them know that many people will never trust them to make a good game ever again
i probably would do it if i felt eloquent enough
i would love to be able to ply this gme i bought and paid for
if only they would make a patch im sure it would take very little resorces and would result in very many satisfied customersi always order games for nintendo ds
i recieved a list of games id like
i checked  they were for pc
the next day i got more of games you like
i checked  some were for nintendo
i ordered another game  this one i checked  times before ordering
i swear it said nintendo so i ordered it
when i recieved it it was for pc so i returned it lost postage  handling  never played the gamei thought id enjoy this game
the initial opening where i was a baby with perfect cognitive skills was different and i like me a storybased game
the very first segment that ends with you escaping from the underground bunker was the highlight of my five hours with the gamei saw warning signs
the gameplay mechanics were so unapologetically oblivionbased it wasnt funny
i also hate that game so not a good start  i shrugged this off hoping the future would present itself once i got to hop and bop across the worldspeaking of the world its fugly
i mean its the kind of jagged landscape you expect in an early xbox game
if youre on a hill and looking out the scenery can be quite beautiful
but since you are usually trudging along and looking at the same dirtconcretemetal patterns for hours at a timethe amount of customization and skillbuilding is impressive i must admit that
and even though it is just oblivion with a coat of futuristic paint the extent of your characters abilities is pretty much limited by your imaginationbut like that other ugly slasher game this one is a chore to reach levels of adequate carnage
prepare to swat mutant bees and clear out hoboinfested house husks for a while gathering the occasional bottle caps baseball bats heck if youre lucky you might find a gun with half a clip of ammo left
this experience is at least humorous for a while as the character animations are laughably mannequin in nature
it brought back memories of goldeneye  and the iron rodway james bond would move with his gunyoull notice i havent said much more about the story
lets start
with everything else about this game going to hell the only motivational factor left was to find my dad and continue what sounds like a pretty good adventure setup
the voiceovers are usually well done there are some cheese moments but what really kills the mood is the wooden characters
sure their faces show a semblance of emotion but they all stand ramrod straight staring directly into your soul
this was creepy especially with large chunks of the game missing music or even background ambiancenothing gave me any indication that forward progress would bring happinessso i have laid out my irks in what i hope comes off as reasonable
im not bashing the game because soandso is better or because it was too difficult and i didnt bother to master the controls not much to master anyways with  being a previous game
this is a d actionrpg and it appears to be the console standard
but until the basics of the game are fixed youll find me happily mfing in diablo  until something better comes alongbethseda took the fallout series and bent it over
the endings are garbage
it has  endings they are merely a different picture
not like the original fallouts where it would tell you what effect your actions would have on the wasteland
the main story is a little tacky and short
you can skip most of it and jump to the middle of the story line which makes it evem shorter
bottom line save your money for a game that has not been molestedwell time for yet another review first before i hammer this product i want to say to the many people that emailed me about new vegas  and personally attacked me by insults about my intelligence  age or otherwise
so lets clear this up first
one  im a retired iraq war veteran with  years of service in and yes i have a hs grad and going to collage on my well earned gi bill  two im  and have been playing video games since the s so it kinda makes me a expert on the subjectnow failout  is at best a original idea great concept and story on the bad side  s of glitches i had to restart my ps so many times to get the screen to unfreeze that i had to send it back to get the onoff switch replaced
number of game mags said a few bugs  a few which means more than  turned out to be manysome of them lied about searching thou the game for  hours its false  at  hours on a profile the glitches get worse and worse after  or so months of playing a single profile i was  mega bite and took  minutes to load up  then it would freeze i had almost  hours on it just to see about this  hour life the only way it could happen is to have it sit for  hours not movingthe game overall is crap waste of good money if you bought it new and all the later add ons just add to the problem  the only add on that went pretty smoothly was point lookout and that is the only oneso before you company flag wavers and hired guns that watch out for the products progress on popularity began to attack my email take a long hard look on youtube on the dozens of people posting proof of these claims before you try to attack me
so put out a quality product and play test first and not with your collage liberal playtesters that work for the company get impartial play testerswow i wasnt really expecting this to happen picked up the tin box special edition from my local gamestop ran home to install and get things goingfirst few mintues were an immediate disbelief that i may have wasted  on the special edition though the goodies that came with the special edition are kinda neatthe graphics immediately looked subpar the voice acting was shabby and the gameplay was just god awfuli said no biggie cant wait to get into the wastelandsafter what seemed like a  minute waste of time and a really poor intro i finally made it out of vault i looked expecting a breath taking surreal postnuclear war enviornment in brillant detaili was so horribly wrongwhile the character models are strong the rest of the environment looked a tad bit less graphical than stalker
and stalker graphics werent even that impressiveand on top of it all after attempting to adjust to the control scheme it just felt lost and kinda spread out all over in all sorts of annoying and inconvienent menuseven vat was pretty pathetic and doesnt add much interest into a game that as if it was a familiuar feeling of something ive allready played in chernobyl with less than average animations graphics story etci dont understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong with this game
more importantly i have no idea how this game is getting the reviews its gained other than maybe the magazines were just desperate for some underthetable payoffyour money would be far better spent on farcry  dead space or stalker clear sky at this pointand this was playing it on a ultrahigh end gaming rigim sorry folks and im more sorry to the folks who bought this just like me
if youve picked it up do your self a good justice and just return it if the seal has not been brokennot even a full  hours into this game and it will become a  coasteri was really looking forward to this game man what a bummer
now i know im in the minority here but its my take on this game and here it goeswell so far ive put in at least  hours hours of agonizing bordom
i just dont get what all the hype is about
its almost as if you have to like this game or youre not cool by the way people talk about it
guess im not cool i freakin hate this gamei actually restarted the game to go ith my lowered my expectations and see if i could bare through it
no gothe pace is so sllooww my god people how the hell can you deal with this
i would much rather read a good book than play this its far more exciting and stimulatingthe graphics are just soso nothing great here
the animations pretty much blow pretty clunky to say the least
ai isnt the greatest either
and its so wordy like i said if im gonna spend hours reading i would rather read a bookmaybe im just spoiled when it comes to rpgs having an uber gaming computer and having played some pretty amazing rpgsthe break down of this game is as follows talking traveling actionpicking up trashim so glad i got it used i would really be ticked if i wasted  on thisyouve been warnedthis game is not a great rpg in fact it is a barely playable rpg
there are no consequences to any of the player actions because everything you do is very easily reversed often in the most obtuse way possible ie
when you first leave the vault a box pops up asking you if you wanted to change anything in your childhood
it is however a massive sandbox rpg with tons of repetitive inconsequential errands but even at this it fails by forcing the player down cattlerun paths using more glass walls than i have ever seen
there is an entire city where even the most evil player can not kill a single person there are main story quests that offer zero alternatives for completion and when choices are made they are always super dumbed down black or white right or wrong choices ie
the complete opposite of the fallout  hallmark grey area moral decisions
it has fewer death animations than in fallout  which get very boring very quickly yet their is no way to turn off the idiotic slowmo kills
dont waste your time or money on this one your better off with either fallout  or agree with the reviewer
bought this game at a discount
played for a few hours in the bunker
didnt get out 
tedious
ok in twenty plus years of playing video games i have never not been able to enter a gameso i guess its not me but rather this pathetic game this is what happens here you have to punch guys which are poorly animated and they clobber you with clubs all the while you search for exits all of which are locked mainly
exciting
what a trainwreck of a game 
only reason i continued was to get out and see world
but i heard thats just more of a tedious chore so why bother
if the developers of this game think this is even remotely fun than they simply are that out of touch with the gaming masses  and not just video game lunatics with no life who can spend weeks playing this tedious game what kind of a sicko makes a game like this 
and worse yet how can people even praise this game 
also the game i heard crashes constantly 
avoid at all costs a colossal waste of time just to figure out the designers of this twisted logic into thining that gamers would enjoy in any way whatsoever a sickening quest to find maddening secret ways to fight off roaches and horridly animated almost pixated looking stick soldiers
all in a blurry opening bunker that takes perhaps hours to get out ofi threw this in thrash didnt even bother returning
put in borderlands  than played some resistance  mutiplay and some unchartered now those games are actually a blast and fun
not this horror 
update  broke out of bunker  took out of trash for one last go around broke out of bunker  real exiting  not was still a mess getting out and having  s video games type conversations with everyone
how is that fun 
also stopping at every last locker and place to get items
again how is that fun
pathetic game  avoid and get something fun instead and not a chore to play as this game isthe game itself is fun but the studio who released it full of constant and endless glitches that cause the game to continually freeze are scumi like the actual game but i am going to take my disc and save it for the day i meet one of the studio execs and shove it down their throat
it freezes about every  minutes
and i have two new and one old xbox  and it does it on all of them
there was a download patch a couple days ago and it did squat
every time you go to any of many many many many different areas it will freeze your entire system and you need to rebootthe graphics were horrible
this game was so hyped up and has not even met your grandpas standards
i was so looking forward to this game and when i got home to play it i realized that i got screwed with no vaseline
it was a total waste of money
i am sticking with oblivion
the voices in the game are shady the graphics are second to third rate
game play is slow and no i am not even close to being overencumbered
i have had it crash about twice in every  hours
even though i had to lower my standards to finish this piece of crap game i found the worst part of this game the ending
it was a joke
i thought fable  sucked no this was beyond a joke
my game catches
when im walking it catches every  meters or so depending on my location
so im walking along fine then a pause then walking then a pause
it really sucks
you have no source for revenue other than killing the random enemy
all and all i would say this game could very well be the worst game of the year
def the most disappointing game of the decadethis game does not work on the pc
i guess my quad   gig ram gt video wasnt enough for this game
this game was sold by bethesda with no workable patch
this game crashes from the very start and cannot be played with any consistancy
its basically worthless
thankfully i got it new on ebay for  bucks so my exposure is limited
for what its worth the landscape in this game is truly amazing the best i have ever seen
the story line is very good and the graphics incredible
i had to play this game in god mode just to get any minimal play out of this before a crash occurred
if you can get this for free and have a high tolerance for frustration try it
but by all means dont buy itim an rpgamer from way back the early ultimas and loved fallout and fallout  ive been waiting years for fallout got it today and played for a few hours and i am hugely disappointedthough the box says that the game plays in first and thirdperson perspectives it actually uses pretty much the same perspective as mass effect and i hated thatyes theres a thirdperson perspective but its not the typical isometric view its a basic overtheshoulder view that can only be adjusted for longer view distance if you use a mouse with a scroll wheel
if you use a trackball or other mouse youre out of luck
its as if youre standing right next to the pc shouldertoshoulder
it may as well just be a firstperson viewive always hated shooters and even though theres dialogue and story line and all of that here i just hate the firstperson view i cant tell whats going on in the area
further without the traditional isometric view of previous fallouts i find it difficult to navigate the areas
the pipboy mapping systems okay but not great and i cant get a large enough perspective on the areas to determine where i am with reliable accuracyfurther fallout  seems to be following a trend of tailoring pcbased games to follow the playstationxbox design of being keybased in operation as opposed to mousebased to get your pc to move or perform actions you have to use keys
i find this incredibly slow and awkwardill play it a bit more while i wait for the storm of zehir expansion to neverwinter nights  and if things improve ill edit this review but im not hopefulcaveat emptorupdate  update  updateive now played the game for about  hours and have some further observationsif one strays from the main quest the shooter aspect of the game becomes even more pronounced
side quests are very linear of the go fetch variety and involve very heavy combat and almost nothing elseeven the main quest is very simplified compared to earlier fallouts with none of the sublety and moral complexities in the decisionmaking process involving the pc that i found enjoyable in the previous versions
conversations with npcs are basic and linearthe local map feature on the pipboy is virtually useless
i cant make heads nor tails of the information displayed as its pretty much just a jumble of meaningless symbols unless youre in a very simple area like a tunnela lot of combat not much roleplaying at allat first i couldnt enjoy this game for more than  mina becasue of its constant frequent crashing
i updated the drivers from my geforce nvidia  video card in my dell xps junk and now all is well
the game itself is wonderful but a little pain to get going with the games for windows live application
amazing graphics like oblivion great quests lots of open world areas to explore amazing atomsphere and landscape for post apoc
another great idea by bethesda
they went a step further with the gore and the slow motion vs shots are to die for literally
as i stated the game itself s good but its a very broken mess of a game
there are so many script graphics and sound problems with this game that makes it virtually unplayable
this game needs a lot more work to actually finish it and iron out the endless problemsthis software was a download and i will never download a game again
i was not able to pass the game to my son since it was a gift to him
with all its copyright protections and working with steam and the internet was a nightmare
i am sure others had great reports but i would contact bethseda and they would say its steam
my son bought another game and left this behind
i got tired of excuses and gave upi dont care if it just plays with itself
the securrom system is installed on your computer and remains there unless manually removed using special microsoft toolkits
just because it is acting benign today does not mean a more detructive behavior cannot be triggered at any time
boycott all software with any securrom involvement
that will be the only way we the consumers will be able to influence companies not to use this stuff
i was also looking forward to fo
no morei bought this for my husband for christmas at his suggestion and wish i hadnt
what a huge waste of good moneyhe installed the game just fine went online to register it and then could not play it
when he tries to launch the game it simply takes him back to the desktophe has a brand new computer as of last year with a nvidia geforce video card that is up to the game specs
he also has g of ram so i think the computer he is using should be gold for playing this gameah well in a couple of years on an even newer computer maybe he will get to play it eventually
meanwhile what a waste of his time and my moneywill all due respect to trip this game does contain securom
it only uses it to do a disk check but it contains it never the less
securrom is malware
the only way to stop this insanity is to just stop buying games from companies that force installations of malware on your computernot really all that great and worst of all securom on the drm which they said they wouldnt use
cant trust anyone these days anymorefirst this review is slanted because for some reason i thought fallout was a fpf
well it is not
its a role playing game
i hate rpgs
but it is so boring i couldnt play it more than an hour
the graphics sucks
the characters movement is like a puppet on a string
the limited action is zzzzzzzzz
you have to shoot someone  times before they croak
you have to look in every nook and cranny to find things
and then mostly all you get are empty boxes or a cup or a coffee pot
you have to talk to everybody in order to find out whats going on and where you need to go to finish challenges
the conversations are zzzzzzzzz and inane
if you like that kind of thing knock youself out
just warning the people who like good graphics and action
i had the original fallout and i though it sucked
i thought this was going to be better
same thing slightly better graphics
but just as lamefirst off i wont review the game based on securom
live with it people
because securom sucks doesnt allways mean the game sucks
and thats what your here to review
if you want to cry about securom send them an emailwow i wasnt really expecting this to happen picked up the tin box special edition from my local gamestop ran home to install and get things goingfirst few mintues were an immediate disbelief that i may have wasted  on the special edition though the goodies that came with the special edition are kinda neatthe graphics immediately looked subpar the voice acting was shabby and the gameplay was just god awfuli said no biggie cant wait to get into the wastelandsafter what seemed like a  minute waste of time and a really poor intro i finally made it out of vault i looked expecting a breath taking surreal postnuclear war enviornment in brillant detaili was so horribly wrongwhile the character models are strong the rest of the environment looked a tad bit less graphical than stalker
and stalker graphics werent even that impressiveand on top of it all after attempting to adjust to the control scheme it just felt lost and kinda spread out all over in all sorts of annoying and inconvienent menuseven vat was pretty pathetic and doesnt add much interest into a game that as if it was a familiuar feeling of something ive allready played in chernobyl with less than average animations graphics story etcanother problem the game has is that it cant quite seem to choose what it wants to be a st person shooter rd person shooter or a rpg
while the idea of the mix is intriguing it just doesnt work out well in the game and is poorly implementedi dont understand how things could have gone so horribly wrong with this game
more importantly i have no idea how this game is getting the reviews its gained other than maybe the magazines were just desperate for some underthetable payoffyour money would be far better spent on farcry  dead space or stalker clear sky at this pointand this was playing it on a ultrahigh end gaming rigim sorry folks and im more sorry to the folks who bought this just like me

even a little securom is still securom
hopefully this will come to stardock impulse
returning my copythis game has alot of potential
it is astounding that a company uses securom at all
it messes with your computer crashes good programs that had nothing wrong with them before screws the good guys that pay for it when the pirates are still hacking it anyway and limits the amount of installations
i was unaware of securom being on this game at all before i bought it
i think bethesda should refund the money of those that were tricked to buy this game with a potentially dangerous rootkit embeded in it or create a patch and quick to remove this horrible program
like i said the game is excellent if i could play for more than  mins
at a time without a crashalright let me start off by saying im happy i didnt buy fallout  used a friend of mines copylike others have said you have less fun and have less options in f compared to fthats soooooooooooooooo bleeping stupid
man
its painful how bad the dialog in the game is
i was rarely excited outside combatthere are ways to install the game without the drm i found directions through google
but still wtf
they dont sell it they license it
with that license you pay a tax an impeding spy on your own computerso it went from a fun and dirty game to a poisonous stunted impostormy favorite point of the game was went i went into vatsthe bullet time mode that slows down time for tactical shots
just so i can see the enemy run behind a wall in slow motion
what the 
i could have done better if i didnt use this time slowing tactical firing mode thingjeeze man and the  dialog and the way your character looks in rd person slides across the ground it looks weirddont you game builders think about this
falling asleep at the wheel you zombiesoh
and the walking
most of the time it didnt feel like exploring it just feel like traveling to a destination
i was never really free to go explore i pull up the map and there is something tugging methe map sucked by the way easily the worst in game area map i can recall
my gps works better and this guy lives in the future manthe main quest was lacking i killed a bunch of slavers for children
how could wood hold me back
i have a rocket launcherstoryline is pitiful some made for tv movie on the scifi channel kind of ploti was entertained sometimes but usually the text was so dull
soooo dull
option  option  option  and the are all full of suckwritten by the same guys who do made for tv movies man
i swearmost of the modern game industry is just blaaahokay not all of it but most of the games i play i end up seriously regret purchasingthe worst is it could be so so so so so much better
the technology is available
you have the potentialwe the gamer community crave for moreyou have more  star ratings than  star
change your wayswe dont want rehash of your other games
be original be innovativewhatever its just a gamei wont deny this
i have waited almost  years for this sequel and to say i didnt have some expectations is an understatementhow can i express myself sincerely without trying to be pretentious or destructive other than to say fallout  is the most disappointing rebirth since star warsfallout  abandons everything that made the original  and  cult classics
the new gaming company bethesda that took this project failed in almost every way
and it all came down to one denominator bethesda thinks its audience is dumbthe algorithmic nature of the original rpg combat system is ultimately replaced with a first person shooting interface
to make this worse its a clunky unresponsive and rigid first person shooter
almost unplayable if you are used to the fluidity of games like call of duty crysis halflifeas a gimmick alternative to appease old fans a new vast system is optional which allows you to freeze and select the next course of actionfirslty pointless because it resumes to normal fps shooting following its execution and secondly why really bother
what is the point of the statistical nature of this game if you can just point and shootthe once brilliant dark humor is absolutely absent in fallout s dialogue and general environment
this makes a major part of the gaming interaction laborious and trickles down to create stale side quests
i always believed fallout was part comedy a colorful reflection on the nuances of our society albeit a parallel one
it shaped the games memorable art concept
what bethesda have contrived is a generic post apocalyptic world plain and gritty much like the games new personalitythe graphics itself has been completely overated
as i look onto the desolate landscapes i am totally shocked by what others have applauded
the water lighting and motion effects are grainy and lifeless
just look at the sky
it looks bit
the games graphic engine predates all of this years fps releases
i run a x card on ultimate high settingsthe very hyped consequential nature of its gameplay is merely a two option approach made out to be something more
you either do the good thing or the bad thing
this is mindblowing for people who are used to the linearity of games like half life etc
but its an insult to the expansive experience of the prequels before itultimtaley war apparently changes
the combat the nature the atmosphere the experience
it all changes
and it changes for the worse
it changes for the sake of appealing to a wider dumber audience
the once intricate witty and absorbing experience is watered down for plug n play gamersi have been a huge fan of the fallout series since the very beginning
i played wastelandthe granddaddy of fallouton my commodore  back in the late s
i was so hooked on that game i would overheat my external power supply for my c
i ended up buying three power supplies so i could swap them out when they got too hotso i was seriously pumped when fallout  came outuntil i discovered it was going to be just another firstperson shooter fps
every  game that comes out these days if a freakin fps so they have to take the best turnbased rpg ever and turn it into a freakin shooter as welli am one of those many lucky folks who gets motionsick instantly when playing a fps
it is torture
i have a killer computer and monitor plenty of time and the money to buy any game i want but i cant play  of the games out there because noone makes anything but firstperson shooters
but this was fallout for cryin out loud so i plunked down my  and eagerly loaded the game on my computer
and gotsickashell
draminine should buy advertising space in fallout because this game ranks up there with the original doom in its ability to induce dizziness and nausea very quicklyevery few days i go back and try the game again because i love fallout so much and i get sick again
when will these idiot video game companies realize there are many different types of gamers with many different interests and invest money in other kinds of video gamesfirst the game worked on my old computer for a few months then the game crashed and so did the entire computer
it was only a year old and the computer is now worthless
sospending  bucks on a new computer with specs beyond compare i try fallout  again and it wont even start from the menu
says fallout  has stopped working  after three weeks trying everything with a bethseda technician ive given up
dont waste your money on this crap
ive read a ton of forums from bethsedas site and this game is prone to crash at every turn
it was a great idea story and gameplaybut a technological terrorwhat made the original fallout so goodit was the nonlinear gameplay the tactical turnbased combat the game setting and of course macgyveri loved the original fallout
i bought that game the day it came out and i played the hell out of it
does fallout  live up to the fallout name
does an original fan think its a worthy addition
read on to find outthere was only one thing the first fallout set out to do
fallout wanted to be the role playing game that let you do what you want let you go where you want let you kill who you want
role playing games before this never had this sense about them all their stories were linear and were already set for you
there wouldnt be all these role playing games today that gave you choices if it wasnt for fallout
it was the first game to put it into the mainstreamfallout  does a good job of letting you do what you want
you are allowed to be good or evil killing the dog or saving the dogremember that original fallout fans
however the dialogues in the game are unintelligent and leave you wondering if they tried hard to copy the first games conversations or if they just grabbed a student from the local college to do them
either way they did a bad job with dialogues
when you role play in a game and you get dialogue options effort should be done so the options vary in being evil or good so you dont sound like the opposite of what you are and most importantly so you dont sound like an idiot
speaking of which the dialogues in the original fallout actually had idiot dialogue options in fallout  every option is an idiot option even if your intelligence is set at  dialogue is dumbed downthe tactical combat from the first fallout was almost perfect
what fallout  does is not improve on the tactical side of combat it ruins combat instead
they changed turnbased combat into a realtime clickaffair
all you do in combat is click the left mouse button as fast as you can to shoot your weapons at the enemies
in combat you also get to use vats which lets you pause in realtime to choose specific body parts to target
but its totally pointless
there is no reason to use vats as it offers nothing nothing tactical nothing
i have played  hours into the game so faron hard setting and i have yet to use vats once
if you want to cheat use vats because all vats does is let you cheat
fallout fans want to be challenged with tactical combat not play a casual combat clickfest
combat is dumbed downthey did manage to get the atmosphere down to a point
its really not hard to make something look apocalyptical but to make it look right is harder to achieve
one thing in the game that youll notice is that they use lots of gore
fallout was never about gore but seems the makers of fallout  didnt get that
you find loads of chopped up bodies all over the place as if the level designers thought it looked cool to have rooms filled with  chopped up bodies all around
gore is upped up which means its been dumbed down because too much gore means you arent trying hard enough with actual content
you go for the shock factor not the content factor
the game is more like postal  than it is like fallout  they did get the s jibe down really well and i love that part of the game
kudos to them for keeping that partthe story in the game as a whole isnt bad at all i just wish it was written better
i loved discovering other real vaults in fallout and you get to do that in fallout  as well
the main campaign is pretty short but so was fallouts
in fallout you could beat the game within  minutes cant do it that fast in fallout  but its still short in its own right
theres plenty of side quests to do just like in the original fallout
the side quests can be long to complete having you run around talking to several people and going to several places before you are able to complete it but the side quests havent been that challengingmaybe because combat is too easy
or is it because they have arrows that point you to where everything is
in conclusionfallout  is like an open sandbox rpg
it lacks the depth of the originals and it appeals to the casual audience of today
it is not a traditional crpg like fallout it is a console rpg ported to the pc
it lacks what a good port should with bad controls and a bad interfacethe game needs patching
the game crashes constantly on me
i get a lot of slowdowns after a few moment of play when the game starts its perfectly smooth
the game has many software problems the developers need to fixoverall the game is fun and as an original fallout fan i see it as a good spin off set in the fallout universe
i do recommend it to fans of the original as long as they know they arent going to experience what fallout gave them
theres some nostalgia to be had here with familiar characters you meet and things you hear but its not the crpg you loveone last note
they also changed the name of the guns in the game
if you needed any proof of the dumbing down of the game even without all the other stuff just look at the names
dumbing down weapons names to appeal to todays lazy casual audience
i just have to say give me a breakthere has been several fallout clones over the years that try to copy the original they never turned out so good but lets hope someone does a good one someday soonisnt compatible with windows  played it b on xbox and it was fun would recommend the game of the year edition but not the originalhere is no enjoyment out of this game at all
the controls and charactors are unresponsive most of the time
all the way through the game you are under stupid amounts of gun fire from all directions and on top of that you are responsible for the lives of other charactors that take ball breaking to another level when they get in your way and end up getting shot
this game is ridiculously frustrating and i guarantee that there isnt a single person out there who hasnt took at least  tries to overcome one certain stupid mission on this game
im not saying that games should be easy but when you fail a mission over and over again because of unresponsive controls and charactors that lack enough common sense to stay out of a bullets way it really takes the fun out of the gamewhere to begin
the story is cliche and im frankly too old to find entertainment in mowing down waves of police officers
that aside the control scheme is ridiculously cumbersome the environments oversimplified and blocky the characters unsympathetic and the weapons are way underpowered
please learn from my mistakes and avoid this gamei was really excited when i first heard about this game
it was made by the guys over at ioi hitman series and they have never let me down 
until now
the trailers and hype make it seem like this is a highbudget game but the actual gameplay comes out incredibly shortthe sounds and environment are bland so there is really no sense of urgency or intensity
the cutscenes are choppy and lackluster and they dont add to the actionmovie style that this game could have achievedthe graphics are incredibly poor for a game of its time
i shot a window and it cracked
the next time i shot it the entire window just disappeared
and this wasnt because of a glitch the animation is just that underdeveloped
when i died my teammates came up and their big blocky arms went through me when they adminsitered the adrenaline shot
this game really looks like an early ps game at best 
the gameplay is the most underdeveloed part of the game
hit detection sucks and even though it claims to have a coversystem it also sucks
in fact there is no cover button even
walk up to a wall and jiggle the joystick around and hope that your character will eventually take cover
it really is annoying
your character constantly pops in and out of cover whether you want him to or notstay away from this game
i really wanted to like it but i had to return it after about an hour and a half of play
with game prices as high as they are youd expect to have some halfdecent quality delivered
kane  lynch fails
if you really have to play this game rent it and youll be happy you read this reviewthis game had everything going for it a quality developer a quality storyline and very capable nextgen systems to support it
however laziness and greed on the developers part totally ruined everything this game could have beennot much more to say about it
controls are horrible graphics are absolutely abysmal gameplay sucks and is so generic there are very few weapons and they are all really bad but at least the story was cool for maybe  of the  missions i played
the rest was so stupid and pointless and i will never again play this garbage
i actually broke the disc into a million pieces because thats how horrible it was
dont waste your time with this garbage
oh did i mention it is garbagethe poor controls are just slightly better than the frustrating number of bugs poor graphics and sloppy storytelling
worth a rental just to see how bad xbox games can really get but not worth any more than thatkane and lynch dead men is an ugly ugly game and im not just talking about the graphics
totally stinks
probably the worst game ever madelike a schmuk i thought that going to vista with my new hop dy would mean a happy gaming experience with my newish gforce gts with mb of ram my numerous cores of intelligence my  gig of ram yes the kinfunts at hp sold me  when the os can only see  law suit anyone  
any way once again the for windows slogo on the box persuaded me to buy the game only to find after dicking about for a whole evening that the window they refer to is throw this crap out of the window in anger no hope of making it run on vistaavoid this game
i even tried to run it on my lame old xp sp machine with a decent enough ati card and it failed to functioni also downloaded all the newest nvidia drivers
after the first install failed it would not complete i removed k and l and reinstalled the drivers faced numerous system hangups thanks eidos you are the next best thing to a virus you  lame frigersi knew this game wasnt going to work
i just knew it
but steam had a deal for  to get this
so a friend and myself picked it up and prepared for a headache
the pc version of this game just doesnt work
nothing i tried helped
reinstalled the game
nothingim running windows  and windows xp so i figured one of those os would run it
nope
i think i got to the second level before the game crashed right after the movies
its the most buggy thing ive ever seen and ive played some really buggy gamesi cant recommend it for anything even a 
the way you have to play is basically rush through the levels and hope you dont crash before you hit the end of the level
if you do you have to start the entire level over since you cant save when you want
i cant even load the game without getting angryseriously this is why gaming is falling down hill garbage like this
this is the only industry that gets away with flat out ripping people off
we need a lemon law for games like we do for carsi was looking forward to playing this game but it was completely defective and did not work for me at all
i was only able to get past the opening page and intro video a couple times and into the first  minutes or so and the game would constantly crash to my desktop
most all the other times  the game would not even start up but instantly crash due to the kaneandlynchexe file failing and being corrupt
i even tried other workarounds but the results were the same  nothing but crash to desktopi really should have checked the games forums first which i recommend to potential buyers
in these forums you can see that this has been a major problem for many owners since it came out in   no patch has been made to correct this to date
this is a major fail
purchase at your own risk  maybe you might be fortunate enough to get it to workat this point i cannot give a recommendation for this game  sorrythis game is actually pretty terrible on windows
it is more fun on the xbox but definitely not on windows
this game is a port which means it was designed to run on a console but was tweaked to make it run on a pc
this is almost never a good thing to do
this time it is down right horriblethe graphics are outdated the camera angles are terrible you have to survive between save spots which the game does automatically for you the gun fights are the same thing over and over
very repetitive and so obvious you can predict the attacks every time
not to be mean but i think the other reviewers here must have been under  years old because only someone so young could still be satisfied by a game this lamethe voice acting is forced the story line is good but who cares about story lines
if you are going to pay  do you really want a story line or do you want a good fps
the game play is not as smooth as it should be
you cling to walls when you dont want to fight the camera to get good shooting angles your teammates get in the way constantly or the shoot you apart and at times they cannot hit the broad side of a ware house
it is not easy to control your men or position them either
this requires some complicated keyboard combos that are not easy when you are getting pounded by some ridiculously accurate at times bad guys
bad cut scenes that some times you cannot skip past
uggghhbad game playbad voice actingbad out dated graphicsbad camera anglesbad keystroke combosbad bugs that cause the story to halt at timesbadbadbadnot worth  in the discount bin
dont bother with this until it is less than 
why blow  on this when cod  crysis ut  time shift and many others are out there that will definitely provide much more entertainment for you and higher replay valueok my last review may have been too straight forwardbut the map is hard to understandthe handgun makes no difference then the batonand dont get excited when achieving the shotgunstill not much differenceno story linejust wake and roam aroundboring monsters
ughthis game was not what i was expecting
it is in the first person
if i were you i would not buy this gameim a girl who is into beautiful graphics
this one just did not thrill mei want to kindly thank you for your sending this game in a timely fashionbut i just was not thrilled the graphics were too flatand i had too many corridors to deal withi should have chosen betterpretty pitiful
it plays like an old text based game that just so happens to have graphics
slow gameplay weak battle mechanics and that really lame old dd first person dungeon style maneuveringreally
just dont bother with this one at allim a big fan of rpg and have no qualms with most rpg on ps but this game just doesnt deliverthe story is intriguing at first but after  hours of playing the story had still not developedthe gameplay is very unispired a few abilities an autolock on system and spam away
dreadfulthe graphics are rather bad the art style is ok in some parts but you can see different designers worked on different parts of the game and it all looks a bit thrown together cutscenes there storytelling there plain text thereits like  different teams worked on this game and none really know how to get the potential out of the pssome people say this game is underrated
hardly its rated low because for a full priced disc based game its low qualityi gave up after a couple of hours of playingthis game has a nice style to it and its different
however its the only ps game that i did not finish even though i was very close to the end
the gameplay rapidly becomes very repetitive and just not interesting
its really more of a chore
too bad but it did have potential
i have palyed over  ps games
my bottom  are mgs and folklore
there are many excellent games demons souls bioshock uncharted but i would not recommend thisthis has it all minimal gameplay little opportunity for exploration too many cutscenes and area loads awkward translations hardtoread font too much information dumped on us too quickly useless interactivity and way too little atmosphere
silent hill it isnt
it seems as though these developers really wanted to create a storybook
if so it should have stayed that waythe story line is great
the graphics are  out of  the characters are ok the language in this game could be considered a bit vulgar and mostly geared for boysthis games biggest pitfall is that it doesnt have auto aim option
you waste lots of time aiming to shoot at the bad guys while they dont have to aim
this game is outahere god of war is the gameupdate  from two stars to oneok this game is officially pure s
even the platforming is broken
theres a spot where you need to jump on narrow ledges later in the game and it is a freaking herculean feat to just jump forward
you  out  times and i know from experience real statistic
will jump either just a little too far right or just a little too far left and die again and again
and thats just standing still
next youll have to do it while avoiding obstacles
at  bucks this game isnt worth iti just bought a ps after being an xbox  owner for years
dont get me wrong i love my  but the ps price is in an ok range now plus the blue ray wireless free online play et all hooked me not to mention the ps exclusives
i love my psuncharted  was a huge hit and i got uncharted  with my system so i figured id get this game to play em in order
this game is a huge disappointmentthe prosgood storyplatforming what little there is of it is mildly amusingthe cons jet ski up rapids while getting raped by by dudes with guns grenade launchers and exploding barrels while fighting the current goes from fun to tedious to frustrating in about  seconds seriously youll be thinking oh god not that jet ski again
if the jet ski portions were actually fun theyd be a nice break but as is theyre breaking up crap with a few crap sequences wave after wave after wave of enemies
on the surface this looks like an indiana jonestomb raider genre game  well no its not its a freaking gears of war clone
gears of war was all about fighting waves of enemies you expected it
this game   jeeze  youll kill off like   bad guys and that takes a while a long while from behind cover and youll think for a second that was fun now time to explore  nope  youll hear a bad guy yell and another wave will hit and youll be pinned down fighting them off  then youll do it one more time
theres a fine line between fun combat and grind this game leaps over that line youll be grinding through bad guys thinking shouldnt i be doing some platforming
usually if they just had one less wave it would be bearable annoying but bearable  asis its just tedious the combat aint that great what little platforming there is isnt all that original but compared to fighting wave after wave of bad guys youll enjoy the five or six ledges you get to jump around on your way to the next  waves of bad guys later in the game guys with one shot kills  they have laser sights  when you first meet them there is insufficient cover so they bum rush you
seriously who thought one hit kills was a good ideagraphics a cut scenes  can you say ps
the cut scenes what drive the story look like ass like something from ps or xboxb game  graphics on backgrounds are nice but get repetitive
i mean the jungle looks nice but after about  minutes gets oldend boss  anticlimactic quick time event let down
lame ending lamei hope the sequels are better i wanted to like this game but feel the modern tomb raiders are far superior in too many respects
this is a terrible gamethis is almost a rail shooter with a lot of jump puzzles
all puzzles in drakes fortune require patient effort none require ingenuity
ive played for  hours and the mix seems to be  timing and position and  ingenuity
id prefer at least  or 
i found myself waiting for the shooting portions but the fire arm controls are terrible on the ps so these were more frustrating then fun if only because contemporary ps games do a much better job
the story isnt terrible and is kinda interesting at times but is pretty unoriginal
voice acting isnt terrible but may be ruined by the script and the ps visuals are pretty good
i played it about  hours before i traded it in trying to give it every chance
i can see why some people like it but i dont consider it a puzzle game and its not an adventure game thief  assassins creed are way more of both which is what it was billed as and its a terrible shooter
so theres really little reason to play this game when there are so many other good games out there
its  you dont need to waste your time on this mediocre gamethis game is supposed to be one of the best games the playstation  has to offer well if this is the case it just shows how poor ps games arethis game is riddled with dodgy gameplayropey controls awful graphics cheesy voice acting and repetitive gameplay it really is quite tediousbut if youve nothing better to do its better than staring at a blank screenbut only justi am new to the psbut honestly everything on the xbox  is way better than this poor excuse for a gameavoid at all costsrepetitiveweak storycliche characterswhat else can i say
sometimes extremely average or below average products are the most popular in gaming
i actually like tomb raider games so i thought id like uncharted but its simply not a quality experience
i suppose some love it for the easy trophies but i cant be bought with trophiesthis game is not utterly terrible but its yet another example of how new generation gamers priorities are forcing a major shift in the game industry
this is practically the poster child for what is wrong with a lot of the games today
with the coming of xbox ps and wii we have a generation of gamers clamoring for high end graphics holywood style cinematics and mindnumbing ease of playability
this in itself is not bad but the current gen systems demand much higher development costs and when ratings are earned more on superficialities where do you think they are funneling their assets
ultimately this paints a very ugly picture for the future of gaming
games like these are basically killing innovation and originality in the industry and the only people we have to blame are ourselves because we are the ones feeding the monsterok enough complaining here is my honest opiniongraphics  good  some screen tearing
this is a pet peeve of mine but i know some people dont caresound goodcinematics goodflow of play and pacing goodstory below average
generic plotlinescharacters lame  annoying at bestaction  average at best  point and shoot rd person action
useless melee attacks
some vehicle driving thrown in for varietypuzzles  platforming  some are ok but mostly very easy
platforming is fluid but very easy
good for little kids who have not developed enough dexterity to play more challenging gamesreplayability very little there are some treasures you can find throughout but they dont do anything so chances are you will stop caring about them almost right away
there are plenty of other easy rd person action games for you to enjoyoverall a mindless romp for the masses but the developer hit the nail on the head and achieved exactly what they were going for
it will entertain you for like  play sessions maybe
if you have the attention span of a chipmunk you might find more to like here
if you have the attention span of a slightly smarter animal you may have a rough time
bottom line shame on you for overhyping this pile and shame on me for buying it
i really would only recommend this game to people who are newer to video games and maybe need something cheap and easyi hate that you have to yank the controller like you would a wii controller i do not know the term used for that
i did not see anything written that you would have to flail your arms around
that sucks
i just could not enjoy the game and my kids are not interested guess it will collect dusti gave it away
i did not like the graphics
it would not play full screen
the images were small like the web versioni found this game to be very old fashioned
not up to date as far as graphics go
it reminded me more of a comic bookgot this game would not down load on either computer i believe this game was a copy so i really cant rate it but i can say i contacted the seller and they did make it right by by crediting my accountwarner brothers should be ashamed of themselves for letting this crap release under the looney tunes brand
in the  years that ive been playing video games this could be the single most frustrating title ive ever tried
what a great idea a wacky coop adventure featuring bugs bunny and friends
all they had to do was come up with something average and the license would carry it
but no
say hello to fighting through poorly designed levels while fighting with badly implemented controls and a lousy camera
whodve thought they could so thoroughly suck the fun out of this licensethe controls are incredibly fiddly including the camera control which you must use because the automatic camera is terrible
weird combinations of buttons and twists and shakes combined with a lack of accuracy make for frustration
theres no reason for it to be so complex there are plenty of buttons on those controllersthe level design is like a how not to clinic
there are tons of places where you can fall either to have to reclimb up endless platforms or to die and wait for your partner to reach the next checkpoint
god forbid you should die right after reaching a checkpoint  be prepared to sit and watch for a while
ridiculously difficult enemies that require you to attack them just so with those awful controls are beyond frustrating
for example in one level you fight these dragons that attack you from water by stretching their necks or shooting fire at you
if you step in the water you take damage if you go in too far you die
but aiming and timing your attacks to coincide with the dragons movements aint easy
and when they hit you you lose melee power which means you do less damage which means the whole things just drags on longer
you can run around to recollect the power but it disappears permanently after a few seconds
we havent made it beyond that level because the one time we managed to get past the first couple of dragons one of the games many software glitches left us stuck and unable to proceed
the game never again held our interest long enough to get that far in that leveleven my young son who loves the looney tunes as much as i do gave up on this after a while
the only things it has going for it are the characters and a few oneliners
we went back to the transformers  game which weve already played through several times
it may be simple but at least its funpersonally i love the game especially playing as daffy
its really not that hard for me yet but i havent reached the end
why havent i reached the end
because the damned thing freezes
on the playstation  it absolutely will not go past the prehistoric era because it freezes
everytime
and this is a brand new disk
the first time im playing
and guess what
so did the last two disks
the disk is perfect my system is perfectly clean with no problems at all
therefore i could not give this game more than a zero
warner brothers needs to apologize to every ps owner they ripped off
stay away from the ps version
it is completely worthlessi will offer my very different review from the other  positive ones posted here
i was deeply misguided into buying this game perhaps over relying on the before mentioned positive reviews
let me briefly cover what i found positive in the game offers npc followers which adds a welcome new spin on the hack and slash diablo style game
plus one star has gun weapon types to include pistols
 star it is inexpensive
mehnow on to the bad points i morn for anyone who has spent more than  dollars of hard earned cash on this ill developed bland and haphazardly thrown together game
i have played many freeware games that offer better graphics and game play
the voice acting is inexcusably horrible it is not even remotely charming or humorous fully equipped with the same i assume programmer speaking with ridiculous accents
foolishly trying to sound at times like a parody of an unidentifiable quasi germanicchinese nerd reading lines randomly typed out by trained monkeys
i have heard some terrible voice work over the years most have some for of entertainment value such as beyond divinity this one however is complete carnage
the  count them  classes all share the same skill tree
i do not understand the logic behind it
the controls are bulky there is no hotbar for healing potions mana potions and scrolls the environment is boring and lifeless
there is no variation in mob skins there are boss mobs that are surrounded in a blue cracking field but they are skinned the same as the othersthats it  seriously even if you are desperate and have played these a million times diablo  dungeon siege  sacred titan quest divine divinity or fatesearch for a freeware game dugeon runners is still free though there is a commercial version and save yourself from spending the money to play this for a few hours only to shelve it for all timethe graphics on this game are commodore  bad
the difficulty isnt scaled and the combat is just plain silly
hitting people with stickswhat a novel conceptst thing i never played it online thats why its  stars
the single player is awful its no different then mgs vr missions
their is no story  just trials or tests
they should of  called it mgs po online because its basically a online game
it doesnt include the original mgs portable opsthis is not a good game
the graphics are poor
you are constantly fighting the camera
controls are annoying
has frame rate problems at times
and its simply boringthe xbox version of anniversary started out pretty well but quickly went downhill
first a key movement required to procure one of the treasures simply does not work
fine
so keep on keepin on and go to the next
so when the next level comes up the first thing to happen is an attack by a very large bear
on the screen is a help line that comes up halting the game play explaining how to do a dodge and in turn an adrenalin head shot
when the text goes away i immediately try the key sequence required and it too does not work
that being said i tried playing several times the same sequence as well as a couple others requiring that same sequence and in all cases the required key sequence does not work
consequently the bear bestsdinasaur or whatever else best lara game over
or if one is persistent and has a chance one can run past the bear and keep on keeping on for awhile at least
not past the dinasaur however
one must best the dinasaur to continue the game so game truly over in just a short while with many levels left to play
comes a pole in the next segment which lara is supposed to climb
she first jumps onto the cement base out of which the pole emerges and climbs
right
nope not gonna happen
lara performs the classic im not supposed to do that jump and she goes past the pole ten or fifteen times
finally she lands on the base and when the key is pressed for the climb she does the im not supposed to do that jumphaving tried several times to get past the first couple segments i have finally given up
i have to say that this is the worst tomb raider i have ever attempted to play
the secondworst is underworld which begs another scathing review unfortunately because of several bugspoor programming apparently since i have raided since tomb raider  and had little trouble compared to the latest xbox releases
all others were for pc
i think thats it for my brand new xbox
i thought it would be less expensive than getting a computer to play these new ones but i was incorrect
i sense that it isnt xboxs fault since legend is the only one that works the way it is advertised to work
at least on that one the only broken sequence is guess what
 the dodgeadrenalin head shot
all else workssave your money and frustration
it just isnt worth it
rather than pawn it off on some poor unfortunate i just trashed itmy two centsgreat graphics and atmosphere along with some interesting game play dont make up for the bugs lack of content and missing featuresi bought the collectors edition and if you do too you can have the enjoyment of not playing the game like i did
dont get me wrong here the game plays after a very lengthy scan of the local data files
but all those ingame exclusives arent on your character
youll hit the  wesite and find that there arent any useful support options
i recommend you do what i did and google your problem
with any luck youll stumble across some rd party message board where youll find a post about the claim command that gives your character these itemssadly the support infastructure is soooo bad on this mmo that youll spend a lot more time trying to fix stuff and looking up solutions then you will playing the actual game
the forums for the game do exist but there hidden in the subpages of ageofconan  good luck
its like a quest in itselfnow i havent even touched on how buggy half the game content is and how broken the classes are
these arent unique problems like a bugged quest here or there
that kind of stuff is expected no mmo escapes that
but this is a whole new level of bugs
for example it is quite noted that the assassins hide spell stealth is a  hit and miss affair
when i say hit and miss i mean youll get all the fancy annimation and to the player youll look hidden
the annoying fact comes when you realize that the mobs didnt get the memodear facemelting mobsyes all  of you please note that player rogueginsudeath is stealthed please do not attack him unless he unstealths or gets too close to you
he should not be detected from  game meters as his hiding skill is maxed out
to do so would greatly embarass the game developers and they in turn will convert all of you into neurtal npc squirrels
if youre stealthed you should not be detected in the same manner that you would be if you werent stealthed
a rogue that cant hide thats like having a warrior that cant swing a swordwhile this game has a lot of potential there is no doubt in my mind that in its current state it should not have been released
im not new to mmorpgs you will get bugs here and there regardless of the titledeveloper
but this is the first time ive seen the actual characterclass set fundumentally flawed
that said if you want to give it a shot go for it
who knows maybe theyll fix it up enough to make it enjoyablein the meantime heres a pointer keep the sercret petition slash command written down youll need it to contact your gmsi went into this game in may of  thinking it could actually complete with warcraft
by the time i left in jan of  funcom totally failed to live up to the hype and promises that were made
the first mmo with direct x was never released as of early jan of  my biggest issue with it was when you got over level  not even  there wasnt really much out there to do
oh the game itself wasnt bad if you dont mine quests up to the mid s after that good luck
and as somebody already pointed out the selling price of a used one is now  cents
thats bad enoughnow it is possible that funcom maybe able to turn this around but a month back on g the cable channel it was reported that funcom had problems
for all who want to try this i would see what happens by june of this year either go back to warcraft try lord of the rings or wait for the next patch of mmos to be released fallen earth star trek online or star wars which supposely is due around update i got names in the game this time
but the graphics are still bad
i dont feel like i am part of the game
my ps deserves better than thisi also wanted to day how little detail is in the game
the players look average
the court looks good but the arena atmosphere is terrible
the arena derail is very minimal if there is any and they arent even accuratei never buy a game anymore until i see some trustworthy reviews that are convincing
indeed i saw some reviews for unreal tournament iii ut that were pretty darn good
i even chatted with some friends about ut and we got psyched for the gamebut the hype was shortlived after a week of trying to actually play utut was hyped as an awesome online shooter
so after some serious online training over the past few months with resistance fall of man and call of duty  i was sure that i had what it took to jump right into the ut online fray
man was i wrongive only been gaming for a year now so im still pretty weak compared to fps vets in the department of get the crosshairs focused on the enemy quickly
in ut its all about running through corridorshallways and hoping youre the first to focus your crosshairs on an enemy before the enemy focuses on you
like an old fashioned duelyou know paces then whos quickest turn and shootcomparatively cod and resistance have open environments some wide open environments with an abundance of hiding places and structures with rooms
for example how cool is it to sneak up to a room within a building in cod with like  enemies hiding there present them with a flash or stun grenade and take em all out
in ut you run through narrow halls and tight common areas and blast away before youre blasted away
i stink at that all run and gun stuffso perhaps ut is just not for me
if you like fast moving run and shoot games ut is right up your alley and shouldnt be missedi did not like the game i am not an online gamer
i was expecting a game kind of resistance fall of man in the campain mode but it is basically a preparation for the online action steal the flag destroy enemies power generators etc
to me that is painfully boring but that is my personal opinion
i changed the almost new game for assasin creed and now i am having a blastthis is quite possibly the worst port from a pc i have ever had the displeasure of playing
the modding it claims to have is basically non existent
i had so much trouble just trying to put in one mod and when i finally did the game crashed and crashed and crashed
i spent over an hour trying to get this damn thing to work and it just refused
save your time and money and just buy the pc version
guarantee it is much better there than the consolei was not pleased with this game simply because of its dialogue so long drawn out and boring
i went round and round in circles in the home and i was just bored with it all
i presented no challenges and i do not play it anymorei was really disappointed by this game to say the least
i installed it and it said you need to play with your blinds closed during the day or your lights off at night
i found this curious until the scenes loaded and i couldnt see a thing
lights on or off
im even using a brand new monitor
i tried to fumble around in the darkness but there was no real direction like in previous nancy drew games
the puzzles were illogical and the plot rather loose and pretty easy to guess the outcome
there were very few places to visit and no fun minigames like in other nancy drew games
i dont know why her interactive chose to change the entire way they did this game but it was a bad decision
the tarantula didnt help either
i played it for a bit and even with a walkthrough got frustrated
i finally gave up and uninstalled it
i will continue to play nancy drew games but this one wasnt worth the moneyi went to gamespot to purchase one of these halo edition s
they look cool and my old xbox  finally died
microsoft balked on the warrenty and wont repair it
i was surprised to find that ms tech support are complete idiots
if you call them you will see exactly what i mean
im over that nowi was looking for hdmi and the new falcon chipset
at gamestop all the halo versions were the original watt power supplies no way am i buying another known piece of junk
also
i cant believe they sell a halo edition xbox and doesnt even come with a halo game
thats rich
instead you get forza motorsports and a stupid spiderman game
basically more junk to sell on ebayforget the halo edition for the extra  bucks i got straight cash and plenty of it get the elite
you get gig hd which is overkill and totally unecessary  hdmi and the newer falcon chip wich runs at a cooler and quieter watts
this unit also covered by ms  year warrentyi hope this one last longer then a year
fyi  any xbox you buy your pretty much getting ripped off and screwed
i should have bought the ps to begin but sony and wii dont have all the phat games eitherthey had an awesome background story but do nothing with it
you  just go around fighting like any other soldier games except often you dont know where to do or what to dobottom line
dont waste your timethis game sucked
i got it put the highest difficulty on and beat in  and a half hours then i played it on the easiest setting and beat it in  hours
yes it is that short i gave this a three for fun because i kept on using nazis as shields and killed them in gruesome ways
like in sometimes when you grab one you can choose to like grab there gun and use it as a bati bought this the week it came out luckily i got it for free because game stop had a sale for you retuning games
anyway the multiplayer sucked
i found  person in the entire time i owned that pos
code masters i love overlord i love grid and dirt but never make shooters because they flatout suck
damnation and turning point were two of the worst games i have ever played
people go buy uncharted
its the best game on the ps
i got to go sell this pos gamewhat if the nazis had won world war two
for that matter what if having conquered all of europe hitlers armies invaded the united states
imagine that youre a construction worker on a building when suddenly missiles slam into the girders around you
looking up you see the impossiblea fleet of nazi zeppelins descending upon your city accompanied by a fleet of warships and backed up with hundreds upon hundreds of jets and fighters sweeping among the skyscrapers blasting everything in sightits a terrific premise for a video game but unfortunately thats all turning point has going for it
turning point is your standard first person shooter
you run around shooting those dastardly nazis gathering and swapping weapons as needed and interacting with the environment at various moments to activate bridges man machine gun turrets and plant bombs
all pretty standard affairs with nothing too extraordinary save for being able to occasionally grapple an enemy in hand to hand combat whereupon you can either take them hostage as a human shield or kill them easily
while most of those kills are variations of knocking them out with your fists bashing them with weapons etc
a few are occasionally quite humorous such as chucking a paratrooper off a skyscraper tossing a thug into a furnace and locking the doors shut irony
 or drowning one unfortunate soldier in a toilet bowlhowever aside from its instant kills and the fantastic premise turning point doesnt really work for the simple fact that it feels unfinished
with such a hollywood caliber premise the story in turning point is practically nonexistent outside of a handful of cut scenes
characters come and go at random and are all equally forgettable
the player character is a construction worker who wears a red shirt and has no personality motives or goals and is frequently sent in by trained marines to do their dirty workgameplay is average with not much to distinguish it
your foes are competent though not particularly smart
theyll attack you en mass to try and make up for their average ai which largely resorts to ducking behind obstacles and chucking lots of grenades one big problem the grenade indicator does not tell you how close a grenade is to your position which makes it nearly impossible to figure out if youre going to get hit or not
if you take too much damage you have to retreat to heal which happens very quickly as you heal in about three seconds no matter how much damage you take
however this wont help you in the last third of the game which throws hordes of enemies your way who have much better accuracy then their first and second level counterparts
in one nightmarishly difficult sequence on a bridge youll be assaulted by at least ten guys with rockets rapid fire sniper rifles combat shotguns a few blimps and even a giant zeppelin
add in the fact that checkpoints are few and far between and the last act of the game or most of the game for that matter just isnt any funin keeping in line with the thin story levels are connected by the barest of threads
at the beginning of the game your goal is to escape and head to washington
after a cut scene youre suddenly in a safe house and have to defend it with no explanation of how you got there or what you were doing there in the first place
this jumpy feeling pervades every area of the game and as a result we have no emotional interest in it
even when were told that the fate of the world is in our hands we just dont care
theres so much potential in this world for a great story and its left completely untapped
when the end credits rolls around were left wondering why we didnt see more of it
is hitler still alive
does canada and mexico join forces with the united states
what about japan and russia
we never find out the answers to these questions and countless othersits a shame really
while the first level of the game does an outstanding job immersing you in the world once you exit the skyscraper it all goes down hill
turning point is proof that a fantastic idea can only go so far without good execution
while it has an outstanding premise and a fantastic opening sequence a nonexistent story poor characters and unfinished feel make it a dull game that is ultimately not worth your timeim rather shocked this game even made it onto the shelves
it feels so broken and incomplete and you cant help but feel the studio rushed it out just for a quick cashgrab
ive play a lot of fps but this is one of the worst ive ever played
the enemy ai is almost nonexistent and there is no challenge what so ever
the graphics are choppy looking and ugly
just dont buy it just donti got this because i was told by a few friends that its awesome
that its true surround sound and you can hear peoples footseps across the mapthats not the case at all
playing call of duty  i have only heard footsteps behind me once and that was on stairs right behind me
usually all you hear is explosions and gun fire its information overload
the surround sound doesnt work well at all imo it just sounds like some fairly good stereo speakerstried it with guitar hero hoping it would sound awesome and it just sounded ok you couldnt turn it up that loud to really rock out eitherfinally the microphone seems to short out the other day my brother couldnt hear me i kept unplugging and replugging and toggling the mute back and forth no lucki would not buy again no chance
imo if you want the turtle beach go with the x with the coord its only like  and is prob just as goodforget about carrying the ds in your pocket
with this thing you might be comfortable throwing it at the wall in which case you should consider anger management but theres no way youre going to be doing any portable gaming which kind of defeats the purpose of a handheld system doesnt it
furthermore this bulky thing loves collecting fingerprints and its tough to get your ds out of there especially if you have large hands
i chucked the case in the closet and forgot about itafter seeing so many reviews i decided to test this
the unit i received does not workat all
the charger would not charge any of the batteries and all it did was light up blue
i decided to check maybe the batteries where fully charged
the wii menu said otherwise red battery sign
i decided to leave them there for a while one battery started flashing red and the other stayed blue
no charging ever occurred
not sure if different shippers are sending different items or if the factory for these doesnt know the meaning of quality assurance
either way please save your money
on another note  thank you amazon for the amazing return policyi initially bought this charger because it has blue lights and i love blue lights
yeah i know stupid reason to buy a charger or any item for that matter
im not sure how much it cost though but considering its only  here i assume thats about what i paid
this one is not good if you are a person who uses the skins that you can buy to tell one wiimote from another because the parts that need to touch in order for it to charge will be covered by the skins
and for me the skins tight fit is a great thing for playing but also makes it take some work to get them on and off
i am planning on returning this item and buying a different charger that will allow me to keep my skins on my wiimotesshould have sent it back  never did work right
very poorly designed  remotes wont stand up so battery pack connects to contactsbethesda has done an unfortunate aboutface on their drm stance and slapped securom into the goty edition of oblivion
i would highly recommend you not to buy this version and to buy the individual standalong versions instead if you really want this game  see also the securom debacle on games like bioshock and mass effect to learn moredont get me wrong i love this game on xbox
i decided to pick up the pc version for access to the user mods and unofficial fixes for major bugs bethesda will probably never fix themselves coughbattlehorn castlecoughhow surprised i was to find that the installer for oblivion goty edition is protected by securom and refuses to install because i run process explorer to keep an eye on my system resources
sure securom tells me to turn off process explorer and reboot but i have it on for a reason and its an application developed by microsoft
there shouldnt be an issuei spent my hard earned money on this game and shouldnt have to deal with obnoxious copy protection schemes
be warned you may have issues installing this gameelder scrolls  morrowind game of the year editioni bought morrowind about a year ago
its a great game openended and great gfx
some master trainers are not there
you can corrupt quests
i did
when i called tech support the main line didnt work and i had to relay a few times to get through
i asked them to fix the quests
this is a very simple matter for someone who knows what their doingfixing vars etc
they said no they wont
what this is tech support
iv used tech support that did far more then just this request
id be on for  hrsor more on the phone andor email me with helpful info
now im stuck with a number of quests that cant be finished
arg
the elder scrolls iv oblivion game of the year editionso far oblivion has been great same openended format great graphicsart
just before i bought it i called tech supportcustomer support
i couldnt get through again
pressed  for oblivion nothing happened
i did this  times in a row
when i called the main line i got the worst customer service call ever
i said the tech support line wasnt working
they said it did
i said no it didnt round and round
 ever heard the term the customer is always right  can you connect me to tech support
no
what
id had enough and hung upoblivion is amazing worth every penny
but if you want customer service or tech support go buy another game
if think you might need either go buy another game
worst customer service of any game iv brought evergraphicsfor an adventure game the graphics are average and acceptable
the textures are good for the most part however some of the scenes are overly dark and appear washed out and blandgameplaypainfully bad
the voice acting is stiff unimaginative and absolutely annoying at several points
hearing sherlock holmess line i have no reason to go over there is the single most annoying line ive ever heard out of an adventure game
the characters are also flat and onedimensional the developers chose to be way too literal in their take on the sherlock holmes storyline
if this character was derived back in the s it certainly shows in this gamecontrolsbuggy
at times the character will begin to drift aimlessly and one will have to hit the esc key and the directional keys to have him move in the proper directionvaluethis game should be no more than  dollars max
if you paid more you got screwed
unless you enjoy hearing annoying dialogue bland graphics unresponsive buggy controls and flat boring characters theres almost no replay ability whatsoeveroverallsherlock holmes the awakened is a boring flat tedious game with terrible dialogue onedimensional characters and a buggy controls system hosting bland graphics
stay awayps
the sherlock holmes thing needs to be spruced up a bit
time for he and watson to get modern
ive never been so annoyed by a video game before playing this one
if you are seeking interesting welldone adventure games see jane jensens gabriel knight series under sierra onlineawful
very old software
in todays age software makers should not be selling games that are not up to datei played the previous holmes adventure and really enjoyed myself
this one departs from the last in a number of ways
firstly its in a fps format so the graphics are blocky and the animations jerky why why why on a pc
i wasnt impressed with any of the graphics in this game
and of course its stomach churning
im confused why this type of interface is used as there arent any real actions scenes where such an interface may be useful such as running around shooting monsters with unlimited ammosecond the hot spots were a pain
you often cant tell where the hot spots are going to be located until you get very close and see the icon change
this ends up requiring sliding along a wall or staring at the ground while moving some more nausea  wasting time getting close to everything just in case
you cant just enter a room and observe it to see what you want
you have to search it with a fine tooth comb
in real life that kind of searching would be appropriate for a detective but  in the game its just a painthe game itself is painfully linear
im usually ok with some linear games if the story unfolds nicely and the game plays nice with me
this one was a head banging fight from start to finish
there were plenty of times i knew i needed an object but wasnt allowed to pick it up
i had all the clues available to know i needed the object but still i had to play through a whole bunch of other actions in the order it was written then go back and redo earlier actions to activate the item for pick up
this was terribly annoying and caused me great confusion more than oncei was often stuck trying to figure out what i was supposed to do rather than enjoy the environment and the story
hints are nearly nonexistent and they are desperately needed since its so linear
sometimes in the beginning holmes will say what needs to be done usually the obvious but after that theres nothing
if you want to find out the hint you have to open the dialog section where all the dialogs you ever had are kept and find the pertinent entry
you cant just turn to watson who is trailing behind you every where and talk to him
he just says something stupid like what now holmes
over and over again
i think the mark of a really bad game like this is when there is an official extremely detailed walk through available
nothing else
no hints no one elses version of a walk through just one
and even with that there were  sections i was stuck on trying to get the game to move forwardvoice acting left me wanting not that the inflection was so bad most in fact were good
but holmes sounds like a nonbrit actor trying to sound brit
some of the pronouncements made me cringe
watson however was bang on
the actor had a very pleasant voice very british and was almost always able to get the mood right
he sounds the way i imagine watson to soundthe music was subpar especially considering the last games beautiful classical music which matched so well to the story
well except for one happy piece near the end
i think they were going for scary but it just came across as lazy and boring so boring that i cant remember one motif sound or effectand now to the worst offense
this game is supposed to be atmospheric and scary
its not even a little
the areas where you expect to find people are completely void of any life which left the scary abandoned areas just like the rest of the game
there is some gore but again its so blocky as to be funny the blood is always fire engine red
the expected monster never materializes which i found to be the most egregious of offenses
throughout the game are hints that there will be a monster as well as idols of the beast so that we already know what it looks like but in the big ending there was nothing
im tempted to pretend that they wanted to instill the idea that it was all a delusion on the bad guys part but it looked more like they just didnt feel like putting the effort into it
in fact the whole thing feels that wayat the end holmes sums up the whole game
its as if the creators thought we were all too stupid to not remember the hours we wasted on this tripe
they were also kind enough to prime us for the next installment by mentioning a future evil whose face holmes knows well
well i wonder whowhat that can be
it was such a ridiculous and abrupt  lines i actually laughed out loudplease save your money on this one
i wish i could recommend someone buying it as i really want to sell this junk but i cant
borrow it if you must but dont waste both your time and money on this bombwith reviews like he got i wont dare order from himi cant say he gives a rip about his customers considering what the last two reviewers said so i was going to buy from him but thanks to them mentioning he was a nasty sort to question i dont think so
mario and duckhunt are the only ones who get the five starscable would not charge my cable price was great but product was junk but hopefully the next one will b greatwasnt even a game boy chargeri purposely got the pc version windows vista of this game instead of xbox  version just bc i like playing fps or any shooting games with mouse better than a controller
also windows version of gow has better graphic than xbox version if you have a good graphic card and has more single campaignsanyway ive had so much expectation for this game
it took about  hour for me to install the game but it wasnt a big problem for me
the problem started when i started playing it
the game crashed every    minutes and therefore impossible to progress
i searched for solution by googling and solved the problem by running the game as administrater
but that wasnt all
i got to act  of  after playing a few hours
the next day i pressed continue campaign but it told me that there was no saved games
i was shocked and pissed
indeed it was painful to start all over again
i tried to find solutions online but still no luck this game could have been a great actionfilled shooting game but those critical flaws killed it
i recommend getting xbox version or other better fps games such as call of duty  etcfirst off you have to have some sort of silly windows authentication or windows live account to even get the thing to install
when i went through all that it still freezes on launch for me
ive been through all the support info on forums and tried everything i could think of
i loved the  version of the game and really wanted to play it on pc since i sold my xbox
no dice
im a professional it guy and a gamer to boot and it took me  hours to get it installed and another  days trying to get it to launch before i gave up
i hear even if you get it to work the save game data blows up after a few days anyway
this game on pc in its current incarnation is not worth the plastic its printed onevery problem that is happening with this game is directly linked to windows live being part of the game
once players get their game up and running they have zero problems
a few in game stuttering problems have already been addressed and solutions have been provided
other than that the crashing at boot and crashing after a few minutes of game play is all microsofts faultdrm has once again reared its ugly head
and this time its really ugly
gears of war for the pc comes with a digital certificate that causes the game to expire on january   that means it cannot be played unless you set your computer clock back to a date  time before january ththose supporting drm using the arguments that it is harmless and non invasive and that it wont really mess up your game take note of this one
it seriously messed up this game
serious enough that you cant even play iti know there will be a lot of folks clamoring about how they will release a patch yada yada yada
sure they might release a patch but how about next time or the time after that
do i really want my ability to play a game hampered by issues like this
heck no
this is stupidity at its finest or it is a calculated move on epics part to give the game an engineered mortality something guys like me and the rest of those opposed to drm have long feared
if game companies cant even get this sort of thing right what confidence can any of us have that their authentication servers will stay active in the futureonce again drm proves bad for the consumer
good job epic
you guys bring a whole new meaning to epic failwow if you are not a techo geek and are not comfortable diving into your config files and registry keys etc this game is not for you
i am somewhat of a computer nerd but i had a very very rough time getting this game to run
i had all the system requirements and then some
 guarantee when you install this game out of the box you can not play it without going to the internet to figure it out
good luck
typical microsofti spent a lot of time adusting my display downloading new drivers reviewing other issue gamers discribed and there are a lot only to still having problems
good lucki cannot believe epic shovelled this game onto the pc without customising anything for the pc player
this is not a shooter its a third person action console game with a shaky epilepsy inducing camera movement that makes you want to pukei felt like i was fighting a game controller when trying to play on the mousekeyboard setup and instead of being in control of the main player you get the impression you are inside a floating camera trying to keep up with the guy
the viewpoint is warped and stupidsorry epic the term fps goes hand in hand with shooter
and this game is a d overhyped overrated console jumping gamesave your money dont reward console gaming companies for shovelling consolitus over to usthis game is very fun and really has a lot of non stop action but its not for windows
it is a really sloppy port of the xbox
if you have played this on the xbox then this game will waste your money
they added some new content but not really worth buying
epic also is very lousy with support for the game
they have released two patches but this game really stutters pretty badly on my dual core rig which runs games like crysis on high settings like waterjust dont get this for windows or if like me try for another title like bioshock  or fallout  they are better titles and really keep you into the game
they also have better supportanother note this game requires that you sign up for games for windows live to save you progress
thats another reason to consider before buying gears of warsi bought these headphones thinking that it would enhance the sound from your psp but sadly it does not the quality of the headphone are cheap and plain out a waste of money
i would not recommend you owning a pair unless you get them from a friend free
another thing they should be free with the purchase of the psp im  female  very competitive against a standard   one of the reasons i like brain age and bought this game for mental acuity training
i have brain age    plus big brain academy
i do all of these start to finish daily
im committed
i thot brain challenge might be a good addition but i must say i dont particularly care for it
 the writing recognition is very very sketchy
i find i have to press very hard with the stylus to make a mark and often my answer is correct and read incorrectly
sometimes the marks dont register at all
  there is no howtoplay info other than whats given on the screen there should be directions on the liner notes in the case
several games i have yet to figure out
  the countdown screens with the rolling and flashing block are very irritating especially since i have epilepsy  need to avoid flashing things whenever possible
  the helper says insulting things such as whats wrong with you today
and thats worse than before
who wants to pursue something without any instructions and then get insulted for not doing well
i know its a game but really
  there are a lot of question screens that one must tap through to get to the next game
do you know the brain
maybe theres a way to skip through those entirely and return to the main menu but ive not found it yeton the plus side the music isnt too terrible
all the games are stylusactivated as is the case with ba and bbaif you want a followon to ba and bba brain challenge is not it imo
mbi bought  wireless racing wheels  years ago when they were first released
i never abused them and always had a blast playing with them
neither of them works anymoreid like another but i cant imagine buying a product thats already broken on me twicei paid about  each for them back then
so now im  in the hole and have not even a single wheel to use
microsoft of course doesnt want to help me outi even own the playseats evolution seat and have one of the wheels mounted
im very disappointed in the durability of this product and cannot recommend them for purchasethe only alternative i have is the fantec porsche  turbo s wheel and its entirely too expensive
i wish msft would just liscense logitech to build one of these
perhaps they could come up with a quality productfor all of you people who cant use the wheel
drive from the road view if you drive up above the carrd personyour brain cannot comprehend what is going on because youre turning on an axis out in front of you
its unnaturalas an avid gamer i have never found a game i hated until this one
the controls are horible you cant scroll back enough to see anything until it is almost on top of you you cant rotate the screen by taking your mouse to the edge of the screen
it is just not user friendly
the online version requires you to setup an account through a german organization that would not allow either of my email accounts hotmail or yahoo to create an accountif i could return a game for any of my money this would be the gamehaving played all my favorite games to death diablo ii dungeon siege morrowind oblivion titan quest i was looking for something anything new to play
i was willing to give this game a chance even though the graphics are poor the controls are pretty awful enemy visibility is very bad and theres a lot of grinding
the first evening i spent playing it i thought well ok its not all that fun but its not all that bad either
the second evening after i entered the game in town and tried to sell something to a merchant it crashed
im running windows xp
i restarted and got through that and continued fighting where i left off
it then crashed again causing me to lose all progress
you cant just save
you have to save and exit
this was two crashes within half an hour
i decided this was now no fun at all and really not worth the irritation
im now back to playing one of my tried and true games until something else comes along
dont waste your moneyi bought this game for cheap
people told me if your a wrestling fan to buy this game but after i did i hated it
the controls take a long time to get used to
steep learning curve
graphics are simple
sound is good
but the gameplay is not what i was looking forthis game you can customize your wrestlers to your liking
you can create wrestlers who can be male or female mask wwe wcw ecw etc
you can also create wrestling rings
but i was never into creating wrestlersthere are plenty of wrestling games out there that are simple and fun to play
stay away from this one unless your a customize fan who wants to create wrestlers and ringsi was really disappointed with this game
the controls were lame and so was the story line
basically you run around killing aliens and destroying any trace of crashed space ships
it was painfully easy as wellone annoying thing in particular is that you had to use the r and l buttons to see where you were going even when you were moving instead of the characters perspective changing automatically as you movedi was expecting a good shooter or action game like god of war or the warriors
this game is neitherthe bright side  i got  bucks for it at a school flea marketwhen i heard that i could use these cables to play my psp video games  watch umds on my tv i was so excited and bought them right away but sadly they werent what i expectedtrue these cables allow you to watch umds and play video games on your tv with the psp as the controller but its nothing like what youd expect it to bewhile umds play great on your tv and display in full frame or widescreen depending on the umds aspect ratio video games are displayed in a tiny rectangular box that takes up roughly half of the screen
i played it on my sylvania  edtv and the display size was about  inches  at the very most
it was so small that it was almost impossible to read the text in the game
and whats more theres no option to stretch the image to fit your screen
cmon even my old gameboy player for the gamecube could do that
put simply these cables are completely useless unless you own a large  tv with component outs otherwise its going to be too small to enjoy playing it on the tvsure you can watch umds on your tv with it but dvds look better anyway and you can watch your umds on tv with the much cheaper psp composite cablenot recommended
use the money that you were going to use on this cable on a game instead youll enjoy it morewanted to output video off my psp  onto my  hdtvi first tried it with my hp  monitor and the output came out with a reddish tingei know my cables have been setting up my home entertainment system since  and these cables are faulty not because i stuckemin wrongsent them back for a refundfyi i dont think it was the sellers fault as it was amazon primed
but this sucks really wanted to play games off my psp  onto a bigger screenthis product is not for all psps and doesnt work to put the game on the television which is what i was hoping for
what is the point of buying this theni thought it would be nice to have a larger image to play on boy was i wrong
wasted all my moneydoesnt work at all
i bought it with hopes of playing psp stuff on my hdtv and no bueno
not pissed but not buying it againdont waste your time or money on this game
after playing this game for  minutes i got stuck and have been there ever since
had to take it back buy something enjoyable instead like simpsons or de blob you were waz warnedi am an army veteran and avid sports player in highschool
i got out of the army when i was pregnant with my son
i did not work out at all my entire pregnancy and i did not work out for a year after i had my son
i bought the wii fit  year post partum to try to get into shape
as out of shape as i was this game was not challenging at all
there is too much break time in between exercises so you cant keep your heart rate up
buy a membership to a rec center
this game is not going to do anything for youstatsfemale lbs at the time of purchase lbs pre pregnancy weightordered wii fit with balance board but when arrive i did not own wii console anymore  we have xbox  nowsince i was not able to use it i requested return just because i did did not need this producttoday  i got email that seller of this product refuse the return and the reason was expiration of the product returnrgb rec is the seller that sold me the product and im writting the rewiew base on the action of that person not the quality of the producti bought this item expecting an amazing and innovative title but was sadly disappointedtheres no storyline
and the worst thing is that it completely lacks action
not once was i allowed to shoot anyone or slash with a swordthis title is all talk no actionthe kids grew so bored with it that they hit their cousin with the boardi honestly cant recommend this to anyoneif you want to buy the wii fit and balance board at any price go for it
however be aware that msrp is 
patience and a bit of detective work should allow you to get one from kmart sears wal mart or targeti came back to wow for this expansion exclusively
this expansion adds nothing new and wotlk is just more of the same
endless repetition massive crowds of children and hours upon hours of wasted time gathering horribly rendered gearim glad i only bought one copy and didnt go full bore on thisdont waste your moneyi must have been on the worst possible wow server where people made fun of you if you quested ran any instance or raid instance or crafted
all the gear has moved to arenas they took it away from s then deleted the vendors
the loot system left you doing  hours of instances and one person stealing the drop or wiping the group because they didnt get it
buffs have slowly been removed from the game and dont stack well anymore
the only thing in general chat is fail and anal please leave a comment as to where the crafters are going after they quit wowtabula rasa has crafting but is shutting down in february
it fixed loot issues wow has and had relatively friendly people unlike in wow where the goal is not to play the game hang around in town and jack up pricesboth conan and warhammer war graphics are only a hair better than wow only have crafting because they accidently promised it in the work up but it feels like they want it to go away like wow is doing toowolk left me feeling like buy the next addon
we are not fixing that quest reputation bar too bad you cant stack buffs and those things dont work anymore get to 
get to  but now its the same thing again
sighi wont get any stars for this but its a serious problem
maybe both users and programmers can find this useful and fix or move on accordinglyhave to purchase time online to play game monthly fee too costly for me and game was not useable offlinei also did my review at gamespot here it is for aamazonthis game is complete garbage
before i even get into the review i want to note that this game is broken
if you do purchase the expansion just be prepared for server crashes restarts and appologies from blizzard stating that the realms will be down for  hours or more while they fix issues with the new content
heck even if your playing on the old content you still will be sitting at your computer looking at the sign on screeni wish blizzard would work on making new and interesting game content rather than putting a new paint job on the same old house
the new world looks the same as the old worlds
just a few design differences
nothing truly out of this world or note worthy
the new pvp battleground was nothing to brag about
picture alterac valley with a fortress you defend
the new pvp gear is just a new and even more horrible grind
pvp armor is k a piece and there are  pieces to collect
enjoy having no life and spending hours farming the honor needed for those setsnot to mention enjoy trying to earn those points fighting against the horrible class balancing that blizzard makes an attempt to fix every new patchthe real killer is that blizzard almost forces you to buy the expansion
all the old cities are just about empty now
shatterah is a ghost town better yet outlands are like a barren wasteland now
all the previous battle grounds are now   so if your decked out in that pvp armor enchanted to the teeth good luck getting swated by people  levels higher than you
the only bg that seems untouched is the alterac valleywhich is 
mostly what youll find are bunches of s and few s as most accounts have moved on and leveled level some games noticably uneven  to 
there are new arts and crafts for you to learn and world pvp is still boring as ever
invade a city and be prepared for  gaurds to spawn and wipe youaside from new levels some new items and trades a new area to run around in which looks more like a missmash of the previous games rolled into one there really isnt much to do
blizzard has the greedy idea to keep you playing longer they should at more levels but once you hit the cap they give you little to do afterwards
usually its one of  raidarena or make a new character
youll eventually end up with the same problem you had last game
decked out in the best armor and bored as hell with nothing to do
like i always argued with people blizzard needs to work on adding fun and exciting game content not regurgitated ideas from yesteryearoverall the wrath of the lich king is nothing new or worth buying unless you just want to hit i attempted to try this game out to see what some of my nerdy friends where all ecstatic about and what consumed all their free time
since im a gamer and enjoy just about everything except perhaps this game and a few others
this is so addictive for some because of its simplicity and it fills those peoples voids of realistic social interactions
now about the game graphics are horrible cartoon like characters
when you customize you are only changing the color and a few minor things
basically you look like everyone else with a different color pair of pants
when you play you are dealing with people who have poured their lives into this so for anyone who is a beginner well i feel sorry for you
you will just be called a noob and disregarded
i from start didnt like the fighting styles there is no movement just noises
i have played other mmo rpgs
i am just sending a fore warning do not purchase this game and become one of blizzards nerd raging minions
the game isnt fun at all
there are new games coming that have tons of more depth and enjoyment instead of year long grind fest that will continue with new dlc
worst game ever madeafter playing through wotlk hitting  raiding and getting geared i finally just stopped one day and said why am i playing this game
all the game is is one long grind sessionwhether youre grinding for experience grinding for gold grinding for pvp points grinding for gear grinding for rep etc
and then once you have all epic items and think all the grinding is behind you guess what
an expansion pack or patch comes out and you have to grind all over again for your end game gear rep gold etc
this game is an enormous time sink and at the end of the day what did you really accomplishi was hesitant to write this review for quite some time but after having my high expectations ruined at the end i decided to just go ahead and write thishopefully im going to get corrected if im wrongorif im lucky enoughmaybe get the chance to have my review read by a blizz senior who will actually fix the fatal flaws that wow has been suffering from latelytechnical issuestech supportwow is the only game that freezes on me everytime i play itother gameseven ones that are even more graphically intensivelike dead space work just finebut whats even more amazingafter trying to play wow for a minuteliterallythe rest of the other games i got in my pc went bad right away
the only solution available to me was uninstall wow and restore my pc to an earlier dateand voilaeverything became as good as beforeso what does that say
whats even worsewows tech support is amazingly irresponsiblethese guys will sometimes tell you stuff like it appears that the item that you had was sold away to a vendoreven though i didnthave a good dayi swear im not making any of this up
i was never able to get any help from these guysever
google the words freeze and wow and youll be amazed at how many players complain from this issuebut blizz simply doesnt seem to carepvpsystem balanceask any woweris wows pvp system balanced and fair
and you know the answerit isnt
its amazing how blizz was able to become one of the worlds top video game developers but isnt able to balance its playervsplayer system no matter how longand hardthey trytried
i meanin all honestyhow does blizz expect its pvp system to be balanced if the death knight has an ability that makes him summon  ghouls on you
and why the heck cant anyone arena in vs matches
how many times did wows players beg for this lovely wouldbefeature only to find a deaf earblizzinsisting that you cant arena unless you are ready to pay for someone elses mistakesand why
so you can experience wows social aspect sighsocial aspecti understand that wow is a social game and you have to play it in groups to really appreciate its funbut what happened with the lich king expansion
heroics now arent worth crapunlike their worth in the burning crusade expansionand to get the best gear you have no choice but to join a guild that has hundreds of players now
in the endi paid to enjoy wow just like everyone elseso just because i like my friends and insist in staying in that little guild i dont have the right to get the best gear as everyone else
blizz is killing off smallerrpgoriented guilds that way and you are indirectly forced to leave your small guild and join a bigger one
in all honestyis that completely fair to everyone
patchclass specialization inconsistenciesokim a survivalist hunterneed i say more
hunters now cant even dpspvp as well as they used to
go to  to listen to thelogicalcomplaints of this player addressing these concernsinterestinglythis blizz member acknowledges the absence of hunters in arenasduh i wonder whyhunters have been nurfed down more than any other classapparently its not bad enough that hunters cant heal or tankonly dps
adeterrence used to be one of the best skills any survivalist hunter has now its completely worthless
bvolleys damage has been cut by 
it used to be one of the best aoe moves any hunter could have but now its somewhat worthless
etcrepair expenses are just so high in wowall my plate armorwearing friends complain of how they never have any moneyas a huntermail armor repairs are expensive too
is that blizzs concept of fun
a friend of mine told me that repair expenses are so high he actually knows some players who adventure without armor
im sorrybut im honestly not having much fun with wow anymorethank you blizz for screwing up your gameand turning a deaf ear to your playersif you want your game to succeedyou will have to please usnot yourselvesthis game is so shallow its like a kiddie pool
from the exploration to the questing crafting instances character customization itemsloot flying abyss guild management tools ui etc everything is paper thin and screams of a fp game
the world is perhaps the most linear i have ever seen in an mmo and you can only fly unrestricted in the abyss
if you havent gotten to level  people will tell you thats where the game opens up and becomes fun
um no
take all  layers of the abyss and put them together and you have the size of one zone approximately since most of it is islands and open space
the fortress and artifact battles seem intriguing at first until you realize that there really is no big benefit to having control of one of these things
questing in the abyss is beyond boring as it is in any other part of the game and the dungeonsinstances are the most uninspired i have ever seen
oh yeah and expect to run instances multiple times and not have any boss drop loot
literally even end bosses of a dungeon will often times drop literally nothing
nothingi got to level  in this game and realized that everything that was supposed to be fun wasnt and why keep going in this disaster
perhaps this game will be to your liking but it definitely wasnt to mineif you love spedning tons of time to level a character to suffer through the endless ganking of people of such a higher level than you that you cant even do any damage to them then finally reach lvl  to only have your acount baned for no apparent reason then to have no customer support talk to you after trying to call for  weeks straight then this game is for you
seriously there are so many people bailing on this game that by the time you level a toon to  they will already be merging servers
i have had  friends get there accounts baned only to have no response from customer support for the reason why and no ability to contact the aion gms if such a person exists that the guild of  that i was in is down to  for people who have gone back to playing console games because of the incredible lack of caring on the part of the aion team for their customer base
not to mention how retarded it is to try and level once you hit  because you are constantly getting killed by people  levels above you thats rightthere is pretty much no safe place to level up after level   you might as well wait until an actual mmorpg comes out instead of a mess like this
and yes i am bitter i put all that time in getting a toon to lvl  to just have it banned with no given reason and no ability to get in touch with someone who can help me after  weeks and what is more insane is that this is not a rare thing that is happeningi bought this game new and sealed on amazon but i have no idea if it is a good game or not because the activation code area on the quick reference card is blank
no idea why
if you buy this game i would check that it came with an activation code immediately when you get iti have been playing mmos since ultima online and everquest and i knew within  minutes this wasnt the game for me
it seems pretty far behind other current mmosi bought this for the sole purpose of not having to download  gb of game data off the internet do not want to strain my laptop
i finish installing and i am slammed with another aion update that is just as big
dont buy this  its worthlessas far as i can tell as of  this game seems to be dropping off significantly in terms of population at least on my server
personally i credit this to inability or unwillingness on the part of the game developersoperators ncwest to
balance the two races such that meaningful pvp can occur
as it stands now being an asmodian is a constant series of losing battles where you are outnumbered at least  to   i would imagine that some might enjoy being on the other side the elyos and slaughtering other players with no effort but such is not for me
bots characters controlled by software with no one actually at the keyboard are rampant almost completely uncontrolled by gms game masters simply because there is very little gm presence in the game
i suspect that since gms need to be paid at least some salary their numbers are kept low
kinah game money sellers usually closely aligned with bots not only broadcast in the chat channels and send you private messages they camp right in front of the brokers
again gm enforcement of the rules against this is almost nil which causes any respect for the other rules terms of service to evaporate
the logic for gaining xp experience points which drive the advancement of your character is such that at least in the general player opinion grouping with other players is actually detrimental
almost everyone solos
expect a lonely first few weeks of play until you have achieved the crucial level  at which point grouping becomes more necessary to survival
last but not least the chat channels especially the critical lfg looking for group have been taken over generally as a teen chat channel full of obscenities racism antisemitism and references to illicit substances and adult activities
yet again no gm oversight
i have encountered some mature reasonable people in groups but not many
i do not recommend that parents permit children under  to play this gamein short the betterknown world of warcraft has nothing to fear from aion online
i expect it to soon go the way of other mmorpg failures such as age of conan vanguard or everquest iiin short aion is a pretty game thats light on content and revolves around grinding
 pedestrian content thats noninteractive
there are only brief cut scenes that place the player in a passive role
theres almost no contextsensitive scripted or interactive events of any kind
just kill collect or deliver
 a glaring lack of content especially quests and pvp
for pvp theres only the most basic familiar trappings from pre mmos open world only  no organized or instanced pvp no rated team play et cetera
for pvequests the content is so thin and unrewarding in regards to experience and currency earned for completion that youll be grinding very early on time and money sinks are ubiquitous and detract from immersion chance of failure on gatheringcraftinggear enhancement which are all expensive experience loss upon death along with substantial fees to reclaim it expensive forms of rapid transit severe limitations on storage and trade etc etc etc the communicationchat system and user interface feel like they were birthed in  real money traders people that sell ingame virtual currency for real money are everywhere  flooding the chat channels endlessly with their announcements sending you mails and even sitting out in the open world for days with loud advertisements above their head
the tools provided by the user to ignore or filter them are amateur barely useful and place a burden upon the user
their automated characters bots clients controlled by programs that scriptautomate the functions of a human being litter the landscape youre forced to directly compete with them for resources quest mobs hell any mobs crafting materials etc
this all bleeds into the economy of the game since they have endless resources and drive up the ingame costs of items on the auction house
since the punitive grinding nature of the game encourages all of this and ncsoft developer apparently has no intentions of stopping it it continues to escalate daily
when i last logged off there were far more bots than actual players  as far as i could telldont waste your time or money on this game
and all of those pretty looking screenshots
lipstick on a pigthe merits of the game mechanics themselves have already been addressed in other reviews
it is a grinder but i expected that going in
the biggest problem with the game is that it has already been completely overrun by spammers and bots on all servers
a recent patch added a feature to block players by rightclicking but there are so many spammers for kinahselling sites this has proven to be minimally effective kinah is the unit of currency in this game
the worst problem is the same rmt companies have bots out in force making many places unplayable alreadyncsoft wests response to this has been tepid at best with occasionally one or two bans being announced the spammers and bots number in the hundreds per server i have witnessed this firsthand
their investment in this game is obviously minimal to have not anticipated this the korean version of the game has been out for  months and is even worse in terms of this activity
aion is a complete waste of time and money dont know what made me think aion was going to be a good gameits still in its shrink wrapobviously its now a fp and this version is literally worthless outside of the statuette insidenone of the digital items inside as far as i can tell have any redeeming value in its fp state unlike other games which went fp such as rifttera whos digital items still provided a use such as extra slotsitemsabout the wingsfrom start you dont have wingsand when you get them you can fly just for a limited timewtf you have hug wings and can fly only for a limited timealso the wing idea is old mu online anyoneabout the graphicsyou can personalize too much your character without limitsso it can look grotesquely deformedalso they look emoabout the landscape and the mapthe same lugubrious combination of colors used in their previous titlesthe mapsome islands and nothing more

dont buy this for someone as a gift even to a lost fanthis game was a pretty big disappointment
lets start with the goodvoice acting is good in places
most characters are well captured
some are not so close and the attempt to sound alike is glaringgraphics are pretty good
they wont blow your socks off but they certainly arent bad eitherthis completes the positive aspects of the gameon the down sidethe game is extremely linear
not only is there only a single and very narrow path but every single person you talk to will point you to that path and you will get annoying screen and journal updates at every turnthe inventory system is archaic
you get a certain number of slots and more items are available than what you can carry
you can barter items for other items but you cant sell for any type of currency
so if your inventory is full it will still be full after trading
your only real option to gain an item is to drop something elsethe inventory is moot because i really only needed about  items to finish the game however not knowing this i stressed over the silly system in placethere are multiple gotchas that will kill you
while this isnt new to this game its save system doesnt allow you to save manually
you will revert back to the last autosavethe gimmick in this game is the use of a camera
the problem here is that you cant just snap a picture
you have to find the exact angle zoom and focus for the shot to count
this is annoying but works ok in the flashback sequences but its outright ludicrous when trying to unlock extras via normal gameplay as you receive no clues to what you are doing wrong
the system attempts to tell you when the framing or focus is wrong but the framing can be corrected by moving in any direction so its no help
the game will even tell you i should take a picture and there are places that i literally snapped over  pictures trying to trigger an item and it never was correctwithout spoiling too much i will simply say that there is one place in the game where they limit your vision greatly limit your run speed so you can only walk turn your character around so you lose any location clues put you in the jungle so everything looks the same crank up the musical score so you have no audio clues and then give you about  seconds to figure out which direction to go and make it to a safe location before you die and have to start that section over againthe game is completable in well under  hours but this should probably be listed under pros as you wont want to spend this much time on this gamethe ending of the game was a single phrase no extra cinematic no plot development of any kindthis game does not add to any of the original lost lore or fill in any story of the actual tv series
you play a separate chapter and even though they boast the cast of lost will help you you wont learn anything about their adventures along the waythe puzzle elements of this game are all exactly the same
whenever you need to unlock a path you get a mini game that involves placing items of different values in a grid until it lights up
its pretty easy to figure out but gets very monotonous after a time or twothe biggest frustration comes as a fan wanting to experience a little more of the wonderful lost experience
you simply wont find it here
while shear lost fandom helped push me to finish this game there was no payoff in content story or feeling of accomplishment when i did
there were elements that could have almost worked in this game
the collection of items with trade value and sawyer as a fence could have been a nice element
the well rendered island setting should have created some nice discovery and puzzles
the deep lore of lost should have created a wonderful story sadly this game failed on implementation in every aspect
im filing this game under completed and never play againwell i wont give out any spoilers but i will say that this game was definitely pushed through for gullible lost fans and im one of them to snatch it up for top dollarthe voiceover acting is good in some points terrible in others
lots of characters are here but there are some glaring omissions like boone shannon rousseau and mr eko
for some inexplicable reason the lost theme music is intact for the first chapter but is subtly changed for all subsequent chapters
why change it
it makes no sensethe movement in this game will be either a slow walk or jogging  the character moves like a mannequin with overstarched underwearsure the facial animations are nice but the synching of the lips is completely off  theres no excuse to skimp here because we saw facial animations and lip synching done to perfection inheavenly swordplay time in this game consists mainly of jogging wandering around shooting taking pictures jumping sliding under trees like pete townsend and figuring out fuse puzzles
yep you read that right fuse puzzles
this game is very quick  with only seven levels most gamers will probably finish it in  days which is hardly worth its high price tagit would have been wiser for the game developers to wait and release this game  to  months down the road and give it more quality
some of the unlockable extras are nice but there could have been so much more to enjoy with more effortdie hard lost fans and people looking to become lost fans will be totally confused at why a show that receives such high ratings led to the production of such an inferior gamesave your money folksthis one isnt worth itand im a diehard fan of the series
the gameplay was so flat i think it couldve run on a nintendo
the voice acting didnt have the best voices and the characters were either so subtly played or over the top that they didnt have the same feel
locke was an insufferably annoying philosopher spouting of fortune cookie quotes about you and the island and providing little real help
kate and jack were tolerable but so ephemeral that the might as well have not been present
no other lostie was present and the camp was so small as to hold maybe  people not the  that are really castthe gameplay consisted of glaringly obvious puzzles and tracking through the jungle for  minute stretchs  minutes of walking and  minutes of waiting for the black smoke monster to leave
this alternated with  minute mazes where your torch or lantern was your essential life barthe flashbacks did much to make up for it and had a good feel
but nothing could detract from the shear awfulnessthe story was so abrupt so short that youd think the cast was stuck on the island for all of  or  days with the nd day being when the hatch is blown
no regard is made for canon except in the most vestigal sense
some neat secrets are revealed but nothing that couldnt be figured out from the showrent the game as the story is actually passable once youre past the inital gag reflex but trust me that you will gag eventually
or get it if you want an easy  xbox points which you can get in the first run through with minimal extra playthe series lost is one of the finest in television history
however the tiein products never fail to underwhelmthe makers of lost via domus faced a nearly impossible task  create a storybased game that fits credibly into a show thats already got three seasons under its belt and that comes to a decent conclusion even though the show wont end for several more years
unfortunately not only did ubisoft montreal flub this one they also forgot the basics of making an interesting and enjoyable video gameyou play as a passenger on flight  who suffers from amnesia after the crash
you meet with characters from the show and travel to island locales while trying to piece together your past
the interaction with other characters is very lockstep ie
you say this they reply that
this linear pattern becomes an overwhelming attribute to the entire game to the point that you feel like youre watching a very mediocre episode rather than actually performing anything yourselfyour memory comes back via dream sequences where you have to photograph select elements to unlock new information
as meager as that sounded ive just made it sound like more fun than it even is
you replay the same looped dream over and over again trying to balance framing and focus to get just the shot that its looking for
this element of gameplay alternates between bland and flatout tediousin between these revelation sequences you go on simple quests that involve familiar show elements such as the hatch the black rock the others etc
again its all very linear stuff  go there get that item bring it back here etc
there are holes in the script that allow you to break out of this sequence but you still end up getting handcuffed by the game anyway
for instance you collect coconuts suddenly its gilligans island and other island goodies to trade for useful wares
i bucked the system and saved up enough to get a gun from sawyer earlier than the developers intended but was then completely unable to use it until much later in the game when it was necessary for the story
but this led to ridiculous situations in the meantime  for example if im carrying a loaded gun why would i allow myself to be put into a holding cell and stripped of all my possessions
there should at least be options for how to handle situations but there arent
this also reduces replayability to zerothe graphics are generally very good and the facial models of familiar characters are welldone even if their movements are a bit robotic
voice talent is provided from many of the shows actors but the ones who are substitutes really stick out  particularly sawyer who sounds like a cross between ross perot and yosemite samthe only upside to the game is the ease of achievements
if youre into boosting your gamerscore then youve come to the right place
with the entire game taking only about eight hours to complete its the easiest  points youll ever rack up
just another reason why this one is a title better rented than ownedit loaded okay but comes up error when i try to start it
checking my system to find out whats wrong
disk is infine shapeits an old old racing sim
graphics are th rate
setup menu is a horror story
buy something decent and recentthis game was too complicated for me to get working on my computer
there is too much stuff i need to download and i dont think its compatible with my computerthis cannot remove the screws from the ds lite
it just scrapped the top of the screw and made it impossible to remove
it was a complete wast of time money and it ruined all efforts i had to fix my ds
total let down
i cant speak for how good this screwdriver is for a wii but for a ds this thing is horriblethis was the first pc game i have played  unfortunately it was boring slow had awful  frustrating arcade timed puzzles story was strange  the ending looked silly
even the voice acting wasnt good
the main character sounded boredi wont sell or give this game to anyone just throw it awayi am an avid adventure gamer but i quit halfway through the game
the spinning yellow lights puzzle in this game is so unbelievably frustrating difficult and completely irrelevant to the story that i immediately stopped playing the game at that point
whoever wrote this game needs to be forced to play that ridiculous puzzle for  hours straightthis game is just plain terrible
it is increcibly boring
after about  hours of wandering around you just dont really care about the game anymore
it has absolutely  no point
the premise sounds interesting but trust me its noti was so pysched to have gotten this game set for christmas and immediately loaded it to play which is where my problems have begun
ive installed and reinstalled gothic  multiple times now in an attempt to get it to work but to no avail
i continue to receive an access violation when starting up gothic   you need to be aware that the issues im having are very very common and as of yet ive not found anywhere on the internet that has a workaround
to top it off piranha bytes is unreachable for support and dreamcatcher has yet to respond after a week and  seperate emails
edit dreamcatcher never responded to any of my attempts to reach them
after  months im going to assume they have no intention of doing so
very frustrating because what little ive been able to play of gothic  the game is almost unplayable due to the insane increase of difficulty with the expansion im sure i would have throughly loved all  games
so please please before you buy this product do a search on the web for gothic access violation and see how completely common it is to buy a broken game
this is completely unexcusable in my opinion and truly hope to save someone else the money that we have wasted on thissys specs alienware  core duo  win   nvidia gtx gothic  as soon as the initial onversation begins the picture becomes frozengothic   when you come into proximity with torches the character freezes the screen gets choppy and shortly after the picture goes blankgothic patched  believe k   unofficial patchesgothic   found no patchesyet nwn diamond and nwn  gold work guess the game manufacturer did not want to update this productgothic i and gothic ii will not open on my machine
we have tried everything
with iii i can install but get a message that something is wrong with the disc
i go on but can tell some things are missing
i cannot get an inventory on some monsters that the walkthrough indicates should be there
the game is a mess but could be enjoyable if the technical aspects were fixed
i have installed the patches and cannot imagine what it would be like without them
technical support sent the manuals for i and ii but says the manual is one the disc for iii
the manuals are sketchy and not much helpif you have win dont waste your money as it barely worked and crashed constantly on win xp
win vista and win they never came up with decent fixchose a ubisoft game if you want a good air combat sim and stay away from this oneyears ago i had an early version of the microsoft combat game and it worked super on a windows  i now have a windows  with a logitech extd joystick
i had great hopes when i loaded up this gameboy was i dissapointed when i tried to fly a legendary mustang
the aircraft couldnt climb and do a loop no matter how fast i was going
it turned like a oil tanker and couldnt go very fast even flying straight and level
then i tried the pit flew no better
a waste of hard earned cash  at least for me it was
moparwhen i purchased this game from amazon i certainly looked forward to its arrival
even though i rated the game in the negative i certainly cannot rate amazon or  the seller as such
when amazon contacted the seller they went head over heels to make me satisfied
even though they no longer stock this game they said that they are issuing me a full refund of my money including shipping any sales tax and the price of the product itself
i think this is way above and beyond the call of duty and i appreciate it very much
i high recommend this seller and would incourage everyone to deal with themr
corneliusthis battery would not charge in the psp or the psp charger made by sony both of which i purchased on amazon
the charger did work with the battery that came with the psp
both batteries were identical same product code
all i can say is defectivecouldnt play it not activation possible
no solution neither support from developers at all so frustrating and sad
do not buy itfree time installation has been known to require a anti piracy download known as securom which fries cd burners slows your pc and has been even known to disable your pc
purchase at your own riski can honestly tell you that as long as the hdmi wire you buy is properly shielded p certifiedect it doesnt make a difference if it costs  bucks or im not saying go by the cheapest possible wireim stating that labeling for use with ps is a sales ploy in the sense that any decent hdmi wire can b successfully used with a ps
if you read the reviews for some of the cheaper wires  make sure that they certify them to do what u need them towhether it be bluray or video game console any good hdmi wire will suffice as long as its shielded  p certified
 u will save a bundle i have a monster wire that normally runs  bucks  i have bought several different cheaper brands commonly found on amazon in the  to  dollar range there was no difference in picture or soundand i have a high end receiver so if there was any benefit to paying more for hdmi wires i would being that i am willing to overspend when theres a benefit to it
 i tried all combinations of wires from verizon hd box bluray player ps ectall to my receiver then to my  samsung lcd so any difference to discern would be noted  bottom line shop around read the reviews and never believe anything that comes out of a salesmans mouthcable doesnt cost this much
you are getting ripped off
please dont buy these they are at least x overpricedthe official sony cables are nothing but junk
the ones that came with my ps stopped working after a short time
this for something that you need to charge your controllers and to link to your controller to your psgo out and buy a standard usb to mini usb cable
it will work fine and you wont have the official sony hassle
its also a lot cheaperwhile i like my games on the ps sony is a lousy company with bad support and overpriced accessoriesthis game will not work on windows vista
i called tech support and they said that the game will not work with vista but i can try the compatibility mode
no luck there either
so this may be a great game or not but stay away if you have vista
as a side note the jewel case came crackedyeah this game run ok on my computer but i have a core  quad and gb or ram however the guitar that comes with it is not very responsive but it does ok i guess the reason i hate this game is because you only get  songs
i guess if your an expert and beat tom morrello on some expert whammy bar crap then you might be able to unlock more
i dont know
even in practice mode there is only  songs
when i get around to it i might see if there are some cheats online to unlock some other songs
i just got it today and im so dissapointed i may never play it again
any way there is one pro
this guitar works with frets on fire  op and thats the main reason i bought this anyway
it was just a few bucks more to get the game and guitar bundle than the guitar alone
so i guess its no big dealthis is by far one of nintendos worst accessories
by reading through the reviews here you can tell what one of the major problems are it takes too long and too much effort to assemble the gun and the games that utilize it arent worth that effort
once assembled it feels rather robust although that little nunchuck cord holder will break for sure
once you have the gun forget any notion that youll be able to effectively use any of the buttons on the remote other than b  then comes the play control
having the remote mounted on top of the light gun gives you much less accuracy than youd have if you were using just the remote by itself
aiming and shooting is extremly clumsy and the sensor bars weakness is even more evident herethen comes links crossbow training
this game is a waste of time
its overly difficult given the clumsiness of the gun and it seems as though it was thrown together in a single day
it doesnt even come in a dvd casejust a cheap paper sleeve like wii sports
i played the game without the gun and actually did much better while still being pleasantly challengedfinally aside from  or  other games theres no support for this
and like the nes zapper i foresee a huge shortage of support for this in the future that zapper only had duck hunt hogans alley and gumshoe
save your moneyfirst off im a wii owner who has no plan to buying any other systems ive owned every nintendo consol so far and ive never owned a xbox or playstation
so this isnt an attempt to bring this rating down for any fanboy reason i just didnt like this productin fact i hated this product because i wanted it to be so good that it was a major let down
i found the zapper itself basically unusable and the nintendo gun not the game is the reason i bought this
i used to love playing duckhunt with the light gun and this sadly sucks compared to thati read a review of this on a game site that wasnt favorable and figured they were just being overly critical but after about a half hour with this i knew they were dead on
the main complaint is the trigger button is mushy and you just cant shoot fast enough when there are a lot of things coming at you
what i learned from the gamesite review was that the mushy trigger button is because there are no springs to make it feel tight and pop back into position it just returns to position from its own momentum
it didnt seem bad at first but after playing with it for a while it was stupid that they made it this waysecond complaint was also one the website had and that is its uncomfortable
the hand that holds the front grip is put in an uncomfortable place and after a while my hand started to hurt
i switched hands i tried holding it with just one hand but it was just too uncomfortable for long time play
i couldnt wait to take my wiimote out and just use it to play the relatively fun zelda game only to find its not that great of a game without a gunthe website and me also agree with the other reviewer who complained the wiimotes buttons are out of reach if they were needed in other games they wouldnt be accessible
something i would forgive and say maybe this is a gun just for links crossbow training if the first two problems didnt existif it wasnt for the trigger and the uncomfortable design this would be worth more then twenty at least   if they had put some real effort into the zelda game
the game isnt bad but its pretty basicminimal in design and not much fun without a gun in my opinion
you may love the zelda game and feel this is worth the  dollars because of it but i cant see how anyone is happy with the zapper itselfnintendo had showed off a gun that looked like the old light gun design at a  gaming expo i hope they reconsider and bring that out or at least something better then thisbuy a classic controller and download some games for your virtual consol insteadnintendo is selling you a two cent piece of plastic and a video game that will make its way to bargain bins around the world for less than two dollars in a few months
the wii zapper isnt needed to play shooters on the wii
in fact it only hinders the gameplay with a poorly implemented trigger that doesnt feel as tight as actually pressing the b button on the wii remote yourself
i am astounded that nintendo has the guts to release this for twenty dollars on the unsuspecting public
its hardly worth what they sell it for and youll end up with a useless hunk of junk cluttering your home and years later youll wonder why you even wasted your time and money
you can play all of the shooters with just the wii remote and nunchuckas for the game links crossbow training will hold your interest for about five minutes you might as well just purchase ghost squard for thirty bucks and get a full game for the near  youll spend for what barely amounts to a game and a useless hunk of junkthis product is terrible
it is poorly designed and a pain to usedesign problemsthe stock itself is too small for most adult hands
the spacing of the fore and aft grips isnt very deep
this will put your arms into an uncomfortable position for playing
the trigger is located on the front grip
this is completely counterintuitive
this will force you to either hold the device in an unusual way or operate the trigger with your lessdominant handyou are forced to assemble the controller before useremove a cover platelock the wii remote into the forward portion of the stockunlatch the nunchuck cord holder which is very flimsyinsert the nunchuckfeed the nunchuck cord under the stockwrap the nunchuck cord inside the stockrelatch the nunchuck cord holdercover up the wrapped nunchuck cord with the cover platefeed the nunchuck cord to the wii remotefigure out what to do with the dangling wii remotes wrist strap nintendo doesnt provide any mechanism for thisafter that process you can finally use the glorified wii controller mount
was that worth your effort
no way
placing the wiis controller in a gunstyle stock is nonsensical
your sighting down the device in no way relates to the reticles placement on the screen
this is a limitation of the wiis sensor bar
its a onesizefitsall affair so it cant be calibrated very precisely besides top of the set versus bottom
the top face buttons on the wii remote are impossible to use while the zapper is in normal use
you will have to hold it in an awkward manner to operate them
the transposed b button the trigger seems cheesy
it is sloppy in feelthe packin gamelinks crossbow training is a snore
its a very shallow target shooter
the design is a direct rip off of twilight princess
the levels dont even appear to be changed significantly
nintendo put the least amount of effort into this game as they possibly couldmore wii shovelwarethis is another example of a company trying to cash in on the wiis popularity with another subpar product
avoid this like the plague
it has no redeeming qualities
you can actually be more successful at shooting games using the standard controller
this only impairs your abilitiesthe wii zapperwell it sucks
it looks like it would be a lot bigger but its not
its very flimsy and light and quite honestly poorly made
it is odd feeling the trigger button stinks and it just feels overall a bad videogamegunthe game that comes with itis not fun
dont let other people fool you it is not interestingyou are much better off buying thewii perfect shot gunby nyko andhouse of the dead    returni had already owned an xbox and it kept freezing up on me but it wasnt covered under warranty because it did not have the  flashing lights
so i got a gift certificate for christmas and decided to use it to buy another  because i still have many games for it
plus the new xbox is suppose to be better built and it came with  free games
boy was i wrong the first week of playing it and it started freezing up on me again
so now i am so furious at ms and i will never buy another ms product ever again
what a garbage of a gaming consolethe games are great the image is wonderful it is a pity that the machine is garbbage
i bought mine on jan   that one broke and was replaced with new one by microsoft in september today jan  that one broke and i am to send it for repairs again
twice in one year
the console is used by an adult  hour a day in average
refunds
no they will not refund a penny just send it in and well send you another piece of garbbage that will break in  months time
there are great games  for other consoles as well so steer away from this horrible contraptionxbox customer support greatwhat they should change is their engineering and manufacturing departmentsi had the xbox  for a short time when i got the  red lightsits true that the graphics are nextgen but whats the point if you cant play itfun playing while it lastedfirst of all id like to mention the fact that i owned the original xbox for years until now to me it was the greatest video game console i have ever played being a videogamer since the atari  times
it had great games battlefront ninja gaiden prince of persia trilogy etc and cool features and so far i had not even thought about moving to  since i still had pending games for the original xbox
that changed when it was announced that ninja gaiden  would be released exclusively for the xbox  me being a huge fan of the original ninja gaiden and given that xbox games can be played by the xbox  console decided to sell my old unit and order the new  so i cold get ninja gaiden  when released on aprili ordered from amazon the console on january and it arrived on the th everything seemed to be in place i came to love forza  and played a little my old games i really didnt use the console that much since my newborn son wouldnt allow me to
things started to go wrong when ninja gaidens release date was moved from april to may then from may to june
amazon would do a great job informing me of the changes as i had preordered the game and ask me if i still wanted to buy the item given the date change
i then decided to buy a  game to play and utilize the new features of my xbox and i got call of duty  the game was terrific and i quickly became addict to it i then started to use the console more often
about three weeks ago i came home from the office and turned on the console the disc tray made a strange noise and there seemed to be no disc on it as the dashboard had the open tray text in it i was almost certain i hadnt removed the game so i checked the game was indeed in the tray the console would simply not recognize a disc in it
i tried cds dvds and other games and got the same result no disc was recognized at all and the tray made noises every time i openedclosed itthe console had a warranty note asking you not to go back to the retailer in a case like this as they may not be as well prepared as their technicians and contact their support center instead
i did that and after waiting on the line for a while a person finally answered i had to struggle with them as they could barely speak english since i do speak spanish i tried to make it easier for the guy i dont know which part of south america theyre from but even in spanish i had a hard time understanding what he was saying and had the guy repeat almost everything he said
this person asked me to contact my supplier first and see if warranty applied even though the warranty info on the box asks you to go to microsoft first the reason for that he said was that the supplier could simply change the unit and provide me with a new one
he told me i could mail them my console to fix it but if that were the case it was likely that they would simply replace the disc drive with a used one if the console need to be changed they could mail me back a refurbished one at the risk of it being an older unit without the features of the one i purchased of course had i purchased their extended service contract they would gladly send me a new unit free of charge
after spending  in a videogame console and with only  month of use i found this unacceptable and could not believe a microsoft representative would tell me that
i went into the xbox  official website and was able to find document number  which explained some potential resolutions to my problem none of them mentioned by the rep i talked to on the phone none of them worked and the last option was to submit the console for them to check it
while surfing on their site i found that there are so many users having this and so many other problems that made me wonder if i wanted to keep the console
after telling some of my friends of my experience i found out that most of the ones who own an xbox  have had problems at some point and have had to mail them to be fixed one of them has had to ship it three time alreadyafter all these problems i simply decided i did not want to keep the console amazon would accept the return after their day return period but would refund an  of what i paid
so i shipped the unit back to them and am waiting for my refund
so far what should have been a better gaming experience has cost me  i will not get from the return  of a videogame i will not play anymore  of a battery i had to buy for the control  of the shipping charges and my old xbox unit
youd think that after paying all this money for their product you would expect quality not only of the product but their service as well to me this was nothing but a waste of my time and moneyid like to think i simply had bad luck but after reading in their own web site i can tell they are having lots of problems with these units my dad who is a sales manager at a retailer store told me customers return these consoles all the timehow did the xbox turn into this
i dont know really word of advice if you already have the old xbox do not sell it i regret i did with mine and if youre thinking about buying this reconsider your options and think if this is what you want system was packaged improperly airbags filling under half of the space
the system rattles
the system is not the pro version no hdmi or hdd
it was built october of 
the old versionand thats after a long wait since they backordered itif i hadnt already gotten games as gifts i would just return everything
as is im returning the amazon order and ill go buy it at targetdisappointing  solitaire overload had many solitaire games but the graphics and the fun of it compared to other games that are ds was simply disappointingi tried this solitaire collection while waiting to get a copy of clubhouse games
im  female never played video games in my life  never have been at all interested
my grown sons guffawed at my nintendo ds purchase
in my defense i bought it for brain age   and then thought it would be perfect for long transcon flights   if i could find some adult kinds of games that didnt involve blowing up cars or hopping across rivers  avoiding alligatorsi was sure that so would be the answer
it would have a gazillion different solitaire games
hot doggies
this would be the entire family of the famous game we all play while on telephone hold rightwell sort ofthis software is just okso suffers most from lack of instructions which i feel are important especially since solitaire games are very similar to each other
i finally got out my hoyle book and another card game book for instructions on how to play these games
there are no instructions in the dox
altho there are some onboard for each game theyre pretty obscure
as i said i got out my hoyle to help me understand the onboard directions
really now one shouldnt have to consult another source to play the game
really lacking on the consumer support
id like to be able to search by game type but this does not appear to be possible despite the search feature
slider down r side of screen is so sensitive as to be almost uncontrollable
if you hate shopping carts that wont steer youll hate this failure too
positives  user may change wallpapers choose music including a shuffle option and change card reverse pic
resolution is sharp in the wallpapers
the cards themselves are a little hard to read but its a very small imagestill and all there are a lot of negatives so i decided to keep lookingstop here if you dont want to read about the game i found and love as long as i was hunting again i decided i wanted something that had more game variety than just solitaire card games which is why cg had looked so attractiveif i had known about touchmaster  i wouldnt have bothered with so at alltm has plenty of games for the solo player including several card solitaires
in addition to very good concise onscreen instructions there are instructions for each game in the liner notes in the case yay
that are wellwritten and lucidhas a wheeloffortune type this has only  categories alas so repetition happens pretty quickly word search etc
several card games will help you brush up your   and  addition facts
some games are strictly chance others involve varying amounts of skill and strategy
you can read elsewhere in detail about the contentall games are stylusactivated
a big plusi must have spent  hours with this software tonight
yes i should have been grinding on my lengthy todo list but i just couldnt resist
ill probably play some more after i finish this review
 forget so
use your  for tm
you wont be sorry you passed on so
compared to tm so is a nonstarter
i cant get the star rating to change to a star
what id really like is  a star
mbi bought this based on the review from gamestop when it just came out
and i was very dissapointed about it
the graphics was alright
but i think they just rush it to making this game and thought they would  make a great deal of money
but they just ripped people off
the game is awfull i didnt like the story either
the fighting was badcrappy
if they put more in to it it could of been a good game
so much a wastei bought this game thinking it would be like the previous kingdom under fire games
alas that was an idiotic assumption
this game is utterly different from the previous incarnation which was like dynasty warriors
this one is a basic button mashing dungeon crawler
honestly the only thing given great thought was the graphics and the item creation system
those two things are insanely fine tuned and awesome
albight they kind of crippled the item creation system with their patch
the idea was that theyd slow down the process of super items being created and force people to spend more time on the game
what happened instead was that now only a handful of those people that were playing the game are left
if you wanna play this one rent it and enjoy it while you cani cant believe that this is the second game in a series
it seems that a group of incredibly lazy developers fished this out of their toilets to cash in on a popular first title
i played this on a friends recommendation
he has played the first game and was certain that the second would be great
i was angered by the waste of both time and money
my friend would not believe what i had to say until i gave him the game to play himself
he is still apologizing
now i will never play the first game or any other title in this rancid seriesi wanted to like this game so much
there are a lot of things done right in kuf but ultimately it was not enoughthere is hardly any story and although the gameplay is not bad it just simply does not amount to anything
if you like mindlessly leveling up forever and ever for no apparent reason then you may like this but for an intelligent gamer well we simply just want more you know substance
an utter disappointment not recommendedi was recommend this game at gamestop they claim it was great good storyalot of action
so i ordered it and i was so sick of it
i took it with other items to goodwill
not worth buyingi picked up this turd new at a wholesale club for  last weekend
what a total piece of garbage and a complete waste of my hard earned money
the graphics are s grade the talking tracks are infantile and stupid no save ability a once you die you start over from the beginning format and the horrid game play all contribute to this being one of the worse games for the wii of all time
i dont even have the heart to give this to the goodwill charity it will be destroyed
avoid at all costsgame is too hard because you only get few continues
they should of put unlimited continues
a game like this is suppose to be relaxing but if your trying to beat it with the limited continues you have to really stress yourself and reload extremely fast and shoot fast and at that point its more of a torture than funi was disappointed when they brought the house of the dead games to the wii
the st letdown i was hoping they were going to update the graphics and horrible voiceovers
i like old school games just as much as the next person but i forgot how horrible the graphics looked when compared to resident evil the umbrella chronicles
the other letdown was what happened to unlimited continues
some may consider that cheapbut to each his own
even an auto save after each level would have been nice
its not like i can jam quarters in my wii to keep on playingwow
i really thought this game would have been a lot more fun
i couldnt wait to get down to some serious hacknslash action
i didnt know my character was going to have to run a marathon to do it though
seriouslyrunning all over that map is very boring
i know they have their goofy leystones but you still end up jogging all over the joint
pluswhen you do get somewhere close to some action its either pointlessly boring or impossibly difficultgood the gore factor is turned up to ten on this one
love the finishing sequences
the game is sufficiently brutalloved repeatedly stabbing that legion champion in the face over and overbad unfortunately the brutality of some of the sequences doesnt make up for all of the boring inbetween stuff
the ending of the fight with the legion champion was probably so gratifying because it was so frustratingly boring getting to that point
fighting on inclines or declines is ridiculous
you end up missing your enemy half of the time
the multiple enemy combat is pointlesss
get surrounded by  enemiesyou die almost all of the time
i thought this guy was supposed to be the ultimate viking warrior
in the endi was expecting a viking version of god of warinstead i got a slow boring version of dynasty warriors without the ability to actually lay waste to multiple foes during a battle
the developers dont seem to know if they wanted to make this game tactical or arcade style
they got themselves stuck in between with some end product that just isnt fun at all
i could go on and on about how many of this games interactive aspects are so unbelievably flawedbut i really dont feel like wasting any more of my time on this onei just bought my first ps on dec  and i decided to start from the beginning so i bought not only  games but   and even  also
i love hack n slash games but viking battle for asgard is a piece of crapi have seen ps games with much better graphics than this horrible game and the gameplay is just awful
i only played for  minutes and was tedious and just unbearablethank god i only paid  bucks for this gameare you serious
this thing is one of the biggest pieces of trash ive ever played
so far it is absurdly boring quiet and pointless
my first let down was that you couldnt really hit anyone or anything unless it was shining
even though it looks pretty with the blood and all the fighting is just really boring in this game
too much running around and just wow there is nothing good about this game
seriously why was this madei bought ps because i thought the gaming would be better
you know all the hype and stuffwrong
this game is so bad
you character is so slow
when enemies attack you in numbers you have no chance of winning
you also have to talk to a ton of characters
lets be real this is just a ps game with better visuals
the game play is horrible
the so called special moves are not very special
they dont help you beat enemies in large numbers
im so mad at ps right now
i use my ps to watch blue ray movies far more than i use it to play games like  of the time
ps games at this time are terrible
only a hand full are any good
seriously dont buy this game
you will be very disappointedtitle explains it all
just go buy yourself a wii for for a little less
or go buy the best console in quality and specs which is the ps
much better than this very disapointing
i have all the  and none are any gooddid not really enjoy this game
the graphics are horrible
i do like the customization
the ai is not great and the detail is really poor
this game should have been more improvedsorry i found it boring
i thought there would be something to this but after a couple of hours i put it away
if nothing even remotely exciting happens in the first couple of hours of playing i have little hope that things will improve
as someone else said if petting fish is your bag great
i can do that at the fish market dead fish might at least be interesting since you can eat them too
when i play a video game i want to have at least a little funi bought this for my husband as he loves to play plane simulator games
the game is apparently online only and when he went to play nobody was online playing it so its useless and he wasnt even able to use it
waste of money who thought of this stupid rulethis would be a great game its a lot of fun to play except for one huge problem
the game just ends before you can actually finish a game
you will be playing a fun game then out of the blue you will get a message saying the game will end in  turns and then it ends
its like playing a nascar race game for a  lap race and then after  laps the game just says sorry the game is over you were in rd place on lap  you will never know how you would have finishedand even if you manage to reach a victory condition the game just ends
you can not finish advancing the civilizationso until they fix this huge bug and allow you to play as long as you want and many others have brought this up the game is totally worthless
and this is really annoying as the game would be great otherwisesid meiers civilization revolution feels like a awfully dumbed down version of a total war game
seriously this games controls are awful
after playing total war games and actual civilization games this game feels like it was made for little children
if you want to play something fun do not get thisi havent had this much frustration since the good ol days of playing military madness
increase in difficulty comes not from skilled ai thanks to good game programming but due to blatant cheating
how in the world do i lose a battle of  vs  or any battle in which i have the numbers advantage
if randomness what is the point of a numbers system and more importantly how come i never seem to get such results in my favor
and how in the world do the other civilizations grow and develop so much more quickly than minethat said ive lost many hours playing this addicting game and will lose many more in the future no doubt but for the sake of anger management and avoiding breaking my disc andor xbox ive had to move on to another game
hopefully if there is a revolution  it will feature better programming and no cheatingupdate i finally got so fed up with the cheating that i ripped the disc out of the system and destroyed it
sequel or no i wont be touching another game made by sid and his fellow incompetent programmersthe variety of weapons  such in this game coupled with the cooperative multiplayer almost makes up for the fact that the game is yet another repetitive  boring fpsthere are no difficulty settings in this game so unless you are a first person shooter hardcore fan you will get stuck quite often
i play a lot of games and love the first person genre but without the difficulty setting the game is only suited for people that have a lot of time on their handsst let me start by saying that this game starts great but ends up being a lame duck
i got over the cheesey graphics when the game started
the porblem was that the game play starts as a new type of game sort of like bioshock but thats all they have in common
the guns in this game are lame and as the levels increase the guns start to suck even more
it takes several clips of ammo to kill one enemy
the levels do get harder and thats cool but the guns do not get any better which is why this game sucks so bad
i bought it when it came out and quickly lost interest
i traded mine in and put the money down on the new left for dead  coming out in november
this is a rental at best and im being nice
the truth is this game sucks periodi so wanted to like this game been a civ fan for years
ive been trying to like it for two weeks now but it is horrible
poor game play insipid and annoying
not really civ at all its more like a description of civ given by ritalin deprived forth grader as a book report except a forth grader would imagine better game play
also  for this
really
a very sad turn for civi guess i should have read reviews on this product before purchasing it
any assumption i made that any company that would place such a well known product on the market would take advantage of the power of the playstation  and live up to the reputation of sid meier the game i have played on a pc or mac for the last decade was completely and totally wrong
as it regards game play it is way too easy to win compared to the pc version and represented no challenge whatsoeveri think the most annoying part of the game are the advisers  they chirp with this shrill highpitched garble
i mentioned this to my friends and colleagues and those who like the game mention that they still have to turn the sound down or just offthe expectations represented by the franchise the power of the ps the lame gameplay the cartoonish characterurization as in characature not character the incredibly annoying speech represent one of my greatest disappointments i have experienced in a game in many many yearsi love civilization  the pc version so i am a big fan  big
however i was smart enough to rent this game before buying it
it saved me dont buy this game
about  way through the first game i found myself thinking about other things
this is a bad sign
i did make it through the first game and didnt want to play a second game
i returned it to the video store several days earlybottom line is that the game was not fun
it was boring very boringafter much research in deciding my next pc game i chose this one until borderlands  goty was released
unfortunately since i was both eager and new to amazon i ordered the ps version which sat on my table while i tried to find someone to take it for free
pretty sure it ended up in the garbage can
so much for borderlandswell i guess if i do not have anything nice to say i should not say anything at all but here we go
i was bored with this game within the first few hours of playing it
trilions of guns fast paced fps rpg elementsnot really
trillions of guns that look almost exactly alike run of the mill fps and if you call walking around doing the same thing all the time rpg then yes it has rpg elements
i am sure this is a fun game online but at this point i really do not care
what a waste of the game seemed like a quasi fallout  wanna be
fallout  was pretty good but i even got bored playing thatprosgood graphics and smooth controlsconsboringafter playing it and my room mate beating it twice within a week
game is boring
same group of bad guys yawn over and over
same scenes  no original concept here  just another boring shooter than had to be crank out before the deadline
anyone thinks this is a great game must either be  years old or a online phony navy sealspecial forces wannabe
horrible game that i can even get  back at the local trade indont get me wrong  great series overall but it got dumbed down to fit on the ds but is still too complicated to play effectively without a mouse and keyboard
in other words this game is too complex for the ds and too simple for the computerand there is no undo move button when you let the stylus slipi donot like this game at all
though it has lot of stratergies
the usability is not good
i love age of empires but not this onehere i am giving the  another chance with the elite version
nope mine broke down like all my other  after a week that i got it
people dont get a  you will not be pleased i am trading this junk with a ps which by the looks is better and has great games out
free bluray built in is great toafter my first xbox  died and was not covered by mswarrenty  i gave in and bought an elite with the new falcon chip
only because i have alot of money invested in games and accessories
i also wanted to finish assassins creed
hopfully this one will last longerfor all you fools out there singing praises to this new falcon chip its too early to tell if it will hold up over time considering its only been out for a few monthsi love the xbox  but will give one star because i had to buy two and have to pay extra for for an elite with a chance it has increased reliabilitygame keeps freezing the case was cracked
that was just horrible  man that was a waste of my time and moneythis game gets very boring very fast
the graphics are very cartoony and unimpressive the sound is good the characters are uninteresting and you cannot create your own only change name colour etc
the enemies get old very fast and are very uninspired
the claim to thousands of guns is bs its the same guns just different colours
why am i still typing this game sucksonline activation required on top of securom disc check
that means that the game functionality relies exclusively on ks servers servers go down  your game stops working
ea learned their lesson
k and activision still havent apparentlyalso you cannot save anywhere in this game
it uses a limited checkpoint system
shows that developers are too lazy to even port this game properly from consoles
just because consoles are pathetic and cannot handle save anywhere you dont have to punish us pc gamers as well you hear that gearboxin any case the lack of a save anywhere system is a clear indication that intelligence is not a requirement to play this gamekeep those in mind before you buybasically when you install the game another programsecurom will be installed with it
here is a simple list of why this is bad
the securom program may cause problems with your computerslow downs and some have had parts of their computer break and stop legal software from working
the publisher can use securom to download information about you and your computer
you cannot delete securomvery easily even if you delete the game the securom program still is running on your computer
securom canmay open up security holes on your pc
securom stops legitimate software from workingi only played it for an hour and hated it
most people play in as teams im single player and i found it so badly made it made me ill the graphic looked like a ten yr old made em
with cheap stupid backdrops for landscape
dumb is saying it is good and this is the dumbest thing ive seen in a long long timewish i could get a refund
not worth the money unless you play on line
no for a single pc player
beware to the buyerive been waiting for this game for years
ever since my favorite pc gaming magazine announced that it was in development i thought an fps mixed with some rpg elements and geared for multiplayer
sounds great
unfortunately theres a pretty big difference between the idea and the delivery
the most important facet is that this is in all ways shapes and forms a direct port from the console done terribly as well
page up and down to scroll the quest text
maybe the developers didnt realize the pc industry started using this great scroll wheel thing sometime around fifteen years ago
the controls continue to ignore everything about the pc in just about every decision
im surprised we even get the chance to redefine the controlsthe biggest irritation though is on the very first quest if you arent actually in the town before the little robot stops it will fail to recognize that youve killed all the bandits and never continue the story
this is unacceptably poor quality assurance
a gamestopping bug on the first levelthe celshaded graphics look really great in some games but they have too much texture detail in this game making it very hard to distinguish between objects and killing your depth perception
it looks tacky and last minute the only scene so far that even looks passable is the intro
its not like other games havent tried this and succeeded xiii looked great because its textures were sparse and you could really get in to the comic book effect
not so with borderlandsthe rpg elements are thrown in to give the player a sense of advancement gaining better abilities as they continue
this works pretty well but gearbox dropped the ball when they decided to go whole hog with the rpg treatment forcing the player to pick up and return quests at job boards and npcs
this is stupid
i want to run through the world blowing things up and throwing bullets everywhere not going back and forth to turn in questsfinally k games is taking the ubisoft path of drm requiring an internet connection to authenticate the game so you can play the singleplayer story
why
because its supposed to be secure or something like that
im not going to argue that all drm is a bad idea but dont force me to have an internet connection if i want to play alone
you already require that i have the disc in the drive thats already enough of a paina friend played borderlands for the xbox  and liked it
go buy that version if youre that desperate to play this shoddy bugridden piece of junkthere is no reason for multiplayer to have this many issues to where it is impossible to play
it seems like the developer gearbox did not test this function almost at allsummary  avoid this until updates or buy it for console
if you intend to buy this game wait for the price to drop while they update the game until its actually playable on multiplayerone of the key features that was advertised and still is advertised is the multiplayer
there are so many things wrong with this that it should not even be advertised
lets look at these problems game freezes at join online game menu
you cannot access the list of current online games because of thissolution forward router ports officially supported by the developers website
connecting to a private game always times out player is never able to connectsolution same as solution for problem number  games are hosted by players and no dedicated servers are even possible
this causes obvious lag which coupled by the clunky controls makes multiplayer gameplay insanely difficult to playsolution none
there is no sign that they expect to change this
even if you do manage to correctly forward router ports and connect to any game if your game loads into a new area which happens fairly often all players except the host are disconnected and the game gets stuck at the loading screen forcing termination of the programsolution 
wait for patchconclusion multiplayer is impossible for this game in its current state
it is possible to connect to a game but nonhost players cant load into new areas
this is necessary to progress the game and hence multiplayer is impossibleif you want to discuss purely singleplayer content much of it is decent but it isnt interesting or engaging and is still problematicthe major problem with single player is the clunky controls
forget that the menus are not adapted from console to pc many menus are navigated using the keyboard and cannot be used with mouse
the aiming clearly just doesnt work
many times i have put my crosshair right on an enemys body or head and it misses to my amazement
not to mention that often when you fire the game loads the bullets being fired or the blood or something like that causing a slight lag right when you need to be lagfree the moston story there simply is just not much
this advertisements make this game out to offer great exploration and player progression
most quests are identical kill these collect those go there and offer little story value
the player progression system uses mmolike skill talent trees
most characters have same or similar skills which do not alter their gameplay style very muchconclusion even the single player while being playable does not offer much for gameplay and storythere have been excellent fpstps games with a comicbook aestheticxiiiandarmed and dangerousspring to mind
unfortunately borderlands is not one of themthere have been excellent rpgfps hybrids likefallout orstalker but borderlands is not one of them either
and this is not even the real problem
the real problem with borderlands is that it does not even know what it istrying to bethe graphics are colorbook cartoonish
they did stay inside the lines but they get no brownie points for the end result
unique designs and creative explosions are nowhere to be found instead the environments look like they were designed with a cookie cutter
loose focus for a moment and you might find yourself hallucinating of having entered a violent pixar cartoon  complete with a walle lookalike
one without a real story that isfor a game that pretends to be an rpg it makes no real difference what class you choose to be the hunter the siren the soldier or the berserker the special abilities fail to offer distinctive flavors
leveling up is just windowdressing as the enemies not only they respawn but they seem to match your level
and on top of that the quests are really boring i had not been so bored with an rpg ever since that pathetic sequel to a great gamedungeon siege iispeaking of dsii remember how paying to have your weapons enchanted was useless because the items you could buy outright were far superior
guess what the quest rewards are far better than anything you can find
sure there are different weapons galore but quantity of weapons could never outweigh a couple of wellthought out weaponsfinally could someone please explain to me since when do cpus needdrivers  and what is this stupidly packaged game doing installing an amd driver on my intel i pc
honestlynow lets talk drm
again k games insists on special custommade versions of securom
using securom as a disccheck is my red line
i can accept it as a barely palatable solution
borderlands is supposed to do only that but it clearly cannot shake its rootkit pedigreethere have been reports from gamers who managed to buy the game before the official release date and could not activate the game before that
thats right borderlands requires online activation one can install offline only after downloading and installing a third party license driver
so much for a simple disccheckan online activation means you do never actually own the copy of the game you paid for
the possibility of you reinstalling and replaying the game again in the future depends on the availability of the required activation servers and the will of the game publisher to allow you to do so neither of them a giveni find it infringing on my rights as a consumer and a citizen when the products i pay in full get stolen back by the seller himself under the guise of fighting piracy an ironic excuse alreadybioshockwas a good game ruined by its overzealous drm scheme
in the end its publisher smelled the overbrewed coffee and had the installation limits but not the activation requirement removed
at the time of its release bioshock was a good game but not good enough to be worth its troublewell borderlands is not even goodi heard so many people say this game is so great it doesnt even need a demo
wrong fanboys
if there had been a demo i wouldnt have wasted my time
borderlands was so bad that it actually made me consider pirating games without demos  something ive never even thought of doing beforeborderlands is one of those games made for coop
it should be fun right
wrong
coop just didnt help borderlands at all it was just that bad
the game as a whole is insanely easy repetitive and downright boring
aside from that the story is horrible and practically nonexistent and most of the time the humor just isnt that funny
even when the plot presents itself its riddled with plot holes
the characters are bland and generic as were their abilities
there was a complete lack of enemy variety more often than not youll find yourself fighting the same guys over and over and over again
its essentially just a bunch of running back and forth to complete dull generic missionsborderlands was advertised as having bazillions of guns
thats true enough
but all of the guns end up either looking the same or looking too similar
most of the guns are worthless junk not even worth picking up
and whats really sad is that the most fun thing about the game is finding the loot
its that badthe gameplay is dull and lacks any sort of depth
characters technically have only one real ability which makes it insanely boring
to add insult to injury the games bosses are complete crap
theyre downright pathetic and dont offer any sort of challenging fights
aside from that the ai is really really dumb
most of the time theyll end up getting caught on rocks allowing you to kill them with easeand another thing claptrap is extremely annoying
theres no way to make him shut up at all so most of the time youll be forced to listen to him unless you complete all the missions he tells you when missions are available
the rest of the voice acting wasnt that great eithergameplay
the gameplay is extremely dull and didnt offer much to keep me interested
coop didnt even help out very much
to make matters worse you cant just save whenever you want to
you have to run to a checkpoint before you can actually save
if theres a reason pc gaming is dying consolization is probably the most majorgraphics
sure the graphics look kind of neat but they just slow the game down
theres no easy way to disable the stupid cellshading crap unless you go edit your files yourself
if viewtiful joe and unreal tournament  with its horrible bloom effects had a baby borderlands would be the resultnot that viewtiful joe had bad graphicsfar from it vjs graphics worked wellai 
the ai is really freaking dumb
i mean come on
half the time they get stuck because of a stupid rock and other times they just stare at you until you shoot them
even older games like unreal and quake  have better ai than this
the boss ai is downright terrible and the bosses dont even offer a real challenge as a result
the guardian angel constantly warns you of a big challenge but every time she opens her mouth the games gets easier and easierplot
the premise is interesting at first but the first plot holes show right when you step off the bus
the humor worked well in some situations but fell flat the rest of the timemusic
the only thing that borderlands did right was the music
it fit the desolate and abandoned them perfectlysound
the games sounds were poor overall
the weapons sounds were absolutely pathetic they sounded like peeshooters or toy guns not actual weapons
the voice acting wasnt outright terrible but it wasnt good either
there was no atmosphere to speak of
aside from the music in the background and occasional wind noise there was pretty much nothing going on and there were no supporting sounds to give the game an atmosphere of its ownall in all borderlands is one of the most boring games ive ever played and ive played a lot of boring games
the gameplay is bad the plot is terrible the sounds are pathetic and the ai is dumb as stones
the only real reason to get borderlands in the coop and even then its not even worth gettingim sorry  but infamous is actually better than prototype andwhat would you do if you had super powers
become a hero or become a villain
infamous on the ps gives you a chance at bothtired of a mediocre at best game freezing on me or mucking up every time i load it upcons game freezes more than any other or recent memory other than farcrys corrupted saves problem story is dumb combo button moves are childishly stupid and reduce the game to button mashing i could never get the controls solid and ended up killing people i am supposed to consume half the time in most games right trigger is some form of attack in this game its sprint
except when youre in a vehicle
but not when you have a gun
yaconfusingor just stupid
 stuff enemies movie so fast knock you down so often you cant get your bearings and end up having to run around like a stupid chicken with your head cut off the powers dont really make any sense
why does he have a blade growing out of his hand
why can he make a spike go underground
odd powers can be cool shooting bees out of your arm in bioshock but here it just seems silly and not storydriven trying to survive in a helicopter with other helicopters around attacking you seems impossible autotargeting is gtastyle ie not good map is ugly and uninspired getting disc is unreadable errors now
lovely
the disc looks brand new and spotless
pos
been on the same guys like phones or whatever its called mission for an hour now to too freezes and dumb disc errorstheres more but why go on
i have no reason to hate on this game
its just mediocre and i dont feel like playing a mediocre game that wont even let me play it without freezing or getting some goofy error every time i try to do somethingthankfully point lookout is coming out soon for fallout and i dont have to put up with this garbage anymore
very disappointing
the early videos made this game look greatlike it might be a sleeper hit
instead its just a sandbox with a lot of sand and not many toys to play withok ill give you this the first  minutes of this game are awesome
youre running up buildings smashing tanks ripping combat choppers out of mid air and killing mere people is laughable
but then after about  minutes you realize youre just doing the same thing over and over again
theres no real point
its a giant sand box game with no real goal or structure
if your thing is to destroy tank after tank or chopper after chopper in the same way then you may dig this title but thats a total one trick pony in my book
that will not stand
gave the game away after taking it out of my xbox because i knew i would never put it back inhmmm yeah the plot in this game is really boring
marella doesnt even consider this a fullgame its more like a minigame based on throwing automobiles with a lame plot thrown in to blind players from what is truly ismarella believes the idea meeting for this game went something like this guy   wouldnt it be awesome to make a game based on throwing carsguy   of coursemarella is not to fond of throwing peoples cars im sure their insurance can take care of it but stillmarella gives this game a solid first thing that broke was the paddles
that required remapping those functions to the buttons on the wheel
the wheel is too small
this thing is a toy
if youre really into pc sim racing get a momo or better yet a gi really really wanted to like this gamei saw the commercials with the sharp graphics and witty funny dialogue and thought this is going to be a great game rightwrongand i am sorry to say thisnowi play a lot of first person shooter games and some are better than others obviouslybut ive never played one that had so much promise and failed in almost every concievable way possiblenowbefore i get to the terrible parts let me start with the very few positive availablelets start off with the graphicsthey are very realistic and youll be surprised great they arethe best ive seen in a game of this type so farthe duel acessoriesweapon selection is cleaveryou can repair any vehicle pretty fast with a rivottype gun which is usefuland the dialogue the men in bad company during the campaign is actually pretty funny and comedy is certainly a nice change of pace in a game about war and deathand the coolest part of the game is actually firing the artillery pieces with a airial view a lot of fun especially onlinenowhere comes the bad parts which are considerable so bare with me through all of themlets begin on the game mechanicsselecting weapons are cumbersome and awkwardyoull shuffle through one only to realize that you skipped itand you would think that the standard lr weapon select system would have been more than adequate to easily get the job donebut l selects the acessories and r selects weaponssecondary weapons like a attached grenade launcher should be on l and use r to firebut disappointingly enough its an acessory so you have to select it with l which is more than awkward especially in the heat of battlethe reticles are almost useless and is hard to guage if you even have your target on it and the recoil moves it around so much you easily lose track of the enemyrocket launchers are underpowered especially up close where they shoulb be the most effective like hitting a guy in the chest and him not dyingand a lot of the weapons you use online and unlockable ones you need special codes and they are extremely hard to get and then even more can only the be unlocked only if youd pre order the game lamenow to the campaignthe story is the backbone to any first person shooter and without one severely dilutes the online part which it does a lotthe whole concept is about finding enemy gold and smuggling it out so everyone there can retirealthough this sounds like this is a great idea and a novel concept its actually becomes stale and boring very quicklylike i said i had no problem with the voice actingbut some may find it to be dumb and repetitivealsothe intro just throws you into a russiantype country without any backstory or explanation on how and why you are there which is the biggest flaw in the gamea good portion of the enemy ai
even on the highest difficulty are dumb and are easy targetsand finally onlinethere are only two settingsgold rush and conquest modeand you can only get conquest mode only if you download it off of xbox live and please do its head over shoulders better that playing gold rush by farthere is absolutely to talking in this game which i found wierd in a game so strategic as this oneat first i thought my mic was brokenbut then soon discovered after playing several consecutive games that theres simply isnt any at allthis might be a good thing howeverbecause there is a lot of team killing that occursand i do mean a lot of itthis was preveilent in the first battlefield gamebut no where near the level that it is nowthe hud is useles as wellit doesnt show you where your team is at accurately and enemies appear as little tiny dots that you can barely seebut you dont have to worry much about thisbecause snipers rule this gameyoull get picked off from a thousand yards away and have no idea what happened until its too lateand dont ever ever get into a vehicle especially a helicopter with your teammates aroundbecause they will deliberately shoot at you until you die or the vehicle is rendered completely uselessmost players also have better weapons available that you do and if youre up against them you might as well leave the gameyou only have about five maps to play on and only two of those are worth playingthe are big a bit too big and although you can select which spawn point you selectby the time you get into the battle the actual fighting is now a thousand miles away from you and youll find yourself running or driving to the front linesoverall this game is a big disappointmentif you expect a great game youll be sadly mistakenedi lay all the blame on the makers of the game who should have realized all of these problems and actually fix themthey deserve a special award for poor game design and flawed unsupervised online game playand a thrown together jumbled mess of a story linei could actually go on with more problems with the gamebut that would drag this review even furtherif you have to play this game i suggest you rent itdo not buy this gameits a waste of time and moneyto finish all i have to say is this game might very well be the biggest disappointment of any video game and any genre ive ever seen and i hope i have given you all the information you need to avoid such a dreadful game as this one turned out to bei like the razor mice simply cause they seem to be very professionally made
the look the design says its a pro gamming mouse
and when you get it it is a great mouse
there seems to be a defect with the left mouse button
ive owned three razor mice in the past year and a half and they all seem to break due to the left mouse button sticking or double clicking
i havent gone back to razor mice due to the defect but i hope they fix it
ive never abused the mice ive owned and i do like them
if in the future they fix this id gladly go back to razor
i think its because the buttons are to sensitive and prone to breaking
over all it is a pro mouse just need to fix the defect
hope this helpsproslots of customizable buttonsglides the best of any mouse i have usedi liked the razor softwareconsstopped working after a week i had to return it the mouse would no longer trackdidnt fit my hand well though i adjusted the way i held it it was ok at best crummy at worstthe build quality was cheap it had some rough edgesthe buttons werent placed very well it was hard to use the side buttonsi have a death adder that i love but it just doesnt have enough buttons for me and having on the fly dpi adjustments is important to memaybe not others
i have had many different mice over the years the lachesis looked good on paper but not in the real world
the lachesis seemed to work really well until it just stopped tracking
the buttons still worked and so did the scroll wheel but it wouldnt track
i would have to say this mouse is pretty much a failure for razor especially when you read all of the people are having problems with this thing
too badi would have to recommend staying away from this mouse there are too many good ones out there
i decided to replace this with the cyborg ratcyborg rat
 gaming mouse for pcmaximum pc gave it a  kick a award i am going to give it a try
i will review it after i have had it for a whilei bought this thing thinking it would be great for games
i have used it for a few months and must say it is probably the worst mouse i have ever used
the tracking on this thing leaves much to be desired
it gets real choppy at times to the point where i have to actually have to disconnect it and then reconnect it to make it work properly
also when i disconnect it and then reconnect it sometimes the mouse cursor does not not move but the buttons still work
i have configured all my profiles
just so i know it is not my profiles after disconnecting this  or  times the cursor will start moving finallyalso i am using this on a razer exactmat so i know it isnt the mouse pad
i have updated the drivers and also the firmware on this thing running windows  as well and this thing just will not work for more than a hour till it starts malfunctioning
i have ordered a coolermaster sentinel advance mouse which is much cheaper than this thing and does much more
i will probably never buy another razer product again till they get their stuff straightened out and also i use a lycosa keyboard which i will write another review another day on it and it isnt prettyi cant believe companies put broken products like this on the market
this is by far the worst mouse i have ever owned
the mouse skips all over the screen
the cursor randomly gets hung up and wont move
the cursor moves by it self
the buttons double click randomly
you would think it cant get worse right
razer released firmware and drivers to try and fix the mouse
this software is corrupting many peoples computers so they have to completely reinstall windowssave your money
dont buy this piece of junk
use a ball mouse before you buy this thingfunctionalitymy lachesis has never worked 
even after installing the most up to date drivers and firmware the pointer will still skip up to the top of the screen
it seems to happen a lot when im using my right mouse button to move my game camera aroundthe programibility and macro functions of this mouse are on par with any other gaming mouse so nothing special thereergonomicsthis mouse takes a while to get use to the way you grip it is different then a typical mouse
its by no means superior to a normal shaped mouse and so the steep learning curve many days is truely a negativethe button placement on the right side are such that they are next to uselessease of useout of the box you must go online to update the firmwaredriversyou must make sure your mouse pad remains clean from lint and hair as this affects this mouse more so then other miceconclusionlook im not saying this mouse is a useless piece of junk
what i am saying is this mouse was a huge waste of money
at the time i purchased it it was  and it has never worked  i paid to get a top quality gaming mouse and instead got a buggy product that isnt much better then any run of the mill  mouse
update i have tried this mouse on windows xp vista and win  the pointer still will job to the top of the screen at random timesi know that most of you know the storyline so i wont go into that except for thisthe storyline is great
the idea behind the action is wonderful
very interesting mixture of horror and science fiction
no problem with that
the problem is with the execution of the game in and of itself i have an xbox  so those are the controls i usedfirst there is the movement
the movement is in no way fluid like say fear or even oldschool doom
the movement is a bit dullsecond the minigames the asteroid action is the worst ive even gone throughi tried to get through this for two weeks did not workthere are some interesting innovations
the zerog is interesting
the slowing down of time is also pretty neat way of dealing with enemies
too bad that there are sections that because you cant get through them youll never know how the story will endof course you must realize that im a casual shooter fan
not big into those kind of games but if the story looks good then i try them outsame with fear   but because these games are not for the casual shooter gamer then theres no way to knowgot it for myself after playing a demo on the ipad
it arrived on time good conditiononce i put it in the xbox  i got a message error
wrong disc region
i have a neighbor who has the same console and there also we got the same message
basically it never worked and i donno what im to do with this game now obviously theres something wrong with the disc
as to regiona issues i never has this problem as i have both pal and ntsc games currently running on my xbox  in summary i was sold a bad disc and since its not from a store i cant return it and tell the seller face to face that the disc he sold me has a problemid appreciate it if someone can tell me how to operate this gameim putting one star for it coz i havent been able to play the game to rate it properlyi read and heard lots of buzz over this gamelet me tell you it was a disappointement
ok so the graphics are good
big deal
the story is lame and the weapons are very weak
this guy moves in slow motion so you get hit all the time
this game was not worth the first bad tom clancy game ive played
i love rts games and all his other stuff but this by no means worked out
voice needs to repeat  times to work by then you are dead
shame was a good ideanot my style of game
basically you give verbal commandsby the way you need a headset to play to the game and watch the game play itself
its like watching someone else play the game while your in the back ground saying go there or attack them
my opinion its lame tom clancy should of stuck to his typical games which was the only reason i bought iti was so exited about having the rumble feature on my ps that i bought the product the minute i saw it
saddly i had  minutes of rumble since then i havent been able to make it work
andto make it worst he company that sent the item gave me a  discount in a  item because of my troubleoh and i still have the controller brokenyes i too made the same mistake as other customers buying the psp  battery chargerin case you werent paying attention this latest edition of sonys psp battery charger comes with a cord that must be used in order to operate and charge batteriesthe whole point of the psp  battery charger was its compact design that included the outlet prongs attaching directly to the unit itself
it was a perfect travel companion but nowjust a hassleit is actually much simpler to charge a psp through the supplied ac adapter included with the psp itself than it is to use this thingluckily i had a generous return policy and got my money back right awayuntil sony upgrades this product and ditches the cordi wont go anywhere near this thingmine came in a plain white box and was clearly cheap low quality build compared to the orginal
do not buyto answer the first question on everyones mind yes
this newly redesigned psp  case will fit your psp game console even if you have the mah battery with extended backplate
there is designated cutout in the rubber that allows the psp  to rest perfectly in place with or without the extended battery covernow the explanation for the one star ratingthe case itself looks a lot sleeker in the package and in pictures than envolped around the psp system itself
it has a cheap plasticy feel to it complete with a second rate floating hinge that always seems as if its on the verge of breaking loosealso unlike other psp cases ive owned the psp logo isnt etched or inscribed onto the case lid even though it looks that way in pictures
the psp trademark on top is just a thin piece of printed cardboard placed underneath the clear shellthis case also comes complete with small rubber grips that when opened properly can be used to stand the case upright so you can view video files without holding the psp in your hands
only problem is the rubber grips never seem to hold onto whatever surface its standing on
it will slowly start to slide downward unitl it is laying flat on the table the counter the desketcthis case looks feels and performs more like a  cheapo instead of a  quality product
for this price i would find something better and you canvery easily instead of settling for this lesser productit didnt work for me either
dont bother get the original brand name adapter
it is not worth your time going back and forth with the seller and shipping it backa recent reviewer said it didnt work and it didnt work for me either
yes i know how to set up an ethernet connection
i followed the instructionsturn off wii connect  turn off wii connect wired ethernet turn on wii configure a wired connection
no dicei tried two ehternet cables
i have a w routermodems that is supposed to work with wired wii connections
i tried to conect the wii to the same port that works fr other devices
i even unplugged the wii connected ethernet and plugged the wii in againi think this product is terrible
i did by second hand but this products doesnt seem to fit the standard wii controller i have
the gun seems to be to thin to except the controller into the top portion and when placing your wii control into this device it almost seems like you are going to break itnot very pleased with the construction of the device at allits a cool idea  but i dont see how the trigger is suppose to work when its not touching any buttons
ive tried to put it together and use it several times and people have come over to play it and cant figure it out either so i havent used it
either my wii isnt detecting it or the trigger doesnt work on minenothing like purchasing a product and then upon receiving it noticing that it is broken
i wouldve loved to of given this product a good review
but unfortunately due to the negligence of the seller was unable to provide that review
maybe this wouldve been a decent product to use i guess i will never knowi dont know what happen with the others reviews but this item is terrible
first of all you have to disarm your wii remote to insert it and after playing about  hour is terrible for your hand  ergonomic i think im gonna buy the wii zapperthis gun is so uncomfortable
when i grab it  the handle is huge
i can only press the trigger with the tip of my fingerassembly of this product is not good
went to put control in and the plug went inside the plastic gun and now theres no way i can use it without finding a jewewlers screw driver and disassemble to try to fix it
do not buyi dont know if bourne conspiracy developers got confused with the movie heat because the game plays like heat with a few bourne scenes from the movie and a few repeating bourne close combat moves thrown into itthe game makes jason bourne very unlikeable character and only knows a few hand to hand fight  moves over and over again
in the movie bourne is a thinker
in the game he behaves like a psycho killerit is  point a to b you cannot do anything else
most illogical about the game is when its timed escape with very limited time bourne loves to go into hand to hand fights than trying to run as fast as he can to escapeunless you like bourne identify too much this game gets boring very fast because all the fighting are very repetitive with not creativitythis game will suddenly ask you to hit a button
you have about one second then you die
your map is also kind of lousyalthough i read reviews on amazon saying that it works for wii ware games it did not
buy a g or g sd card and it will hold more than you would ever needit was not the correct card
although advertised to fit the wii when it arrived it was for a nintendo game cub not the wii
very disappointed but didnt want the hassle and wait of returning iti did not like this game
the graphics were very good but i really didnt like the game itself
i found it very hard to handle the controller with the games i was playing
i just felt silly working the controller during the game playit was justoddi tried it twice and then sold itwii controller does not work properly with this game
for example in alpine skiing i cant accurately steer in the direction i want
its very frustrating
its a huge waste of timethe music and the graphic are okayi regret buying it
i should have rented it
mario  sonic at the olympic games is much better in terms of good controlling better graphic and more funthe wii belongs to my wife
im an xboxplaystation kinda guymy wife likes games that are easy to understand not too challenging easy to playwin and fun enough to keep her interested for  minutes to an hour at which point she usually gets distracted by something elseme i can play games for hours
i want a game thats difficult challenging and unique
i like games that make me think and challenges me to find new ways to complete tasksneither of us liked winter sports on the wii
the controls are completely senseless and have no relation to the task at hand spare possibility the lugeskeletonbobsled games which require nothing more than tilting a controller to keep the craft centered on the track
the controls for speed skating made no sense whatsoever and the curling controls were in a word stupid
the controls for ice skating were so frustrating that we only played it once
they simply had you jerking on the wii controller and nunchuk attachment when icons for the two controllers reach a circle at the bottom of the screen
the problem was we could never get the controller to read accurately and felt like there was a literal th second gap of opportunity to register the movement
very very frustratingthe other various subgames give you instructions on how to control the sport but no indication of how to reach success in the game
for example it took a few passes down the bobsled track before we realized that you wanted to aim your craft for these lightcolored strips impossed in the ice while a success bar would fill at the bottom indication successful completion of each turn
if we had been instructed in this method before our first time down the track it probably wouldnt have been so frustratingthe graphics look nice until you realize that theres little intelligence behind it
during a twoplayer speedskating challenge i pressed the ready button and both character figures on my split screen took a launch stance at the starting line
my wife had not pressed the ready button yet and so both of the character figures on her split screen were still stretchingi love the winter olympics
i love winter sports
but this game isnt worth its value in melted plastic
id have more fun falling repeatedly on my butt on an ice rink then playing this game for any length of timesave your money
buy something elsei so wanted for this game to be good
i just couldnt sit and play it more than once
the controls are horrible
if you want to be frustrated this is the game for you
graphicsum bad
the game had so much potential but it just did not deliver
pass on this onenot sure why but my son hates it
he said that it was too serious to play
complete waste of moneythe visuals are crap the game play is linear and the sound needs major improvement
over all it just sucksignored all the bad reviews and got the game 
should have lisened to the bad ratings
what a boring game with the same mission over and over and over
played it for a week and finally give up with fustrationelectronic arts and now ubisoft thinks everyone is a pirate waiting to happen and for some reason they seem to think that paying customers will put up with just about anything to play their gamesso if you buy this game be aware that youll be limited to  activations and then youll have to call ubisoft at your expense if you want to install it again
i dont know what ubisoft charges for phone support but it probably isnt freewhat is an activation
install the game thats an activation
change a piece of hardware that uses an activation
reinstall windows without changing any hardware that uses up an activation
you might even use up an activation upgrading a video or sound driver
adding a usb peripheral device could use up an activation
you get  of these then the game ceases to function and youll get a message saying that you need to buy a new copy not call them for more activations as it should saysecurom has been known to give users errors or not allow an installation to occur due to cddvd drive incompatibility problems usually older drives
you will typically get crc or checksum errors while a file is being read from the drive
securom also maintain a black list of processes where it wont allow the game to run if you have one of these black listed programs installed or runningsecurom is just plain bad news for the honest customer and to make matters worse it hasnt had much impact on piracy at all
in fact the pirates enjoy greater freedom and far less headaches than the honest customer
spore is a great example of why securom is bad all the way aroundfor more info search google or wiki for securom theres lots of info out theresadly i will join the mass of other users who will not tolerate activation to play a game i legally purchased
why is it games like sins of a solar empire can sell millions of copies being protection free and other companies have to saddle their games with activationi just came from ign after seeing the  review and this is a game ive been wanting to purchase but just now noticing the same bs that was on spore
 im not interested in spore for a full  dollars im not about to ask a company to play a game after ive handed over  hard earned dollars
yes yes the whole premise of getting  activations sounds good on paper but the whole deal of securerom humming in the background of my computer when im not playing the game just doesnt work for me
i use my pc for web design and work use i dont want it saddled with unnessesary bsi mean really if even just half the people who said they cancelled buying the game actually did thats thousands of dollars in lost sales
i can understand the need for a comprimise somewhere  a company protecting its property and users not wanting activation when they buy a game
surely some sort of middle ground can be reached
pc gaming has been doing fine for years with a simple cd checki dont pirate games so all this does is inconvience me a legal purchaser
i dont know the solution but all i know is i will not ever purchase a game with which i have to activatebuyer beware
this game contains the securom virus
once installed securom can not be deleted even if you are the administrator of your computer just like other viruses
if you do indeed want to remove it you must download and run a special clean tool again just like other virusesi was so looking forward to this game
the original far cry was one of my all time favorite gamesjust to set the context regarding what i like  my ratings for some popular fps gamescrysis  crysis warhead  call of duty   call of duty   far cry obviously i like great graphics fast action game playvaried and somewhat flexible settings and weapon choicei have a dual sli  gtx intel quad core  gigs ram vista  bit set upwith a big apple cinema displayi give far cry  a  out of   i wish i could give it  starsactually let me make it a  out of  because of the promise of the technology usedhowever this is the most ridiculous frustrating game of all time for methe game treats you like a fool of the time you are running around with nothing to dothe missions are lame and repetitivethe weapons suck
the novelty that they get jammed is stupid
it gets old after the third gunfightthe whole premise of being sick with malaria is unpleasant and lamethe graphics technology is promising but the actual visuals are dullwhat a waste of money and more importantly what a waste of timei couldnt care less about the licensing technology that others have complained about that it only lets you install on this many machines and that many timesone install was enough for meid like to forget this game ever happenedi have been replaying crysis and crysis warhead missionsto get this game completely out of my mindid like to preface my review by stating that in no way has my opinion of the game been swayed by the drm used for piracy protection by ubisoft
this review is solely in regards to the gameplay itselfwith my pure enjoyment of far cry and crysis i was extremely excited about the release of this game
unfortunatly when i began playing the game i became more and more disappointed as i played
in fact if it werent for the graphics this would easily be considered an instant bargin bin titlei have so many gripes about this game that im not quite sure where to begin so i will start with my biggest one the firefights
you have so much against you from the very beginning that it is extremely difficult to find them enjoyable
in fact you feel as though you are being punished just for taking the mission
your gun will continuously jam
you have malaria so in the middle of a gunfight you may need to pop a pill to get over it everything turns yellow and fuzzy
if your health gets low and it will continually from all the sharpshooters they have in africa you must first pull the bullet out then you must heal yourself
i must ask
why
i suppose it was to add tension but only succedes in being frustrating
you will die often not because you get overwhealmed by the incredibly stupid ai but because of a gun jam having to heal yourself with a two step process or because you get a malaria outbreakas i get off that rant i invite you to another
lets investigate the whole sandbox free roam open world direction in which the developers decided to take with this sequel
first off the compass is horrible and the map is even worse
not because they are a bad concept they work extremely well in gta and games of the like
the problem is your objective is sooooo far away that even when you pull out your map because it isnt a full map all you see is the general direction you are supposed to be going and not able to pinpoint the best route to take or where exactly your objective is
this is compounded by the fact that you hit several checkpoints more on these later that ensue a forced firefight and i believe i already explained how much fun they are
it will take you at least  minutes to get from point a to point b because of this
rediculousnow remember the checkpoints
these lovely roadblocks are apparently set up by guerillas no not gorillas who attack you when you come close
i guess that makes sense however the frustrating part is after you destroy a checkpoint they respawn so every time you drive by you get attacked again and again and again
if you try to blast through in your vehicle a car chase ensues sounds like fun right
wrong because no matter how fast you are going they magically appear behind you and if they shoot your vehicle  or  times it stalls
and i bet you thought the engine was in the front of the vehicle
so because of this you end up getting out of your vehicle and you guessed it a firefight begins malaria damn gun jammed shot need health pull out the bullet use medi deadfinally the vehicles themselves
for some reason the geniuses at ubisoft only give a st person view of driving so you try to drive look at map and compass at the same time and because the vehicle handles so poorly you hit a boulder and the vehicle stalls out so you get in front of the vehicle and fix it
get back in and hit a lovely checkpoint further upthere are several other nuances in the game like no checkpoints well theres lots of those but i mean autosave points so hit f alot or your  minute trip from point a to point b can take you  minutes
there isnt really much of a story here to be found either so you really just find yourself doing side missions even the main missions seem like side missions which dont give you much of a feeling of accomplishmenti realize i have been on quite a rant and most of my reviews are not as negative or sarcastic as this
as a matter a fact i dont think i have given a single star review to anything before but this game definitly deserves it
as i attempt to leave with a positive remark i am at a loss
i could mention the graphics however theyre really not better than the original far cry and i can max them out on my machinei was extremely disappointed and feel my  was just wasted
ive played the game for about  hours and cannot bring myself to finish it and thats an extreme rarity for me
with all the great games coming out this year spend your money on something elsethis is a great game
i think its physics and graphics are the best i have ever seen
however  is a lot of money to spend for a game that you really only are leasing for a few years or if you are unlucky and have your pc repaired a few times replacing hardware you wont be able to run this game anymore
thanks to drm
and thanks to drm i wont get to play this awesome gamei went to purchase for  identical systems mine and my two sons
it is a lot to always drop  for each new game that comes out
but i have been doing it for years
the family that kills together stays together
yes as others have noted this type of a system dont keep the pirates away they hacked it already
it keeps the people that pay awayheck if they wanted to look amazon keeps records of purchases
mine go back  years
they can see every game i ever purchasedand always in s or s
if i can run a local server so we can play against just the  of us i buy a th copy and run a dedicated serveri also love ubi games and want to support them but i cant pay for what is a short term lease
there are some old and classic games i still playlike bf and bf alien vs predator black hawk down serious sam postal  doom  doom is s
and a classic
this is just the wrong solution to the problem
i wont use a free hacked version either
the honest people remain honest
but this is a great game and long after this game is no longer drawing in  and it is in the bargain bin a while this is the type of game that will become classic and a copy will sell on ebay used for  or more
drm long after the support stops for this game will leave me with no one to turn to when i need to upgrade my system yet again  times in the next  yearsi had this game preordered have been watching nearly all of the developer diaries and reading lots of hype for this game for a while nowi was very much on the edge of my seat waiting for this game to be releasedthen came the announcement that ubisoft was going to be using an activation based drm implementation on the gameafter seeing how quickly other activation based drm protected games were available in an unlocked form i came to realize that so many other people were rightthis isnt about stopping piracy  it simply does not work
publishers are shooting themselves in the foot by using these overly complex protection schemes to ensure a sale
the long term damage from angered customers just doesnt seem to get factored in to their business decisionsinstead of fostering good will with their customers they are forcing a first sale by creating an environment of fud where a person buying a game off of ebay or amazon marketplace is worried about the install count remaining on a game
what nonsensecan you imagine buying a copy of this game from amazon marketplace and find out that there are no install counts left remember artificial limitationthe buyer gets a defunct copy of the game and has to fight with ubisoft for another install count
its not their fault but they have to deal with itat the same time i was looking forward to this game i knew that cd projekt had been taking customer suggestionscomplaints to heart and were working on a massive reworking of the dialog forthe witcherthis free patch was released in september of  along with digital copies of the map soundtrack making of videos game manual and game hintstricks book
that shows me that they truly understand what fostering good will is all abouti could have easily gone and purchased a used copy but i instead decided to preorder a retail copy ofthe witcher enhanced editionno activation
to show my appreciation for all of their hard workif you buy this game from ubisoft you are telling them that it is ok to limit resale
you are then setting a precedent for other publishers to do the samedoes anyone rememberbioshock
that game certainly is well known for multiple things one is its the first game that truly brought the activation requirement to the fore front
since it went on to do great in sales and customers didnt really rally against it the precedent has been setits ok the customers said well deal with it
we just want the gamewell guess what the publishers heard you loud and clear and are happy to deliver the activation process as part of your gaming experience
so what
 you may say ill just buy the console version or just buy a copy and then shelve it right before i grab an unlocked copyyou go ahead and do that hand over your money to a company that is determined to strip resale rights away from their customers
the next thing you know youll find that this practice migrates to consolesafter all there isnt much left that makes a console stand apart from a pc in terms of tech
sure a pc can use better hardware but for a vast number of customers a current generation console is good enough for their graphical needsin summary im rating this product as a dudwhile i may have a blast playing it now will the internet required lock for this product work years from now when i can afford to play this game with maxed out settingsi have a  core  quad  bit system  gigs of ram nvidia  gx with  gig of ddr that runs everything smooth as butter on maxed out settings even the notorious system hog crysisfar cry  ran with a terrible frame rate even with the eye candy turned off the resolution way down and my video settings turned down a couple of steps from optimalan email to ubsoft tech support got a quick response with a generic cover all the bases answer that showed my query was not even read
even after trying the fixes recommended there was no change in performancethanks goodness amazon has a great return policy
this game is going straight backthis game cannot be purchased you can only rent it due to the horrible drm system
dont support customer abuse dont buy this game until ubisoft removes the product activation limitthe worst frame rate and mouse response ive seen in years
unfortunately i didnt know that it sneaks in some drm so now i have to go figure out what fecalware it installed that the uninstallers doesnt remove
of course now im out 
thanks ubisoft
i wont be buying anything like this from you again
the game is in my trashvery simple this is the reason i did not buy crysis warhead now it is the issue again
so i am not going to buy it this game starts out fairly fun
soon it comes down to coming up on check points killing all and moving to the next
over and over and over  zzzzzzzz  very tiring
not much fun or challengewhat more can i say about this bad game that you havent read before
all the one and two stars rating reviews are accurate
i will have to add that i really dont understand what was all the hype about this game on magazines
most video game magazines were talking about how good or great this game was supposed to be but you just cant substitute a particular magazine review with several actual players reviews so if you really are planning to buy this game think about it and dont waste your hard earned money like i did with this terrible gamethis is not a game reviewit is a thank you note to all the people who did review this gamethanks to you i will not purchase far cry  or any other game that has limited downloads and places a virus on my pcwhen i buy a game it is mine and i can play it whenwhere and as many times as i wish toany producerdeveloper or publisher that puts any kind of restrictions on something i buy just lost me for a customeri just purchased a very expensive gamming rig to play all the new games that are comming outthanks to all of you i will not be buying games that download a virus on itkeep up the good workthat is why i have an xbox on stand bymy thanks to all of youjohnny akins ps
i just thought of something i would like you to trydownload a game with securom or starforce drm protection then when you are through with it unload it from your pcthen use your system restore to restore the pc back to a time before you downloaded the gamethat might workthe product installed properly but the cd code was invalid
it wasnt used just invalid
ubisoft provides no further online support and its expensive calling them overseas from a military post
i was on hold for as long as i could stand and now all i care for is a refund
unfortunately because the game is opened there is no refundi just threw away moneyeven worse i discovered malware on my computer after installing
really drm securom malware
ask any real tech and theyll agree
these antipiracy programs are rabid and reduce your computers performancedo yourself a favor and do what i should have done
buy a book and wait out the securom scam ubisoft and ea are engaging in
the cure to piracy is becoming a new disease for legitimate playersim tired of having limitations placed on something i buy legitimately
go after the pirates take the to court stop screwing with your honest customers alreadyuntil ubi and ea backs off the limited online activations and quits treating paying customers like criminals i cannot recommend this game to anyone who wants to own it
this is nothing more than a cheap ploy to artificially keep the price of the game high and destroy secondhand sales
this draconian drm has nothing to do with piracyi was looking forward to this game but its a farcry from anything i was expecting i know probably the th time that was useddo you want to know what this entire game is
get a mission drive across the map kill
get a mission drive across the map kill
okay okaysometimes you gotta blow something up after you get done killing
and most of the time you gotta kill guards at check points to get to your missionthe same guards you just killed on the last mission
and the driving blows after a while boringthing is its the same thing over and over and over and over andyou get the pointyou are supposed to be hunting this arms dealer named the jackle to stop him from arming two factions so they stop killing each other right
so what do your missions entail
simple you get a mission from one faction  and its to kill the other and viseversa
wait i thought i was supposed to help them to stop killing each otherbut to do so i gotta kill them
hundreds of them
i dont think im gonna finish this one because i already know the ending and here it goes
the jackle ends up in the unemployment line and on food stamps because he has no one to sell guns to anymore because i freakin killed them all
at least thats how i assume its going to endnow for the positve
the graphic are pretty dam impressive at max settings
the physics are great and attention to detail is very cool
but see this is the problemyou have awesome programmers and horrible writersthe writers really need to be replaced with people better suited to dream up gamesits like a hot rod with every thing under the hood to blow every one away but the driver is a doof
cant blame the mechanicsand want to dominate this game
use the spas get in close and you will annihilate every one
why
because  rounds from an ak into the chest of a tanktop wearing bad guy isnt enough to bring them down
can you say wtf
orthis game was built as an multiplayer unrealquake game with solo play as an after thought
i dont know it just sugzsave your moneyim glad i got mine free with my video cardplain and simplethis game is totally worthless
nothing like the original nothing like the great storyline in farcry and nothing like wasting my money on a lame horse
come to think of iti should have wasted my money on a lame horse
at least watching the race would be more exciting than this boring ol peice of codeand not only does the game bite ubisoft went and added drm
securom
the agency from south of heaven
ubisoft thinks that by adding drm to their titles it will keep piracy downomg dont they realize its limitations like these that bring on piracy
i mean how many of you have heard of hacking the original game farcry
none
why
because their are no limitations
what fun is it when its free for all
hey ubisoft you want to stop piracy
well then stop adding drm to your titles
no duh
do not waste your money
wait to buy this on walmarts value software rack
it will be there soonpros creative use of african ambiancethe music sounds accents of the characters you interact with all give that you are here in africa feeling
music is tribalambient and thus fits well with the mood
graphics are decent though nowhere near crysis or for that matter cod
decent frame rates on a lower core  duocons respawning poorly implemented stealth mouse drags in high resolutions regardless of cpugpu respawning drm senseless random attacks by enemies did i mention respawning enemies
tell me how is it i can sneak up on some poor chump and slit his throat special forces style and the whole bloody camp knows about it the instant it happens
didnt ubisoft learn anything from thief the dark project
rumor has it they are working on thief  god help us if they employ the same sneak tactics here where every guard within  feet can hear a mouse fart
then there is the respawning guards i just killed including respawning jeeps huh
it is inconceivable to me that the very jeep i blew up not two seconds ago is now following me with armed guards every  secondsyou already know about the drm so i will skip that portionpart of the allure of this game was that its touted as a mercenary for hire sort of game whereby you obtain contracts to acquire wealth diamonds in exchange for downing baddies
but what good is it for immersion if you plug the guy with  bullets and he still doesnt go down
i used to know a guy who went through buds seal training years back and he would say that if you take a bullet by one of these big guns you are going down fast
yet it takes  bullets to down any guards unless it is a head shot at close range
ubisoft definitely dropped the ball on this one
mark this one avoidubisoft devs didnt just hype this gamethey out and out lied about it
where i come from lying is still a vicedo not buy this game show ubi your middle finger as long as they support sonys illegal securomsince game publishers now can do whatever illegal action they see fit without any problem from authorities without telling you beforehand it is it imperative for you to do your homework and this game comes infected with the following illegal schemerdparty drm securom machine activation limityouve been warned  do not buy this game
any changes in your machine  it could be as little as an os patch  could trigger this illegal spyware to nuke your activation and you have only  activationsyou want to sell the game when youre done
sorry it aint work pal because activation limit prevents it  another sheer violation of your rights see firstsale doctrine in the us rendering it essentially a rental copydo not buy this game lets send publishers a message you say drm  we say nosecurom  a sure instant way of providing death to pc gaming as we know it
sure game companies would like to provide protection against software pirates but lets make a couple of things clear  sorry ubi
if you think that pirates are not going to think their way around this one think again
securom interferes with my burner
i do a lot of home video creation with sony vegas pro  software
do you think that im going to want to install a  software package thats going to ruin that not to mention the hellonearth experience of removing this piece of junk
even if it were in the discount bin at  i would never even dream of creating an afternoon of fun trying to fix my hardware againi am very sad to say that i will not be purchasing far cry   i was soooo looking forward to this game but securom is an instant turnoff
i dont pirate games so for some person to wreck my hardware setup with inept software because they dont trust me doesnt earn my businessmark my words  if the pc gaming industry continues on this path it will spell a slow but sure death to pc gaming as we know it
there must be an easier way  and securom isnt it
perhaps they should call it securoti am going to enjoy my original legal purchase of far cry nowplease do not buy this game
this is the only way to get these companies to stop selling garbage games
this game should not be called farcry
if you purchase this game you will be sorry
shame on you ubisoft for selling this trashive spent a lot of time writing about securom x in games likemass effectorcrysis warheadand theres plenty of information out there about its evils
i dont feel like i need to run through all of that again here at this point the information is readily available
this review is about the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach the feeling that im about to lose an old friend
that pc gaming as ive known and loved it for many years is dying and will soon be dead
murdered by greedthe future is here and it is scary ownership transformed into glorified game rental
games infected with spyware data miners or flat out malware
a time when the gamers who made gaming a bigger industry than hollywood will now be treated like thieves and piratesif youve been a pc gamer for more than a dozen years like myself you probably have a pretty awesome collection of games both new and old
the beauty of pc games vs console games is that even when you upgrade your hardware there as always ways to play your old games without keeping ten different gaming systems in your closet
i can pull out my copy of alpha centauri and start playing it anytime i like no vintage system required
pc games have always been excellent when it comes to replay value
sadly that is not longer the casepc game manufacturers have taken it into their heads that what we consumers really want is to rent games
aka installation limits
we dont want to own anything just rent a game for   or maybe even a dozen installations the number is not important and then our games will cease to work
if we want to continue to play those games were forced to buy another copyi bet ive installed my copy of alpha centauri over fifty times across  or so different computers or upgraded os and ill probably continue to play it into the future
sadly anyone buying far cry  will not have that option
at some point in the notsodistant future their install limit will be reached and the game will be uselesswhy is this happening
because of greed
because companies like ea ubisoft and others are putting their bottom line ahead of their customers best interests
ultimately however theyre doing it because we are letting them
its high time that as a class we stop giving money to companies that treat us like dishonest pickpockets instead of paying customers
only by not buying games that come with installation limits can we effect changehappily there are exceptionscheck outthe witcher enhancedfor example
some companies are realizing that gamers and pirates are two different species
pirates will steal games regardless
gamers will pay for them as long as the system is fair and as long as gaming companies show them a little respecti choose to spend my money where i get treated like a valued customer
ubisoft has chosen to treat me like a thief therefore i will not give them my money
i will buy my games from companies that respect the art form and the people who love it the most
people like me and youfar cry  itself is a nice fps shooter
but i wont be buying it
the cost is just too highrecently ubisoft had to settle a huge classaction suit brought against the company for bundling the notoriously harmful starforce drm with its released games
so what the geniuses at the helm do next
they decide to make the same mistake yet again  by choosing the same drm scheme that made bioshock mass effect and spore infamous securom xx with limited activationsmass effect can be found in clearance bins only months after its release spore not only undersold miserably but also made history as the boiling point of gamers lashing back fed up with idiotic drm schemes
and the clueless mbas that run an artform as any other commodity business decided that hey why not jump into that mudpond ourselvesthe original far cry was such a great game that any sequel of it would have to fight an uphill battle to begin with especially without its original developing team
now imagine shooting this sequel on the foot with a well known much hated and totally useless drm scheme that turns it into another rentagame no one wants
were i a ubisoft stockholder i would be ordering my broker to sellsellsell
 instead of posting thisever since its xx version securom has nothing to do with fighting piracy
all it does in this direction blocking certain optical and virtual drives is a very old lame and already bypassed attempt that serves as a thin smokescreen
securom is in fact an intruding and silent dataminer and roothijacker that is delivered by means of popular gamesthat is why even the steam versions as well as the free demos of such games are infected with it
securom will borrow deep into our pc systems and will refuse to be removed completely even after uninstalling the game it came with
it will retain backdoor access and will keep reporting to its mothershiplately these security concerns have been accentuated as known trojans seem to be exploiting securoms backdoor access for their own purposes
in effect installing a securominfected game in our computer will be placing your hardware and data at risk long after having uninstalled the gameand the latest vehicle to deliver this hazardous snoopware is far cry   a game crippled by limited installations
no thanks
i think i ll pass this one toothe only people who do not care about securom are in factpirates
because cracking games protected by this contraption apparently is very easy
every single game that was supposedly protected by securom was cracked hours withing its releaseto everyone else though securom or starforce or any other hazardous drm scheme is a core issue that needs to be resolved before pc gaming can evolve any further
and the best way to resolve such issues is market correctionthat is why it is important for gamers to keep voting with their wallets
and as with any vote well informed decisions are paramount in making the right choicethis is another game where the publisher has decided to treat its customers like pirates
i thought that if i bought the game through steam i wouldnt have to deal with securom after all steam has its own drm system
the thing i like about steam is that i dont need to have a cd in the drive and if i loose my data i can always download another copy of the game
trade off  no resale value or second hand marketnow why is farcry bundled with securom and  installs if you buy it thru steam
wtf is this
how am i pirating the game after i bought it through steam and why i can only get to install it  times
why am i being treated like a pirate
since when you only get  installs when it comes to pc games
this is a lawsuit waiting to happen this limited use is ilegal and unethicali guess this is not steams fault they are just complying with the publishers directive and were at least honest enough to tell me when i asked them
i will keep buying games not renting through steam as long as they dont have securom
below is the official response from steamthank you for contacting steam support
for any thirdparty games that include thirdparty drm it will be listed on the righthand side of the storefront page for the game
you can see that far cry  does include securom title fary cry  storefront pagelink  please let us know if you have any other questionsnow for you guys that call everyone who dislike securom a pirate
what do you have to say
am i also considered a piratehas securerom and uses activation thanks microsoft for this sucky idea that every retard company now uses
in a word faili bought  copies of the original far cry
it was an awesome game and i have been eagerly awaiting this sequel
i could have dropped dead when ubisoft announced that they were using the dreaded securom drm see spore and that we would have up to  activations on  pcs
why on earth do we need activations at all
these securom games are always pirated leaving freeloaders with a game that lasts forever and paying customers like me with a game that commits suicide and spies on my computeri am devastated
i was so looking forward to this
i have decided to buy fallout  instead which is not only going to be a great game but doesnt have online activation  activation limitsthis game is loaded with securom and activation limits
they need to look at fallout  that is drm done properly
ea games and ubi soft are out of my book for games to buy because of their draconian drm schemesthe original far cry was good  big maps with lots of alternate routes interesting characters and some oddball bad guys pretty decent funfar cry  on the other hand is just a jokeyour character is just a mercenary sent to kill the jackalbut all you end up doing is pursuing missions for political factions  crisscrossing the same bleak african landscapes carrying out basically the same missions  assassinating someone or blowing something up blah blah blah  over and overthe jackal only pops up now and then to give some idiotic political speechbad guys can see you through foliage from a half mile away and shoot you even while theyre running yet if you stand still theyll walk up and trip over before realizing your there and then they run around in circles before finally attackingand for some unknown reason youre given malaria at the beginning of the game and have to endure periodic attacks throughout the game and have to get medicinelots of mountains but you cant climb anyin fact trying to climb or jump over anything more than a foot tall is basically impossiblea side project is looking for briefcases with diamonds but theyre in such oddball spots you practically have to trip over them to find them and all you can do with the diamonds is purchase improved armamentsand then theres the endingthe ending is without a doubt the most anticlimactic one i have ever seen anywhere  books movies games life  anywhere
then as if to add insult to injury after you complete the game youre forced to watch a seemingly interminable list of credits  the only time in the whole game when the escape key doesnt workwhat a waste of talent time and technologywhat were they thinkingi wanted this game but i passed cause the drmeven the steam version that has its own copyprotection had a double layer of drmwarning to video card makers with drm on games people wont need to buy new video cards because people will buy the console versionsi would love to purchase this game but sadly i will not be doing so
this game could have been great but is tainted with the stink of drm securom enforced limited installs
the drm is a part of the game that you cant avoid if you install it so i must focus my review on the drm
supposedly this game releases the authorization if you uninstall the game but what happens if there is a problem contacting the server at the time the uninstaller tries to do so
it probably wont release your install
what happens if your system crashes and you just format or you buy new hardware and forget to uninstall the game
your authorization wont be released
then you have to call them and hope that they believe you purchased the game in order to play once you run out of authorizations
if they dont believe you i dont know what the procedure is but you probably wont be playing anytime soon
it would just be another hoop that they want you the legitimate customer to jump through and hope it works
i would recommend that everyone stop purchasing games with these limitations
the only people hurt by these limitations are the legitimate customers
pirates will have the games from day one regardless
the game itself has been getting good press which makes me sad because the limiting drm that it is saddled with will keep me from getting it
luckily these days there are many other games out there to be had that dont force this drm on the end user so i will be looking elsewheresecurom  no sale i had to cancel my preorder when i found out it had securomunisoft is hacking you computer only you have the right to be an admin on your computer not them
they do not have the right to have more admin power them you on your computersecurom take over you computer and will block over programs and hardware you own from working
i have had these issues after getting crysis a year ago
after installing crysis my dvd lite writer stopped working on my vista hard drive in my computer
i booted to my xp hard drive and it work fine
i had to reinstall vista to correct the issue
i never gave securom the right to stop my hardware i own from working
this is hacking and against the lawunisoft management should be in jail you would be if you try this sort of thingi also have the right to resale this is the law you cant resell the game with limited installsim a hard core gamer with a variety different games
iv spent  total on oblivion and never had so much fun
iv spent my share  voting for my favorite games
for various reasons windows os tends to crash and your hard drive along with it reinstalling windows is needed
upgrading hardware you may need to reinstall
drm malware makes any game unplayable within a short period
i wasted  on counterstrike i the steam malware made it so i had to sign up to install giving out an email
i wasnt about to let my email be used for spamming
i used the  min email website
i got some menu instead of basic installer
drm and steam are malware
now i have find out if steam left malware on my system after uninstall
i will not buy any game with drm or steam
gamers vote with your 
amazon needs to clearly label any games with drm or steam a search filter is needed
so crysis warhead farcry  and bioshock are out
lets hope fear  project origin is malware free
look for my list of malware free gamesall of this drm discussion has kept me from ordering some of the recently released games but i want to play farcry so badly and i cant play fpses on consoles so im buying the pc version even though it goes against my principleswhat ill do though is not open the game get a playable version by other means wink wink then sell the unopened game in  weeks once ive finished it
that leaves me free and clear legally and morally and without supporting rentwarenote far cry  was not developed by crytek the original developers of far cry
instead it was developed by ubisoft and we all know how well they develop games yeahok this game is one of the most boring pc games ive ever played its loosely considered a pc game by my definition
far cry  was a big let down with no surprise it actually ending up being a console port with pc at the very back of the minds of the developers
the story is absolutely boring as well as the characters which i dont even remember were all forgettable
i honestly cannot even remember what the game was about  it was really one of those video games you just had to finish so you can tell someone else oh yeah i beat that game before
consolised gameplay comes second to worse as well as the annoying re spawning of enemies
gun mechanics were laughablesomething about the graphics in fc really ticked me off crappy textures visuals  reminds me of a console oh thats right this is a port
another annoying thing is how gigantic the world in fc is that maybe good for other good games but not fc you spend more time driving to your destination than you actually do finishing missionsoverall there was nothing memorable about this game  i would avoid at all cost if you love the original game as well as pc games
you arent missing anything
and coming from ubisoft i wouldnt expect anything more than subpar they havent released a good game since the original far cry  they have practically butchered every pc gamers favorites series and with far cry  looming near next year it doesnt seem to be very promising just another cut  paste of a wannabe codabsolutely ridiculous how poorly the pc controls are setup just ruins whatever fun the game might have been and that wasnt muchthis game is nothing like the original far cryat least it was really cheap but i sure found out whythis is a review of the product
not the game only but the product itself listed abovethe product installs a great game
that being said it also installs spywaremalware onto my computer
this is the same type of software that i have paid programs to remove for years
why would a user want to install it deliberately onto their machineif you buy this product know that one day it will cease to work
i dont care if it is  months from now or  years from now
you are not buying an actual product you are renting it until you change your computer a total of  times
considering i have  computers on my network alone and i use at least  of those as gaming rigs i know this would be relatively quick for me
either way you will most likely not be able to dig this out of the closet in  years and nostalgically play
you are buying a self destructing productthe drm on this game does not do anything to limit piracy as the company says
spore itself was already downloaded drm free k someodd times before the game was even released
securom is not a drm scheme as it does nothing to prevent piracy
it does everything to limit the value of the product to the legit customer and prevent them from selling it to a second party
this has been proven an illegal practice in multiple lawsuits throughout the years however they continue to install the software on end users computers without their consenti am not a pirate
if i was a pirate i would probably already be happily playing this game instead of being here writing this
again no pirates need to complain about drm
they are usually busy playing the game freethis game uses the same horrible drm scheme that is found on bioshock mass effect crysis warhead spore dead space sacred  and red alert  i refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game
there are several games that i own that i have had to install more than five times for various reasons
that is why i refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times i can install the game let alone a drm program like securom that could be considered a trojen horseas a side note this drm method does nothing to stop piracy
all of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some like spore even before their release with the exceptions of sacred  and red alert  which have not been released yet however the developers confirmed that they would use the securom activation drm scheme
the only thing this drm does do is prevent this game from entering the used game marketwhat do most people do with older played out games they sell them on the secondary market
in the case of far cry spore etc there will be no secondary market because you may not get an activation from a used game copy
so here you are with a ligit game which is worthless
maybe like buying a m car that has no secondary market
what would you do with it
there has to be a beter way to get people to pay for legit copies like charge reasonable prices not far cry keep this up and those who would have paid for the game will just get it off the internet when the crack is out there ex crysiswhi was looking forward to the release of farcry  until i realized it had been ruined by a poor publishers push for digital rights management
needless to say i will not be purchasing a copy of what could be such a great titleback in  i had a choice of the xbox  or the ps
being a big playstation fan among other reasons i chose the ps
now  years and   months later the ps has died
sony has been on the decline with their games and their systems lately
i have not played my ps much anymore due to the lack of games
instead i used it for blu ray netflix hulu and amazon instant video
so even when the game selections stopped barreling through and playstation network got hacked i still had good use for the system
now i have a brick
thank god i bought an xbox in  and i have been much more satisfied with xbox live and the games
pc games are still quite superior to any console but still too slow to depend on for constant play
on top of the system dying anything i had from the playstation storenetwork is now gone and unaccessible
this is a huge downside to using consoles to purchase digital only content
i guess you just roll the dice play the game as quick as you can to reach the end and hope you can go back later to play
at this time i will not replace my ps and i have no plans to get the new console from sony after they announce and release it
i will have to see if microsofts hardware can deliver better than sony
if not then i guess there is no hope for consoles lasting long anymore
i sure feel that  for a system would have given more than  years of servicedefective machine no video returned
rattling inside when i unpack end up spending  of my own money for return postageafter using an xbox  for the last year and trying my buddys ps which worked for a week there was no comparision
the ps cannot and testing proves cannot keep up to xbox graphics engine
plus the games for  blow ps out of the water
a blue ray disc player doesent impress me enough to buy this eitheri was on the borderline of  stars and wasnt sure about giving it a  or a  but this game is really one of the best games ive played in a while
as many other reviewers have said i didnt know it was going to be an rts game real time strategy which is where you gather resources build armies and direct those armies to kill the other army
dont get me wrong i like rts games but only on the pc
but the character voicing the storyline the art graphics music is fantastic
at  this is well worth it
if you play on brutal difficulty it takes a more than  hours to beat it
if you are doing all the side quests it takes more than  hours to beat it
sounds like a lot of people that are complaining about the time just rushed through it without enjoying the game to its full
love it
 this is my past review was  starsnew review   stars warning ps users do not buy this gamemany ps gamers have found that upon completing around  to  of the game their save will no longer load and they have to start over
worse yet the problem will likely occur again which makes finishing the game a frustrating experience
xbox  players do not suffer from this problem
the developer has acknowledged the issue and says they have done all they can about it but a patch is still not available and all inquiries about the matter should be directed at eathe only pros are the luring graphicsand being a graphic artist i mean luringsince i own mysims racing and excitebots this overly popular game was a huge disappointmenttracks are boringspeed zones have no speedno kartweight extremely lame simulationthere are no music and sound effect controlswhich means you have to listen to the primitive noises which they included as music in it for which same reason was nascar kart racing thrown into the garbage in my houseso far i havent found an additional for the mysims racing gamethis game is just horrible compared to the older mario karts like  or double dash
in the old games nintendo tried to make the gameplay good
but here all they care about is gimmicks like the steering wheel and miis
in the older mario karts the person who was the best driver would win
but here the person who gets the best items wins
its all based on luck
there is this item that is a blue koopa shell with wings
it goes after the player in first and blows them up
in double dash you rarely get hit by it
in the wii version you get hit by the blue shell all the time and its very annoying
the whole game is just lazy
half the courses are copies of the old games
the controls on the wii wheel are horrible because you cant do the mini turbos like before
and even worse on the new wiis you cant plug and gamecube controller into them
also when you buy any kind of wii it does not come with a gamecube controller
thats really stupid because the older ones have support for them
i recommend to just sell that wii and buy a super nintendo a nintendo  or a gamecubeunlike earlier versions you cant win in this onethis takes all the fun out of playing itblah blah blahi love mario games but this mario kark just plain sucks
its boring its super frustrating due to the cheapness and unfair computer factors and the controls are not good at all
save your money get super mario wii wario shake or mario galaxy instead they are actually good gamesit is worth noting at the outset that lush is locked into its present course of destruction
it does not have the interest or the will to change its fundamentally meddlesome whinges
we are observing the change in our societys philosophy and values from freedom and justice to corruption decay cynicism and injustice
all of these values are artistically incorporated in one company lush
lush is the picture of the insane person on the street babbling to a tree a wall a cloud or  a bar of solid shampoo which cannot and does not respond to its ebullitions
i plan to discuss the advantages of twoparent families the essential role of individual and family responsibility the need for uniform standards of civil behavior and the primacy of the work ethic
are you with me  or against me
whatever you decide lush has  not once but several times  been able to endorse a complete system of leadership by mobocracy without anyone stopping it
how long can that go on
as long as its postmodernist blasphemous campaigns are kept on life support
thats why we have to pull the plug on them and deal stiffly with conceited loan sharks who force us to tailor our fulminations just to suit its directionless whimsif lush isnt predaceous i dont know who is
i want you to know that this screams of the old belief that merciless adolescents also known as lushs fans are merely unpleasant vexatioustypes
knowing as they say is half the battle
what remains is to break the mold and stray from the path of conventional wisdom
okay theres no reason for me to be vengeful so ill leave you with this concept lush should be regarded as a bete noireif you enjoy playing slot machines youll like this game the game play is mostly random
if you play with friends its fun but still not great
you might as well flip a coin and congratulate the winner
as for the wii wheel its total crap
save your money
the game looks nice but its ultimately disappointingi found myself bored and regretting shopping the bargain bin for this one
the game play is just not that exciting
good music does not make up for a lousy gamei was challenged and bit frustrated at the beggining of this game as some other comments i saw
i did start to really like the moves as i moved forward a bit but then i just got mad
there is a place where the game locked up and would not allow me to move forward at all
i went to ign and i was already doing what they advised to at this stage in the game
there was no way to get past it
so i spent hours gaining proficiency at a game just to face a dead stop oh well
do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistake i did guyswhat could be wrong with a tatooed babe wielding guns and swords as she chews her way through enemy baddies
sadly the answer is everything
ive left things in the toilet that have more value than this gamei was sorely disappointed by this game
from the opening cinematic i was appalled by the weak ps reminiscent graphics
some of the worst cutscenes on a gen game
yes your character has some cool moves but when is sliding across a room full of bad guys in slow motion profitable when you only kill two
the platforming and aiming mechanism are weak
also the socalled upgrades that you can purchase should have been gimmes to start withthe graphics are mediocre at best and the controls are just awfulthis is a ps gameso what is up with the crappy graphics
i knew the graphics wouldnt be as sweet as the cover of the box but i didnt imagine they would be as bad as they are
if you have played infamous or uncharted  then you are aware of the pss graphics potentialwet takes advantage of maybe  of the potentiala very lazy attempt at a game and a waste of timeif you still want to play this game do yourself a favor and rent itdo not buy this gameyou get only one character choice a horrible story uninteresting monsters stupid bosses and a lame ending
this is an insult to the golden axe series
only one playable character and the worst skimpy dressed one at thatunfortunately all the negative reviews on this are true way too many flaws and the combat system in this is terrible
there are way better games out there than thisthis is one of the worst  games ive seen
ill start off with the good
the graphics are mediocre tyriss run speed is kinda fast and death adder looks cool
everything else is terrible
this game takes the worst elements of the original golden axe and slaps them together at a pathetic attempt to make a next gen gamestory  the game begins with tyris walking through a barren valley by herself and realizing shes late for a huge ceremony where her dragon god flies down from the sky and blesses her people
she realizes that being late for this is probably a bad thing and starts to run but encounters orclike creatures called boogeymen
seriously thats that theyre called
she battles her way through the boogeymen and arrives at the ceremony too late
a group of boogeymen kill all of the priestesses knock tyris out and kidnap her all mighty dragon god if your dragon god gets kidnapped by a band of orcs its time to get a new godlater tyris awakens and the dwarf from the original game is there pulling an axe out of his chest
he sees tyris and exclaims by my balls i thought you were dead
ok if youre a hot chick who was unconscious and the first thing you hear is a dwarf talking about his testicles thats not a good thing
maybe hes saying he resurrected you somehow with his balls or he is your father or maybe thats just a contemporary dwarven expression
anyway the dwarf gives tyris an axe and says you must find the pieces and reassemble it
lucky for tyris the pieces just snap on
near the end of the game axe battler from the original game appears and says something like gee tyris im sorry your game sucks so bad
see ya and hes gone
i think there are  lines of bad dialogue in the entire storygameplay   in this day and age developers of real games put the player in an adventure and let them battle their way through it
golden axe puts the player in a world and punishes them if they dont do what the designers intended
no attempt is made to make a cohesive world
instead the game just stops from time to time and says challenge complete and gives you a score usually telling you that you suck
if you die during a challenge you have a limited number of continues that you can use or you must start over
the game also makes every attempt to take cheap shots at the player  bombs hidden in objectives poison hidden in chests near impossible jumpscontrols  the controls are very awkward at besta  jump b  mount beast x  light attack y  heavy attack rb  parry lb  evade dpad  choose magic l trigger  run r trigger  magic xy  knockback attackcombat relies heavily on pressing rb lb and xy
where do you put your hands to press rb then xy immediately after that
combat  you begin and end the game with  combos
xxx for multiple enemies
yyy to do damage to a single enemy
if you delay your presses you deal extra damage
you can mix and match the xs and ys but theres no point
you cant get new moves or new weapon types so youd better love pressing xxx or yyymost of the focus of combat is on defense which is a lot less fun than thinking about slaughtering enemies
there is no block in the gametyris can parry or evade
the enemy attacks are color coded
orange attacks can be evaded blue can be parried
if you are successful you can counter attack for extra damage
if you try to parry a blue or evade an orange tyris just stands there and gets beaten up
if no attacks are coming at you the buttons do nothing and you are immobile for  seconds
if you are attacking the parry and evade dont take effect until the animation ends so the best way to fight is to stand still parry or evade then attack
boy i bet you cant wait to experience that
there is no combat manager in the game so tyris can be attacked by a blue and orange at the same time which means you get hit and lose your bonus
this reminds tyris that the world is cruel and unfairbeasts  beasts are only in the game about  of the time
the beasts are sluggish and clunky and they only have  attacks each
x y and xy
in some cases using the xy attack drains the beasts health
the beasts are disposable and if tyris gets knocked off a beast the weakest enemy can jump on it and ride it to remind her that she is not specialleveling up  at the end of each challenge you accumulate gold
if you defend well you get a bonus to the gold that you pick up
if you get hit once the bonus drops to zero
this is very frustrating
when you complete a level you get graded based on damage taken gold time and dismemberment
if you play on normal mode the game multiplies your gold by 
you only keep  of your gold
the background for this screen should have been a giant middle finger
hard mode is xgetting gold fills a bar at the bottom of the screen
when that fills up you get what the game decides to give you
you usually get a new outfit for tyris that looks the same as the one she already has
this reminds tyris that no matter how hard she tries she will never get ahead in the worldlevel design  every level looks the same
from the rocky barren plains to the dusty barren plains dotted with ruins
in every level there are spikes that randomly pop in and out of the ground for no apparent reason
absolutely no attempt is made to make this look like a world
instead the levels are there to take cheap shots at tyris
in some levels while riding a dinosaur the wind can blow you and the dino off of the cliffopening doors is incredibly confusing
there are  different ways to open doors but there is only  way to open each door and you never really know how you are supposed to open themif you ever get lost the best way to tell if you are headed in the right direction is the slow down
the game drops frames to load in enemies
so if the game suddenly pauses for a second thats a good thing
there are invisible walls everywhere so the levels may look like mass expanses of dirt but theyre linear dirt trails surrounded by dirtbosses almost all the bosses are the same guy
its a  foot tall giant that you attack
after you hit him a few times he crouches
when he crouches tyris kicks him and he goes flying backwards into a fire column to take damage
if tyris can move a  foot tall giant with a kick why cant she jump more than  feet
perhaps the bosses are made of heliumbugs  ive seen tyris get stuck in level geometry
ive seen the game crash
ive heard the sound skip
ive seen tyris fall out of the world
there are render tears and slowdown
ive also seen an entire palette shift to bluesound  the music is ok but neither feels epic nor atmosphericthe ending  tyris catches up with her captured dragon god and he tells her the final piece of the axe is his soul
she stabs him in the head and does her best darth vader episode  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i laughed for a minute
then you fight death adder
the fight is  minutes long and makes no sense
but thats ok because the fight pauses every few minutes and popup windows appear giving you detalied instructions on what you are supposed to be doing
hit him ride him make him destroy some statues then a cutscene plays where death adder says fool i will destroy you
tyris replies maybe but not this day
seriously thats what she says
she chops his head off
your reward  a skimpy white bikini costume
so the final scene plays and the dwarf and axe are there
tyris says ive lost my land my god my people  but its hard to take her seriously because she looks like fun in the sun tyris whos about to go play beach volleyball and drink something with a little umbrella in it
axe battler says this is just the beginning
the dwarf starts to talk but is abruptly cut off by the credits
thats right the credits interrupt the last cutscenethe game is rated m for violence gore and nudity
unfortunately the nudity is only on dead charred or dismembered bodies
if youre going to put breasts in a game put them on living women so the nonnecrophiliacs can enjoy them tooif youre dying to play a hack and slash game you should play ninja gaiden  devil may cry  oblivion too human viking the force unleashed lego star wars assassins creed then buy a wii and play zelda and no more heroes then buy castle crashers on the xbox marketplace youre better off avoiding this gameif you feel you must play it its only  hours long and not very difficultyou might be thinking poisoned blade if the game was so bad why did you finish it
i did it so you dont have tocondemned s developers clearly played manhunt  on pc and ps
this game woefully tries to mimic its mood and storyline but instead provides ugly muddy graphics and a storyline chock full of expletives for shock valuei couldnt get pass the first level
the entire game looks like a huge oil slick was dumped on everything
one can barely make out characters or details because of the ugly color scheme and detail given to everything
the story is cheap and stupid  rather than provide an intriguing storyline and main character the player is given cuss words and a main character thats about as ugly and filthy as his language
the combo system is clunky frustrating and pointless
hell the main character should be able to curse everyone out and just walk off
thats how the fight system shouldve been
choose the best cuss word and watch what happensits a stupid game developed by stupid people that knew they could cash in easily with the use of strong language that mostly kids wink wink would be shocked at
im sure they were pissed with the m rating as this game clearly was not targeting an intelligent yr old audiencecondemned  is dog excrementi played this game for maybe an hour before ejecting it and putting it back in the case
its boring it sucks having to do over levels again and again as with any game and the first person viewpoint is annoying
its easy to get turned around and get killed while trying to find your opponent againtruly horrible flying sequence
truly awful mine field sequence
trial by death is not fun
this game is not goodthis game started out promising
i have accumulated a ton of health items and cannot use them
all of my characters are on the verge of death and the game will not let me use the health items i havei played through the first obscure but never really got into the game
i wanted to get my moneys worth though and finished it
surprisingly i read good reviews of the follow up the aftermath
i decided to try it since i really enjoy some of the other survivalhorror games and cant find enough quality titles
the aftermath was not what i was looking for it was not a quality title and in my opinion worse than the original which was bad enough
for one the characters are college kids and their behavior and language are suppose to mirror that of real college kids i guess
it didnt and i actually wanted to kill them off myself they were so absurdly annoying
the characters are idiots
the game play is dull with a lot of walking around searching for clues what to do next
in a way it reminded me a lot of a silent hill game in that respect all atmosphere with no real substance and lots walking around
i traded this one in without finishing it which is rare for me
i couldnt take it
i swear i wont buy a third if there is oneok so ive been playing res evil  so im a little biased
but ive also been playing house of dead and res evil umbrella chronicles so i know a little bit about survival horror games that arent so great
but obscure is awful
it starts out so dark you cant even see what is there
i walked arond in circles for ten minutes trying to find a way out
then you are suddenly flashed back to college and the whole scene becomes a drug induced blur
if you get motion sick from games at all forget this onelousy controls horrible voice acting made me feel like i was watching one of those teeny bop horror remakes no funi rented it played it once and returned it
i just dont get itthe first mini game is boringit has nothing to do with tenniswii tennis is much better
i dont need a turbo charged tennis game
tennis is tennisthe main problem with wiis version ofsega superstars tennis is that they kept the controls and game play the same as its release for the other  systems its on nintendo dsxbox playstation andplaystation  like playing with a controller
which with the wii youd think things would be different
just stick with the tennis onwii sportsormario  sonic at the olympic games
at least on those  games or  you get to actually swing thewii remoteand have a better more realistic tennis experiencesorry but this needs improvementi dont believe i did get it and even if i did it wasnt the  version it was the xbox original versioni have used many third party expansion packs and they all have failed
they have caused my console to crash and have experienced other issues
i now am using the nintendo brand expansion pack and have never had problems sinceno justice for the original
this was a disaster
highly repetitive dumb
good voice acting and great cutscenes though
horrible gameplay though
just horriblethe  i shelled out for this game was a total waste of money
the graphics are mediocre im running an nvidia  gts so its not my card
gameplay is lame and there are bugs
the main one is the ingame save keyf doesnt work
i tried remapping the key but it didnt help
gameplay is choppy
i ran crysis and bioshock with no problems
pass this one byafter about an hour of use my shift keys stopped working
after updating the drivers the keyboard stopped working all together
the manufacturer website is all but useless offering no real help
i returned it and got something else
proof that what looks great isnt actually functional
its too bad too because it looked darn good
but alas it is junk
avoidthis keyboard was cool if it would just work
it randomly assigns keys to do whatever functions it sees fit in the middle of playing games
i will have to unplug the keyboard or sometimes restart the entire system just to fix the problem
i dont know why this happens
i dont even have any special macro functions set up i just use it as a normal keyboard
this problem pretty much makes this keyboard useless seeing as how it happens at least once a dayive been using razer mice for awhile love them and heard good things about the lycosa
i finally broke down and picked one up  to complete the set
after a couple of weeks its on a shelf gathering dust
it looks nice initially but becomes dirty very quickly mostly oil from hands and does not clean easily
most problematic was keys constantly sticking and i have one of the newer batches which supposedly fixed this problem requiring an entire reboot to correct
razers support is virtually nonexistent
getting a response is like pulling teeth and then they work off a script and do not waver
this was a costly mistake and will be taken into consideration when looking at other products from razermy teenager son ordered this cool looking keyboard
within minutes the keyboard lights were randomly turning on and off
he thought it was a glitch and downloaded any updates and drivers
we ended up returning it within days of receiving it
most of the problems were the keys randomly being pressed even with the slightest touch
it also randomly launched programs like itunes too and it was so frustrating not knowing what else will happeni bought this keyboard thinking it would be a great keyboard
i took it home and plugged it in and everything seemed fine
a few weeks after purchasing it i realized this thing is not overly friendly when using the directional keys
they are to low and hitting the directional arrows usually means you are hitting the casing of the sides as well very annoying
i dealt with it and kept using it
i then took a closer look at the lights some of the lighted keys are dark underneath the letters meaning something was blocking the back lighting
i peered closely and saw it was the stuff underneath that the actual keys mount on yeah great design
ok i can deal with that
then the keys started rubbing off on top and you can see all the back lighting underneath the stuff around the actual letters and numbers
wow i cant believe it
i paid a lot for this keyboard and it is just horrible
the touch feature for turning off the lights is very poorly designed as well
i dont know how many times i have actually had to turn it back on in the dark and sliding my finger all overi went back to my logitech g with the price this thing cost and how it was suppose to be high quality i am sorely disappointed
my razer lachesis review isnt much better than this one as well
i will never buy another razer product again more than likely unless they get their act togethercontextim a web developer and gamer
i spend at least  hours each day every day on the computer using this product and  other razer products
all three products including this one were purchased approximately  years agomy relationship with razeri was a razer fanboy when i first got all of three of these products
in hindsight i was about as stupid as people who blindly buy any apple productall three razer devices im writing about have failed
using a bestbuy warranty i have replaced them all at some point or another for failingi would not anymore recommend razer products to anyone
i apologize to my friends who i raved about their products to as now they are experiencing the same issues and terrible products i amrazer products ive owned statusrazer lycosa keyboard this review in trashrazer naga mouse in trashrazer carcharias headset in trashsimple summary review  razer lycosa keyboardthis keyboard is a very nice looking keyboard that functions decently as a keyboard
however considering the premium price i expect that the advertised features work and that this keyboard at a minimum functions as a keyboard should with no unexpected and unbelievably frustrating behavior
unfortunately not with this product or brand
after going through  keyboards over a period of  years im throwing this device in the trash where it belongs
ill never buy a razer product againpros  razer lycosa keyboard this keyboard is truly a beautiful piece of plastic
im a particular fan of the matte buttons which are hard to get dirty and easy to clean it is perfectly visible and usable in completely dark environments the buttons are very easy to press leading to less wrist strain over long periods of timecons  razer lycosa keyboard this keyboard has a severe issue of getting stuck signals
its like a key is stuck but its not
the only way to resolve is by unplugging the keyboard
this happens quite regularly even without using the keyboard at all
i cant count the number of mornings ive woken up turned on my monitor only to find my keyboard just a typing an infinitely long windows password on my locked computer
its dreadfully annoying in gaming environments
example sorry guys i didnt mean to pull the boss
my keyboard is acting wierd
 the media controller touchpad is absolutely useless
i have never gotten it to work and it always goes crazy
it will regularly turn your volume down
it will constantly flash the keyboard lights
it will always start playing music when you arent even near your computer
i contacted razer support and you know what they suggested
that i put a quarter on it
yes it a quarter will completely disable the touchpad
so for the past  years ive been using a quarter to keep my wonky keyboard under my control sacrificing one of the biggest reasons i wanted the keyboard to begin with the included usb port doesnt work
the power strength is a fraction of what normal usb ports are from my computer so charging a phone for example takes multiples longer than using a usb port on the back of the computer
in addition ive yet to get any device to actually function in it
thumb drives are so convenient to plug in there but the port simply doesnt work
yes i plugged both cables on the keyboard in
it just doesnt work the lights appear very dull through the buttons
this can be a pro or a con as the lights shouldnt be distracting
however i think its just a little too dull as it looks like the lights are failing
pop a key off though and its plain to see that the actual light source underneath is insanely brightin hindsighti wish i had more nice things to say but unfortunately the truth is what it is
i wish i wasnt initially blinded by brand name and i wish i would have done more research
unfortunately the past is the past and the money spent on these  razer products is lost forever
i hope razer can fix their products in future generations but i will never give them another shot
this is a premium product with a premium design
however the functionality of their devices are equivalent of cheap knockoffs made in chinai dont know even know why razer makes this crap product
its has a nice slim design but its not meant for typist or gamer
it feels like a laptop keyboardget the blackwidow mechanical keyboard for about the same price and youll thank me laterthis keyboard is a disappointment if you are using it at daytime or with any kind of light in your room
you cant see the buttons since the backlight is too weak
only in the real darkness of a gamers room it is nicely lightedtherefore if it had optional brighter backlight such as for the wsadonly setting it would be ok overall but like that  no
save your money for the logitech version or any buck standard keyboardmore cons the keys are loud when pushed the touchpad for multimedia control can fire signals at random and start eg
media player without your command
when starting the system it does not always keep in mind whether to stay dark or backlitonly pro the usb and audiojacks at the keyboardfirst i bought this keyboard from bestbuy
the keyboards external port never worked
the keys never worked fully
sometimes letters would not work
now the keyboard receives no power
posrazer sucksi got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved it for the  minutes he had it before it started to die
he troubleshooted it in every way he could think of as well as every suggestion given to him through internet searches
to no avail it still barely works
as soon as we can we are going to return this keyboard
razer you really disappointed me i would rather watch grass growor paint dryor a baseball gameorwell you get the point
dont waste your money or timei was very disappointed by how little there is to do in this game
basically there are  different minigames that you play and each only last a couple of minutes
that is it
i know i know you are thinking that there has to be more than that right
but there isntafter about  minutes this game is no fun anymore
the burger king nostalgia wears off quickif your hoping for a story  line give up nowthere is no story
thats the big point some of these reviews say a sifi noval
if you loved homeworld or hegamonia or nexus you will hate this game
when you start a new game it asks you to choose a configuration for the galixy how many suns and there colors planets are random then you hit start and it generates the map and you start with a planet and you start to build you move into other suns and mattering on the diffcualty you get attacked your forces get push back or you move forword bomb there plants or visa versa and then your done
done thats it pick the next one and then your off doing the same thing
you can make a random map but its just like the other options
theres nothing to keep you playingso my experience with this game  in a word horribleinstall went okaylaunched game tried to play
 notifies you there is an update available no biggie right
 wrongso you click okay to minimize the window an go to their website it takes you to the battlefield  page  no patch to be found after some not so easy searching youll finally discover what your looking for on their very unfriendly website problem solved right
 wrongso you download the  gig update  after an hour of messing around it looks like youll finally get to play the game  wrong againgo to install the patch and error it tries to tell you you have a newer version already
which is falsemore searching of their bad website and presto known issue  oh but they have instructions to manually edit the registry to fix   sounds easy enough right
 wrongso you go to follow their steps only to find out their steps are wrong even for your specific operating systemend of story i have a semi expensive paperweight hence the garbage titlelast patch was in  so i know there wont be any patch to fix this issueif you buy it good lucksurely ea cant make anything easy for the customer
first of all good luck trying to get this game started without it crashing
second good luck trying to activate the expansion pack included on the disc
everything is on one disc but the expansion pack is for some reason seperated from the rest of the game and you have to go online to activate it
the link provided sends you to the offical website and thats all it does no way to activate the expansion on the website
third good luck trying to track down ea customer supportstay as far away from this game as possiblethere is a reason consoles have gained more market share
you put the game in and it works
if you can get past that first step your game sucks and you lostwelcome to ea games or youll wish you hadnt wasted your moneynow let me start by saying i love this game
i think it is a great mix of modern and futuristic in an fps
i loved playing it when i was able to
after a while it just stops working
ive patched it didnt worked uninstalled it reinstalled itleft it unpatched then had problems with punkbuster not updating uninstalled it reinstalled it patched it did a securom workaround for their buggy antipiracy software  manually updated punkbuster finally got it working played for  days then it stops working againdid a system restore didnt work uninstalled it and reinstalled still didnt work
workaround in forums are for xp not vista
gave up for now
will try again later but this will be my last ea product
i never had so many problems and in trying to get the northern strike expansion to work dont even get me startedanywaygreat game but crappy software all aroundyour piracy paranoia has doomed all those who actually paid for itwish it was on a console that i could just put in and play online like right now
thanks again eai bought this controller after seeing it for  dollars on amazon
however when i got it i immediately notice how much it underperformed compared to the sony dual shock prosits wireless low price on amazoncons its not responsive
you may have to press buttons  or  times before the signal actually goes in
it isnt lag free like it says joysticks are way to sensitive
for example if your are in a racing game barely turning the analog stick will cause you to do a sharp turn its motion sensing feature is a gimmick
it sounds good on paper but does not work in reality
youll barely turn or not a all no matter how much you move around the controller it is very small
doesnt fit adult handsthe dual shock  blows this controller out of the water
this is expected as rd party products are usually garbage
i highly recommend you pass on this product
the controllers ability to play ps games is substandard
the company that made this controller made it to make as much money as they could before people realized it was garbagethe grade i give this product is a dbought it for three players on borderlands  and it wouldnt work
piece of junk
live and learn
also what i got was not in the picture shown but was closezero stars if possiblebe careful
item ships from hong kong
my unit was opened with the plastic cut open and jagged
item stuffed into packaging like it had previously and obviously been returned used etc
how this could be sold especially as a new item is nutsavoid this order at all costs
shipping took many weeks not even worth a return
buy a different version of this adapteri have tried this game on  different computers  xps and a vista
it halfway works good for a while at first then it just randomly crashes to the point you will want to throw the disc and box into the nearest fire
this could have been one of my favorite games but the instability of the game just kills it
i went to the sega total war site and forums and tried many things to no avail
maybe i got a  defective game beats me
gave up on it
forgot to add i also own rome total war and it works finewhy did rome total war make more sense there were unit collisions which help make the game feel realistic
this was just better graphics with no regard to gameplayi was blown away by the sheer quality of this game
i liked how you can easily play it while doing something else since simply mashing buttons will advance you through as well as any attempted strategy very convenient for todays onthego gamer
also you dont need to pay attention to the story since it basically does not exist brilliantthe visuals are top notch i very much enjoyed the rock walls modeled after lumps of mashed potatoes and i found the character designs to be extremely memorable and endearing with such favorites as guy  and guy 
later in the game you even encounter guy  which was really exciting
in a final dealsealing stroke of design brilliance all of the achievements are worth  points each regardless of how easy or hard they are to acquire which i feel really embodies the spirit of gamerscoreif you like movie tiein games this is one of themhere lies another flash in the pan extremely average video game based on a movie
anyone who spends a bit of time playing video games knows to be extremely weary of a game based on a movie and released to cash in on the movies advertising
jumper is a very repetitive game that does nothing to prove there can be good games based on movies
if you bother with it at all and i recommend that you dont it is a rental game for sure
even then you will be spending money on nothing so best to borrow it from someone you know foolish enough to have either purchased or rented it
this game is pretty much a passthis is one of the poorest games i have ever played
no story you have no idea what in the world is going on in the game
the combat is very pointless and there is nothing new about this game at all
the only real positive is that i played this game for about  minutes and earned  gamerscore in that periodi rented this game because a it boasts wifi play and bit looked really cool
as it turns out neither was true
this game is terrible
i mean it is what it is its a hoverboard game so that is kinda cool
however me and  friends played and it was awful
the gameplay way too complex
i swear i could not complete the tutorial at least not before getting disgusted after  minutes wasted
you get almost no instructions
the first level of story mode was way too hard
but at least you can play online right
wrong
you can download other users ghost from all over the world and race against their best time
wasnt that a feature of the snes mario kart
racing vs ghosts
totally lame
save your money or buy nitrobike or mario kart
after buying mario and sonic  the olympics which was awesome i was really suprised at how poor this game is
too bad
hthgame is pretty good in its self but it will not run in widescreen even with a hex edit or any other edit of any kind
i would get the  version if i were youinstalled it several times and it just wont work
its a great concept for a game
sure wished that it would play
searched online for help and found that there is no cure and that this happens to others but not the majoritythis game is the definition of a great idea gone wrong
even if i was paid to play this game i would hate it the graphics are equivelant to a budget ps game
fight the urge to impulse buy and avoid this game like the plaguedont waste money or time in this wackiness bad effects just doesnt compare to any of the other games out there really not worth the time or moneyfirst let me say that this game was very fun to play
i love the art style and the storyline was good and the actionadventure style was really enjoyable
restoring nature to desolate areas was really rewarding just because of how vibrant the game is seeing flowers and animals pop up in areas where there was nothing but ash and rock was visually amazing and this is coming from a lifelong gamerthat said i enjoyed playing this game up until i had to restore the big tree with the old guy that was dancing a shuffle
the execution of these cutscenes was horrible
first off the bug has to shut up
he is worse than navi from ocarina of time
you could skip through navis blathering by jabbing the a button but the bug in okami refuses to let you cut him off  you must listen to every one of his words creep across the screen and it is very very frustratingthen in the cutscenes where you have to assist people cuttingrestoring things in the world you have only a splitsecond to actually help them and if you screw up which is often because the brush feature is bugged you have to listen to their blather all over again and as i just mentioned you have no opportunity to skip itas for the brush feature it works about half of the time
at least with the wiimote
im not sure about the gamecube version i havent played it
but it just doesnt work half the time i can draw a straight line across something and it wont work
i can repeat the same exact brush stroke a second time and then it will work
the same goes for restoring trees with a circle
i can draw a circle and it wont work
i do it again and it does
restoring or cutting things on the field isnt that big of a deal because you can indefinitely repeat your brushstrokes however in the cutscenes it becomes a major issue because you have to do it perfectly  or  times in a rowso i get to the restorethebigtree deal with the old guy and he blathers on about this being a supersecret dance and i get to the cutscenei draw a circle around the first flower bud
it worksi draw a circle around the second flower bud and it makes a sun in the sky instead

it worksi draw a circle around the third flower bud i fail after doing this for about an hour i took the dvd out of my wii and broke it in half
in the  years that i have played video games i have only ever been so angry at a game that i wanted to physically destroy it maybe  or  times
i like to think i take care of my electronics
but this game is bad
very fun to play and coded very bad
the developers should have done some more playtesting on this game at least for the wii versioni mustve drew a few hundred circles in the sky for the sun to come out at kamiki village and it never worked
the little bug voice got annoying even after my circles became perfection
still no sun
i can only rate this game  star
it was interesting until i got to the dead zone
i guess the people who gave it  stars never made it pass the freaking circle stage
hate itthis game for nintendeo ds is by far the worst
do not waste you money on this one
it will get you attention for about  seconds at most
there are far better ones for the ds system so go right by this onei dont know what all you other people played because this game is boring
i wouldnt recommend it for any gamer
avoid this at all costsbored me to tears 
i played it for a couple of hours and i never played it again
lstinkolook its a game  its supposed to be fun to play  this is not
the horrible control scheme was utterly outdated when it came out in re and feels even worse now
yes i said it re is a completely terrible game
play gears or halo  etc
etc
etc
etc
etc
 and tell me that you prefer clunkiness of the entire re series
there were rumblings that there would be control alternatives for this one  no dice
the fact that they considered alternative schemes shows that they know that the controls need improvement  to put it mildly  or at the very least that there are a lot of gamers who hate their controls  but in the end their bottom line was obviously more important than pleasing discerning gamers or creating a truly great game
for many of us the poor controls are absolutely a deal breaker
this is an insultthis is one of the worst games ive ever played and ive had the misfortune of playing teenage mutant ninja turtles on the original xboxquick check whats good about this game the idea
whats decent about this game the sound and the graphics
whats bad about this game everything else
the controls are horribly clunky the melee attack is more powerful than bulletsbut at least you have forearms the size of buicks a cutscene every  seconds you get the worlds wimpiest gun on a mission against zombies and megazombies and they have successfully created the worlds most idiotic and annoying assistant
about the th time she told me to be careful and then ran in front of me and just stood there i was ready to shoot her and then myself
she has apparently never recovered from an earlier blow to the head
this game does inspire terror it has scared me away from ever wanting to buy another resident evil game and to run over to where they are selling dead space or any other game for that matter
ill play dead space over its a much better horror shooter
buy dead space not this steaming pile of goolong live halo and gears of waras a bargain game i would have thought a resident evil title would have been an amazing find for the price
wow was i wrong
i played re way back on the ps and found it entertaining
i am not a huge rd person actionsurvivalhorror gamer but i can get my way around most of them
re is the first game i have turned off after literally less than  minutes
i got about  checkpoints into the game before i shut it down before losing my mind
its going right back to the store for crediti found nothing fun about the control schemes
looking over the shoulder is an odd perspective i could get used to if the game was intuitive
your character is slow
slow slow slow
he walks slow runs slow aims slow and apparently every little item on the floor prevents him from moving
imagine a small  gallon plastic garbage can stopping the terminator in its tracks
the camera over the right shoulder also makes you completely blind in most instances
its a major blindspot
this would have worked in the slow limited environments of re and  it has no place in this type of gamevery early in the opening stages the game throws you into a massive battle with dozens of zombies and some mad boss from the new movie
i gave this spot a try a few times before giving upthe zombies no longer lumber around
they are fast and plentiful
with no autotarget you have to manually aim at each one
this is infuriating for so many reasons
a  you are completely blind on your left
its as if chris has only one eye
b  the aiming mechanism is so incredibly slow to move around
by the time you get your target selected its on you
c  your partner is secretly trying to kill you
she shoots your target causing you to waste ammo and she gets in your way at every step
she also needs to be healed every  secondsthe re series was notorious for limiting your inventory so much and this game was no different
you have little ammo and clumsy controls limited health and an inept partner who leads you to wasting most of your ammo anyway
the game was totally unclear as to what you were supposed to do
i basically ran around and just shot as many zombies as i could before getting cut in half by an axe
the purposely limited view and lousy controls made a difficult game even worse
i had the game on easy and couldnt even play  minutes before wanting to smash the disk
not fun at allfor the serious gamers and re vets this game will probably be manageable but i dont see the fun level in it
capcom may defend the controls and limited view as adding to the sense of uneasiness
i say thats all a cover
the controls suck and the average to novice gamer will hate them
bad bad game and i will not be playing another re game anytime soonseen it and played it on both
the home system is way better
plus we have are own home space for resident evil 
trade it in for the ps version its way better i downloaded the demo of this game on xbox live and was so looking forward to it as i enjoyed the previous game so muchbut this game is seriously lacking in many waysthe guns seam weaker than before with even fewer ammunition and the enemies are tough then to make matters worse the controls are incredibly bad and are  the worst ever even resident evil one beats it on this countits like having both hands tied behind your back and your shoe laces tied togetherwhat another wasted potentialavoid this at all costs unless you like getting really wound upi bought a copy of re at a local gamestop for  used i returned it the following dayhere is whycontrols when aiming with your gun you cannot move
you have to lower your weapon in order to move and it takes a second to raise your weapon again
this is a real problem when needing to be on the move and fight at the same time
this is not possible in the game
so forget strafing your enemy as you shoot him which is a pretty standard feature in all shooters like these
also when switching weapons or using an item in your inventory i had to open the inventory navigate to the item and choose use or equip
when a boss zombie is chasing you you dont have time to make selections
come on capcom this isnt a turn based game
then when you do get grenades or mines equipped you have to go through the same bs to select your pistol again
additionally you can only run forward and not to the side
good luck dodging that swinging hammer without turning your backgameplay the game has such tight spaces that it felt like i was in a maze instead of the place presented
for instance a village instead of having all the access to the alleyways everything is blocked off or gated so your forced to go in a certain direction
i am used to this in linear games it just felt like re made very little effort to cover this up
so there was no emmersion for me into this game
when shooting enemies there were only two effects it had on them head blows off or they die
so if you shot limbs you see a little splash of blood and the enemy shakes a little
if you hit them enough they go into their death scene
so weather you throw a granade or slash them with a knife it has the same effect on their body
the interaction with the environment and stage was the same
you could only shoot piles of fruit or barrels that provided supplies
except for tvs you can shoot those thats it
so forget body parts flying or debris falling from bullets
it hardly feels like your character is even in the environment so how am i suppose to feel it
the cut scenes were inconsistant
in one cut scene your just spectating then all the sudden in the next cut scene something flashes thats telling me to press x so i dont die
its senseless and didnt make the game any more funi had no issue with the sound or graphics neither was great but goodall in all this game was way behind in the times
something i would more expect to have been playable in the s
now in the st century as far as gaming has come absolutely dissapointingi recognize  re titles and those being  and code veronica everything else is pure crap
capcom if you cant go back to the old re style then im done with your series and i think most people will be too
the only way you can overcome this disaster that youve created is to make the next one like the originals and make resident evil  and  just a dream that leon and chris had
so for the next one remember go back to the old story and gameplay as well as real zombiesmost xbox users are used to controls that were developed with halo and have now pretty much carried over to most games on the market
move with left stick look with the right
well this game is a blast to the frustrating past
you move around with one stick then have to hold a button in order to switch to aim mode which takes a whole second and you use the same stick now to aim while you stand still and get beat up by zombies
it takes a few seconds just to shoot a guy standing  inches in front of you
dont even get me started with the horrible ai your partner hasi think fans of the franchise will love this game controls are similar to the  year old resident evil  game
for someone new to the series i urge you to try the demo before forking a lot of money at this game
if you can get used to the controls its a decent game not great and pretty short but getting used to those controls can be torturewhite knight chronicles follows protagonist that nameless faceless soul that we are expected to create and love as he takes a job as a wine seller and delivery boy
along the way youre drafted into the kingdoms army to help fight off monsters and gigantic robotic armored suits to rescue the princess cisna
why are you a wine delivery boy with no formal training magical ability or even a remote tie to the kingdom or princess willing to do this
um moving ongraphics and audio are typical starry eyed jrpg to the nines
awful dubbing and bizarre choppy speech that are the hallmarks of virtually every bad game made since final fantasy
backgrounds and character models as well as cinematics are fluid and well produced but the degree to which the characters speak like they have some kind of paralysis induced by learning a new word is laughably disappointing
many scenes will proceed like thischaracter a its the ltnoun
character b whisperedltnouncharacter c frightened whisperltnoun
combat is innovative in that you arent locked into the attack magic or item routine
different weapon classes have different skills which can be setup beforehand into combos that are useful easy to determine and actually a challenge to pick and choose the right setup to get the best bang for your buckthe degree to which you can customize protagonist is astounding and you could easily spend an hour creating a borderline clone of yourself as an avatar
and just dont be disappointed when you have to flush all that work down the commode as the real main character is leonard the white knight who was fortunate to have spoken lines in his cinematicsoverall this is a major disappointment
good graphics a good combat system and a tolerable story that made the makings of a solid    star game are completely crippled by the fact that your character is dealt off to the side with a deus ex machina thats as subtle as a gaping chest wound
ive never played a game where youre expected to create a character and have him wind up as the lackey to a high schoolerwhen i first saw the trailer for white knight chronicles i was absolutely stoked and preordered it immediately
it looked like a great fantasy story similar to what youd see in the older final fantasy games
when it came in however i was greatly disappointedi played this game for about  hours and had to turn it off
the first  minutes were character creation
i spent a fair amount of time to make an avatar only to find out that hes the new guy and has no role whatsoever in the story
instead they smack you with an angsty teenage boy as a main character
absolutely nothing after the character creation grabbed me
the graphics and sound are ok  the smidge of story that was presented seemed quite lame and the characters introduced were completely uninteresting
i made it as far as the second save point somewhere in the plains right outside the first town
the combat system seemed like a variation of what was in ffxii
combat was to frequent and boring
i turned the game off and now im trying to sell it used on amazon
hopefully i wont take too big of a monetary hiti dont know why people like this game the combat is terribad if you havent lost your money i suggest you rent it if you really want to play it
when i saw the trailer i was pumped man i thought the combat was gonna be sick like kingdom hearts or at least ff  is almost like this but the timer is not as boring and combos much interesting
plus they allow you to move around  in a fight but it doesnt matter how far away u run they still hit you but u cant hit them
so i just put the game down i cant stand to look at it my bro is in love with it though i mean he loves it
alls i got to say is if your like me and u like intense action games like gow kingdom heartstransformers or anything along those lines then dont waist your money ive played ds games better then thisthe key bad points in this game areway too much grinding and farmingsemi decent graphics just slightly better than psboring music but just below averageit has some nice armor and weapons textures but not much differences between them expect new armor and weapons may look worst than what your wearing and it takes too long to make them in the item creation to make all of them could take over a year of boring grindfarming
possibly over  hours of gameplay is a big turn off for meif you go online to the game servers its a scam the amount of time consumed when playing online is ridiculous the farming is hard the amount of rewards are rare and if you go on dlc psn network you know why all the dlc combined is over   buy this and that such as increased drop rates and have it lasts for  days only a lot of the best gaming is supposed to be done online but at a high price the game is a  at best such a game should not be so hard to play online with all that grinding youve been warned its a serious grind game just as bad as world of warcraft im a hardcore gamer but this game white knight chronicles is only just okay offline
the moment i went online i was scammed out of so many hours spent and only little reward to be had
a lot of people reviewing this come from the game company themselves
trust a real person a real gamers review i will say this offline it has some fun to be had with it go through a half decent storyline your main character remains silent and boring throughout the story which doesnt make sense its very anticlimactic for all those hours u could spend creating your character is only useful onlineso when you do go online your whole world changes you have to grind and farm even more than a typical hardcore gamer is used to i gave up playing this online as the game isnt good enough to promote such grinding and rare drop farming
just to make your gearoutfitarmor that overall has better stats than what your wearing but lacks in style and appearance such as im wearing a cool armor and weapon but i make or find something that has way better stats than what you already have on just kills the whole point in spending hours farming and grinding to make the new piece or armor and weapon look really shabby and crap all that time spent to look more ruined in the game
a lot of people stopped playing this game so the community online is dying im sure this is because of the lack of game mechanics to keep you playing this is what happens when you force people to spend more than  hours doing nothing but rare item hunting which does nothing but waste your time
imagine this going out looking for groups to do a quest for rare monster drops you spend some time getting a group then you all go out together when you go through the level and kill the end boss say spending  hours or more in it and the boss doesnt drop the necessary material thats needed to make a piece of armor or weapon
you catch my point in games like this thats not an mmorpg massively multiplayer online rpg all boss drops should be once defeated a  drop rate so people can work on other pieces of gear instead of farming the same one over n over
a note to the developers this game isnt an mmorpg so dont try to emulate the grinding and farming on doing the same repetitive quests over n overthe game is full of materials and a lot of them cost a lot of time and money to get and the game isnt rewarding when you kill enemies you do not end up with much money at the end and mats you have to grind for a long time to get quantity of them just enough to build the next armorweapon
the music in the game is just below average the storyline super cliche the graphics are just slightly better than playstation  quality the only thing thats decent is the texture of the armor and weapons but most of them are too similar in design and only have different designs on them so really im going to farm  hours just to get another piece of armor thats worst looking has better stats than my good looking armor and weapons and with slightly different characteristics
no thank you
i completed the game and the sequel because im one of those hardcore gamers even though i dont like a game if i find something of small interest in it i will continue to play it till i finish it but that damn online mode that kills out your psn wallet for little reward isnt worth it or the time spent in building the rest of your gameplay
the problem is you have to go online to get the chance to make all your weapons and armor as some quests you need help from other people to complete
having to spend months to a year or so on one game that to me is just super lameif you want a decent rpg that will last you a decent time without the process of involving a  hours of pointless grindingfarming avoid this game at all cost trust me you will thank mei miss the days of grandia final fantasy x xenogears chrono trigger secret of mana star ocean  valkyrie profile zelda   and ocarina of time just to name a few top ones there
so you guys know im for real a hardcore rpg fan since the release of zelda  nes and even further back heavy on the magic keyboard adventure game on the amstradthe game by itself its not a bad idea but after a few hrs the gameplay becomes tedious and boring and the story line is just crap the whole game is an intro for a sequel to come i was very very disappointed when i saw the final and said wtf 
i was angry and i went out the door to trade it in for a game worth whileokay so the combat isnt terrible
there
thats the nicest thing i can say about this gamethat said the combat does grow stale and repetitive a lot faster than id hopedthe dialogue is awfulthe plot is ridiculous
spoiler the princess gets captured no fewer than three times while standing within  feet of you and you just stand there like an idiot
the graphics are fine but not exceptional or even very imaginativecharacter development is bland and pointless  the best choices are obvious and you can easily get all the options you want pretty quickly
i imagine if you look at the socalled choices all the players of this game make most of their characters would be shockingly similarthis is the sort of game you really want to like but if you are able to convince yourself that you actually do like it you must be pretty gulliblethis game was very enjoyable until i encountered a very serious bug that causes the ai controlled party members not to attack
this makes the game unplayablethe bug is triggered by entering a certain room in greedes underbelly
once the bug is triggered your party members do not attack anywhere in the gameeven in other locations in the game
loading the game at an earlier save point will restore remove the bug but when you enter the same room in greedes underbelly the bug is triggered againits an odd bug because not all gamers encounter it
the publisher of the gamesony is not able to resolve the issue and i have no idea how to contact the japanese company level  who developed the gamefor me purchasing this game was  flushed down the drainvery unhappy with sony and level this was fun for about an hour
then i ran into a boss that is to hard
i died about a zillion timesanyone out there i will send you my copy free just to get rid of it before i break iti was misinformed
i thought it had an easy modethis game is an annoying button masher with a simple yet nevertheless annoying amount of combos you must rememberbut that being said for a veteran gamer spanning multiple gaming decades with multiple systems and a current gs of k i could not get past the boss on the nd level while playing on the easiest difficulty settingi ran to the internet to find a way around this idiotic nonsense and google lists igns walkthrough  i go there to find the ign editor saying this boss has the distinction of being one of the most difficult this guide writer has ever tackled
i assume this guy is a much better gamer than i could ever live to bewtf
on level 
on the easiest difficulty setting
thats asinine
there is no reason a game should be this absurdly annoying on an easy difficulty setting in the beginning of the game
dumb
no reason you have to play it
there are so many better games out there
dont bother with this onethis game was absolutely horrible
the graphics were terrible and the fighting system mostly just consist of you pressing the same button over and over again
also i could not make it past level  because the boss was  unbelievably hard to defeat
the boss on level  was also very hard to defeat
was it really necessary to make all the bosses in this game unbeatablei dont appreciate games where you die a lot because the enemies are so cheap
the bosses take out  of your power meter with one hit and the game does not provide you with enough heal items
it is one of those games where the developers made a very short game and they compensate by making the difficult as hell
darn it
i wasted my moneyeasy apparently means different things to different people and the creators of ninja gaiden  are either illiterate or just wanted to fool folks into buying their game
im a casual gamer not looking for a ejectandthrowthediscatthewall experience and when a game has an easy setting i expect it to be just that
perhaps the god of war series has spoiled me
luckily i only dropped  for this crap and should hopefully get at least  when i trade it in for hopefully a game that has an easy level that lives up to the name
but at least this game isnt as bad as ninja blade as ninja gaiden  at least has multiple save points throughout whereas with ninja blade you have the same ignoringilliteracy when it comes to the word easy but cant save until youve played through an entire level multiple boss battles and allnow just so you know i love this series
ninja gaiden on the nes is one of my favorite games on the system and ninja gaiden black was one of the very few original xbox games i absolutely loved
when i heard a ninja gaiden  was being made i was overjoyed
when the game finally came out i was impressed with the first  levels but then it all just went downhill
the game is incredibly buggy and some of the weapons are ridiculously unbalanced
scythe which opens a new problem with the game
no challenge
this game was way to easy and shouldnt carry the ninja gaiden name at all
the series is know for being hard and thats what i loved about it
yeah some bosses were hard but for all the wrong reasons
team ninja there is a difference between challenge and cheapness get that through youre head
also fix the enemy ai
the enemies most notably the wolfs cant comprehend the basic ability of standing on a table
i stood on one and the wolfs couldnt get to me
did you hear that
standing on tables wasnt incorporated into the fighting engine
another thing im not a graphics whore but this game just looked awful
in fact ninja gaiden black from  looked better than this
ninja gaiden  was one of my biggest let downs this generation
look if youre craving a fun and fast beatemup or hack n slash dont look hear
just go pick up a copy of the first game ninja gaiden black bayonetta or any of the god of war games
this game may seem fun for the first few levels but it only gets worse as the game progresses
thanks for readingcmon
whos kidding who
what is with all these  and  star ratings
wheres the integrityif i were a betting man and in this case i definitely would be id have to allege that those reviews purporting to hold this game in such high esteem are somehow intimately acquainted with the company k gamesmafia ii collectors editionha
imagine walking more in this game than you are likely to do in real life
it is incredibly slowand i mean sloooow
the only fun i found was driving the cars escaping the cops etc
look i am a  yo
man and if mafia ii bores me im guessing you wont be happy either
now ill give you the benefit of doubt it could be because i am really into high action gamesyou know something that makes my heart pump and at my age you must understand  that is important
how else would i know im still alivemafia ii has the look and feel of games that hit the market ten years ago
the graphics while they are acceptable respond to the controller with too much jerkingcharacter movement lacked smoothnessvery edgy
if you are a person that likes slowmoving games requiring only minimal cognitive ability well all i can say is enjoymaybe there is something in the game i am not seeing
maybe i should have tried to achieve higher levels before giving up on itbut geeze when oh when was this game going to give me a real challenge
granted i suppose my criticisms may have spawned from too much call of duty halo and naturally being a pilot myself games like namcos ace combat   hey how about pac man
now there was a game that torqued my jawsltgrin  talk about tension
youve got to know im kidding
mafia ii may have debuted about four years ago which makes me wonder why they were pushing sales on it this year but you cant help but wonder if they pulled it out of a late s storage closet
for me its just hard to imagine this game was developed in the st centurybottom line  if youre ready to get into this game make sure you slam down an energy drink before you beginbecause at that moment when there is some action youll be able to wake up and jump into it otherwise ltyawn  as i understand it there are those who truly believe and insist there is action in mafia iiwho knows maybe i slept through it
after all i am  dont forgeti have played just about all of the mafia games for the wii and the xbox  and would rate this one as by far the worst of the lot
i stronly prefer the godfather games
the gameplay on this game is straight forward but very unoriginal
you can beat this game in  hours or so and there is not any replay value associated with the game
i would wait until the price dropped to the  range before getting this oneill make this simple so noone wastes their time
if you like  player games and have no internet or friends this game is great
colorful smooth graphics great characters and a well written plot
if you are like everyone else in the world that does have internet and was waiting to play the campaign online with  other friends or split screen the campaign with your buddy or little brother youve been duped
cause it isnt there
no coop online or splitscreen campaign mode makes this the worste and laziest move ever
its even deceiving cause the box says its  players online but thats not for campaign
its for these horrible game modes they make you play thrown into  area to defend artifacts or trap ghosts
aweful
i traded in left for dead which you can play online with people
big mistake
dont give atari anymore money
they have no finger on the pulse of what the majority is asking for
i want my  dollars back
a shame since the campaign is fun
but if you want a good  player game go back into your old dresser and pull out oblivionand now atari joins the drm thralls with a protection scheme so stringent that legitimate buyers wont be able to install the gamewhether the title is fun on nonpc platforms or not i dont know and for those who managed to install they have realized in shock that multiplayer options have been taken away for pc users
i cant get my copy to install regardless of what i try
if you search the atari forums you will find lots of similar complaints and very little in the way of answers
and it doesnt just fail to install for windows  users  it has failed to do so for customers owning xp and vista as wellsecurom
 install limit
online activation
while ea and other companies are starting to move away from drm atari apparently cant take a hintoh and you also cant save anywhere
typical brainless console port
while i understand that consoles being inferior and all have problems with save anywhere at least allow us pc gamers to save whenever we wantthis game doesnt deserve more than  starapparently if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
turns out ghostbusters pc is of course drmd up
also turns out its stripped of the multiplayer component which is an offense i cannot forgivethis is the rd time ive tried to install this game in the hopes that it will be good
i get it installed  then start to play  i then remember why i stopped playing it the first time
its a pointless rail shooter with no real content whose shooting which is the main point of a shooter i poorly coded  just not fun to play
i know its staying true to the movie that you have to wrangle the ghosts but a  year old movie does not stand up to the rigors of a contemporary shooteri came in hoping for non stop excitment  this game gives you non stop boredom its a constant crawl at the speed of molases
many times in this game you are barrarged by stupid convoluted faux conflict an by stupid convoluted faux conflict i mean finding you cant go one way on a map then having something explode making you have to go back the way you came just so you get to utilise a new dohicky you just got to get pass the thing you couldnt get passed the first time i know console gamers are used to that kind of inanity as its standard for there platform but as a pc player i can say i hate it
if you cant flesh out a ghostbusters game of all things without having to pad its levels with this nonsense you need to stop developing games  go back to game design schoolnot to mention how bad the ingame hud on the back of the ecto pack is or the pc versions lack of online play or any number of other failing this game has avoid this game at all costs especially if you are like me  a ghostheadi bought the ghostbusters pc version
installed successfully and loaded properly
however after the initial cinematic scene and intro scene the game freezes
the freeze happens before you even get a chance to play
also the game freeze is so bad that you have to reboot your whole computer
contacting the company atari does no good been waiting a week with no response
note the computer that i use exceeds the minimum requirements to playthe point the game is probably good but pc users are out of luck
if you are using a pc to play games do not buy ghostbustersfirstly i cant say how good the game itself is because the game wont install this is a large and well known problem if you buy this game youll likely be waiting in line at atari support like the other people who cant even install it which seems to be about everyonesecondly this thing is drmed up the arse with securom drm and finally they completely stripped out multiplayer folks
yes it was in the game but it got ripped out
you can even see traces of it in the files on the discall in all waiting  years for a true ghostbusters experience like this and atari screwed pc gamers
if i were to compare this game to something it would be the ghostbusters firehouse you get it and its garbage but it has so much potential waiting to be unlockedi was a fan from soul edge ps to soul calibur  psgraphs changed a lot to worsemovements are quite differentcharacter design is quite oddmusic unspectacularstory mode sucks man i loved the one back on scsc  in the other hand wowhated this game and wish i didnt waste the time and money on this weak attempt at a franchise awfuli have played many ps games and generally really find most to be very good
this is not fun but a chore to play
positives are game is very long and some of the powers are pretty cool
i will list just a few of the negatives
very repetitive the side missions are generally awful
constantly getting shot at gets real old quick
game is not really hard but it can be very unfair
once you start a mission you must finish it or you start all over again
boring
you have to do a lot of boring time consuming travel from one mission to the next
story is average at best
constant bombardment by enemies is stupid they shoot you at all times
climbing works well sometimes others it doesnt camera often gets screwed up
finally finished game and will not play again its just boring work
anyway i could go on
i like challenging gamesfavorite of all time is demos souls but this is not a fun game periodi dont know why ps games are not all in p or i resolutions
its supposed that we do have a big lcd screen will have an advantage but no it look horrible
nintendo  looks betterim not a fanboy of xbox or anything but at least every game that i buy for  is i capablevery dissapointed with infamous and the psedit if you are going to vote down this review please provide a rationale in the comment section below explaining why
you are supposed to vote down a review for being poorly written not because you disagree with the opinionafter the playstation network was hacked last year sony gave us free games in order to apologise to us
this game was one of them
now i had heard this game was listed as the top  ps games of all time so i was curiousstory the story is about a man by the name of cole macgrath who is trapped in a devastation in a corrupt city he is then caught in an explosion finding himself with electrical powers
the problem i had with the plot is that it has no depth story
youll be waiting through atleast  of the game in order to be intrigued by its slow paced plot or the fact that it lacks sense then again maybe the story lacking sense is what makes the game but it just didnt do it for mecharacters major flaw the lack of character development
throughout the game we are hearing about coles life and who he is but in the end it leads the player absolutely nowhere
now the imageview of coles character all depends on you you are given a karma meter which decides your characters fate between good and evil
sadly it really doesnt matter how you do it because the chracter is lacking an in depth storyvoice acting the voice acting is good however i have an issue with coles voice
the voice of cole is good but it doesnt match who his character is
coles voice sounds as if he is a blood thirsty character when cole is absolutely nothing like that
i was expecting him to sound more like chris from resident evil  not batman
the rest of the voices sound okaygameplay the gameplay is good very smooth but a little slippery when climbing walls buildings etc
being able to shoot lightening and go on a street rampage is pretty cool
though some gamers may not like being shot every time they walk outside
if you enjoy free roaming i must say this will keep you hooked
when you run out of electricity you will need to find the nearest power source and take energy from it
when taking damage from an enemy the screen will begin to turn redder and redder until you diegraphics the graphics are okay the faces are a bit squishy
could look better considering this is the psfinal word i wish i would have never downloaded this game its not even worth free
i do not understand how this game got on the top  ps games of all time
there are millions of better games out there for the ps
now hey dont let my opinion hurt you from buying it its just my opinion
to be quite honest this may be one of the worst games ive ever played
im not interested in the sequel
and to all you fans out there i just want to let you know that theres a movie in process i thought i should atleast let you know that
for me this was a complete waste of timeenviroments look really sickspiderman with a gun and a goofy haircutnothing different except the special armthe main character looks quite dumbloolspidercomandoi really didnt care for the mulit playerpsn id gremdude
okay i really wanted to like this game
there were things i did like but the killer for me were the checkpoints
i dont mind difficult games and the controls were not that difficult
yes the pistol is a pea shooter but that didnt bother me that much because there is generally plenty of ammo
the grappling can be fun and this was the main draw for me
i made it to the second part of the gamethe industrial complex
there is a part where you have to jump to a building and kill the five guys there
no big deal
then you have to jump across to another building
once there you kill  guys and then have to jump to another building
this is all one checkpoint
the fights are not hard
i was never killed by the moron ai in this game
the platforming is just way too unforgiving
the game starts off by saying that you can fall off a building
sure as long as there is no water as this idiot drowns in  seconds flat
even considering the fact that the bionic arm weighs him down he should be able to hold his breath for at least  second
long enough to find a grappling point to get out of the water
nope freaking seconds
so if you fall in water you are dead
if you go the wrong way and hit some radiation you are dead
in other words i killed those same  guys four times just because i missed a jump and fell into the water
linear
hell yes
there is only one way to get to the destination
some person mentioned that killzone was linear
duh it is a standard first person shooter
you never get the feeling in that game that you can explore the entire area
bionic commando fools you with the wide open landscapes and makes you thing that you can go all over the place
radiation everywhere and water makes sure that this is not the case
when it comes right down to it this game is not fun and i returned it to gamestop in one day
i will take a straight linear shooter any day over this crapedit actually i ended up giving this game another chance and made it all the way to the second to last level
i didnt finish the gamethat part jumping from jet to jet just frustrated the hell out of me but is is worth the price once you get used to the grappling
mastering the grappling skill in this game is essential
the boss battle with the gigantic robotic worm alone is worth giving this game a chance
psn user gremdudei have only gotten  through this game
i had to restart my ps three times because the game froze
there doesnt seem to be any obvious reason for the game to freeze
it is not a graphic intensive game at all
i have noticed more bugs in the game besides the unpredictable freezes
one minute i would get trapped behind walls or fences for no reason and another minute a supernatural force would teleport me through thick brick walls or closed metal doors after minutes of struggling to get to the other side
it is creepy
my game is brand new and in perfect condition
one other thing is when i first downloaded the lego batman demo from psn i couldnt play it through
the demo made my ps freeze  times till i finally gave up
i thought the real game would be fine
i guess i was wrong
i have played other lego titles and this is the first time it freezes so frequently
i am so mad that i will only play the ds version of this game from now on
maybe rent it before you make a purchase of this gamesimply cannot be read
returnedthis game would be great if it were playable
when pressing r to open chests it acts like it isnt being held
the double jump doesnt work
i initially thought it was my controller tried another
same result and looked online a plethora of people are having this issue
playstation had no answers
when i called they said that the number to contact god of war iii was their number but it wasnt anything they had a solution to
ridiculous and disapointing
i recommend against buying this until that is fixedlatest patch has fixed my glitch i still drop a star due to this initial problem combined with it being not as good as uncharted  in my opinionseems like this game was deliberately programmed to infuriate me
its one of those games where you get your butt kicked while youre learning a sensation ive never treasured
how would you like if i sat you down to a board game you didnt know  you ask how is it played
and i respond uh youll more or less get the idea once i start attacking you
thats exactly how this game works
i hate losing while im learninganyhow heres some other things the way this game was marketed promised a lot of good ol hackandslash action
really though the lions share of your time is spent doing timed puzzles moving blocks around pulling levers turning cranks etc
lord if i havent had an afull of these
i solve enough gd conundrums every day at work i dont need a video game testing my intelligence
i want to be a guy with huge muscles who runs around slaying monsters with his awesome sword
is that too much to ask
the actual adventures your guy goes through get mindnumbingly repetitive even if youre playing through the game for just the first time
nearly every encounter is based on the cage match paradigm your character trips some sort of switch whereupon some sort of of walls come up and some sort of monsters continue spawning until you manage to trip another sort of switch whereupon the walls come down and you are allowed to continue
yawn
you cannot control the camera at all as you can in many games of this type
this is a shame since there are some good visuals along the way
this drawback gets pretty infuriating in some of the puzzles where you need to move the camera around a bit to get a good sense of what youre looking at
heck even when its not a question of a puzzle the camera is awfully dumb about framing relevant elements
as a result of this the game has a very restricted cramped feel since what you get depends not on what your character needs to see or logically would see eg the ledges hes jumping from and to but rather what the camera wants to do to best showcase the background art
the easy mode really isnt 
the monsters are easier to kill but since nothing has been done about the timed puzzles and jumping challenges ie the spike room flying through the tunnels they still manage to infuriate everybody
the actual combat is exceedingly dull although it may not look like it to somebody watching the game
i frequently put this game on pause to get my algebra homework done
although there are a plethora of combos available nearly all monsters  including all boss monsters  can be safely dispatched by simply pressing the same button over and over again
this game has no business forcing you to go through a whole bunch of jumping and swinging challenges since its graphics and shading arent good enough to tell where your character is eg remember jumping behind athenas bed
most of the time this is because the lighting source and therefore the shadows are illogical so its difficult to gauge distance and height
consequently success in the games many jumping puzzles boils down to just a matter of luck and memorization not skill
also the logic of the distances you can leap to seems to change depending on the camera angle sometimes you can leap vast chasms other times you can barely hop over a puddle
i hate watching the same cutscenes over and over again
why doesnt this game let you skip them
the storyline is preposterous
the olympians are immortal
how can they be killed
and how can you kill people who are already in hades
and does it make sense that kratos would be making so much headway on overthrowing the gods of olympus when he even cant jump over an effin puddle
the gods woulda just teamed up and squashed him like a bug
the weapons you get have some grandiose names eg bow of apollo claws of hades but theyre quite ineffectual even against gardenvariety zombies
if youre fighting a runofthemill skeleton and it takes like  hits to kill him its time for a new weapon
i love how the muchvaunted bow of apollo has about as much oomph as a spitwad
curse you yu suzuki or whoever invented qtes quick time events
i hate them
these are the times when its basically a cut scene but you have to press the x button or the o button at the right time
what is this the fourth grade
are we learning to identify shapes this week
another problem with these is that you cant focus on the cool graphics at all since youre waiting for the next prompt with gimlet eyes
qtes need to be outlawed
this game is far too violent for my taste
it just got to the point where you didnt want to enter qtes when an opponent was on its last legs since you know the visuals are going to be gross
if this had been a movie it probably would have received an x for violence
i mean youre graphically pulling folks heads off and stuff  couldnt they have at least included a blood off option like they did in assassins creed ii
game is not kind to you if you havent played the first two installments
youll be baffled as to whats going on until at least halfway through the gamethe game had potential but instead is more frustrating than fun
i bought it cheap so its not a total loss of money since i can sell it for most of the money backfor the most part its pretty much exactly the same as the previous games
game play is pretty much exactly the same as the previous games
i get the whole if it aint broke dont fix it thing but this is the end of the trilogy i expected something new in this department and sadly there isnt anything new about it
the story is a disappointment as well
its basically a giant snuff film who does kratos has to kill pretty much everyone in order to get his hands on zeus
it gets real boring real fast
the graphics are soso i expected better and the soundtrack is epic
what ruins the game for me though is the frustratingly difficult quick time events that are so freaking annoying to deal with it absolutely ruins the game for meoverall i expected something far greater than this to end such an epic game trilogy
its not terrible but its far from the masterpiece that everyone made it out to behow could they do this
the first gears multiplayer was the most fun i have ever had on xbox   hours and hours of fun
they have completely changed what made the multiplayer good
how can you justify this
if it aint broke dont fix it
i have sold gears  and reverted back to gears  it is sooooooo far superior to gears  for the multiplayer experience
i am a huge gears fan and i am hoping that the creators are looking at these reviews before they put out gears  go back to the good ole days where the shotgun could acutally be a useful weapon and you had to have skill to pull off a  downs execution with the sniper rifle
why epic whyi hate this gamethanks to this game people actually stopped playing onlineits that badterrible experiencegow took the worst of the first game and made it its strong pointthe plot takes you nowhereok theres some really cool levels and the graphics are top notch but this is an example of something genericand the multiplayer sucks big time tooyou must wait for minutes and minutes to realize your patience is rewarded with a lame annex game nobody chooses but since there was a tie in the votes its computers choiceobviously four of your team leavesand you too if youre smartbut then it counts as a negative for your rank so if you once had a three now you have a two and never leave therethe shotgun sucksbut the worst are the grenadesnow the strategy is to throw or plant the smoke grenade so every one on the team stuns for like an entire round lying on the floor like idiots and it just takes one person of the other team with a chainsaw ready to kill everyone lyingohand if an opponent comes at you with a prepared chainsaw and you shoot at him with your shotgun he wont stopyour bullet will not affect him and get will get youalsoremember when you had to be good with the torquebow to kill someonenow you only have to hit the floor with an arrow close to the opponent to kill himwhats nextbouncing sniper bulletsso all the little idiots are now running with their chainsaws killing everyone and planting grenadesaint that a break for the mediocrehonestlyit sucksdont buy itrent iti never receive it so i dont know how it is but i heard is greati loved gears  online although i was not a huge fan of the story although i doubt anyone was because they purposly made the dialogue like a cheesy scifi
but the greatest part of it was bring guest online and playing with your friends
as is such the appeal of halo
i was really looking forward to going home opening up and playing with my friend who has waited in line with me for  hours
i logged online and spent  minutes trying to find how to log a guest in till i realized they had not included that feature in gears   in my opinion the worste mistake they could have possibly made
not only that but they have also made several key tweaks to the weapons that add up to make mediocre online play
for example the smoke grenade now stuns
considering every player in the game starts off with one of these it makes it impossible to hold cover
it has already become quiet common for a gun battle to just turn into an exchange of smoke grenades
also they have make it so you can turn frag grenades into a sort of makeshift mine
naturally players are just standing on the frag grenades waiting for them to repop so they can put them in your spawn
they have also added a pointless ability to crawl while you are down
this is not only pointless its humiliating
dont be mistaken their is not escaping when you are down
it just makes it funner to humiliate you for the other team
another wonderful addition is the shotgun is now even more powerful
although they have managed to make it possible to keep them at bay from a range
close range the shotgun is now extremely powerful and accurate
it is not at all uncommon to be eliminated by the first shot which pairs just wonderfully with the smoke grenade stun
the game has just turned into a race for who can through a smoke grenade faster
another huge dissapointment is the game types promised and maps
the new game types simply dont offer the excitement that simple execution and warzone provided in gears one and the maps often foster overuse of smoke grenades and frag mines
i can say though the roadie run and cover system has improved vastly
the campaigne play is much funner and the story is much more involving
but as a person who would only by a game for only play i am extremely dissapointed
between no longer playing with guest a very unbalanced play style and not delivering on new game types my worste fears of come true
after months and months of waiting gears of war   suckswell i waited and waited for this game and just like fallout  and fable  it was overhyped and overrated
these games are making money off of their titles
i am not writing a review and blasting this game for any hidden motive at the end of this review you will not read what game i think should be the game of the year
i think the intentions of this game were good but they were not executed the multiplayer was horrible taking forever and a day to load
the graphics were great but the overall game affects were not even close to par
there was some major lagging i have to say the weapons are the only reason this game would even get a  star if you can honestly say  once you have a good  hrs in this game  u enjoy it then it is a total biased review
the game is repetitive
anyway i am sure some of the gow followers will blow this up and say how biased i am but if it makes them feel any better i loved gow 
i think if this was not a sequeal to the amazing gow  it should at least get a  star ratign however all of the build up and that kinda stuff lowered my rating bc of the game its selfi tried so hard to like this game but the controls are absolute garbage
mostly because of that the game is insanely ridiculously hard and unplayable
stay far away from this game
it pisses me off because it could have been fantastic
after playing this im seriously considering getting rid of my xbox   developers have to ruin every single game bad camera controls ai ludicrous difficulty that borders on cheating and this is no exceptionhonestly just read a book or go to the gym
its a much better use of your time than playing this trash
the first bionic commando was great but this is not even closegameplay is okay by  standards
the big problem is the game is barely functional
you have to have a constant internet connection to play even single player
bnet  is incredibly frustrating and confusing
you will probably mess up sometime adding friends and end up revealing all your personal information to someoneedit 
this is now a negative  star reviewi thought that hey its been over half a year since i last played this game maybe just maybe blizzard fixed the stupid skirmish ai
and the game might be fun now boy was i wrong as i cannot even play the game anymore because of blizzard treating its paying customers as if they were criminals
they might as well ask for a fingerprint and dna
sample before being able to play
maybe i need to take a test of some sort before they deem me worthy to play a game i physically own
hell the cia
and fbi
websites have less login requirements than this freaking gamei have to remove all stars because this game is no longer playable due to the sheer amount of loops needed to jump through just to play offline singleplayer
there is nothing wrong with my fios fiberoptic connection
there is nothing wrong with my firewall
there is no reason to have to activate a game for the sixth time
i legally own and have a physical copy of in the drive
it tells me i need to link my game to the battlenet account but doesnt give me a link or any decent information as to how to do this
i cannot play the game at all in any mode
i cannot even log onto the game as a guest on my own computer
i dont even play multiplayer
why the bleep do i need to log onto  different places to play offline singleplayer
this is beyond ridiculousif this is their idea to try and stop piracy then they failed because this kind of treatment of paying customers just drives pc piracy through the roofif there is any class action lawsuit against blizzard or way to return the game please let me know because i want my  dollars back
edit 
i just got the retail release been waiting  years for this i have to say it is more hype than it delivers on
yes the controls are still nice and simple i enjoy that a lot but it just seems to be starcraft  minus the brood war expansion with a bit better graphics thrown in
forgive me for being blunt and critical with this but they have had over  years to make this game
first off the price was outrageous but like an idiot fanboy i shelled out  bucks for rd of a game considering that this is only the terran campaign and that the protoss and zerg campaigns will not come out for over a year from now and they will cost an additional  each as far as i know at the moment
though there are rumors they may be expansion priced at  a pop in all honesty they should be free downloadablecontent since it should have been in the game from the beginning
so blizzard is becoming even more greedy than ea
sure when ea releases a game its too soon halfa and buggy as all hell but at least it is mostly there
blizzard on the other hand releases a game a million years after the first game fully polished and debugged but missing rds of the gameplay and no big improvements over the originalthe game runs fine on ultra settings for me with vista ultimate x gigs of ram and an nvidia gtx card but i am a bit disappointed considering there has been over  years of d rts advancement from the original starcraft what i mean is you cannot rotate the camera only zoom in and out a little bit so sometimes trying to click on one unit in a group of many is a nightmare
you cannot rotate the placement of buildings so everything is always facing only one direction not that bad but units still come out of the sides or backs of buildings through walls instead of the front door the is no antialiasing support not that bad but my computer is a gaming rig
so compared to the older command  conquer generals or the newer command and conquer  or supreme commander and many other rts games out there already this game is actually behind the times in graphics and d battlefield controlone of the worst things is the online requirement but fortunately it is only checked occasionally so this can still be played offline with a laptop but in that case you have to log on as a guest for a game you own on a computer you own
but beware when you register the game they ask you very personal things like name age sex location telephone number and even your street address
and you have to fill it out or else you cannot play the gamenow for the gameplay it is just as awesome as the first starcraft
i am having a blast with it but that is because this is just like the first starcraft some of the levels feel like they just took them from the first game and threw in more eyecandy
if you loved base building then keep playing the original starcraft because this game seems to have been made for the adhd
and add
generation too many levels are small and set with a time limit comeon blizzard
you can do better than tiny little  minute levels though there are still some large maps and unlimited time levels for us base builders
but i miss the huge levels from broodwar and the original starcraft where you would have to send out search patrols all over the map to find that last enemy building or objective
i think they spent more time on the cut scenes and inbetween game down time than the level design and map sizes some of the levels feel downright cramped claustrophobic
there are some new and quite awesome units in this game but there are also lots of missing favorites from the broodwar expansion
though one of the new elements i find interesting is the downtime between missions where you can purchase unit upgrades talk with crew members point and click style and choose the next missions a bit less linear than the first starcraft so it has a bit of rpg elements thrown in
they have also jumped onto the whole achievements bandwagon so you get these annoying popups now and then that apparently give you bragging rights online or something like that
when you get these achievements they dont actually do anything that i am aware of in the game other than unlocking portrait pictures for the forums online communitythis game gets  stars for fun because it is just as fun as the first starcraft but it only gets  stars overall for the fact that in over  years they could only give us  missions in one playable campaign and slightly updated gameplay graphics one of my friends couldnt tell the difference between the original starcraft and this one while taking away lan play taking away some favorite units and jumping on the always online and pointless achievements intrusive bandwagoni loved the original starcraft to death so i honestly thought this one would be a bit more updated compared to the original
it is still a very fun game but i would say wait a few more years for a game of the year edition or a reduced price boxset with everything included unless blizzard nickel and dimes its fans to death first
edit player vs ai
is completely messed up the ai
does not even make base defenses until  minutes into a match and even then it makes only  and in a weird place
ai
also attacks the entry to your base that is nearest to the ai
base and completely ignores undefended points of your base if they are farther than your main entry point
ai
also just creates a large mass of units and sends them all at once making the ai
very easy to defeat with even bad units
multiplayer and vs ai
has a lack of unit types basically half of what you got in the campaign
every day i play this it feels more like a still in development beta releasei will continue to update this review as things get worse or better over timebottom linejust play the original starcraft and broodwar expansion because this is rd of a game with a slight d graphical update sparkly cutscenes and the most draconian and annoying startup and login procedure of any game i have ever playedi bought the game installed it and then went through all of the trouble of creating and registering an account but even after all of that when i try to play it it will not let me log in
no matter how many times i try putting in my account and password it rejects it even though i know i am entering properly
when i contacted blizzard about it i basically got snubbed the first time and then the nd time they said that this was a known problem and we are working on it
yeah
right
why even bother to release a game if they can not do it rightbefore i go into my review for this game i just wanted to say the game itself is pretty awesome unfortunately its years behind in  aspect that i really expect to find in any game past my complaint region lock
my friend from another country and i can discuss strats but we can never practice them or see who is right thanks to the completely irrational region lock on this game
its so frustrating
i wont ever buy another blizzard game again because of this one thing
i went from blizzard being one of my favorite companies to buy games from to the least
the reason i wont buy their games now is i now know they have no concept of what some of us expect from gamesive read thoughts about the reasons for putting the region lock in but ive never seen a good one
i dont buy that its to prevent laggy games if that were the case you would at least be able to select another region knowing you might be entering laggy territory
i dont think its for extra money either because of the trouble you have to go through to get a working european copy and us copy at the same time on the same machine yes currently you actually have to have a separate client to play on another regions serversi got my copy on the day of releasse  have had fun playing itthe game is woefully incomplete though
it also focuses heavily on you being online and constantly reactivating the product
i expected an online game to have some drm but this is really ridiculousill probably play for another  weeks and then give my copy to a friendseriously disappointingive been playing against the computer for a few months now and have come to the same conclusion each time
anytime i play zerg against the computer i always lose on very hard difficulty full ai with no resource handicap unless i set the computer to also be zerg in which case i beat it easily
anytime i play terran or protoss against the zerg i knock the snot out of them
the zerg have been gutted and have piss poor crowd control with only one unit having any major splash damage
that makes an enormous difference in a game where crowd control is absolutely essential
granted there are some units with splash effects but nothing like what the terran and protoss can meat out for damage
the first starcraft was extremely well balanced and ive been pretty disappointed with the second onethis game was produced over a  year period
thats a lot of time for the rts genre to improve
starcraft  incorporates only a few of these upgrades
an easy example would be allowing for an optional peacetime allowing someone other than grunt rush style players
this feature is virtually standard on every other rts
no such luck that improvement was just too sophisticated
the real disappointment though was the much hyped online match making
the idea seemingly so simple and obvious is to actually make for competitive games by having rankings and balanced matchmaking
sounds straightforward
instead they have the most simple rating system imaginable one that is often cheated at by the way
the end result is that a very good player can just be paired with a less skilled player allowing the master player to mop the map with everyone
all in a supposedly balanced game
we waited  years of work for that
the graphics are improved but the overall gameplay is stuck in   the game reminds me of starwars episode   after a long wait and a ton of hype you get a very pretty yet substandard gameto play this game  even to play it alone without connecting to anybody  you are required to give the company your real name email address home address birthdate and phone number
this is required information not optionali will not pay  for onethird of a game nor will i pay that for a game that has far less functionality than the original
activision put its heart and soul into ruining starcraft  and blizzard and theyve clearly succeededsixty dollars for no lan play no chat rooms paytodownload dlc remember when you could download maps for free in every other blizzard rts
 a bizarre friends system and of course onethird of the starcraft  story with the promise of the other two in expansions
its almost supernatural how insulting it all isthe best part is that blizzard has said publicly that theyre fine with all of it that activision hasnt limited them at all
i cant help but get the image that activision execs were holding assault rifles to the blizzard reps head as he announced thatshamefulso you buy a pc game for  and you get a  of a game with glitches and hitches and more ways to make money
i remember when i was excited about blizzard games i even bought blizzcon tickets this year i feel dirty nowwhythey arent the same that they were its now about making as much money for the most stretched out game play
albeit the name of the game is to make money but where is the honor in upsetting all of these fansplease blizz cut the drm licence bs
please deliver a game that i want to pay for and not feel like a crooknextly ubi should join blizzactiv make a giant brain child of drm and server control on a side not the game is good same old same old really good for some not so much for othersif you were a die hard sc then you will like it if you werent you probably wont make a giant change and come backim not under the delusion that blizzard wont make a ton of money on this game theyve become a megalithic game company for a reasonrequiring the internet to play removing lan plan and all the other things they are forcing people to put up with in order to play their games is a sure way to bring them down from the clouds howeverim not buying it nor its drawnout future expansion campaigns designed solely to make more bank and the same seems to hold true for the release of diablo eitherwow
this is just like the first game but with updated graphics
stick with the first one
if you want something cool keep an eye on end of nations which is an mmorts
that will be the game to getim writing this to all of you who said that the game review should be based on the game itself and not marketing scheme
are you kidding me
if i pay for a full pie i expect a full round pie
i dont want  of the piece
fine to avoid piracy you need internet
fine no lan all my friends are in distant place anyways
but to take away the campaigns
cmon those campaigns are there to learn how to play each race i dont want to learn each race by getting owned by  yr old kid cmon this is torture
is this another scheme to lure me into buying guides
really
is it all about the money
clearly this decision was made by business person in any software developement if you have business person making the technical decisionit always go bad
i know there are sc developers reading this review and probably knodding their head by now speak up sc developersive finished the entire game on normal difficulty so im well qualified for this reviewive finished the entire game in just one day
as far as single campaign is concerned it was way too short many missions last less than  minutes
for  cold hard cash i expected a lot morethe game took too long to finish and as good as the graphic is is showing its age
it looks ish because of dxcs limitation
it just doesnt have the wow effect anymorethe money first customers second is rearing its ugly head ever since activision took over for all blizzards talk about we put our customers first the only thing they are concerned about now is milking more money out of its loyal customers  you can count me out nowfor those of you who havent purchased the game yet wait until it hits 
as it is right now it aint worth no stinkin  dead presidents
for those of you who dont care about online play you will not be getting your moneys worth
im not even looking forward for the expansion anymore
what
they gonna charge  for ten more  minutes missions
ill pass
this is coming from an exblizzard mega fan
goodbye blizzard
youve certainly aliened your fans a good deali find it extremely frustrating that the industry is trending toward forcing you to go online to play their games
what happened to the days when i could just insert the cd enter the antipirating key load the game and play
this game forces you to be online to play
period
if you dont have access to the internet or have a slow connection youre screweddont know about you but i will never buy another game that forces me to login to the internet to play
this is why i didnt buy cc
 its the only way i know how to send a message to the developersunfortunately blizzard is no longer about gamestoo many years of running wow aka a moneyprinting machine has ruined the companyor maybe it was all the changes to their corporate structurewhatever the cause making you sign onto the internet over and over to verify your copy no lan game uber regionlocking and charging  for what is effectively  of the complete game is unacceptableit means blizzard has finally become a company  not about the games or the fans or even the casual customers they are purely about squeezing every last cent out of every fanboy they can dupe into buying their productsplease dont take my word for itresearch this gamemake sure you understand completely the limitations that blizzard tries to hidebuying this abomination will only encourage them to produce morehelp them see the error in their waysboycott this gamegood fun game
credit where it is due
great graphicssound
decent if simplistic storyline
fun if somewhat brief singleplayer gamebad drm nightmare
lan play crippled
battlenet is a huge pain but you have to use it
cant play in different time zones
cant spawn
internet connection required
paying customers treated like criminals
greeeeed its only actually  of the game
look forward to the whole game costing you  not for any special editions eitherblizzard has likely hammered home the final nail in its coffin as a studio that gets it
what a huge difference between this and the originaland definitely not in a good way
i pay for games
i do not advocate piracy
so why then do pirates get a superior product
yes the cracked version is already available all over the place and that version lacks what makes this product so distastefulhaving been a huge fan of the first game i was bitterly disappointed that this one is so crippled as well as being incomplete
there comes a point where the bottom line of profit is directly impacted by ones reputation
blizzard took a running jump over it this time
they went from one of the most respected studios on the planet to an entity that makes ea and apple look positively enlightened by comparison
to be fair it is perhaps activision that is to blame but most folks will not take that into considerationpiracy is here to stay as long as there are people who simply refuse to pay  for a computer game
thus far no one has produced any drm capable of stopping it or even significantly reducing it
the drm does do a fine job of annoying the paying customers though
why studios fail to see this is beyond me
i suppose whoever builds drm solutions has a really good sales team
meanwhile those who pirate the game get a better version than the one we pay forluckily for blizzard the anticipation for this game was so frenzied that they will do quite well im sure
millions have already purchased it
im just wondering how many returns they will get
theyll get one from me thats all i can say for certain
it will also be interesting to see how well they do selling the second and third parts as well as any future games
my guess is that they wont get quite the numbers they expect unless changes are madestatistics have proven time and again that having even the most draconian drm does nothing to reduce piracy and that those who release a game without it somehow manage to do just fine if its a good game
some studios have learned this lesson
mass effect  is a good example
i happily purchased that game after passing on the first one due to its drm
hopefully blizzard will make some changes and restore its reputation as a gamerfriendly company soonyou arent buying a disc thats usable for playing the game
you might as well just buy the download version you need constant internet access to play this and will end up downloading even with this discokay i have read many reviews here giving it one star and i have to agree i was so excited for this and yes while its fun to relive the exact same game from the past i would like to have seen some risk
not only that but not lan
i still do lan parties with starcraft 
come on blizzard you helped create the lan system why not keep it upit seems ever since wow all blizzard cares about is their next cash cow while this will help i sadly will shelve this game until my friends pick it up which will be when the battle chest comes out with all  sigh thank you blizzard you tarnished my favorite childhood gamethe game is very incomplete because there are no campaigns for zorg or protoss
those will probably be released as expensive expansion packsthere is also a lot of drm
you cant even play a local game on your computer without connecting to battlenet
the game also requested that i open many ports on my firewall
none of the other games that i own do thisthe game designers also made stupid choices for no apparent reason
for example you can only change your name once
why is there a limit at all
that makes no sensethe campaign mode is terrible
the designers didnt separate the tutorial from the campaign
so in the campaign the game gradually lets you build different units
for example in the second mission you only have marines medics scvs barracks command center and supply depot
each new mission introduces a new unit or building that you can use
this is a pathetic way to make a campaign
i wish that on the first mission you had access to all units and buildings
also the first  missions are extremely boringthe achievements at the end of each stage are also stupid
the game doesnt tell you what you need to do to earn the achievements before or during the mission
then at the end of the mission you will realize that you didnt complete all of the achievements because you didnt know what the achievements were
also if you want to replay the stage in order to get the achievements you will have to reload the game at an earlier save
you cant easily replay a stage in order to get a higher scorethis is coming from a long time fan of the series
i purchased this game the day it came out i beat the single player campaign and have spent at least a dozen hours playing onlineafter being a big star craft fan for so long i was psyched about this when it came out
i bought the original star craft with the zerg box on the day it came out and i beat it  or  times played the online for awhile and got many years of enjoyment out of it
so when starcraft  came out it was a no brainer that i wanted it
well much to my dismay part  is by far the inferior of the two games in just about every way possible
so ill just give reasons why below i did not like starcraft  you do not ever get to explore the maps create your own strategy or play how you want in the single player campaigns
every single player map basically tells you what to do exactly and almost how to do it the game holds your hand the entire time and guides you everywhere and giving you a cue every time something needs to be done
the entire game is literally a giant tutorial and nothing else
i never felt like i had a chance to explore to set up defenses to try and use strategy or anything on my own
like for instance when you earn the ability to get siege tanks its because you find them on a mission i use find loosely as its unavoidable to find them and then the rest of the map is setup specifically designed to let you use the siege tanks to win and doing so otherwise just doesnt work
or one where again you find a vehicle and have to stop these trains well unless you use the vehicles you found against the train you wont win
every map is staged so you have exactly what you need and every map has a specific predesigned way of beating it
they are all exactly as small as possible so you dont wander off and do something dumb like play your way
every single player map is like playing a game of chess where the pieces are setup for you already and the only way to win is to do things the way a diagram laid out for you says blizzards amazing story cut scenes are designed horribly
youd think this was gears of war in space because all the men are these giant bulked out muscled guys that have to weigh lbs of pure muscle with arms so big that they are bigger than my torso
i thought we would get away from the chris redfield of resident evil  and gears of war school of character design
this is a little gripe yes but it kind of ruins my ability to suspend disbelief when every male in the game aside from the skinny nerdy guy look like they are smuggling car fenders on their clothes i still dislike that i paid  bucks for  of a game
i know blizzard said many times that they couldnt put all of the campaigns in here due to time and so on
but i look back at starcraft and warcraft  where they managed to fir great multiplayer many single player missions for all  races and a complete storyline onto a single mb cd but they cant do it with a dvd or two now also
i dont like the idea of paying  dollars to play all  races
now since they merged with activision this tactic or more money is becoming more evident i dont think it has anything to do with time or whatnot
since merging with activision their prices have gone up starcraft  cost  when they used to cost  like all of pc games the starcraft  collectors edition now costs  when it used to be blizzard only charged  for the collector editions the wowcata collectors edition also got its price raised by like  bucks
the game was chopped up into  parts so they could sell more and nothing else every other mission i felt like i was being rushed as much as possible in the single player campaign
it seems like every other mission has a timer of some sort
save the colonists before the protoss kill them destroy the trains before  get away get out before the never ending wave of zerg kill you and so on
way to often the game is rushing you through the map even if you dont play online you still have to connect to your online account to play
you have to get a battlenet account you have to register your games cdkey and you have to be connected to your battlenet account before you can play a offline single player game
i dont like having to login so i can play a game offline there is no lan support in the game meaning if i want to play with friends we are forced to go online and get funneled through the battlenet service
i dont like that i liked being able to get on a lan with my friends right there and play  lag free with no problems
but blizzard removed that feature purely so were forced to us their battlenet service in order to keep us on their servers
so the people i play with we tried it a couple times and didnt like it so we fired up the original starcraft instead and played on the lan and had more fun actually the multiplayer still sucks because of how the game is designed
unless you practice and follow the exact same build order as found on online faqs like everyone else youll get crushed online
the game is inherently flawed for online play to give victory to people who build stuff in a certain way
play against a terran and watch them and they will all build the same things in the places in the same order
if you enjoy playing others but dont like following the exact same pattern every time you play and play to rush through as fast as possible then you wont have much success online or much fun eitherall in all blizzard has made starcraft  vastly inferior to starcraft  in every way possible
aside from the fact the graphics are nice in part  there isnt a thing i liked as much as or better
i cant recommend this game unless it costs  bucks or less to youthe rumors are true blizzardactivision has disabled lan and single player gaming for starcraft  to clarify you must be logged into battlenet so blizzardactivision can track everything you doi realize blizzardactivision is greedy and wants to sell your information to different corporations
but why did they have to disable lan gaming
unless you have screaming fast broadband do not even attempt to play this onlineto make matters worse you only get the terran campaign
if you want the zerg and protoss campaign you have to dish out another  plus tax
greed has ruined blizzard
i would suggest you pass on world of starcraftblizzards antipiracy tactics have destroyed starcrafts incredible legacy
i cant believe it took blizzard  years to bring this disgrace out they would have been better off just letting it be
its ridiculous that users are forced to play online even when not playing multiplayer
by the way this is obviously a  rental considering it has  resale value youre paying  for something only you can use and eventually throw away
this really should not carry on the names of starcraft or battlenetway to destroy a great game
no lan option
that was bread and butter for sc why abandon that feature for some half baked crap like spectator on bn
im glad a friend of mine bought this game and not me
i got so busy with work i didnt have time to preorder
fate was good to me it seems
i knew activision was just going to be one big albatross for blizzard and here is the first birthing of that inbreedinggood luck to all those good developers artists and other line workers
im sure youll get your credit back in shape in  or so years after this smelly turd of a company lets you all gostarcraft ii is a disappointment
the game is short and really easy
a lot of the missions are just retreads from the original starcraft
it might be worth picking it up if you like multiplayer and want to game against your friends
dont get it for the single playerim not willing to spend sixty on this game only to get onethird of a game sc  came with all three races on two play discs and have to pay for premium content on top of my sixty bucksanother candidate for the five dollar bin six months from nowalso valve ea blizard et al need to get off of the always connected requirement
drm is a tax for those of us who are honest and legitimately purchase our games
if the  server wont be running  or  years from now then i posit that you are renting not buying the gamehonestly i didnt expect starcraft ii to be the second coming of rts games but after playing this game i came to the conclusion that it was too little too late
while i can certainly understand blizzards mission to uphold the highest design standards of the game and not release until its ready what i came away with was that the game does not justify the long wait we endured
while the cgi sequences are certainly above standard what game doesnt have great cgi scenes
 there is nothing particularly spellbinding about the gameplay
been there done that was what i kept thinking as i played through the missions
initially i did not believe the rumors i kept hearing about starcraft ii being a third of a game
but it is true
the game can be finished fairly quickly by any seasoned rts playerthe openidtrueid thingthis is the appalling part of the entire process
it ruins the game
it is a slap in the face to anyone who plunked down hard earned money for this game
i have no desire for my real name to be floating out there for the spammers to utilize
i already get enough spam
when i play starcraft i want to escape realitynot have it thrown back into my face
blizzard definitely went overboard with this and i feel privacy should have been placed higher on the priority list at blizzard headquartersthe game looks great but keeps crashing every  minutes or so randomly looks like blizzard no longer makes goodstable games
we waited this long for a buggy as  game that keeps crashing and doesnt even have features the first one have
update i see many comments about upgrading my computer no this isnt the issuecpu intel quad qgfx nvidia  gtxos windows xp pro sp bitram  gigsmotherboard and ram are of a high quality brand and model as well
this is not some old cheap computer and no other games in the  or so years i have owned it have ever had issuesit is on my sons computer i will install it on my intel i gig ramati win computer to see if has same problemsi havent bought this game or even have a computer to run it but i am mad that they dont have a lan option and only have one campaign
the first game had  campaigns
what i did see from videos on youtube is that the game play looks solid and the graphics are very nice
i dont like that i would need an internet connection to play the gameif i ever buy a computer i wont be getting this game for surei was going to buy this game today but based on what these reviews tell me im not going to bother until its in the bargain bin
which by all accounts will happen sooner rather than laterforcing people to be on battlenet to playmassive fail
shame on you blizzard
how dare you tell your paying customer how they can and cannot play
they paid for a copy of your product and it turns out that they never actually own it
terriblesplitting the game into three parts
sorry the terran adventure alone isnt worth  to me
again not when it will be  within  monthsif you do this with diablo  i wont be buying that either
you seem to think that because you own wow you have your customers by the throat
ill just spend my free time playing xbox games at least i permanently own thosei bought this game for my kids to play
when i originally bought them a computer they could all take turns using it
i only needed to buy one computer
i only needed to buy one operating system not a separate os for each user
we have word i only need one copy on the computer and various family members use it
we dont let the whole world use it or copy the disk for others as other people should buy their own but everyone in the family should be able to use the family computer and whats on it
there are some games on the computer like plants v zombies
everyone can take turns playing them under their own name so it saves their own progress
not with this game
only one person can play this  game
they actually expect you to buy separate copies for each member of your family who wants to play
thats disgusting
in our neighborhood word of mouth is what gets kids to buy games so they can do what their friends are doing
the word of mouth on this game is pretty negative at this point
i wont be buying anymore blizzard gamesive been playing video games since i was  years old and im  now
there has been pirating since the inception
there have been many attempts to stop it but this new method is absolutely intolerable
i bought starcraft  and brood wars
great games
however i will be steering clear of this one for sure
i probably would have given it a shot but considering i have to connect to the internet to play single player
no thanks
blizzard im not sure how this decision was made but it was a bad decision and this is one fan who you have lost forever
btw i bought ddexp wow starcraft expfor all you people looking for something fun
try mount and bladewarband
its a free download and you can play until level 
go to the website for trial version  its actually exactly like the full version but you can only play util level 
you can buy it from steam but i hate steam
get it from the websiteno lanthis pretty much concludes why this gets a one star
it is utterly ridiculous for this game not to have lan suppot
and its not like they couldnt do it its that they intentionally left it outsimple review herefirst of you stat with a cheap cinematic showing raynor but the graphics on this cinematic are really badlike something from gears of war nothing up the standards of blizzard cgi cinematics
the campaign starts out kinda of dull
cant tell you anything because of spoilers
nd mission is fun thoughthe reason i gave this game  star is because not only does it keep crashing on my ati mobility radeon hd  giving me the bsod it also lags online gameplayprobably my mbps connection which is decent for me
also this game has trouble giving my fps and above on x resolution all maxed out no anti aliasing
while games like crysis run the same but gimme far more texture detailworst of all is the no lan feature and the fact that i would have to buy a separate copy in order to play with someone else who doesnt even game as often
 friends on my place on my crappy internet connectionlagfestim sure my issues will be addressed but so far im dissapointed with a game that had beta test and years of work with  million dollars invested which happened to be a confusion by the way they never spent that muchblizzard fanboys stay away from this post just like sony fanboys hype up their horrible game mag and call everyone else who dislike it a noob gamer etc
im not a nerd aightpart of why i loved the original starcraft was playing out the  campaigns seeing how each side viewed the war
paying full price for just the terrans is not acceptablethe game is probably really fun
but i spent all day downloading  gigs of something
then i could only play the first  levels
yay
so i spent all this money
maybe i did something wrong
but i dont think so
you cant even play online with itas far as im concerned blizzard can now join ubisoft as another company whose games i will no longer buy
only includes the terran campaign no lan play and overthetop drm
all for 
never again for this
blizzard is treading on the loyalty of its longtime fans just for a grab for more money
are the dumptrucks full of wow money not getting to the office quick enough blizzard
it seems like now more than ever game companies are trying to squeeze every last cent out of its sheeplike fan base
blizzard wont worry because the sheep will buy every episode of sc   shelling out the cash every timeblizzard is nothing but a greedy company
and as a pc gamerif you buy this you will be hurting pc gamimg forever
paying  dollars for  of a game is pure stupidity
you can bet other game companies are watching this to see if it sells
if it does you can bet that other companies will start doing this
dont let greedy blizzard do this to pc gaming
for this one game you will end up paying  dollars for the full gameyou cannot customise hotkeys in this game
blizzard has demanded you use the ones they set for youreview will remain  out of  stars until a future patch makes the hotkeys customisable in the menulet me say i have played all the socoms and i was expecting better out of this
the load times are horrible and to top it off the gameplay just isnt the same as the old socoms
i was disapointed being a big socom fan
just my  centsworse game ever for online game play  do not waste your time on this horrible gamei was using a blu ant headset with my ps
unfortunately it died and i needed a new headset
my goal was to purchase the official ps headset
unfortunately it was sold out everywhere unless i went with the bundled socomconfrontation package
id read very mixed mostly negative reviews but i figured the bugs had been fixed by way of patch and it was really popular sony exclusive so there would be a community that would be able to help me figure it out
the headset works great  in fact its awesome
first party peripherals rarely dissappoint and i reccomend it if you are using brand xsocomconfrontation is garbage
it has a lengthy patch after the lengthy download
it promptly froze the first time i booted up
and the second
once in the main menu you will find absolutely nothing in way of tutorial or explination
there are no training missions and no option to play against bots
the only option is to go straight online
not only does this suck for people new to the game but for those who are already online its no fun having people jump in that are totally cluelessonce online using my nifty new headset i said whats up guys im new to the game any pointers
i was promtly booted
next game i wondered about picked up five kills lead the room in kills and was promptly booted as soon as the next match started
these were  of a possible  people matches
the quality of players was sketchy and i checked  and there were only  people globally playing
compare this to  people playing killzone  at any given time or  playing  year old codmw in any week
i gave it a few hours and found the game boring and maps nearly empty
furthermore even an experienced gamer will get wrecked by experienced players in any given game i pwn on killzone but get pwned in cod
there arent a lot of players and on a weekend over the course of several hours no skilled players that made me think i was outclassedthe actual nuts and bolts play isnt bad
playing rd person is differnt after s of hours playing in the first person but its okay
the graphics are last generation
i understand that this is a psp game ported to ps but this is really terrible
the load out is simple enough but in most of the matches i joined i had equipment that was restricted and i almost always played with whatever the host wanted me to play with
the pacing is much slower than cod and killzone  in my opinion too slow
after having played games that require thought and move very fast whipping up on the socom players felt almost unfair
again the quality players seemed to be playing something elsewhen you play killzone or see videos of codmw running it really makes you wonder who sony and slant  thought would play this game
graphics arent everything but socom is not user friendly it is not something you can pick up and play and offers nothing to entice new players to comeback and get better hence the few number of people playing
i thought there was no way socom could possibly be as bad as some of the reviews and its my favirote genre of games
turns out the negative reviews were right on
this is a bad game
go buy cod killzone  brothers in arms dora the explorer
do not spend money on this game  you will regret it
consider yourself warnedboring
sub par graphics
boring
too many dorks talking online
boring
set up is ridiculous
boring
stick with cod
boring
headset is overrated as it is nothing special
boring
what else can i say
did i mention boringi was maybe able to play this game for  minutes i wish it wasnt playstation network only
if they would have included a storycampaign mode for single player would be greatthe online meet up room interface is horriblewow how this thing was ever considered as a finished product is beyond me
this has to be one of the worst ps titles ive encountered
the biggest complaint i have involves the numerous bugsinstalling the game itself and trying to play it for the first time gives you an error message
it seems as if the  patch which you are forced to download corrupts your save game
since the game creates a save game when it first launches it is an impossible error to avoid
after patching the game you will be informed that your save game is corrupt and that you must manually exit the game and delete the save game
seriously the game forces you to delete its own save game just to play it for the first timewhile playing this game you will encounter the following  you will get lockups leading to a frozen console
you will see other players characters missing weapons
most of the servers channels will be full and open games will be difficult to find
you will encounter serious lag during play
closer aiming will inexplicably cause your character to stand up
the menus will respond slowly to your inputthere are other issues with this game beyond the glitches alone
the graphics are poor for a ps title
the textures are muddy and low resolution
the game has plain lighting effects which fail to impress
the blood effects appear to lifted directly from mortal kombat
the control scheme is unnecessarily complicated with poor default mapping
all buttons on the controller are used and some serve multiple functions based on the duration of a press
unfortunately this doesnt really lead to superior control versus other similar games
its complex for the sake of complexity
features you expect in a modern game such as the ability to join one of your friends games in progress player muting or even something as simple as your own name being highlighted in a long list of party members are absent
trophies which are indicated on the box itself are nowhere to be found
they are promised in a future patchill write briefly about the headset as its likely thats a main draw in the purchase of this bundle
there are a couple of minor problems with the device
the unit itself is quite heavy
it is by far the bulkiest bluetooth headset ive used
you may feel your ear getting fatigued earlier than youd hope for because of this
the ear cushion is not adjustable in size so it may flop around in your ear as it dangles from the headsets hook
the main attraction to be found is the giant mute button in the middle of the device
most headsets created  for use with cellular phones have an inconvenient mute function
you will also receive onscreen notifications when changes are made to the unit such as volume adjustment the mute toggle and a battery charge indicatorsocom confrontation isnt ready for prime time
it has far too many showstopping bugs and feels unpolished in most aspects
i would stay far away from this game
the headset is worth a purchase but the game itself is noti am a big fan of the socom seriesexcept this one
the very first mistake that they did was make it an online only based game
the game is great in terms of graphics
the sound is amazing
the movement is suprisingly fast depending on your connection but mine is pretty fastwhat makes this game frustrating is that lack of intelligence of those that are playing
dont play this game around kids and dont have the blue tooth on
youll hear all the cursing and downright raunchy comments made by the guys playing the game
if you are a novice like i am forget it
ive been voted out by the other players maybe because i wasnt fast enough or had enough kills and even learning how the game is
im just learning the game
but to tell the truth i dont know if i want to learn the game as much now
because the levels are just not that interesting
i like the other games which you had missions to do and you had to converse with your team where to go and what to do
they did it
maybe not right all the time but you didnt see a whole team running about with no coordination
everyone seems to just be going where they pleasethis game is a great idea though
connecting players everywhere to play a game
i just think there are parameters that should be built in the game
lose the communication
useless
ive heard nonsense
one guy was singing a song
another bragging that he was high and needed to get more booze so he can get really drunk
i dont want to hear that
so what i found myself doing was leaving the bluetooth on and just setting it on the counter so i wouldnt hear all the nonsense
i turned off the ear piece one time and you can here their stupid comments through the speakers with the rest of the game and my kid was in the room
one thing that i wish that this game had was a level of skill where you can join a game on your skill level
for example when you connect to a game it would automatically put you in a game where all players that are of lower rank would play
if you were a high rank it would keep you out because obviously you dont belong
then as you increase your skills you graduate to another level where you are teamed with guys on that level and so on
that would be much better i think
because it seems like no matter what skill level you are youll be in the mix with guys that play the game together and will actually kill you if you are not up to their standardsso i dont really recommend this game at all
im sorry that i purchased itit isnt a fair game without cheating
i couldnt even beat the first mission without having to start from the beginning
it is only enjoyable with the ar code for infinite health
the graphics are not very good
if you wanted a good version of this game then go for a console version instead
the ps version is fun the wii version has the cartoon characters with added mechanics that work and there is one for the xbox  toothis could be a great game it it wasnt for the cheap difficulty and irritating ai partner who gets in your way almost as much as helps you
its also way too easy to miss jumps and fall costing you precious lego currency pieces
i got so pissed off at the game i almost ripped the disc out to break it in half but i settled on taking my anger out on the caseim not bothered by having to kill cops as villains since for one thing its cartoonish and they merely fall apart and disappear and another thing ive had my bad days with cops which probably shouldnt surprise you
anyway back to the game
it sucks
there are people who may tell you that its the player who sucks and that the game is perfect i wouldnt be surprised if such backlash came in the comments section but remember that there are also people who claim that reagan is a god among men sharia law makes perfect sense andor that showing any lack of support for our troops should be considered an act of treason
in other words just because someone says something doesnt mean it holds any truth
okay so maybe this is more of a rant than a review but i do thoroughly hate this game and would be content if travelers tales went bankrupt for making such crapok ive marked this review down to one star because i want to get my point across
one of the problems with sr was that when you drive past a number of gang members and you decide to turn around and fight them they have disappeared not because they ran off but because the game wants to delete the part of the world that is not in front of you
im really disappointed that they did not fix this problem in sr i would never have bought it had i knowni was chasing down a car i went past it turned around and it was gone
no it hadnt just driven off because i would have seen it off down the road it just vanishedif this is fixable please fixim sure there is a lot to be liked here but this really annoys me and does not happen in gtaivim so shocked this is weak
ive played soul calibur since the nd one and the rd blew me away with all the great new addonsand from what ive seen in  the company just gave uptheyve switched a nice custom character creation with simply editing main game chars
theres no legit sidequest its just a tower with a bunch of enemies vs mode arcade mode and story mode
thats it sad sad sadall theyve done is added yoda gave it new graphics and removed the things that made it great and stand out in the figthing genrei though we had a new standard of big name games since the new systems came out obviously the group behind bandai namcos soul calibur has ignored that
they figured pretty graphic playing online and yoda can justify dont even bother wasting the money renting this go buy a ps if you already dont have one and get soul calibur  other than graphics its a massive improvement and you wont feel cheated
yes even after paying for a ps youll feel less cheatedi really feel sorry for anoyone who paid more than  for thisseriouslytried the series many times its just not mortal kombat
maybe thats why i didnt like it just rather play mortal kombat anytime over this game
very boring characters are boring lame replay value
there are many fighting games but this one doesnt bring anything exciting to the table
again im not a fan of the series
first time trying itthe good it arrived quicklythe bad did not come with the battery doors as promised in the product description battery was swollen and did not work wouldnt even dock in the device to use without the doorthe resolution was issued a refund for the product price prime member so didnt pay shipping anywaythe recommendation buyer beware
im not the first to write a review stating that i didnt receive the doors
that may be a consistent problem
also the battery i received was swollen and unusable
thats a bigger problem
for  i expect it to at least be a viable product and not something that should have been discarded before it was sentthe graphics are ok ive seen better but theyll do
the gameplay quite good abit average really but the game does have a clever plot like every object or enemy has thermal energy that you collect when it blows up or dies
the vr is fun when you first try it but then when you have to use it loads it gets a bit tedious i also bought conan with this
im sorry but lost planet got lost and collected dust because conan completely dominated it in everyway mind they are two completely different games so i cant compare them
but conan was just more fun in my view anyway when i had nothing left to play on except back too those never ending boring ones oblivion and quake wars i just had no choice and played on this
i concentrated a bit more on the storyline and it actually isnt a total let down
if your into sci fi and imaginative aliens this is the one for you if you want a game thats entertaining i wouldnt reccommend this one too you
good bosses and its challenging and puts up a good fight on hard and normal
notice ive never said brillant or fantastic this is because nothing in this game has been amazing all average really i suppose it has a good storyline mind the humans are trying too make this planet earth edn  and want to kill all life on it we already have earth
capcom stick to earth and focus on resident evil and devil may cry their the games your good atlost planet extreme condition is boring at its worst and mediocre at its best
meh
the bosses are tough darn tough
when you die and meet the boss again you cant skip the cutscene unfortunately and must wait for the movie to finish
i completely agree with the metacritic score of  if you value your spare time skip this one friendsi had high hopes for this game i really did
the lego version of star wars was a total blast and im almost as much of a fan of indiana jones as i am of star wars so i eagerly purchased the game as soon as i saw it in the storeonly to have my hopes totally destroyed
while the gameplay is just as fun as its scifi predecessor it has some glaring bugs that render the game totally frustrating and unplayablein three gaming sessions ive had the game freeze twice both times right at the end of a chapter before the game actually saves anything
the only thing i could do was to power the ds off and back on which meant i had to replay the entire chapter from the beginninggetting almost completely through a chapter only to have the game crash and force you to start over just totally sucked the fun out of itim hoping i just have a bad cartridge or something and that its not a problem with the game programming though either really makes me wonder how good is lucasarts qa teamive been playing the dynasty warriors series for years
the previous games were by and large flawed but tended to have some redeeming valueand dynasty warriors  even approached a level as close to perfection as the limited conceits of the game would reachlo and behold dynasty warriors  comes out and everything is now broken
this game is so bad that im breaking my twoyear pause in writing reviews
its just impossible not to ventpros the acting has marginally improved from previous dynasty warriors games
thats about the only improvementcons it seems koei has swapped in the game mechanics and proportions from the samurai warriors series
so now your character is smaller onscreen
the physical motion of the characters no longer feels unique every warrior moves the same the weapons feel the same except a couple of useless novelty characters eg
the new dian wei who move like theyre tied down with lead weights
youll feel like youre playing with a controller thats been soaked in beef fat
and theyve filled the entire screen with running peons and your allies so that now when you enter a major skirmish the whole screen flies with character names and hyperactive figures so that you cant even tell where your actual opponents are they just drown in an ocean of writhing masses
the overhead maps are now so tiny that you cant even use them to locate the enemies around you the red icons enemies look exactly the same as the blue icons allies theyve reverted to the horrible system of  utterly useless allies commanders made of butter who love to rush that spot where three superpowered enemy warriors are standing and giant maps with objectives that require you riding from one end to the other about eight times per mission
this shouldnt be categorized as a fighting game this is a running game allies are utterly worthless unless youre just about to score a killing blow on a supercharged enemy generalin which case your allies will rush right in to steal your kill with one last hitand boom you fail your mission target
thank you very much
you no longer get a bodyguard and even your horse seems hellbent on messing you up by trotting away just as youre about to mount
oh and there will be many times when youre running around after a battle unable to find your horse because it becomes invisible when its behind you
fancy playing hideandseek your character is anemic
the renbu system they implemented on this game is about the worst idea theyve ever had
why
in previous games you get more attacks in your combos by getting better weapons
once you get the maximum your character is powered up and youre all set
here the renbu system means that your character starts out every level with only three attacks in the chain
the renbu meter shoots down if youre not fightingand lets remember that this game specializes in making you run from one end to another with nothing in between so by the time you get to that big battle your character is back down to a miserable three attacks
its the equivalent of starting every mission as an untrained newbie character enemies are overpowered
this has been the case for most dynasty warriors games but in this case theyve now made enemy blocking impossible to break by getting behind the enemy
whats the result
enemy generals will just block and waste your time until either their allies get behind you to gut you or theyll just wait until your other allies elsewhere fall like flies or your commander runs headlong into oblivion
anybody remember when double dragon added the block feature
the ability to block indefinitely just doesnt work in a oneagainstmany fighting game
you do have special moves that can get past a block but theyre useless because they do almost no damage and most of your characters are too slow to combo after performing it so the enemy will just resume blocking after you break their guard
they can afford to because it takes something like  mashes of the buttons to kill one minor general and after every mission even one of the easier ones my hands are paralyzed
youre supposed to be able to kill those super enemies by powering up with special attacks or musou attacks but many missions will pit you against a super enemy right at the beginning eg
the battle of chang ban a mission that made me want to smash my console before youve had a chance to pick up powerup items or even build a renbu or musou meter
and in those battles if you get hit by one enemy combo you dienot to mention that this game will stack three four even six minor generals in the same place so that youre one pygmy fighting against seven giants its possible to train up your character but now it takes so long that by the time im ready to play that characters story im bored with the character
and theyve now left about  per cent of the characters locked  you cant play them period unless you play one of only about half a dozen characters to unlock them
which means you cant pick the characters you want until youve finished with some of the really weak really annoying characters first
boo the geography is abysmal
i cant tell you how many times im pounding on one superpowered general and after about two straight minutes of hitting the guy with hundreds of attacks i juggle him off a ledge and he falls into a river and i have no way of pursuing because if i did it would take five minutes to travel back to where i need to be and id fail the mission
so all that hard fighting work is killed by bad game design
the addition of countless annoying mountains and valleys means that the designers now make you weave left and right just to get across a quarter of the map and if you happened to take the wrong routesorry your commanders dead
as ive said this is a running game  like a mario game without any of the fun of a true platform game theyve also taken out many of the visual options that would have alleviated the problems
for example many parts of the maps are so dark you can barely see a tree in front of you but theres no option to brighten the display
and the badly acted repetitive movie scenes can no longer be turned off so if youre fighting a battle for the th time you have to mash the buttons to skip it  and even then your character will grind to a halt putting you at a disadvantage
they used to offer an option to turn off those movies i have no idea what possessed them to take that outall i can think is that koei has finally lost the plot and passed the point of no return in its perverse thinking that frustration equals fun
like dynasty warriors  gundam this game is frustrating for the sake of being frustrating
i suppose if all you want is a higher blood pressure a lot of rage and the feeling that youre at the mercy of game designers making you jump through hoops then by all means indulge in this game
everybody else just go play rock band or nba  or any other game that is actually well fun  an enjoyable activity rather than what dynasty warriors  is  a toothpulling source of stressman i usually get really into games hrs before i actually judge the game but it only took an hour and the game itself is already boring
why is it boring
its the same stuff all over again its an fps but a bad one because it doesnt engage the player instead you feel like your doing a chore or working at a job that doesnt pay you
avoid this gameat all costs save your money i feel like i have been robbed at spending  rentalwhen i heard the premise for legendary i thought wow  this game could be one of the best games of  basically the idea is that charles deckard an art thief is duped into stealing pandoras box
when he inadvertently opens it he releases hordes of beasts thought to be fictional  such as werewolves and gryphons  into an unprepared modern world
a full scale war between man and myth begins and it is quickly complicated by the actions of powerful secret societies
sounds good doesnt it
well its not
it is a horrible game that has substandard graphics and animations the sound and music are terrible and feel strange and out of place the game is ridiculously short and there is no online mode whatsoever only one multiplayer mode which is rubbish and no replay value
quite simply put the biggest flop of  with no exceptions
do not buy itpeople compared this to resistance  its story is horrible
graphics sucked
had a good idea but was together by a bad developer
the guns werent fun to play with either
this doesnt even compare to resistance ugh this game is very frustrating
at a glance it appears to have potential but turns out to just be terrible
it tries to be some type of steven kinghorrormoviegame and im not even sure if it succeeds or fails at that but either way its a very boring and repetitive game
this game feels like it should have come out five years ago but even if it had it still would have been awfulthe most annoying part is you have no idea what is going on the entire game
struggle through your boredom to finish the game and you will still have no idea what transpired
the ending is short and resolves none of the baffling story
there is no closure or explanation of anythingthe game isnt so much scary as it is confusing and tedious
the controls and gameplay are clunky
you spend the entire time trotting from place to place usually in the woods shining flashlights at shadows and using a clunky revolver or riflethis feels like a very old school game with linear levels and horrible character development
most of the characters introduced in the game you learn nothing about and have virtually nothing to do withgraphics and voice acting are both ok but both could have been betteryou will spend the whole game reloading your flashlight and revolver to use on very repetitive shadows
oh and you get to crank generators
funbasic premise of the game  light is good darkness is bad
your main weapon is a flashlight and you collect coffee thermoses all game for no reasonsave yourself from wasting several hours of your life and play something elsewith all the hype i thought this game would be something special what it turned out to be was a thankfully short boring stinker
the story was lame and the action tedious and redundant
also a few years before the game was actually released all the previews were totally different there were images a cloaked baddies and a totally interactive environment
this game feels like it started out as a huge sprawling sandbox actionadventurehorrormystery then due to budget cuts ended up a lame shootergraphics  nice environments were very detailed environments all looked the samecombatinnovative system of breaking down enemy shields with a flash light then shooting them to kill them
cool at first gets old real fastgameplay this game consists of going from point a to point b and getting to a plot point then repeat
there are  types of enemies and a couple of unimaginative bosses a backhoe for example
the environments while nicely detailed all look the same with little to no thought in the level design often you just head in a straight line through a generic forest a generic building or a generic office
the is combat fun at first but once the novelty wears off about  minutes it gets boring
what makes matters worse is the cheap shots the enemies take
youll find yourself just walking along or worse fighting off a horde of baddies when all of a sudden they start spawning right behind you basically right on top of you
this happens so often and becomes so damn frustrating that youll be tempted to quit not due to the challenge but due to the fact that the game just isnt fun enough t keep you caring
i finished the game in a day yeah its that short and that easy minus the cheap shots
replayability none getting through this stinker once is a test of willpowerverdict possible rental if its cheap or borrow it from an unfortunate friend who got taken in by the slick packaging
you shouldnt pay more than  bucks for this if you are really really curious thoughthis is one of the worst games ever made
boring gameplay a nonsensical premise boring gameplay and thats pretty much all this game consist of
this is how to not make a videogame
this game was created by sega one of the worst developers in gaming historyamazon removed my review for no reason at all
cleary they cant accept the truth that this game sucks
it wouldnt take an act of congress for me to expose amazon as the hypocritical sycophantic bias website they are  remove this one more time i dare you i double dare youi dont really have that much to say besides that this game was a big disappointment
i get all the new games that come out to play myself and with my  boys
this one was not appropriate for them obviously
anyways the gameplay was linear the weapons lacking and i just found the overall game not very fun to play
i have already sold this game back to bestbuy for credit towards a game that was actually fun
the bright spots in this game were the cut scenes
i probably didnt give this enough of a chance to play but i have a short attention spansadly nowhere in the description of this game did it mention that it is not compatible with windows attempts at running it in compatibility mode where unsuccessfullit installs but the video is non existantsending it back would cost more than what it is worth so i am out the moneydescriptions of items should include compatibility issuesdo not buy this game it does not work with windows vista
if you do buy this game destroy it or just give it to somebody you hatei was curious about this game as it gained a lot of interest as a rhythm game that would keep the player occupied with the beats to advance in the game
i enjoyed the beginning but smashed into the virtually impassable sequence to make rain or whatever it was i needed to get through the desert
looking online to see that it was extremely difficult for other players helped me to let go and have someone else enjoy the first fraction of this game before leaving it in frustration for something else fun to doyep you cant host a game with out loging in  and if you cant login you cant create games
thats why you see no servers up for this game because ubisoft has broke the servers and maybe even have turned them off
so this is a brick of a game buy it on console insteadthere might a pretty good game hidden under a whole mountain of crap here
a historic medieval killing machine raising h e double hockey sticks in the holy land
sounds great right
it would be without the fact that its wrapped in this stupid youre in the present remembering an ancestor doing all this stuff scifi crapola joke of a premise
i could forget it if didnt rub your nose in it every two seconds
i dont want computerized hitech scifi imagery invading what should have been a great medieval fantasyadventure
i think they were trying to be clever and provide immersion but its just stupid
to load in you get to relive that horribly endless tutorialcutscene that started the game and to quit you cant right away
you have to come back to the present exit that stupid case youre supposedly in pause the game quit again reload your profile pause the game then quit to windows finally
oh yea its an awkward console port to boot and the controls blow
not worth the bargain bin price
avoid this like the plaguegame is hard to control you have to use severl button on your key board at once for some moves and it get tiring after about  minutes of play i found the game boring and hard to control graphics were not that great
i played if for two day than took it off my pcsave your money
i have tried to find something positive to say about this game but i cant
this has to be one of the worst games i have played in years and i play them all
it is unimaginative repetitive quickly becomes boring and frustrating after you and i am not exaggerating do the same missions  times climb the same towers  times see the same graphic cutaway  times save the same person in the crowd  times etc
also you are not completely playing the game every  minutes or so it cuts away to a poorly written hack story line that you are forced to sit through
the sad part is this had the potential to be something great open world design and fairly good graphics
to be perfectly honest i am bitter and angry that i spent  bucks on this garbage of a game
ubisoft should be embarrassed of this release and fire the designersi cannot speak for console versions of this game but the pc version is quite terriblethe migration process from console to pc is annoying sloppy and poorly executed from top to bottom which seems to be the case for nearly all consoletopc titlesthe keyboard controls are awkwarddefinitely only suitable and comfortable for use with a game padcontrollerthe audio and video and terribly glitchy even for a relatively old game and no my system does not suck  it far exceeds minimum system requirementsi recommend that pc players simply avoid this game entirely  given the products on the market today you arent missing anything  assassins creed definitely shows its age and bias toward console gamingbought this game thinking that it might be fun
after several attempts at the controls i finally got the hang of it
then it happened
anti christian anti bible pro muslim messages began to be promoted throughout the game
i kept playing it thinking that things would get better but it only got worse
there are lots of games out there that are more fun without a message that i would recommend but not this one
beware of this game for the younger folks whose minds could be corrupted with lies in the name of fun
as a result i didnt even resell it
simply put it in my new shredder where it belonged in the first placewe bought the nyko quad charger and you cant put these on the remotes and charge themother than that they do fit the wii and nonwii brand remotes just finesave your money and get the eforcity ones instead
they are better quality i got the two dollar red ones and they are much nicer than these
just ordered a black one that eforcity charges ten dollars for plus shippingsince the eforcity looks like it actually might be black this one is actually more of a grey and the red one i got was so much better i decided to scrap this function degrading eyesoregive it a miss
the company ships quickly thoughthere is some important storyline you need to see but this game is crap other than that
imagine kingdom hearts with a different totally random slot battle
that is how stupid this game is
not the final fantasy that i wanted when i went to play this game
this game sucks and it is the last square game i ever played as a resultif the creators of these final fantasy games want better sales make the final fantasy vii remake we have wanted for so long
the fans deserve betterthe picture of the psp does the price include all the stuff shown in the picture if not please explainear part that goes over the ear will  not stay on and falls off when i use itcould care less if i buy a product like this againi had the unfortunate fate of receiving a defective unit and had to return it
thankfully it was really easy to return items with amazon
just to let people know that this may be brokengood grief how can you spend so much time making the visuals so cool then expect us to direct the action through the keyboard vf lame 
mega loss of cred game merits  points out of  ie sucksi have played games my whole life
there are few that i have come across that i hate
there are few that i say without a personal taste disclaimer not to buy
but alone in the dark is a gaming crime
i have no idea what atari was thinking by releasing this game
i am playing it on a pc and it feels like it was designed for a console i only hope that it plays better on a console
but did anyone actually play this game before it was released
did they do any type of beta testing with someone other than the designersforget about the horrible camera angles and the absolutely frustrating off centered bogged down fighthit zones
what really takes the cake on this abomination is trying to figure out the one and only one way through this rail shooter only problem is that the rail derails you
you must some how figure out the one magical trigger point that needs to be crossed in order to move on but it might not work because some glitch that happened a earlier in the gamein short   bad camera angles horrible interaction angles rail shooter than cant even stay on the rail
stay far far away from this onei usually sell my games on ebay once i am done with them
this one i am in a moral delima because it is so bad i feel i would be ripping someone off
i guess ill post a disclaimer and try to recoup some of the  that atari took from me for this abominationwow what a total piece of crap
the music is great though so i picked up the pc soundtrack edition for 
i know the ps version and xbox  version had terrible controls but i though maybe its workable with pc controls who knowsso i installed it and within a few minutes i realized that is was even worse on the pc
well i guess that should have been expected
after all if they did not do play testing and get the controls right for the console why would they bother with the pc versionwhat a mess the controls are
much like the console but unbelievably worse
its too bad because there was a lot of potential for this ideas behind this game
i just dont understand how they could have gotten so far in development and not realized how bad the gameplay and particularly the controls werebottom line all versions of this game are terrible
just stay away
this is coming from someone who spent money just to get the soundtrack because its great
the game though is  terriblecame as said it would new and in good condition
gave  star each becuase game was a gift i never played iti agree with everything said about the horrible controlssuper frustrating and not fun
the screen shots look awesome but i never got that far because i was walking into furniture and door frames for an hourwhile pushing a key to blink my eyes so i could seethis was a very very sad attempt to make a good gamethis game almost feels like it was rushed to get finished
the graphics were ok the sound acting was subpar
trying to control the guy was almost impossible both in first and thirdperson modesthe best thing about the game was uninstalling iti cant believe i spent almost  on itthis game is the one that made me finally decide to switch to video gaming
im tired of paying  for a pc game and it turns out to be unplayable
this is one of the worst games i have ever seen
the controls are terrible
so i went out and bought an xbox  and hooked it up to my monitor and speakers
it looks and sounds great
also i noticed the price on this game has dropped  since it was released just over a month ago
that should tell you somethingdont waste your time on this game
the game may seem like the next horror video game but it is not anything good
the games third person camera is horrible the controls are horrible and at sometimes you find your self mashing the same buttons over and over
the puzzles are completely ridiculous and some levels are hard to get through
the save system is stupid because it saves as episodes like a tv show
the episodes are split into parts and if you are on for example part  and you dont finish part  or you die you will have to do it all over again
i am trying to stop you guys from buying this game as i have stopped a guy at gamestop from buying it
do not buy thisone of the most disappointing titles of  is alone in the darkpros good visuals but you often wont be able to appreciate them due to a crazy camera good effects fire and electrical good soundtrack good looking inventory its only good conceptually though not good in practice a nice rebuildaworld concept
eden did this incredibly well with test drive unlimited
i suggest you buy that game insteadcons everything else the cameraviewperspective is insane and simply uncontrollable
this game has a st personrd personrd person forced perspective
it switches back and forth between these perspectives every  seconds against your will you have no choice disorienting you and when the perspective changes the control layout also changes which is even further disorienting
this means that if you are looking around in st person with right thumbstick  like every other game in the world and the game sudden changes to rd person because they think its a neat cinematic gimmick that right thumbstick no longer functions as it did before
in combat it gets worse
that same thumbstick changes yet again depending on the weapon
wow that is nuts first person view is too slow controls are insane and uncontrollable
as described above they keep changing and you have to unlearn everything you just learned and relearn what the hll everything does based on what perspective you are in and what the situation is
thats the problem
your brain will still be using the layout you were able to use  seconds ago because thats natural intuitive and the way most good games work
hll even really bad games have consistent controls there is no option for the gamer to map the controller as in other games
if theyd put the controls in the gamers hands maybe this would have been a  or a  even if you master the constantly changing controls they are still slow clunky and unresponsive
doing things like jumping and just trying to pick something up can be goofy while the inventory system is interesting and has a professional looking interface it functions like everything else in this game with poor unintuitive controls
beyond that the inventory doesnt pause the action so youll get your butt kicked in combat trying to figure out what to do with the inventorynice the use fire to kill everything gimmick is overused and seems a bit silly
fire isnt ubiquitous in real life dialog not really inspired story not really engaging dont really care about the characters driving is horrid
i wont even talk about it combat is tedious long difficult and silly using the clunky controls
and again unintuitive and utterly inconsistent all of the above means poor game testing
somebody somewhere at some point must have mentioned the camera and controls
my guess is that somebody did they werent the boss and the boss never played the gameusually with bad games you have things like bad ai which runs right at you lowrez textures bugs poor collision detection stuff like that
these are hallmarks of low budgets rushed titles noob programmers etcalone in the dark is very bad is unusual ways
like they had a big budget decent developers and had good tools in their hands but still managed to create a monstrosity
that crazy show cop rock comes to mind
a complete disasterive played some really bad games in the past but i have to admit that aitd has jumped up into the top gamplay  absolutely horridgraphics actually pretty goodsound  theres sound in this game other than gruntsokay so handsdown the absolute worst controls in any game  ever
the first five minutes of this game alone will have you wanting to throw your controller across the room
just wait until you have to fight an enemy
moving you character is such a chore that any hopes of enjoyment are soon done away within short i simply can not understand how a game that has been delayed as many times as this can still be this badtrust me
save your moneyworst controls ive ever had for a console gaming system
it has st person and rd person
your character walks slower than an  year old lady even though theres a fire and buildings are crashing around him and theres some crazy malevolent force trying to eat you
if you go into first person view to see what youre doing or get a better angle on something it kicks back to rd person as soon as you turn a certain way
it literally would not stay in first person for the life of me
and to walk you use one stick to move forward and one stick to move directionallyit was horribly done
it wasnt scary at all either
i gave up on this one i wouldnt recommend even borrowing it from someone its that bad
dont waste the time turning on your console to play thisthat badare you one of those people that enjoys pain and self torture
does the idea of poking yourself in the eye with a sharp object sound pleasurable to you
then look no further  this game is for you
im actually very disappointed in myself
i typically read multiple reviews prior to buying a game and for the most part i am influenced on whether or not to spend any money on it based on those reviews
however for whatever reason i let my curiousity get the best of me this time
i ignored the scathing reviews and actually let the one or two decent reviews talk me into buying this farce of a game
how diasppointed was i
well i spent   shipping so about  total
thats a complete meal at taco bell
id have gotten  times more enjoyment out of some taco bell tacos than i did with this piece of crap
its really like i spent  for someone to kick me in the sackhardwhy am i making this game sound so terrible
because its terrible
unplayable
i cant remember the last time i started playing a game and was already yelling at my tv in frustration less than  minutes in
oh wait yes i can it was the last time i tried to play this pos
if this game has any redeeming quality whatsoever its that it looks good
the graphics are clean and well done
the good points end there
regardless of how good it looks you cant enjoy it because youll be too frustrated trying to control the idiot protagonist
i read a review on this game that described the controls as being similar to a tank with a broken engine
that is spot on
just trying to move the jerk so you can focus on a specific point is like pulling teeth
trying to actually platform is even more of a joke
sometimes the b button will be jump
other times it will be drop down
i guess its whatever the game decides at any given time
and combat
yikes
you focus on an enemy and swing the right stick to hit enemies with whatever object you can find
after  or so shots to the head with a chair the enemy will dropfor a few secondsand get right back up unless you drag the limp body over some fire to fully kill it
sound stupid
it is
very
the sound of the game is also lame
the voice acting is hilariously bad
like something out of a c movie
not a b movie a c movieso lets seeit controls like crap sounds like crap has a convoluted story that i never got into because the game is so crappy that i couldnt bare to continue past the first  minutes and well its just crap
to anyone that claims to have played all the way through this game and considers it a hidden gem is easily entertained has an unnatural patience level and has likely never played a truly decent game
otherwise i can really think of no reason anyone would derive any type of pleasure from this title
the developers of this game should be embarrassed to have been a part of this pos
im actually embarrassed to have it on my shelf
i tried to give it to my neighbor  for free  and i got a response of no thanks dude
he mustve read the reviews that i ignoredthis game is easily in the top  worst games ive ever played in my life and thats after only playing  minutes of it
i refuse to give this farce any more of my time
if youre considering buying this game dont
youve been warnedoverall   id totally give it a  if possiblethis could be the crappiest game i have ever played
the controls are broken the camera doesnt work well the graphics are just okay the story is far from compelling and it just isnt funive been reviewing games for amazon since  ive seen the worst of gamesdaikatana most especially
now after many moons have passed i have come across one of the worst if not the buggiest most annoying piece of program i have ever encountered in my life
alone in the dark is a major disaster from its storyline dialogue annoying voice acting frustrating controls unforgiving checkpoints and the most buggiest collision detection ever
the only plus in this game are the graphics but thats about it
so ill keep my review straight and to the pointgraphics excellent
no complaintscontrols main character moves like a tank with a bad engine
controls are completely unresponsive
some buttons do not function as stated
for example you press a to turn off a flashlight
if youre holding a gun in one hand and holding a flashlight on the other you cant press a to turn it off
you have to press the gamepad down open your virtual jacket and then unequip from there
how tedious can this get
another example youre standing next to an object your wish to pickup an pickup object icon appears telling you to press a to pick up an object press a the problem with this is that turning off the flashlight you need to press a as well
so if youre holding a flashlight and you need to turn off it off it has limited battery life by the way youll have to move away from the pickable object so you can turn off the flashlightheres another example again you have a zombie attacking you controls say you have to double click the left analog stick to do a quick turn
if youre holding a gun or a melee weapon quick turn wont work but then sometimes it does
and heres another example driving a car is like driving a bar of soap on a smooth glass
a slight turn on the stick will spin your car uncontrollably
theres an action sequence in this game that requires some driving
i will warn you now prepare to do this about  to  times because you will failbuggy action sequence theres an action sequence on episode  where you have to escape an earthquake
the entire driving sequence requires you to get away from the earthquake before ti swallows your car
unfortunately the car is just completely unresponsive
second theres a jump that you have to make before the entire road cracks open
sometimes youll make the jump sometimes you wont
whats weird is that once your car flies over the cracked road the game will turn into a full motion video showing your car making the jump
but once your car lands somehow the game randomly decides whether the earthquake catches the tail end of your car thus killing you instantly or by some algorithmic calculation you do make it
but thats just half of the problem because this action sequence will continue for the next  minutes and if you fail halfway or even on the last part of this sequence the game will throw you back to beginning of the sequence
totally unforgiving checkpoints
by the way you cant skip the full motion videos which means youll be forced to watch cheesy fmvs over and over again everytime you fail an action sequencehow about weapons you ask
forget about using guns
guns are completely ineffective against zombies which you will be battling the entire game
so if ever you decide to collect ammo wellits pretty much useless and waste of space
zombies can only be killed by fire
if you do have to use your gun to kill zombies youll have to find gasoline or any flammable liquid combine it with your bullets load your gun with said gasoline dipped bullets and then shoot the zombies
but wait you cant just shoot them anywhere
zombies have this glowing yellow areas of their body thats vulnerable to fire
so on top of mixing and matching items to make fire youll have to be a sharpshooter to hit the zombies where it hurts
otherwise youll just be wasting time and ammoi think ive said enough
this game is the worst ever for  do not waste your money on this
believe me when i read the poor reviews i told myself nah i dont believe these reviews i will buy it and try it myself
so now i am  poorer and my blood pressure just skyrocketed after playing this game
avoid this game
stick to the dos version of alone in the darkthis game has by far the worst physics of any game ive ever played
the control system is overly difficult to get used to and even when you do it isnt easy to play
the game is abnoxiously dark as the game says in the title so its really hard to see anything even with the brightness turned way up
enemies in this game are more difficult than they should be and mercilessly pummel you even on the easiest setting
i got fed up with this game after  hours and tossed it in the bottom of my game basket with my old atari and nintendo games
save your money and time and avoid this game like the plaguei guess ive played worse flash computer games and maybe a couple old nes and super nes games that sucked more but this was just a broken piece of trash
there have been so many game projects with great potential that have just been scrapped and yet this actually made it to release it even knows it sucks as you can skip any level you wantits just garbage
even the parts that seemed cool were ruined by some glitch or another and it is just brokenthats all this game disc is good formaking a good coaster for your soft drinks and other sorts of beveragesif youre thinking about buying this game to play it and enjoy itdontoh dearthis is the lowest score i have given to a ps game for a long time
alone in the dark on the ps fails really glaringly in many ways and provides a thoroughly unsatisfying game experiencethe game is a kind of actionsurvival horror story with you playing as edward carnby trapped in a collapsing and monsterfilled new york
right from the start the controls will baffle you and they conspire against you having any decent fun at every single opportunityyes its that bad
the game is almost unplayable due to the terrible unresponsive and sometimes downright unuseable control system
nothing works well
in several chapters carnby has to climb up and down ropes and swing about to reach ledges
the implementation of this makes it impossible to judge when to let go
then there are the car driving sectionsawful cars that dont even drive in a straight line even when you dont push the lstick at all and which spin off into instant death at the slightest clipping of any obstacle
then theres the fightinga gun that can only be fired in st person
melee weapons that can only be swung in rd person
and both with a real time lag
then theres the camera constantly wobbling and bouncing around behind carnbys head
you cant see the scenery or anything very clearly let alone where you are running
thank heavens the rd person viewpoint actually keeps still
then theres the inventoryall in your pockets which you have to look in and pick things out of
then theres the first aid packs and general healing
how does this work
i dont even know
and then there iseyesclosed mode
oh my god
words fail me when trying to describe how terrible this is
you try keeping the r button held down without actually tipping it from side to side
and right at the end of the game theres a perilous twisting catwalk with instant death drops at each side to traverse that you can only see in eyesclosed mode
i can guarantee you will be screaming
screaming for your money back probably
ill say this though the game designers have been fiendish in making you work out exactly what you have to do
there are no clues
walk into a museum with a couple of monsters in it and there is no way out
not a single clue
walk into a factory where the floor is covered with deadly slime
use the spotlights some helpful dame says
how
the panel has no instructions on it
and worst of all is the savingsave spots are at set points and if you die somehow you often have to go back and do some tortuous skillbased action sequence over and over again as many of the setpieces are trial and error based
hideousnow that just leaves the graphics and these are no champions either
characters are blocky and awkward
carnby has this awful gaunt squarejawed hero face that looks really ugly
i have seen better graphics on ps games from five years ago
the collision detection is awful and carnby was forever teetering on invisible cliff edges or falling off when he should have been standing safelybut i persevered and played it right to the end bracing myself for a very uncomfortable finalebut let me tell you though i was gobsmacked by the feeble winding up of the game
i actually thought i had got the bad ending and had missed out an entire final level
but noa final nail in the coffin
oh well at least i was happy that i could stop playing itsorry folks but this game is a stinker
games are supposed to be about fuin and with everything thats wrong here
alone in the dark is no fun at allwell first let me start out by saying that this review is on the ps version of alone in the dark
and from what im aware of is completely different from the ps versiongraphicwise its the standard average for a ps game
nothing terrible but nothing spectacular
im assuming it would be better on the ps or xbox since they have better graphicssoundtrack this is perhaps the only positive feature this game has
it had some beautifully composed moments in some scenesgameplay i found the game anything but entertaining
it felt more like a chore trying to get through levels where most of the time your obstacles are just booby traps or exploring through darklit locations
there are monsters here and there but they dont exactly add anything to the game
they felt more like extras
even the boss fights consist of shooting like crazy until they fallyoud think there would be a strategy involved since nearly all the levels have strategies you need to develop to get by themthere was nothing unique about the game that i saw made this game alone in the dark
it felt like an average ps action game youd pick up on the shelf
or leave on the shelf for that matterstory according to others the ps version of the story plays out very differently
but the ps version is anything but entertaining
the game starts off on an interesting note but then the storytelling just goes downhill after that
the characters do nothing to move the story along and were far from interesting and became boringannoying very quicklythe story dragged on for me
the levels and obstacles you had to get through to get answers and continue the story was not worth the time
the story is also very confusing where the ending didnt make much sensetechnical issues a lot
when they say alone in the dark they arent kidding
the levels are so incredibly darklylit
even when i turned my television brightness up it hardly made a difference
the game did not have a brightness control either so for the entire game i was running around very much blindthere were places in the game where the sound just dropped a few levels
so i constantly had to turn the volume upoverall weighing out everything about this game its not worth the time or money
the only reason its survivalhorror is because of how incredibly bad this game was mademy suggestion avoid the ps version of this game at all costslike i said dont buy this game
it totally sucks
i was all hyped up and waiting for the release of this game but i was truly dissapointed
the controls are so difficult to get used to and there are some parts in the game where it gets frustrating
i thought it was gonna have controls like the original game released on the playstation  the camera angles are also horrible
so please stay away from this game or if u wish to check it out rent it and see for youreself
dont throw  down the drain like i did and i wish i would have never purchased this cause theres no refunds for opened gameslike a fooli did not pay any attention to the reviews on hereabout this gameso i went ahead and bought it anywaythinking that it couldnt really be that badoh my godwas i ever wrong
this game is total crap
thank god i only payed  bucks for itand maybe even that was too much
i agree with the other review that says its so dark that you can hardly seeyou cant
plus the controlsoh my godthey are terrible
story line is strange and i dont get itthe game doesnt even help youyou just walk around trying to figure out what to doplease folksi beg youdont be like meread the reviews and do not ignore themlike i didwhen they say something is badthey are telling the truthi sure learned my lessonso stay away from this gameits horriblei think this game would be truly better on nintendo ds if they even made it for ds witch they didnt this game in my opinion would be way better if they worked on it a littl harder because this game lacks way to many things to make it even  stars better graphicsbetter storylineand better force to be unleashedi just received this game last week  and when you begin you can play the optional training module
i aced the training simulation perfectly but when the game started it was press c or z or whatever and nothing like the training simulation
i got shot several times by bullets even tho the game said i was posed to block shots automatically
the wii remote acts slow or doesnt move fast enough when you swing your light saber
extremely hard for a casual player like me and the wii remotes sensitivity sucks
and yes my wii is only  months old
 out of  starsthis isthe nintendo ds version of a game released a bunch of different video game systems
i cant speak for the other versions but this one is lame
the graphics are subpar the camera angle is often annoying the main soundtrack consists of a single short endlessly looping track and the game itself it quite short
im not very good at action games and this game only took me several hours to finish completely
the game is an actionfighting game and basically consists of advancing through long halls with no branching paths or room to explore defeating enemies
its boring
for the fun factor this game is not worth money
that said i dont recall anything i found particularly objectionable about the game from a moral angle
its still not worth getting thoughquick review presentation  this is the only decent part of the game
i like the characters and the story is decent
graphics  the graphics arent all that badbut the framerate is god awfu and so is the loading time
sound  the sound effects are decent
the music is wellstar wars
gameplay  this is the worst part because the game is so glitchy its unplayable lastin appeal  you will never replay this if even finish it
overall  its probally in my top  worst games of all time
i have the wii version and its actually quite good so i would recommend it on a consolea few years ago a little game called incredible hulk ultimate destruction was released and was a surprisingly great take on the marvel character with freeroaming and destructive environments plus the overall feeling gameplaywise that you really were the hulk
this new movie tiein incredible hulk game from sega seems to want to follow in the same footsteps but alas it is a disappointing and quite frankly boring smashathon that squanders any potential it has and the wii version ends up being the worst version of the game to come out
the first thing youll notice is just how bad the game looks on the wii with glaring glitches and popup backgrounds and some bland looking areas as well
where the game really falters however is with the wii remote and nunchuk controls which are just utilized so badly here that the game becomes very frustrating
add to this no option to use any other form of controller for the game and youre in for a bad time
occasionally the game is fun by tossing people around and the films stars including edward norton lend their voices but as a whole the incredible hulk for the wii is incredibly bad
all in all if you own a wii and are a hulk fan avoid this game at all costs and track down an old copy of ultimate destruction insteadwas going to buy this for my husband but didnt
he changed his mind before i put in the order
dont know why this up here
didnt buy itnever got iti love video games even the repetitive ones that offer little variety in gameplay but still make it fun
ill give any game that interests me a chance even if it doesnt thrill me right at the start
iron man for the ps is the only game to date that made me abandon that principle after just  minutes or so of the worst gaming experience that ever sullied my television screen
id normally try a game for a longer period of time to get a better insight into it but so bad was the experience of this game that i couldnt stomach it for a prolonged period
in the first level when controlling the mark i iron man armor i had to reset the game halfway through because iron man one of the most powerful marvel heroes ever got stuck between a wooden fence and a mound of dirt unable to shake himself loose
after circumventing this inescapable environmental trap i finally got to play in the more advanced mark ii armor flying and shooting down enemy choppers and tanks in a large city level
i was really hoping the first level with the inferior mark i armor was going to be the only example of crap gameplay in iron man i couldnt have been more wrong
the movement and flight controls for iron man were apparently designed by a drunken monkey since hovering in place and shooting down flying enemies requires you pressing the hover button just lightly enough to stay in place
press too hard in the slightest and you go shooting up higher into the air press too lightly and youll plummet back down to earth
its basically impossible to stay stationary in midair let alone fly around in the air and get a decent lock on your enemies who continually fly towards and then past you forcing you to change direction constantly while struggling not to collide with any nearby buildings as you chase down pesky helicopterseven the ground combat is lame and awkward
iron man throws punches at human enemies and tanks as if he were made of stiff wood and the games hit detection is pretty bad as well
even the cooler touches of combat like tearing off the tops of tanks and the tails of helicopters get old quickly
this game and others like it would have been better if the flying and combat controls were more like the ones in the zone of the enders games
as bad as the gameplay is the graphics are just as horrible
the environments while large and roomy are bland and uninteresting
the enemies were boring and blocky
only iron man himself looked appropriately polished and shiny but thats only one minor positive amongst an ocean of negatives
fortunately i only rented this game and then returned it within an hour of deciding never to play it again but i still mourn the  i lost to that rental
dont make the same mistake i made because even renting the game is a total waste
apparently the videogame for iron man  wasnt any better according to other reviews so stay away from both games
i for one wont even bother with the second game
the best example of the ongoing trend of great movies making lousy gamesthere hasnt been a game in quite some time that i thought was terrible pretty much across the board but iron man managed to hit itfrom terribly repetitive levels with respawning enemies to it unnatural flight controls and a bad targeting system iron man manages to fail at damnnear everything it tries to do
this is the bestexample of every criticism of a movie game ive ever seensure each level in the iron man world is huge and gives a good impression of not being in a fishbowl like some other games do
at the same time however the graphics to that world are flatout disgusting
in my opinion for what is supposed to be a nextgen game iron man may be the worstlooking yetthe ability to upgrade your armor is a nice new spin but unfortunately just cant overcome the fact that everything else is going so completely wrong
even the voice acting is lousy
robert downey jr and terrance howard reprise their film roles and you can almost hear the indifference or distain in their voices
its almost as if they realize how bad this is and want to get out as fast as possibleto summarize  the movie is absolutely terrific and gets my highest praise and recommendation
take whatever you would have spent on the game and go see the movie again
for the really curious the equally baddemo is available on both xbox live and the playstation network for free
dont let this waste of a game ruin the films experience for you by buying it i rented iron man and gave it a test run since the sticker price seemed a little steep
after playing for a few hours i found myself wondering how a bugridden game like this ever got past beta testingive listed the top offending errors below environmental errors there was a section in the first level where i moved behind a fence
i came to the end of the fence but couldnt move past it even though nothing was blocking my path
i had to loop all the way back and go around
this is a pretty basic error and yet quality testing missed it  not a good sign
 enemy detection errors i was fighting a slew of enemies on the second level and before i could advance further i had to eliminate all the ground troops
there was one left on my radar and i flew down to find he wasunder the concrete
yes this enemy somehow fell under the concrete
i had to reset and start the level all over again
 poor targeting system the only way i could shoot a target is if the crosshairs were centered on an enemy at that specific moment
that means if iron man was running flying or dodging its pretty likely that my laser blasts or missiles would miss the target
 hypersensitive flight system the flight controls operate on a hair trigger
if i pressed the hover button too hard iron man shot straight up
if i pressed the hover button too lightly he dropped like a stone
when i hit the flight button iron man shot forward at ludicrous speed  and i couldnt slow down
at allin a nutshell i spent most of my game time flying around at breakneck speed with little control trying not to slam into buildings attempting to hit multiple enemies with a poor weapons system while trying to break a time limittheres absolutely no justification to pay the asking price for this game
we as video game consumers deserve betterthis game when i received it did not work with my wii consulthe seller provided me a full refundi wish i could have gotten to play itthe demo of ironman was quite entertaining and fun
it didnt take long to get the hang of the flying controlls and the action was implemented quite well
the graphics were not the most impressive i have seen but the demo got me excited enough to buy the game
the opening sequence of the game where stark builds his first nonflyable suit was good but after that it went into a training sequence to aquaint you with flying and your super powers and everything was going so so till i was to grab hold of drones and shown a red button well i did it but it kept doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over
basically this has taken a lot of oomph out the game and made me wonder if sega used playtesters or beta testers to critique repeitive parts like this
i had hopes that ironman would be the exception to movie tie in games and i think i was wrong
so if you want to avoid frustation you may want to rent it before plunking down the full monty
if the game experience was at least as good as the demo it might have been a different story for me
i dont like to pay to be frustratedthere hasnt been a game in quite some time that i thought was terrible pretty much across the board but iron man managed to hit itfrom terribly repetitive levels with respawning enemies to it unnatural flight controls and a bad targeting system iron man manages to fail at damnnear everything it tries to do
this is the bestexample of every criticism of a movie game ive ever seensure each level in the iron man world is huge and gives a good impression of not being in a fishbowl like some other games do

take whatever you would have spent on the game and go see the film again
for the really curious the demo is availible for free on both xbox live and the playstation network
dont let this waste ruin the experience for you the game starts off great but soon youll encounter the missing companion bug crashes or other glitches
this game was released years ago and shouldnt have any of these problems in  i cant even get ataris garbage website to patch it properly
pathetic
too bad it could have been a great game but instead its another reason why pc games are a dying breed and consoles are taking over
dont waste your time or moneyok nwnloved it to no ends
still have it installed on my computer to boot
it was an amazing game and still is
then this comes outwhere do i begin
right off the bat i knew bioware didnt make it playin itoh well i still had hope
huge bioware fan i then go into the oc mode
play that all the way
story wise good
love the companion setup
and the influence is greatsadly your choices of char dont afect the story line at all
i played it multiple times in spped mode of course with different classes and races and aside from like  line changes it the same exact gamein nwn your classracealignment changed the storyline alot
and i think it made that a good thing
almost like playin a while new game with a new char
next the cameraomgwtf
you accidentally move the mouse to the left too far bam your char is in the bottom corner gettin attacked and you cant see
to play though the maps i had to be switchin the camera like you wouldnt beleive
up down sides to side
and all around
now when i got to mobwow
like  companions to the bunches from the oc
the story line blewyou had no idea what was goin on
at the end you still had holes in the story line
and its shortamazingly short
compared to nwn sou  hou this doesent stand up to itwould i have bought it again givin the chancemaybe
if your a hardcore dd fanyoull be disappointed if your an rpger the expansion will let you downive been playing these games for a few years now
i have to say that i have yet to find one that impresses me they are very glitchy and i just dont think the company is dedicated to this franchisedont bother if you have xbox  and say but their are no other alternatives  just go back and buy mvp  for  and call it a day
i decided to give this game a shot despite reading many negative reviews  i though oh it cant be that bad
it really is as bad if not worse than what they say
the batting interface lacks the control of even nes baseball games the pitching is actually pretty good the feilding makes this about the worse baseball game ever
by the time the ball is hit and the glitchy computer figures out where to send the ball and unfreeze your closest player it is already to late
tons i mean tons or errors that you cannot control due to very very beyond glitchy controls and situations  and no i am not being butthurt because i lost a game
i like a challange and like to have realistic situations
the only thing that this game has that is next gen is the graphics but like i said rbi baseball for nes will provide a better more realistic overall experience
i wish i had the  i spent on the pos backit didnt work
no surprise since it was light as a feather
i cross checked it with a genuine power cable and verified this generic power cable was worthless
i mean come on even in generics a power cord that doesnt carry electricity from one end to the otherok so i loved iron man  iron man   unfortunately this game reminded me way too much of iron man   well if youve seen iron man  you know what a let down it was compared to the first movie
well this video game is a pure failure in the control scheme area because it is a console port
whats a console port
well thats a game that was originally developed for xbox ps or nintendo wii
unfortunately since companies want to make as much profit as they can a lot of game publishing companies today dont take the time to develop a keyboardmouse friendly control scheme they just say oh well if someone that owns a pc wants to play our game let them go out and buy an xboxps controller that works on a pc
well i happen to have an xbox controller specifically for my pc because i dont own an xbox
unfortunately the control scheme is not laid out identical to what it is on the xbox because pcs have a thing called a mouse
well for whatever reason some of the input for iron man goes to the mouse and not the xbox controller so you cant fly around in the game at all using any combination of keyboardmouse xbox controller keyboardxbox controller or mousexbox controller
fortunately i paid less than  bucks for the game
so bottom line if you play games on a pc mainly but happen to have an xbox or ps
skip the pc version of this game and get the one for your console of choiceplease note that the pc version of the game is a port from the playstation version of the game
the ingame graphics are old gen as a result and poorly ported at that
if graphics are important to you youd be better off purchasing the  or ps version of the gamea few other differences between the nextcurrent gen version of the game and the pcps version upgrades are not purchased the items you use the most are automatically upgraded
there are fewer unlockables and missions in the pc versioni bought this game off of ebay
yet another example of amazon being too pricey
i got the game installed in and was instantly told that i needed to insert the correct diski went to segas website figuring they had a fix for it
well there are about  treads on their website forum talking about this very error and then sega puts out a patch but the link on the website is for the european version of the patch
i waited a couple of days till they got the right link installed it and it still didnt worki called sega tech support on my own dime sent them all of my computer specs and they proceeded to tell me there was nothing they could do for mehmmmmm i can run doom and far cry and assassins guild all at highest video settings but some cheezey movie game wont run on my xps
id say its the programming not the computersave your moneyupdate the sega forums suggest some solutions to the glitchy scenarios which you might want to try
the following is a list of keyboard controls which is different from and more complete than the game manual
hthiron man keyboard controlsw move forwarda move backwards move leftd move rightmouse move camera  target enemyleft mouse button fire weaponmiddle mouse wheel next weaponright mouse button afterburnerspace bar hover upx freefall when hoveringf punch  contextual actionshift dash propulsion energy armor energy weapon energy even energyescape pause menuleft alt afterburner flightthe game starts off nicely enough with a bash through the tunnels and kill the bad guys scenario
simplistic controls dated graphics but not bad either
second scenario is flight and weapons testing an overly long tutorial as you learn the basics of flight and weapons with the suit
not bad either but then the scenario doesnt end you cant get out of the warehousetarget range to move on to the next scenario
the walkthrough thats posted online is for the console version not the pc version appears to be major differences and there are no patches posted im writing this on may   and hoping that theyll fix the problem and post a patch for it
so far im very disappointed i have to agree with the poster who said this looks like a rush job rather than a finished product
i havent returned it because im hoping that they can fix the problem with a patch ive been an iron man fan for many years and am still looking forward to playing this gameive played thief dark shadow and loved it so i bought the dark project and metal age mainly because it stated it would run on xp pc
howevr it gets to the weapons section then just goes to dark screen
will not play or go anyfurther
it will not go on an xp comp
i have some things they said to do to get it to run and have to redo it each time i play
to me this is a waste of money and time as i was led to beleave it would run with no special trickery
rather dissapointed and mad
been misledi thought id save some money and get all three thiefs for the price of one of gogcom
sadly all three games were very unstable on windows  usually crashing within a few minutes of play
i tried several reinstalls messed with the settings same results
i downloaded the gog version and it was flawless
great games i highly encourage you to get the gog version and enjoy this great seriesi am such a fan of the dungeon explorer that came out for the turbografx many years ago because the elements in that games was reminiscent of classic guantlet except that it had more interesting characters such as witch warriors wizards etc
the ds version is a revamp and not such a better one either
the elements and game play are not at all addicting
the game is currently collection dust on my shelfhave you ever seen that movie groundhog day
thats the one about the guy who gets stuck in a time loop and has to repeat the same day over and over again
well baroque is the video game equivalent of groundhog dogbaroque takes place in a postapocalyptical world where the few remaining survivors have been twisted into strange forms are haunted by guilt and madness and remember only confusing fragments of what happened to them
it is this world that your silent avatar is plopped down into and told by the leader of the survivors the archangel to lug a bulky rifle down to the bottom of neuro tower a gargantuan structure that towers over the ruined landscape and use it to purify the creature held captive down therethat is pretty much all the direction you are going to get
baroque is all about letting the player discover things for themselves
normally this would be a good thing
however progression is made as unintuitive as possible
for example triggering certain events causes neuro tower to expand and contract
in rpgs the traditional way to do this is to hide clues in the things npcs say
now imagine a game where say very bizarre things and its only after you talk to them about fiftyodd times that a method to their madness becomes clear
also imagine the one key clue only has random chance of being revealed after youve gone on the same fools errand about ten timesthis is really what makes baroque so frustrating
in most games the point is to complete a task without dying
in baroque dying is a key component of game play
you have to walk into nuero tower multiple times and either clear the dungeon or die trying just to get the story to move along ever so slightly so you can figure it out without a walkthrough guideevery time i managed to piece together a puzzle the payoff was meager
i was just handed a new puzzle or at least i think i was
the game is mean enough to throw something completely pointless at you
and no or limited new information
in a way baroque is lot like assembling a jigsaw puzzle without any reference to what its supposed to look like when complete and all the pieces are buried in an olympic poolsized sandboxbaroque is game played trapped in a time warp
each time you clear the tower or die you are transported right back outside into the town at level one with your inventory stripped from you
you have to go right back into the tower and start everything all over again
as i said before dying has no real penalty
in fact it is a necessity for making progress
you could say that players dont lose at baroque they only stall
or you could also say that players dont win at baroque either since win or die the outcome is the samebut still as frustratingly random as i found the game i did make it to the end
the story starts as confusing claptrap but it does clear some of itself up by the end
however if you have ever played digital devil saga you have already heard this plot and heard it better with superior characterization presentation and cohensionbaroque is an action rpg
the mute protagonist must enter the tower bare handed and search for weapons tools and the npcs that dwell there while fighting swarms of monsters
in baroques favor combat is not terrible just simplistic
customization is the key to victory as there are all sorts of accessories and items to collect to boost strength
essentially there are two health meters the hp gauge that decreases as monster injury you and the vitality gauge which steadily decreases over time and must be refilled with the crystals dropped by slain monsters
the addition of the vitality gauge makes it necessary to search the levels quickly yet thoroughlybaroque also boasts lots of tools but most of the thing you come across of marked as unidentified meaning you either have to use them on faith and hope you didnt just inject yourself with a lose a level potion or throw an invincibility item at an enemy or find an appraisal parasite to reveal what the item is
however the appraisal parasites are few and far between and one use only so you will be lugging around a bunch of unidentified items in your limited inventory
items also have lots of other nasty tricks such as armor that doesnt come off or armor that unequips itself every time an enemy comes nearif i had to pick one really good thing about baroque is that it has an excellent atmosphere and it really gets you to identify with the characters as they live through their repetitious purgatorylike world
after traversing the tower for the tenth time i felt like the poor tormented creature trapped in the basement of the dungeon repeating dont go crazy over and over againbaroque is atluss yearly turkey that one title they seem to put every year that tries to be innovative and offthecuff without considering if the end result is a fun game
this is not a hardcore rpg in the sense that the term usually means which is to say difficult its really easy and one that you must put some real effort into
this is a game that will only appeal to people who can love repetition like the most obsessive compulsive personality
not recommendedthe graphics looked like it was going to be a fun game but the commands it gave you to do survival skills didnt work
the x an y buttons did nothing
so my person just died unable to do anything but roam around
sad but trueit had to go back must have been defective as my other games worki played this game on a review that it was an old school rpg osrpg
im  i know what osrpg is and this is not it
this is boring and very sad
claires the girl partner if you chose a boy main character heart rate health just kept dropping because i couldnt figure out how to build the fire
when i finally found the wood her health dropped to  and kept dropping even after i made the fireby the way building the fire was not fun
you have to keep pressing the l and r buttons ds owners know these buttons are fragile and will stop functioning if pressed to hard or way to many times especially the lbutton google it if you dont believe me repeatedly until a bar turns red then you blow into the mic to start the fire
nice except you have to do this everytime the fire goes out every night or the girl will freeze to death and diemaking food from clams and seaweed was cute but frustrating as it did not bring health points back to 
the amount of hp recovered is based apon how well the food was enjoyed or prepared
if it was not enjoyed you got a small amount of hp
the most i saw when the meal was ok was  pts
by the way what is the point of having a rest system if it only applies to you
thats right  the girl partner clair will not recover health at all even when she is resting with youevery rpg game in history has you recovering hp while sleeping not this game
food didnt heal her one time she blatantly refused to eat no thank you im not hungry
while her hp was dropping
clair my partner died as i watched her heart points dropped down to   she just keeled over and died game over
this after i fed her rested for the night and built the fire  timesthat was not fun
i turned the ds off pulled the game and sent it back to the nether regions from whenced it camethis is a rip off   this   game do not even look like sega genesis quality that is a sham  for a  game and microsoft  for let this company  get away with the licence to sell this garbage game do yourself a favor  not waste your money in this of gamefor a while i was torn between purchasing operation darkness or this game spectral force   both are strategy rpgs and both are by atlus
i decided on operation darkness and it was surprising fun
so spectral force seemed like a nobrainer
at first glance it looked a lot like the wonderful shining force series of games
even the name seemed to tie in to the old series
but beyond that this game is no shining forceproblem  the control scheme is very counterintuitive
its simple enough to move about the game terrain but the attack setup is murky at best
there are different strength attacks depending on what button you push
of course the game doesnt explain that and the game book is similarly uselessanother problem  the enemies appear in stages and not all at once
that works fine for operation darkness because the maps are huge
not so much in this game
you kill three enemies and suddenly there are three more standing behind you
its hard to coordinate attacks when you cannot anticipate the enemies locationanother problem  the hub you return to after missions gives you practically no information or hints about creating items and armors
you find random junk during battles and you can create new gear after the fact
but what will the new armors and weapons do
are you making something really powerful or is it just more useless stuff
the game doesnt really tell youanother problem
let me get this straight 
the healer in your party cannot heal himself outright
you have to acquire a spell after the fact
he has no problem healing the other party members so why cant he heal himself
that didnt make any sense and it makes even less sense after the character dies constantlyfinal problem in between missions there are static cut scenes with dialogue moving the story forward
this is where the game likes to freeze
now an occasional freeze is forgivable but not when it occurs on a consistent basis
you beat the mission watch the cutscene the game freezes you cannot save start over
thats unforgivableforget this gamebad thing about this game is all the bonus puzzle that you have to do to get to the next level is the sameonly played it a few times and hurried to find a sucker to dump it on
it in no way compares to the realism of major league baseball kfirst of all the ps version wasnt made by insomniac so i dont blame themok now to the gameboring storynot funny even when they try and the weapons are awefulcontrols for ratchet blow and clank controls dont differ slightlyplanets are boring and blandweapons are lame and controls are unresponsivethe graphics are terrible and the gameplay is worsesave yourself the money and buy a worthwhile gamenot this garbagenotethis was fun on pspi had finished ratchet deadlocked and okay maybe not the best but still its got some intersting stuff to it but this
no
abso
lutely not
the disappointment here cannot be described
the game had too few weapons some were useless and the game was just awful
nothing good came from this game
nothing
this game looked like someone was just not committed to the rc name
this is what happens when someone who is not the original creator makes a new game in a beloved series without knowing what they are getting into
this and secret agent clank are both total failures
 and it gets the  only because this is not an original console title as it was on the psp first
still you expect something good with ratchet and clank on the cover
not this timelet me start out that i am a huge fan of the ratchet and clank series and as such i decided to give this game a try despite not being made by insomniac games
that was a huge mistake
for starters they got tones of details in the appearance of the game wrongratchet and clank arent correct and the sound quality is just garbage
i get that it is a psp game ported to the ps but i dont think that they even tried to make it good
the game play is super broken as is the camera
they didnt try to scale up the graphics for the console release
the plot is garbage
normally i dont pass judgement on a game until i have beat it but this one is so bad that i am making an exception
this one is not even worth giving a try
it is pure garbageratchet  clank size matterssave your moneynot in the league of insomniacs gamesgraphics and camera gameplay for ps version are very disappointing which is a shame because i am a huge ratchet and clank fani suggest only sticking to insomniac versionsit could be hes too young for racing games and i can see how someone older would enjoy it  but my  year old simply wasnt into it and hes a big fan of super mario galaxy on the wii played that until beating it then beat it a second time playing as luigi instead of mario so its not that he cant handle complicated games he simply wasnt into it could be he doesnt like racing gamesi got a dutch version from geek wholesale which my computer didnt even recognize
it had no booklet or registration code either which seems very suspiciouswhat a piece of junk
i have a logitech precision controller that played perfectly with lego star wars  all i had to do is click on it once and it worked by default
no problem no maintenance
but not on indy
turns out you cant use your controller unless you map it onto all the possible controls manually
come to find out i run out of buttons on my controller to assign to functions in the game
and so it wont let me accept my settings because i have  empty slots
i read on some forums that you can assign those useless slots to the keyboard
i tried you cant
so i cant play the game with a controller
i have to use keyboard
thats stupid
lucasarts you guys suck
thankfully i was smart enough to not purchase the game and feel ripped off i used the demo
lucasarts you did not and will not take my money
i strongly recommend that anyone thinking about buying play the demo and see if you can use your controllerunfortunately this game just wasnt ready to be released
since the new movie is out lucas arts had to capitlize on the momentum and they released a partially functional gameout of the box run the installer
everything looks good until it refuses to run because i have an emulator running
copy protection paranoia
i go to the support site and there is information about a combination of dell and roxio which trips this block
i download the patch even though i have an hp and roxio and the error message goes away
fortunately i know what i am doing but i feel for the average parent who just wants to get a game for the kidsok patch installed nothing but a black screen for over fifteen minutes
the only way to get the game to start with the patch is to run the task manager and switch to the lego indiana jones app
again i pity the uninformedonce the game finally runs there is no sound only music
the game plays but the graphics are jerky and i have to turn the settings down i have many games and a pretty advanced system and this is the only game i have ever had to turn down anything on
at first it insists that player one be the keyboard while only player two may use the game pad
nothing would let me change that
today i discover that whatever you touch when the game starts determines which control will be player   seriously
completely idiotic
nevertheless make sure if you can run this game that you do not touch the keyboard when the game starts
do not even try to turn down the volume as you will be stuck using the keyboardthe gameplay graphics and music are nearly equal to the star wars ones but the lack of sound effects is irritatingif you really must buy this game wait until we are done beta testing it and the patches are all availablethe experience with this game has made me rethink my preorder for lego batman
my son really wants that one but he is frustrated with this experience tooupdate  after a long time of messing around to try to get sounds working on this game i finally decided to give run as administrator a shot and lo and behold there be sound here
now the game is much better but i renew my objection to both the emulator problem im not running an emulator of any kind and the fact that no one at lucas arts had any idea how to fix this game
seriously no one and they wrote it
fortunately i just happened to decide to try to run it as administrator and the problem went away
shoddy programming and documentation but it turns out to be a pretty good gameafter the family fun pack i vowed never to buy another stuff pack again
but stupidly i let myself believe i was missing something so i caved and bought this
after all my favorite custom content downloads are kitchen and bathroom stuff
this stuff pack was not worth  bucks it wasnt even worth   the new stuff is boring ugly and not much
save your money and download some custom stuff off the internet the quality is waaay betterthis game is quite a disappointment
the  card games are impossible to lose and theres only twelve scenes to find hidden objects in
this entire game could be finished in a day
a waste of moneyi was very disappointed by this game
as mentioned by another reviewer this game consists of various solitaire layouts that truly are impossible to lose
after playing  or  solitaire tables in a row you get one scene of hidden pictures
then its back to more solitaire
its monotonous and not at all challenging
if you want a true hidden object game there are thousands out there that are more worth your time and moneyi didnt really care for it that much it was boringthis should be and would be a fantastic game  if it worked
the game mechanics and story are tons of fun
the problem  and it is a biggie  is that at least on vista the game is so unstable that it has become unplayable for me
cut scenes freeze forcing you to kill the game from explorer and start over
savepoints dont save forcing you to go back to previous savepoints  sometimes from hours of real time ago
keyboard remappings dont work preventing you from finishing missions
the end result is that you play the same segments of the game over  and over  and over  and over again trying desperately each time to find the particular sequence that will avoid the freezes and crashes
so i cannot recommend this game even though i want to because it is just so frustrating to keep dealing with the unpredictable crashes and even worse the inability to reliably save gamesinprogressthis game has so many issues you gotta wonder if they actually bothered testing it at all
it has endless problems right off the bat first for some reason it does not recognize the native resolution of my monitor one has to do a funky workaround which i found off the net to get most of the graphical options enabled  if you dont do this the maximum resolution youll see is x which makes the game look as graphically amazing as a first year ps game meaning it looks horriblebut dont think that even with all graphical options enabled youre home free the game has really below average graphics i mean its not mediocre by any means but really not much to look atthe character sometimes looses the ability to move for some reason while youre getting grilled by random guys you gotta restart from the most recent checkpoint which brings me to yet another problem the save system i went through  different mission pieces and for some reason when you save and come backit brings you back to the start of very first one which doesnt help at all seeing as the reason one had to reload the savegame in the first place was because the other common habit the game has is throwing black screens at you in the middle of story videos leaving you no choice but to go to your windows task manager and close the process out and try againa really bad copy of infamous stay away from it at all costsprototype fails in the one thing i ask of a game that it work
in brief it doesnt much of the time and when it does work its unimpressiveit seems that activision released this without adequate testing if they tested it at all on systems other than the one owned by the guy who wrote it and maybe his moms computer
the web is replete with stories about how to fix the audio bug although theres no official patch on activisions website and the only thing at prototypegamecom is an advertisement for the sequel
the unofficial fixes require changing component settings and removing hid devices from the device manager drastic steps which i havent seen recommended since the days of dos and various incompatable video standardsive completed the first part which seems to be a flashforward scene
you click various buttons and do various things none of which are really different from any other combination of clicks
some seem to do damage in a wide range others directly ahead of you
it doesnt matter
just whale on the buttonsyou can run up buildings which is cool a couple of times until you realize theres no point to doing that except perhaps to escape the chaos of times square
theres nothing on the rooftops except generic slooking textures
fortunately you can fall any distance without injurythe sluggishness of the game is confusing
itll become unresponsive at odd times and menus are nearly unmanagable because of the really poorly designed screens and cursor
the menu screens are almost all black and the mouse cursor is red which any freshman design student can tell you is a bad choice being invisible to a large part of the population yes myself included and hard to see for the rest
furthermore the mouse cursor jumps about by fits and starts if it was smoother perhaps you could figure out where it was but thats not really an option
youll have to use the keyboardi suppose that you could have fun with this smashing the same cars and beating up the same passersby textures are very limited and everything looks like everything else while growing tentacles out of your body but the appeal of that is limited for me
i got a little leery
your first mission is to kill lots of soldiers
why
ok they killed some mutants and a girl that might have been infected but about halfway through i paused and asked ok why am i killing soldiers
why am i not killing the icky mutants that are attacking innocent passersby who all look the same
if it had been adequately described ie
if there had been a writer attached to this project maybe i would have gone ahead and not felt like i was a superpowered terrorist
i know the basics of the story from the box description but its rather turgid and inconsistent
and it really should be assumed that the player starts from ground zero knowing nothing and learning things through playif you want a good thirdperson shooter pick up the mass effect games
if you want a really good firstperson shooter invest in deus ex three installments all of which rock
if you want an extraordinary action story set in a unique environment get bioshock i and ii the sequel is nearly as good as the original and has better controls
if you want to see tentacles growing out of someones body well japanese video has lots of that
if you like changing all the options on your system to suit one game that isnt a whole lot of fun then try prototypei bought this game since it was on sale and had a relatively high rating
i should have done more research
the hero goes around killing people and absorbing them
there is no way to even attempt to justify it either since many of the people are innocent civilians or soldiers just doing their job
it is gory and makes me sick just thinking about iteven if you have no conscience and can actually get past the moral problems of the game it is just not even fun
you are given dozens of super moves that you supposedly can pull off but you spent  of your time bouncing around like spiderman trying to avoid the  enemies sharing the street with you
please avoid this garbage for your own mental healthedit the memory card refuses to load any of my saved data
the data is on the memory card but it will not load on anything i want to play
do not buy this
seriously
dont read this and be like oh maybe it was a bad shipment
no
its a bad product
dont buy iti purchased two of these memory cards like a lot of other people have and when they had finally came in the mail i opened them and wanted to test them
i put in one of them
it worked perfectly
mb
one whole extra mb
that was pretty cool
then i opened the second one
i put it in my playstation  and read at the top left of my screen  kb available
thats almost mb
the memory card itself says mb yet only has mbdue to the fact that the memory card that is mb works perfectly fine im giving this a two star review
if it had a single noticeable flaw this review would only be one star
the other memory card that is mb works perfectly fine as well this review is a low review because of the mix up with the mbshave the new playstation  not sure if that matters but no matter what i did this card wouldnt work with my playstation these are all over ebay and are made incredibly poorly dont buy into the large size data corruption and unit failures arent worth the risk
i say risk only because chances are the card will not function on first usei loaded it multiple times but i never managed to even get to the play screen
how oddthis game sucks the first was better
it has more guns and monsters but the online and offline coop make it worse
the graphics are slightly better than  the first but the interface is bad
buy the firsti cant say much that isnt already said on other reviews
in short i wasted my money on this one
i loved the first one
this one is going on ebay
and i just bought it yesterdaylets start by saying i am new to the ps having had an xbox  for a few years nowbut i decided to get a playstation and bought resistance  together with fall of mani really loved the first gamebut this is a stinkerwhat went wrong everything about resistance  that was goodthe controlsthe story the gameplay were thrown out of the window for this sequel what were the developers thinkingwhere they drunk all the time through development or were they playing a joke on gamerswhatever it was they really messed this game up its as if a whole new team worked on it without any or little knowledge of what came beforei cant think of anything but the rumble feature that this game has thats an improvement over the firstthis game is all trial and error and it gets really tedious when you die over and over and over and over again and each time have to start again from the beginning of the level you often die because enemies just spawn out of nowhere when you least expect you also get confused as to what to do and where to go you often get swarmed with masses of creatures who bizarrely only target you and not your teams mates and you often run out of ammo a lot as you are restricted to two gunsthey also changed the controls around as well which annoys the hell out of mebut i finished this game because i bought itbut had i known how bad and inferior it would be compared to the first game i wouldnt have bought iti hoped the third installment would be betterbut sadly its worseps sucks
x box is the way to go
i finaly sold my ps for a low price of  after i finished this game
i will never go back to sony
sony sucks
am i a fan boy
no look at my other reviews i have given gow  a  star review as wellhorrilble
why why why
bc these companies are to lazzy and know we will run out and by it bc of the first this game is a weak effort compared to the original
insomniac appears to be more interested in cashing in than improving the fps species
rent before you buyokay now i loved the first resistance but this one to me is horrible especially when it was released a few months before the astonishing killzone  i thought the graphics in this game blew so much that i was wondering if my tv broke but it was clearly the game
so ugly on some parts of it
now im not basing the entire review on graphics because some fan boy might come along and talk some poo poo
so the actual game play annoys me compared to the first one i would get lost often and make circles because it would not tell me that i needed to push a button or tell me where to go
yes someone will probably say you just suck at games well so
i mean im not a nerd  hours a day gamer i need something easy and enjoyable and both of these key feature were not there for me
i play maybe  hours a week on my free time because people in the real world work and have families
multiplayer was mediocre and did not have that addiction lever i was looking for at all no unlocks and  players seems fun but it wasnt it was like being in a bad game on mw with loads of campers but times  because all the other team did was spawn kill
oh and remember before you get made that i didnt like this game
to each is own im not you and your abviously not me chill out and let me be damni can honestly say that this game is without a doubt the most highly overrated game out there
as an experienced street fighter ii player i found the game to be the same in almost every way
there is truly nothing new here
the graphics are definitely better
but the graphics itself does not impress me
i thought the characters looked rather cartoony in comparison to all the games out there for this current generation of consoles
second the movements are actually the same
yes there are updated moves but they still look the same to me
the ability to generate the special moves is a little easier compared to the original street fighter ii
third the cutscenes leave a lot to be desired
i thought they were somewhat bland and cheaply made compared to the characters themselves which are already dated in my opinion
just look at call of duty  and you will see what i mean
fourth i cannot believe that they charged the amount for this game which is nothing really new
its just a rehash of all the prior street fighter games
now they have super street fighter at a lower price but still so high in terms of their actual worth
the bonus material worlwide matches just doesnt cut it to me
why dont they have true tournaments periodically to make it worth your while
we certainly have the technology to do this
and when i mean tournaments i mean a true tournament that is officiated by referees
finally yes the game is supposed to be difficult
but some of the moves by the ai
opponents are really cheap
i am for challenging games but this one cuts the cake
if i had known how this game was going to be i would not have purchased it
it was a waste of moneyi tried downloading this a couple of times but it never worked properly
plus it required too much talking and moving around the environments to get anywhere
too much work for medont bother with this one unless you have something a far cry better than a x ghz celeron and an intel graphics card
they both stink for this purposei am a huge fan of tomb raider
i got underworld after reading a review stating that it was being played on a dell inspiron  i have a 
i missed the part that states one must have an xbox controllerin addition the video is jerky though i have it set to the x setting disabled videointensive stuff decreased the texturing and did what else i could think oflara is uncontrollable from the keyboard
dont bother trying
tap the arrow key she turns nearly full circle
it is impossible to point her in a specific direction unless she is running
further the arrow keys are unpredictable as are the wasd keys that are used
they might do anythingthe one thing that works well is the mouse
camera pointing works
that is alli think thats it for tomb raider as far as i am concerned
i couldnt even navigate her through her burning house
what a total disappointmenti was playing street fighter since the s
it was always my favorite game of all time
however this is the worst one they had come out
graphic was too cartoonist to a point that it looks roughall characters pack up with too much muscle looks fake
this is  with a platform of ps i would have expected something a lot better
this game lacks new moves you can find the exact way of playing ryu as usual except this game response more awkward
they even canceled some of the nice combo connections you can perform from the previous sf
over all i played this game expecting surprise which gave me noneim rating this game  star because capcom didnt give us a demoi live in a place where it is impossible to get to a game rental store and i dont have a car
so unless the game is horrible there is no reason to make demos available for us
i buy all my games from amazoncom so i must make sure that i like the game before i buy it and the only way to do that is by playing the demoi see the  star reviews but i really find them unreliable cause one i bought headphones according to the amazing reviews but the headphones really almost ruined my ears and left me deaf and i returned them on the same day i got them so the only find the one star reviews reliablecapcom is all about milking the franchise so its no surprise that super street fighter iv is launching  months after sf iv
a few new characters lots of tweaking and rock bottom low price to get you to buying this weak update
if they needed to tweak the impressive new roster includes classic combatants from previous street fighter games like t hawk as well as allnew characters such as the mysterious and deadly female fighter juri super street fighter iv adds new ultra combos and advancements to the state of the art online matchmaking and online game play introduced in street fighter iv with numerous additional features super street fighter iv takes many of the groundbreaking features introduced in street fighter iv and refines everything to deliver the ultimate vision of street fighter to fans the world overits shouldnt be a new stand alone game it should be a free expansion update for what is clearly a lack of game testing before it went to marketok let start with the graphics common dead or alive  have much better graphics and is a game from  we are in  i was especting much more
the online you are playing and you are doing great and then puff disconected and i have  cable conection
if you play the game normaly solo without online is kind of good game but too easy
next time i hope they make better graphics soulcalibur  have better graphics so common capcomeven for  this isnt a good deal
with the arcade edition now seen for  the  is worth it
especially considering the arcade edition allows you to switch to the super edition through a menu optionkinda like the madden football games of late just a very tough game to learn
button and joystick combinations with just the right timing i just dont want to invest that much time into this
i just felt like this was a tedious and repetitive taskfelt like work not funive played street fighter games in the past infact im one of the lucky owners of a dreamcast copy of marvel vs capcom  the thing i find interesting about this is that ken fights darn near exactly the same as he did in mvc infact most of the characters have the exact same moveset as they do in the other iterations of this series minus a few moves and oh yeah with a graphics upgrade comes less characters than weve seen in sf since the first game of the seriesalso the ai in this game takes all the fun out of a mediocre fighting system
on the normal difficulty i got beaten on the third level by an ai who used just the ability moves didnt throw a single punch or kick the whole match and say what you want about skill level and ability thats not fun to deal with
but being a good sport i cranked the difficulty down and figured id work my way up
on the very first fight chun li spent the whole match crouched down throwing attacks whenever i got close enough
again i dont care what your opinion about my ability is the ai being designed to fight like that is unacceptable
of course after playing it online i learned why the ai fights the way it does
after  matches online i officially gave up
there isnt a thing fun about this game its all a competition to see who can fight the cheapestthe graphics also are pretty crap yeah i know the whole cel shading thing is a style but ive never liked it for certain aplications and doing a whole game cel shaded is never a good idea
you wind up with what looks like lazy animation no matter how much work you put into it and in this game it just looks cartoony and sillyoverall id say if your a street fighter fan get one of the other versions its the same fighting for a lesser price and youll get more characters for your troublei wish i could have been able to give this game a more honest review because from what i was able to see the graphics were heightened and the difficulty set to your personal playing level seemed like an improvementbut the timeline went a little something like this i started a franchise with the lions i know went through the madden test to receive my madden iq how the game is finetuned to your playing level and around the  minute mark the game froze after a tackle i even intercepted the ball
i restarted the entire process right away after turning the game off of course
iq test preseason pregame training how you increase your players stats  rather pain staking for so measly little upgrades i saved the thing and started my first game
froze
second period during the play call screen
game off for the nightnext day  turned on load saved game and tried again
finished the game
i lost
but i finished my first game
hey im 
saved
second game
froze in the first period
game off for the nightnext day  walked into eb and returned the stupid game
never another madden game ever
went home and enjoyed k on the ps
waiting for fallout the end
this might not be you
check ea forums for similar stories and updates on the problemok iam sick of these games madden sux ks where the best 
besides who wants to play a game where every single button on the controller must be used and you have to get use to the controlls by playing for a month thus having no life
new video games have gone in horrible directions 
ill take madden for sega over this crap the shipping and everything was quick
no complaints there
however this gamei bought the most recent tr game  basically launch date
i loved it
no problem to go back and keep playing
i figured id order a diff one and have something else to work on not so muchi cant stand this game
its so frustrating
the controls are so jerky
i cant figure anything out
ill pass and trade it ini have been playing tomb raider since ps
the puzzles are frustrating
confusing and now i might sue crystal dynamics and square enix for giving me a horrible headache for compensation
its also hard to play this game when you are staring at her wooty the entire time and those cans
ooh
anyway glad i just played the demo
the guns and different things in the game is not worth your time to try and aim since it does it for you
big let down
 is the best tomb raider game
the puzzles are challenging
but doesnt anger me
glad i wasnt a sucker for buying this and just demoing it
like others have said lots of bugs as well
just pass on this onei have a portable
play station got the wrong format size so i woulnt be able to comment
on this particular
itemwhen i buy a game i want to be able to buy the full game
so if there is dlc for the game i want to be able to buy that tooso eidos decide dlc is available for the xbox  only
which means the ps version is never the full productso now i have to buy it on the xbox  to get the full experience after buying it alreadyone star for a shocking business practicethis is the worst tomb raider game i have ever played
it is supposed to on a next gen console but it looks horrible
the graphics look worse than what they did on tomb raider anniversary for the ps
the gameplay isnt much to compare to past tomb raider games either
dont buy this gameim sure this game would be fun if i could get through a game without the thing freezing up
i bought it the day it released and have maybe finished  to  games
the freeze issue has frustrated me to the point that i cant bear to put the game in my ps
oh and it may be a coincidence but another reviewer mentioned this as well but the day after i bought madden  and played that night my ps crashed and had to be sent to sony to be repaired
bluray drive went kaputim not a madden vet by any means
this is the first one ive purchased since probably the days of sega genisis and what i played of the game i liked
i expected a huge learning curve and im fine with that as i havent played this series in probably over a decade and the difficulty level adjusting to your skill level seemed to be comparable and fair
but like i said no point in really playing if there is a very good chance youre not going to get through a whole game
i find this fact inexcusableive been playing this game since it came out
it wasnt that great of an addition for the series to begin with but after less than  months the game jams after  minutes
its not a scratch its not my ps its a bug
and i have read many other reports of bugs like this
perhaps ea thinks that this will have me buying madden  but trust me that is not the consumer reaction at this juncturebe warned if you pick up a used copy of this game that it likely has the bug as wellas far as game play goes there are absolutely no improvements in this version over previous ones
its still painfully hard to rush the quarterback no matter how intense your dl
its still ridiculously easy to run up the score with your passing game
improving players in the dynasty game is now based on tedious practice sessions rather than onceayear training camp and the improvements are nominaland chris collinsworths color commentary is muddy
i saw madden call the  superbowlhes still got it so why not lend it to the series with his name on it
ea is shorting its fans and be advised that someone else will come along and steal your market if you dont step it upthis game is incredibly frustrating
ive read dozens of negative reviews here and they all hit the nail on the head
this is one of the most horrendous games ive ever played
the odds of playing through a single game and not running into bugs errors glitches and wtf
moments are absolutely zero
this game is fubarthe more i see games from the far east  the more i agree with hideo kojima when he said if you honestly compare japanese games with western ones japan has lost
resident evil is another example of how you can make a games which looks great graphically but is barely playable in terms of controlsto begin with just to start the game you have to push the following sequence of buttons or more like push the same button so many times start x x  x x x down down x x are you freaking kidding me
and its the same throughout the game every time you need to go to a next act or to restart a game because you got killed its a miriad of x pushes
even to upgrade a weapon you have to push x to select the upgrade then confirm upgrade by pushing x again then confirm the confirmation by pushing x again then when its upgraded you have to push x yet again to the message that the upgrade has been installed
holy cow
who in the hell did come up with this stupidity
now i dont know why it was even considered as an option let alone the only option available to completely stop a player in hisher place to shoot and even to reload a gun
but it does seem like every playable character in the game is a complete idiot unable to handle more than one task at a time you can either move or you can shoot or you can reload your gun but never the combination of moving and one of the other twoaiming is also weird while youre rooted in place you have to find where in the hell the laser line ends which is nearly impossible without a full stereo d because you cant really tell how far it ends because it can be pretty much anywhere on the screen not centered as in the majority of games where you have to aimthe control scheme is the worst of all games in the world
ive complained on bad controls in other games of course but nothing comes close to re in this regard i doubt you can come up with the worst controls for decades to comeas far as the storyline is concerned  its japanese so its all ridiculously cheesy and convoluted just like pretty much all other japanese games that managed to reach the west
i know some people might like it so take this as my personal opinion all in all the controls completely ruined the game for me
the graphics are amazing although the ps version as usual have gotten a shorter end of a stick with jaggies appearingdisappearing all the time because of the dynamic antialiasing framerate drops which also causes control lagginess and many other graphical compromises here and there that have already been mentioned by the  reviewersi bought this to play in splitscreen coop mode with my gf
we found it too difficult and too gory
it was just not any fun at all for usi suggest resistance  fall of man rainbow  vegas
army of two was oki wish there were more games that offer sidebyside splitscreen coop mode for the campaigncould only play for a few minutes after installing as the controls were too weird
could not move while aiming
limited ammo
boss within first few minutes
no training
camera angle was distracting
moving around felt and looked strange
died easy in easy modei am really tired of people blindly giving this game  stars and two thumbs up and all that nonsense pretending that its a good gamei have been a fan of resident evil since the first game which means all the stuff everyone complained about  the bad controls the bad camera angles the inventory games and so on  were all things that made the game work for me
that is i liked the concept as it waswhen re was announced i had some concerns particularly when we found out that the original design was an update of the existing formula with better graphics and controls
but i gave it a chance and found it to still be a fun game although not by any constructive means a resident evil game
so even after hearing all the bad news about re i kept my mind open and gave it a chancebut this game is just atrocious
the fundamental problem is that the designers obviously do not want to make the oldstyle re games
they want to keep pushing the series towards a straight thirdperson actionshooter incarnation but they are unwilling to make a clean break
so what youre left with is a hodgepodge of old and new whose sum is somehow worse than its parts
all of the old complaints are still there clunky motion cant shoot while moving crap inventory and inventory management confusing and difficult gunammo interaction the whole herbs thing  but instead of helping the game as they did with the originals where all this contributed to a sense of tension they make the game impossible to play
this is because re is not a survivalhorror game
it is half perfectly generic bland action game  kind of a poormans gears of war  with archaic and broken controlsthe game is spiritually and conceptually bankrupt
there are many headnods to re canon with old characters reappearing and a creaky extension of the endlessly mutable tvirus plot line but in that respect its a lot like one of those straighttovideo sequels that drops a few established words and phrases for borrowed credibility and a free reserve of good will
yet the game completely fails to build on those starting points and it just feels like a soulless cashgrabyou dont get to know any of the locations because youre speeding through them on linear paths
there are no puzzles beyond the lockandkey variety and most keys come from vanquished foes
the enemies are simply ridiculous not scary and mostly bipedal zombies riding motorbikes and shooting aks big fat guys with chainguns
gameplay devolves into standing still and spinning in a circle to shoot the braindead enemies or engaging in tedious coverbased bullet swapping
and for the first time in re history that ive ever noticed an re game uses spawners
not even in a subtle way either
you can see dogs appearing in the shipping crates and then running out to get youthe bosses are uninspired and tedious  the multiheaded hydra theme is played to the max
one battle has you pick up a gun specifically designed to kill that boss which slowly recharges as you try to dodge the boss strikes which are quick time events ugh
the entire battle is you standing still occasionally dodging and firing the weapon  nine  flipping  times
it doesnt ramp in difficulty it doesnt change at all
you literally just do the same thing nine times in a rowin general the weapons are boring just lots of revisions of the same basic things handgun shotgun rifle etc
and if you thought the what are you buying guy in re was a really dumb way to handle weapons re doubles down on that stupidity by just putting the guns in big shiny briefcases all over the levels
inventory management continues to slide downhill  i dont know why everyone hated the item boxes which were an effective solution but now you can only access your items between chapters in the game
inventory management itself is still cumbersome and unwieldy and worst of all the game doesnt pause while you do itand finally there is the coop
let me just say that a long time ago i was a fan of coop
it was one of those things that was rare in a game so when someone did it they generally had a compelling reason and it was a fun but separate element
then it became the big fad and everyone decided everything had to be coop to the point that there are no singleplayer campaigns
sure you can play single player but thats just coop with the computer which is somehow even dumber than my friends
so now youre stuck shepherding a dumb barney around the entire game someone who consumes your bullets and ammunition and constantly does stupid things
most importantly the mere presence of a second person in addition to the ridiculous depiction of the main character biceps like smoked hams puts the final nail in the coffin of the supposed horror aspect of the gameam i the only one who remembers what re was about
it was about a single person with some tactical training but with human limitations trapped in a series of small learnable but terrifying environments and using their wits and the occasional bullet to survivethis isnt a resident evil game
more importantly this isnt a good game
its just a very polished professional looking piece of generic junk using a licensed name
if it were a movie it would have been made by michael bay
its a tremendous disappointmentas a huge fan of the resident evil franchise i couldnt wait for this to come out
now that it has i realize this game was all hype and no substance
for starters the controls are very awkward
you spend time thinking about how you will execute the movement in parts of the game when they should just come natural
the biggest flaw design is that the designers have set up the game play where you must decide what items you want to use for each chapter before you begin the chapter
this seems fine at first but as you play the game they dont even give you the option to drop any items
so once you are full you are stuck with them
how stupid is this
then there is the story
the designers decided to tie all the resident evil stories together to give it a sense of full circle
initially this seemed intriguing but then as you play the game the same old bosses that you encountered in resident evil  are here too
you attack one and the little creatures spring out from his back or head
gee didnt see that one coming
but what really got me was their decision to go from a night time horror game to a daylight one
you can see everything in the day light
what genius thought this up
since the bad guys can be seen they have them hiding in areas where it doesnt make much sense like the marshland
they were hiding in the water and just jumped out
i know they are infected with the las plagas but can they breathe underwater
apparently they can
then absolute worst part and horribly corny is these infected beings i cant call them zombies since they are really not zombies will rush up to you and attack and then almost come to a stop when they approach you
oh and they like riding motorcycles too
speaking of running you cant reload when you are running
your character comes to a complete stop to reload
ugh can it get any worse
yes it can
your partner shevas artificial intelligence is okay but not the best
when she is armed with a gun and she runs out of bullets for some reason she doesnt switch over to the grenades or other weapons
she will switch from gun to gun but when shes out of ammo for those she will go to the knife
youll also find that she uses ammo like its going out of style you are always giving her bullets
i really wanted to like this game but its just tired and predictable
i laughed when the mystery character that saved irving appeared
why was he dressed like batman
didnt have the ears but it was close
completely laughable
and they call this survival horror
please not a single thing was scary
the game play was boring and not even exciting
no sense of urgency or anything
i felt like i was going through the motions
all of their their previous games gave a sense of fun and excitement
not this one
weve seen it all before in their other games
its as if they remade re  and changed a few things
completely boring
the graphics and sound however is incredible
if you have an audiophile system with an hd tv it looks and sounds awesome
but you know what they say all style and substance
that accurately describes this game
save your money and dont buy this
this is without question the worst resident evil game in the seriesterrible character control
stiff and nonintuitive
the game is scary because you cant move
the horror is trying to play
its the only game i havent finished in yearsim not going to write a long review but if youre a fan of resident evil then buy this game
if your just looking for a shooting game to beat rent this game
i didnt care for this game at all
i beat this game and it wasnt even hard
this game really isnt worth it to be honestbrazil  gramado  rio grande do suli both cause of the movie but this game is disaster dthis game really overstays its welcome
the first  of it is the scariest or at least creepiest part of the game
but it just gets more and more michaelbay dumb action setpieces intrusive cutscenes turrets bosses with glowing weaknesses
resident evil  tried to separate itself from the convoluted and stupid backstory of the previous games
resident evil  embraces all of that horrible junk
by the end you are literally fighting wesker on top of a volcano and there is no horror left
by the way wesker might be the most embarrassingly tonedeaf character in all of fiction
the minute he starts his bulletdodging matrix crap i wanted to never play this again wesker represents japanese developers insistence that they understand what western audiences think is cool but it is just embarrassing that an adult came up with this character
it took resident evil   of the game before i earnestly desired for it to end
resident evil  wore out its welcome much much faster
added to this you have to babysit an idiotic ai partner and your inventory system is nightmarishly inferior to what is was in resident evil  also the lipsynching is terrible especially sheva who moves her mouth like a sock puppet
when a game ends i should not be thinking thank god im never playing this again this game is nice looking in many parts but it is just a comedy of errors
skip this and skip re as welli had great expectations when i first saw the videos and heard the news on the new resident evil game for i have been a huge fan of the series especially re and re code veronica best re of all time
re  had already been disappointing some years ago with all that action and no puzzles and shock moments implented anymorewell and after playing the re  demo several times here are my first impressions an unbelievable long loading time
i actually went to the bathroom got me something to drink checked my mails then i got to play
that really has to change until the launch of the game but i doubt it chrashed several times very unstable
hopefully that is just an error as to the demo and not the full game graphics are really stunning as to the sourroundings africa in far cry  looked better but it is still great and characters
the zombies look kinda weird
and after you killed them they disappear in some sort of bubbles looked like house of the dead looked really silly the biggest flaw this damn coop mode
dont get me wrong playing coop with a friend is kewl although the splitscreen was implented in a weird way in the corners of the screen but okay
but if you are a solo player you are stuck with your miserable ai
partner that always runs in front of you around you cm away from your nose like a bee anxious to get some honey
it is soo annoying
and it does not matter in the least if you are doing everything the right way meaning giving her ammunition herbs covering etc she dies and that happens a lot
and that means game over
i want to play re i want to die and i want to finish the game with my skills not with some screwed up ai
figure that cant even walk right the sound is okay as long as you just focus on the surroundings and the zombie sounds
the weapon sounds are some of the lamest sounds i have ever heard in a game difficulty well the past re games have always been easy in the beginning and sometimes got really hard during the game and especially in the end with defeating the final boss
but now since when does a zombie not die when you shot him directly in the head
with your pistol u have to shoot at last  times in the head or  at the body of the zombie to kill him
and considering that you got much less ammo than ever in a re game this is pretty annoyingoverall i am very very angry sad and disappointed and immediately cancelled my preorder
first i wanna see how the final game looks like and which of those flaws have been erased but i fear there wont be much done about it
if it costs  some time in the future i guess you can buy it
the current state of the game just does not justify a purchase in any way
sorry capcom you blew it big timethis is the worst resident evil included resident evil  its an action game without the horror like re   or code veronicai bought this game because i want to know how the history ends but i knew that this game will be a bad gamei love the original resident evil re   or code veronica because the syntesis were the horror how you are walking in the corridor and how a zombi jump to you and this kind of thingsbut this game its not re its only to run away from the thousand of guys another thing is that the puzzles doesnt exist in this game you only shoot shoot and shootfor mi its not a re this is a great deception i hope that capcom fix the next re and make it like the originals without accion and more horrori play video games to have fun not to be frustrated
i spent three hours playing this game but thats the last three hours resident evil will ever get from me
you have to stand still to shoot
you can only punchkickjumpetc
only when prompted
camera angle sometimes changes by itselfespecially when i need to face the enemies not have my back toward them
ammo is too limited for the number of enemies to kill
i have to use the knife a lot of the time and you have to hold l all the time to have it equipped
why cant you do just a onetime toggle like other games
my hands hurt playing this game for only three hours
stupidly designed game
there are other cons but my hands are too tired to type right now from playing this very frustrating game
goodbye resident evil
i will spend my next  on another game not resident evil despite keeping all software up to date the bugs inherent with the software are a deal killer on this
the few things that i got to play were entertaining otherwise it froze up so fast i couldnt advancei bought one of these to try it out
not only does it hold games so incredibly tight it can damage them the sound and graphics are off
piece of junkdont buy dont buy dont buy this is a beutifull concept but  a bad pice of hard ware dont waste yuour money better buy the originals sitll are aviable on amazon and otter places i purchased this item from walmart 
it was reasonable price since regular nunchuck is still  in any popular storefirst one was totally defected
onoff bottom doesnt respond flashing light never turn to solid light to read signal
it took long time and hassle to setting up in first onei decided return with unbelievably messed opened package
its impossible to open neatly without cutter
they need to change design package to open more easilynext one was exchanged at walmart and this was last chance for me if its not working it will turn refund
it read signal so quick like what instruction said
then tried some game and works great
light never flushing back again till you turned offi think this is good item if you lucky enough to buy non defected one
you might need try several item to meet one works great so i recommend to purchase near your homeyou might need aaa rechargeable batteries for this item
 i got mistake with rating its should be  starts like i rated fun as  stardoesnt work tried this device several different times and it just does not work
did not pay enough to try and return threw in trashfor the better part of an entire year i was hyped up to this game
the announcement that there would be no knockouts was the only thing that soured me a bitthen i read a midway qa session on igncom regarding the game and almost every response midway gave either consisted of no this game will not feature that or we hope to include that in the next game
missing a lot of things though it may be midway showed just how much fail is in this product when they spend an opportunity to hype it up by basically crapping all over it and all but telling us dont buy this yetits only the beta version of the sequel coming in four or ten years
then the game itself
the graphics are good but what game isnt these days
you cant give a game a pretty rating just for graphics aloneimagine how final fantasy spirits unleashed would have been received if the graphics of the movie were considered a part of how good it waseven then the graphics look nowhere near as good as the nowapparent prerendered screenshots plastered across the internet
i absolutely could not tell that james storm character was supposed to be james storm while for the most part all the wrestlers look how theyre supposed to but dont break the barrier of shock and awe
they are more in the league of smackdown vs raw  or that said compensation appears to be made for the aboveaverage graphics by immense cuts in game content
 superstars is no real big deal
when all those superstars have the exact same generic taunts and the same puddle of moves to pick from that is a big deal
a bad big dealthe controls are a sloppy and contorted mess
arguably this could be from a several yearlong accustomment to the controls in wwe games from day of reckoning to smackdown vs raw  but either way its simply not very functional for the r button to be for running and for the stronggrapple button to be on the opposite side of the controller from the base grapple button itselfthe controls are designed in such a way that it will take a very long time to grow accustomed to them much less to master them
maybe this is due to my clumsiness and retardfingers but even i was able to get over the switch of l button for blocking strikes r button for blocking grapples in svr after a transition from wwe day of reckoning  where it was the other way around within a short while of gameplay
as such when you are thrust into the ring early on your only chance of winning is the basic punchkickbasic grapple until you can figure out how to do more complex maneuvers without the computer utterly destroying you while you stand around stupidlythe moves actions ingame are indeed fluid but only for as long as the opponent is standing
as soon as they are knocked down and fail to immediately come back up the fluidity is broken
as far as i can tell there is absolutely no way to pick your opponent up when theyve fallenonly to stomp or punch them drop elbows or whatever other thing or do ground grapples involving the exact same arm locks and suchthe fluid motions as well must be fluid if you consider just how slowly they come about
the controls do not react immediately and once youve set about trying to perform a punch or a grapple there is no going back
as such if youre lightningfast on your button mashing like i am youll be angered to no end by how sloppily your character tries a meek little punch only for the enemy to back away quickly then come right back up and hit you while youre still recovering from throwing that first punchmidway apparently has reason to brag about how fluid their grapples are as wellthere are only about two or three of them the player can perform
compared to the dozen or so that can be done in the wwe equivalent the game pretty much only needs one button and two directions on the analog stick to fluidly perform the exact same suplex or jawbreaker or hurricanrana quickly and efficientlycounters are apparently the only area where the uniqueness of tnas inring talent is on display
amazingly the moves are all very ordinary and basic whereas the counters show off some of the most insane unique and innovative maneuvers tna wrestlers can do
countersthe sound is terrible
obviously something like sound isnt really of big importance to a game that does it right but in this game theyve really done something wrong for sound to get mention
the audience has only three or four noises they makeand they are noises because this crowd never quiets down or gets louderthe generic white noise of screaming a gasping sound effect used millions of times in various movies and tv shows for the past hundred years and slightly noisier but no more louder cheering
the punchkick sounds are comical in nature sounding like something youd hear in street fighter ii or final fight for snesi could have given the game a two or even three star rating if not for the crux of the massive bag of issues this game is the fact that the opponent will seemingly always be better than you no matter what alwaysi started the game playing as chris sabin vs shark boy and in said match i was very new and experienced
i tried a balanced workout of punches and kicks first followed by experimenting with grapples and trying to figure out how to do other grapple moves
not only did i utterly fail to do anything but snap suplexes but because i was kicking the crap out of shark boy with only the most basic of moves he easily countered some of them built up a full impact
bar and performed his finisher and pinned me for threethe next match i was aj styles vs rhino
this bout went even shorter as despite the fact that we both battled each other equally my pins barely made two whereas rhinos one pin got me at  in less than  minutesthen i go to story mode where the most damning thing happens  i spend a good  minutes utterly destroying this obese clown named benny or some generic name like that with  of all strikes and moves in this match being done by me on him and i grab him up in my finisher and pin him and he kicks out
after a more sustained and concentrated beating not only does he kick out again but he manages to pull off his finisher on me and pin me for three
after getting in almost no offense he somehow beats methis happened three times in a row
after finally beating him somehow i move on and the same thing happens
i squash my next opponent and yet they perform enough moves on me seven moves on me out of  on him is still enough to get you a full impact
bar to perform his finisher and beat meupdate this only seems to get worse as you progress in storyline as biggername stars are even bigger jerkasses to beat as in one scenario where i literally squashed james storm as in got over  of the matches offensive moves placed on him and just because he managed to counter  of my moves he is able to get a finisher hit it on me and pin me for three
trying to break out of a pin by wiggling the control stick is such a frantic ordeal ive cut the skin of my palm just trying to keep an opponent down for a pin by wiggling the control stick
or rather smashing it back and forth wildlythis is pure bs
when youre pinned the game gives you a motion of the analog stick wiggling back and forth in order to break the pin
the only problem is it doesnt tell you which analog stick this is and wiggling it gently is as effective as not wiggling it at allyou have to ram it back and forth as fast as you canand so midway releases to us a beta test of a future release
and it is a great many things and many of those things are what was once just a verb but has now become a noun as well fail  this game is pathetic i wanted to like it couldnt wait to get it and i am treated to another midway halfaed piece of 
all the wrestlers have the same moves the caw sucks and has only  slots only one finisher per wrestler no submissions scorpion deathlock etc the costumes for big name wrestlers suck nash
the finishers looked good but hell you needed to do  on an opponent just to get a  count how realistic is that thats maddening
the ai is total garbage and stupid you do  finishers on an opponent and all he needs to do is punch you knock you down and your done thats midway terrible
the entrences are about  seconds long the hardcore aspect of the game is nonexistant the gameplay is horrible countering system sucks bubba ray cannot reverse backflip into a super neck breaker im sorry
you can just see playing this game or trying too that midway hyped up yet another unfinished pathetic half aed failure
bye midway thanks for mortal kombat trilogy and armageddon other then that fu
cant wait for a better company to buy mk and tna gaming licences
hell they cant do any worse than the insults midway has done to mk and tna with such bad horrid games
everyone should have seen this comming when as another reviewer already pointed out the interview on this game was done with midway
every question about content and features match types etc
was the same stupid lame awnsers myabe in the next game thats a good idea if we have timethey knew they had a real turd on their hands and when they released so did fans
its half finished turds like this is why midway failedi was so excited to play this game only because i love the ring design and some of the matches in tna as well as the washed up wwe superstars
when i got this game luckily i rented it i quickly found out why tna is no competition for wwe
this game feels rushed
each player has about  moves apiece the opponent gets up the moment you knock him down even with high impact moves
then to top off the crappy controls and lack of moves you start out with less than  wrestlers to pick from
honestly i think they could have left this game in production for a couple more months and tweaked it a little
the wwe smackdown vs raw games are just more realistic and have better much better moves
if you are looking to play this game i suggest you drink a lotthis game has terrible match type features
ultimate x is the only good thing
also just about every wrestler has the same moves
the entrances are short and generic
the create a wrestler just flat out sucks
the controls are terrible
the only weapon in the game that ive seen after playing for hours is  chairs
the cut scenes start of in great detail then as the game progresses it gets lazy and bland
sure we can get sick of smackdown vs raw but even some of the worst wrestling games have this beat
id say play wwf warzone wcwnwo world tour ecw hardcore revolution rumble roses def jam vendetta
all of these are better than this game
in fact tna impact is the worst wrestling game since wcw nitro and wcw thunderto be honest  the first wwe smackdown game released in  by the at the time rookie game company thq was a better game than this  midway game 
the controls where unresponsive first time in a long time i wanted to destroy my controller the counter system doesnt work rb most of the roster is locked and you have to play the story mode  and the button system is so simplistic  you can win some matches by just mud hole stomping  you cant explore the map like you can in the early smackdown games lame  and the create a wrestler system is basic major foul for me because i love to make my own wrestlers the only good i can think of is the voice work from the wrestlers and the story in story mode isnt bad at all
the camera system works  of the time  and the game is no dq this isnt the worst game ive ever played  but it it a major disappointment 
get a ps and play  to  year old wwe smackdown games over this graphics are good gameplay sucks
not enough moves or characters
dont waste your money
gameplay is way to easy
i beat story mode in a weekendi have nothing good to say about this pathetic exscuse for a video gameits just all around terriblethe graphics make you wanna vomitthe controls will make your thumbs sorethe game modes all suck and the horrible repetative music makes you go nutsstay far far away from this nightmare of a gameeven if its a buckwow stunningly tepid graphics
unreal in  had better graphics
gameplay is just stupid
no ai to speak of andthe so called puzzles are too simple
story line and action is one cliche after another
and what is it with every door having the stupid security panel that you have to short circuit by holding e for  seconds
does this add somthing to the game
the level design must have been done by students blind students
i cant even finish the game because of a bug that causes you to fall through the elevator
lots of complaints about this bug
gamecock doesnt even acknowledge the error
dont waste your money its worth  bucks tops and that with a fix for the bug
still no bug fix as of todayterrible game direction hard to play
sometimes objects are extremely unclear all you have is some dude yelling in your ear to do a thing without telling you how to do that thing
expect to be frustrated a lot
expect to die a lot
only play this game if youre a completionist and want to see everything in the world beatenamazoncom does not provide the product codes for legendary or any game for that matter and the one i received was invalid on purchasethis game did not activate with the key code provided
the company southpeak games lists a phone number and email for customer support
after three phone calls recorded message each time and four emails over a three week period i have heard nothing
so maybe theyre out of business or they all died in a nuclear blast
however the phone number works and all the emails went through
i will send one last email notifying them of my review on amazon
hopefully amazon will grant me a refund
first and last time i will purchase a game sold by southpeak gamesi played many games from first person shooter and i know the quality that some games had but this title realy sucks
dont waste your moneythe only enjoyable moment i had was when i removed this trash from my computeri wouldnt have bought this or i should say paid money for itsince they dont actually sell it to you had i realized it had activation
no where in the product description did it say that when i got it
its limited activation at thatdisappointing since the game itself is actually a lot of fun
im baffled by the low professional reviews
it looks nice has a fun story fun creative enemies etc
it moves along at a fast pace and while youre fighting a smallish number of enemy types like in any fps theyre all very differentmolten rock creatures vulnerable to water werewolves that have to be decapitated etcif you were intrigued by the premise buy itbut buy it for one of the consoles
thanks to activation limited activation at that i effectively have a paperweight now and this would have actually been something id like to keep to play down the roadthis game is beautifully done with great graphics and very wellhidden objects
unfortunately one flaw renders it unplayable under some circumstances  the mouse does not move all the way to the edge of the screen
im stuck at a point where i know exactly where the object is a hint wasted even confirmed this is indeed the correct object but i cannot get the mouse to move close enough to select it
ive clicked dozens of times all around it and lost many minutes
and still it will not select the object
unfortunately short of starting as a new player and hoping i dont get that particular object again or any in a similar position i dont see a way to overcome this issuewhich is sad otherwise the game seems very nice but it is simply too frustrating that you cannot do what you see needs to be done to progress the game
ive tried a few times and always run up against this issue
i dont know how to correct it so im simply uninstalling the game and hopefully forgetting about it
editthere is a way around the problem  someone told me the secret
you have to start the game then go to the main menu and uncheck full screen
click okay to resume the game which will now be small and windowed too small to play with how tiny some of those objects are
and then go back to the main menu and recheck full screen
you will now be able to move all the way to the edges
im not sure if id change my star rating even if i could maybe up the fun item because thats such an annoying flawso this allowed me to play through the game and the story history is great the only issue okay two issues
one its really really short
two some of those items are impossible to find and there are very few hints
seriously the fireflies
who could find that one  well i wont spoil it
but save a hint for thatwhen i finially got around to loading this onto my pc it would not load kept stalling further what did load was a short cut to buy the full edition thought id already done that
while its possible i recieved the wrong product the fact remains what i did get is  to put it mildly worthlessthis hidden object game is one of the few that i have thrown away and the first ive done so before i clicked on the final suspectthe game is a murder mystery which i normally like to solve but this one was depressing dark and satanicthe characters are creepy with skimpy costumes multiple tattoos body and face piercings and stretched bloated cartoonish features
there was the body of a murdered clown in one ominous scene and a dog in a scene and a pig in another that were eating humans
a crow was drinking from a pool of blood in another scene
there was blood and instruments of death throughout the gamethe main character whos life you are hired to save is a horrible hag that laughs and jokes as the others die horrible deaths
when her son dies she cackles with glee and says no great loss i can always have another one
ive never given such a negative review before but this game totally creeped me out
im sorry i wasted my money on ithidden relics is not what the game is about
the picture and the relics give you the idea that is ancient relics
it is not
it is not worth what i paid for it
i would love to send it backthe game can seriously be finished in  hours or less
theres no challenge no big twists and the ending is a jokewords just fail to describe how crappy this is
theres no replayability in it either cuz in the end it doesnt matter if youre a cyborg or a full human wether you join pilot or fight against him  cuz the end encounters are exactly the sameextremely disappointed in this game
wait for a few months when the game is  bucks then it might be worth iti bought a cheap guitar so that when friends came over theyd have something to use
the price seems to have gone up since i bought this guitar and at this price  and over i wouldnt touch this thing
if you can get it for  bucks somehow go for it
but if you are paying close to  or more spend the extra few bucks and get the original rock band guitar not this cheap imitationive had two of these guitars and both ended up conking out
the first i couldnt figure out for the life of me because there are two settings on this guitar those who own rb and those who own guitar hero
i own rb and i finally figured out that the stupid setting needs to be on guitar hero to work on rb it was very frustrating
the second guitar just flat out stop working after a few months
its really weird because i can see the guitar is registering with the receiver but for the life of me cant figure out why it wont play
oh well im done with this cheap plastic guitar and going to get the original guitar for rb
my advice pay the extra few bucks and have a high quality back up
worth the extra  bucks in the endi thought this would be an acceptable second guitar for use with rock band   i was wrong
the dongle is huge and heavy
you cant just plug it in and let it hang like with the rock band dongles
i frequently have problems getting the guitar and dongle to sync to each other
once i get them synced up they generally stay syncedthe biggest problem is the play quality
they lack the mini buttons on the bottom of the frets like the original rock band controllers but more importantly there is no stop at the bottom of the orange button
what this means is that if youre playing on anything more than medium difficulty where you have to change hand positions you are very likely to loose track of your fingering
additionally the buttons are very junky and smooth and the feel is not goodyou get what you pay for and i could accept the poor feel and play if at least it easily synced and the dongle wasnt so ungainlytwo different times i bought the frontman guitar as a second guitar for the rb on the ps and neither time did it work
i had to scratch and claw for a refund both times
is there some sort of defect i dont know about
apparently
i will certainly not be purchasing a thirdthis is not a game
at best its an interactive storybook
i wasted an hour of my life playing this game
in that hour i was actually playing the game for maybe  minutes tops
the rest of that time was spent reading the word balloons of  characters talking to each other
the few minutes that i was allowed to walk around and fight things seemed pretty fun but im not going to put up with hours of clicking on word balloons if i can only actually do anything for a minute at a time every  minutes or so
i realize the story is important but i think any game should have more play time than storytelling timei like the artmusicgameplay
i just wish it would actually let me play the gamei finally bought this game about a week ago after reading amazing reviews on it and i must say i felt very mislead
i was expecting at least a little bit more of a traditional rpg with more realistic game play
twewy was far from what i expected
from the first time i booted it up i thought oh no this looks cheesy  im going to hate this game but i gave it a chance anyway
after way too much ridiculous dialogue involving two characters that you cant help but hate the game finally begins sort of
i finally got into the combat part of the game which i absolutely hate
it feels like a mix of dance dance revolution and final fantasy  you are expected to control two characters at once one at the top of your screen and the other at the bottom
on the bottom you run around in an extremely limited space using different attacks while trying to avoid the enemy
while doing this you are expected to follow a pattern of buttons to push to control the character on the top screen which i have found impossible as i am not a chamelean and my eyes do not look in different directions at once
if you ignore the bottom screen for more than a second you get bombarded by enemies
after trying to figure it out i found it too difficult to resist the urge to destroy my ds by slamming it against the coffee table so i just left the top screen on autoplay which apparently the autoplay does a terrible job and makes it impossible to achieve higher than a c on any battle which hinders game play
so now i officially hate the gameplay the characters and the combat
i decide hell  of people on amazon loved the game so lets keep going and try and see what they see
i played a few more hours gathered a few more pins and all i discovered is that  of people on amazon are morons
i must say though i hate the characters a little bit less
but i definitely hate the game much more
boss battles have become extremely difficult because i have no choice but let the computer control my nd character  but wait
i have the ability to switch the game to easy
i read reviewers say they like this aspect but to me its a cop out
square enix failed to make a consistent game and decided it would be easier to have us switch difficulties throughout the game than to fix it
in this reviewers opinion square enix failed to make a tolerable game
i am surprised to see that anyone enjoyed it and baffled as to how so many people loved it
hands down one of the worst games i have ever played and this is coming from a huge square enix fanaddim so sorry that this many people got insulted when i said  of you were morons
i forgot the internet is where you take everything you read so seriously that you want to throw epunches at the guy writing itabsolutely awful
i read all the great reviews and i tried to give it a chance but it was so amazingly boring that i had to put it down
the text went on and on  i kept wanting to play the game but i wasnt interested in what the people were saying
by the time i tried to play the game i was so bored that i didnt care
this is the most overrated game i have ever played
play zelda insteadwarning spoilers
read at your own riskstop deceiving people
many people like myself have bought this game due to good reviews
it sounded cool it looked cool
why not
but when you actually get into about  minutes of playing this game you realize that there is much more dialogue with blowhard unlikeable characters whining a hurricane instead of gameplay
the protagonist neku whines so much that he isnt even likeable and shiki is anorexic and annoying
the gameplay is awful
you have to control neku and shiki at the same time fighting two battles on two different screens you control neku with the stylus on touchscreen and the anorexic girl on the top with abxy or udlr depending which hand you prefer using
seriously how can you make a battle system like this
especially square enixheres a protip before buying a game look at the negative reviews before bothering
stay away from this garbage
no excuse
it was made by one of the most popular game developers and it had so much potentialoh and the music sucks too
i usually turn off the sound most of the timewelli was very disappointed in this gamethe game came in a timely mannerbut it just did not meet my expectation
i am into rpg gamesbut this one did not set well with me
there was too much distracting musici didnt understand how to even play it
and i didnt understand how the seller wanted me to return ittalking about the case being closedi want my money backthis top paragraph is an added edit everything after it is the original reviewi wrote what i believe to be an relatively intelligible negative review for a game that is very popular  i went against the grain and backed it up with a reasonable critique stating why i didnt enjoy the game
what do i get for doing that
unreasonable gut reactions from huge fans of the game in comments and ratings
when someone doesnt like a game and you do grow up and deal with it
i can understand commenting on a negative review for a very popular game that you like theres obviously reasons that certain games get very high ratings including this one
i myself have commented on low reviews for incredible games
however these are generally reviews that dont give an intelligent reasonable reason for the low review like a brief review that simply says this game sucks dont buy it and not much more or a complaint about the shipping things that dont have to do with the game etc
these reviews bring the rating down for no reason
but when a low review states its reasons i also qualified many of the comments i made with things like im biased towards such and such and theres obviously a reason for the large following like i said grow up and deal with it especially when the other low reviews give similar reasons for disliking the game original reviewabsolutely the most overrated and over anticipated rpg for the ds ever
horrible battle system simply ridiculous i think even for action based battle
im biased because i prefer turn play but also play tactics and action battle rpgs and still feel the gameplay is horrible
i also thought the buttons as item upgrades was at first confusing and then once i understood it i found it plain silly not innovative
too much unnecessary dialogue the worst battle system ever as though the developers quit halfway through creating something that could have been innovative  i hate to use this phrase in any review but this game deserves it in my eyes  it plain sucks
shame on square enix and i cannot understand the large following the game does have so the game must have its merits
i cannot see any
this game to me is not innovative it is a huge flopmy advice is to play this game first before buying if you can because like i said it is obvious that a lot of people like it but also obvious that there is also a group like me who were disappointed re
other  and  star reviewsi love a lot of square games and bought this on the strength of the reviews but i thought this game was terrible
i disliked the music the style of the art the premise of the story the realtime dualscreen combat using the stylus the idea of buying buttons as item upgrades and liked nothing about itif youre an rpg fan and money means anything to you do your homework before purchasing this one
i did my homework but should have done moreso i bought this game yesterday   couldnt wait to get off work so i could go play
put the game in and actually sit through the tutorials
lets say i was very impressed with gameplay and how fluent it worked remember i am only in the tutorial
after i finished tutorial i went to the saga
now being someone that owned all budokais i was expecting a decent length and substancial storyline
to say the least i was wrong
i finished the story that night
i mean what a rip i only got up to the cell saga
i came in thinking it was all the way through to buu at least and had all the characters i came to love in budokai tenkaichi  seeing as that only makes sense
what really bothers me is after each saga they fabricate a movie based on gameplay to wrapup what happened
i think this space and time could have been better put into including a buu saga
i mean most people just skip these low budget in game movies anyway so why not give us something we want
when i buy a game i buy it for substance some good gameplay
not half of a game with better graphics
btw they include the first disk of season one   season one came out over a year ago and most of us fans already bought it
why give out something we already own
even worse why give out part of a season where you will still have to go out and buy the whole thing if you dont own it
i mean seriousl what are we going to do with one out of six disks in a set
just a way to get ppl to sink more money into this franchise
i strongly urge everyone to rent this game before buying so you can see exactly what its worth
this game to me is was worthless and i am ashamed that they would even sell this game in the market let alone sell it for such a steep price
trust me you are better off getting something elsecons
game is short only through the cell saga
game has cutscenes every  seconds during actual fighting which throw you offguard and confuse you
maps are incredibly small
you can successfully hit someone about  times before you hit a wall
gamplay has no learning curve its ez to play with no skill involved
you have unlimited specials with little to no delay before refire
tisk tisk
limited characters maybe  or so
transformations make you weakerwhy why would they do that
game is  completed in one night
absolutely no replay value at all
i sold the game first chance i got
when you near the end you hope the game finishes soon because it is soo badypro
graphics look pretty goodi know you were expecting more pros but honestly this game is terribleso like where to beginbattles are amazingly annoying
the fight system is the dumbest button mashing setup ive ever seen
i actually tested it outtake a randomn battle put it on normal and set the controller on the ground
usein your toes hit the  main buttins out of  times ide win
not too mention the character set upswth
you only get one special per battle
in my opinion if you want a good gamego pick up budukai tenkachi  its hands down the best dbz game ever made
if you wanna compare em its easy
on bt you can cutom your chars upgrade skills use multiple special moves the animation is still better even though its on an older system and to top it all off theres more chars and lvlsnow how does that make sense
this game was like a step backwards from that onei bought this game trying to get into a good fighting game not only is it the worst fighting game ever it may be one of the worst games i have ever played
a lot of people like to say that games cheat but this one really does
the fighting system is completely unfair and unbalanced
and your cpu opponents have a way of magically restoring most of their health when they are about to be defeated
this game personally forever ruined dbz for me
i cant even watch it because i hate this game so much
even my girlfriend and avid dbz lover says this game is crap
dont buy itas a long standing owner of xboxes the original and now a  i was pretty excited to see a dbz game on an xbox finally
ive played budokai on the psp and some tenkaichi on the psthis game plays like a ported copy of the psp game with better cutscenes
as was mentioned in some of the other reviews the game stops at the end of the cell saga
i cant even think of any other dbz games that do that
the transformations are a bare minimum with goku being the only character i found with more than one kaioken and ssjlong story short tenkaichi  on the ps was twice as good as this game and thats been out for years
the only way you should even consider buying this game is if youre a dbz fan thats never played a dbz video game and you dont have access to a ps or   the only thing this game has over any other dbz game even the psp versions is decent voiceovers and cutscenessurprise surprise
another flawed paradox product
as i half expected the program would not install andor run property
are they incapable of selling a product that works out of the box
this seems to be a pattern for themnot recommendedjust ordered this game and cannot play it
i read great reviews that it was one of the scariest adventure games of all time
according to what ive read it will not play on a computer with intelafter months spending an afternoon here and there of trying to get this game to work ive given up
i never got to play it
i simply couldnt get it to work with my systemits awfully fussy about connecting to the internet although it doesnt allow you any ability to change the connection settings such as manually configuring proxy settings
but you are required to connect to the internet to play even if you just want to play solo
this is the way the game ensures that its a legit copy as well as downloads patches
but since i was never able to connect to the internet my money was wasted and amazon doesnt give refunds on softwarecutesy graphics dumped on an ai that is several steps beyond totally awfulonly for those that are mesmerized by flashing lights and loud noisesprogrammed by goofs with with juvenile attitude that every german weapon was far superior to all othersi am glad i only paid  for it
after  minutes of play i tossed in the trash
you cant adjust the camera more than  in any direction
therefore you cant see where you are going
you start the game in battle you cant see where you are headed so you have to run around hopen you can figure out what you are don dont buy this gameplayed the game for  minutes
i understand its a disney game but still
cannot stand that  dimensional interface
either do a birds eye d view or a full d view dont do a  d view its very cheap to do that aka demon stone and ps lord of the rings games
the game is a kids game it almost looks like a mario brothers game but without the fun
yes the graphics are good but what is the point if the game sucks
you cant try to squeeze a movie into a game without working on the game itselfi waited for some time for this game to be released
i had thought it would be like the phoenix wright games
far from it
you just click and click and follow along with it
i finished the first case but just lost interest in itdoubt if i will do the next  casesi was so excited for mario kart for the wii
i preordered the game and an extra wheel for my wife the game did not disappoint  its a blast  the wheel however is a total waste its soooo hard to use you cant get nearly the right control out of it  the best way to play this game is with the remote and the nunchuck
dont waste your money on this silly piece of plasticnot worth the learning curve the nunchuckwiimote is a better control mechanism worst  dollars i ever spentdont waste your money you will just end up using the nunchuck or a classic controler in the end and more over dont waste your money on the new mario cart just keep or get one of the older ones its just recycled maps with new controls that arent that good anywaysthe premise of the game is that a pair of kids inherits a toy shop and they have to build it up and make big profits within a certain amount of time or they wont be able to keep itthis sounds like it has potential for fun
unfortunately it really doesnt work out that waythe game centers on the making and selling of toys with an occasional excursion into other parts of town to talk to people
in practice nearly all of your attention has to go toward the creation of the toysthe character making the toys has a skill rating that represents his ability to create any given toy
this skill rating has several effects
it determines your odds of successfully making a toy it determines how much time it takes to make the toy and at high levels it can cause you to make toys  or  or more at a time instead of just onebyone
eventually after youve gained a certain number of skill points in making a toy it will unlock other toys though in some cases you have to talk to people in town instead to learn a new toythe creation of toys is also a sort of minigame
its not much of one but theres a small diagram on the screen which positions pictures of four different tools to correspond to positions on the direction pad of the ds
its always the same tools in the same positions
while the character is making toys hell get thought bubbles thinking about the tools he needs
if you correctly push the direction corresponding to the tool hes thinking about hell advance very slightly in the process and save some time
if you push the wrong direction hell fail at making the toy completely
if you dont push anything hell just go along attempting to make toys but doing it more slowly than if he had helpon the other hand you have to sell toys
you really dont get to be very involved in this process however
you can visit a real estate agent to ask to buy a bigger shop when you have enough money
you can buy the display cases and decide which toys go into which case and set the prices
you can also open and close the store
everything else is an automated process of people from town coming in wandering around on their own and visiting the cash registerthe biggest problem is that the game is completely out of balance
what tends to happen is that you end up selling toys much faster than they can be created
really what this game ultimately tends to come down to if you want to do well is spending tremendous amounts of time staring at the thought bubbles of the tools while your little character is trying to make toys to help him go as fast as possibleso most of your time you see a picture of a tool and you try to push the corresponding position on the direction pad as quickly as possible
thats pretty much the gamethe really disappointing thing is that it had some potential
you get to make decisions about which toys to make and whether you want to focus on a few toys in the interest of being able to make them as fast as possible or keep working your way up to more complicated toys larger profit margins and allows you to have a variety of things in the store to please more customers
if they hadnt made you actually sit and go through the process of making every individual toy it could have been a little bit like a richer version of the old lemonade stand gameas it is i really dont recommend it unless what you really want is a game that requires virtually no real thought or planning the vast majority of the time that youre playingthis game falls short of what you expect
even when you make the toys the stupid little character will fail and you will lose the money used to buy the materials
i played this game for  minutes and it went right onto ebay
stupid game
may be good for younger players but i am a  year old gamer
i love games like cake mania mah jong word jong and the sims so i thought this would be a good addition
i was wrongi thought the idea of this game sounded funtaking over a toy store and building the business back up
looked on here after i tried it out to find out if other people found it to be as boring as i did shame on me for buying without reading the reviews
i bought this for  yesterday and i plan to excange it today at our local game store
thank god they give you  days to return used games
this game had a lot of instructions
basically  you are taking over your grandfathers toy store and building it back up from scratch
you are playing as a brothersister team
the sister runs the store while the brother stays home and makes the toys which consists of using the arrow keys to use  different tools
both characters are supposed to chat with people around town for advice or just to make friends with the locals
the concept has promisebut the game is very poorly executed
my  year old daughter tried the game and after  minutes said yeh im not liking this game
so back it goesi bought this game at the store because i thought it looked fun
the front cover is well done and really draws you right in
i was also expecting something like mysims or maybe animal crossing except a business settingthe graphics are really bad
i mean it looks like they didnt even finish it
the grass looks weird and the camera view moves on its own
it is even hard to move the people
mostly you see the top of their heads
you can go talking to people but they say stupid things to you like such nice weather
that is it
nothingdid i say the graphics are terrible
i mean when you buy a game you expect it to have good graphics
this looks like they didnt even work on it
they probably know how terrible this game is how bad the graphics are how there is no point to it at all
a game gone wrong that they have to sell because they will lose out on money if they dontthis game is totally boring
from the casing youd think its gonna be a fun game about assembling toys and such but its actually a boring game
i played it like once and never played it againi did not enjoy this gamecouldnt figure out what to do and didnt play with it thought it was more of a time management kind of gamei got this in a wii bundle
i only like the tennis game
i suggest wii sport resort if anythingyou have to unlock one game at  a time to play all of them
you cant just choose one
the pool table one comes with no instructions so now im stuck on this one and cant get the rest unlock so it was a waste of moneydid not enjoy this at all
even first time playing these games was not enjoyable
had to force myself to keep playing to say that i at least tried every game on the cd before i traded it in at gamestopcharacters here have an awful mean demeanor thats not appropriate of good sportsmanship for kids to watchvirtual tennis  is easier to play and has video game mode that you can hit a ball against a colorful wallwe rented this game to see if it was something wed like to buy and boy am i glad it only cost me  at blockbuster
the game play in this stinker is stupid repetitive and way too hardwe started with all four of us playing kids age    and ended up with just me trying to score high enough on the games to get enough tickets to buy enough prizes to move onthis game takes literally hours to move onto the next section and when you do  guess what  you get the same crap that you had in the last area but repackaged as different games
how you can say that the games are different when they play the same the goal is the same and the motions are the same is beyond me  my elbow hurt like crazy the next dayi also didnt like was the last area we were able to unlock  some kind of strange halloweenhaunted house themed area that was downright creepy
we finally had to shut it off because the games and characters were scaring my  year old
my  yr old who has played alot of different video games including some of the shootemup style was also kind of creeped out by itok lets sum up you have a game that not only does the game play suck but also scares the age group you are trying desperately to appeal to so that mom  dad will spend money
genius marketingnot easy to play
not family friendly
not funi rented this thinking it would be as good as the carnival games wonderworld is from the same publisher and the case had similar artwork
the graphics were disappointing the cover makes it look like its funi played this game with my younger sister who is about  and even she thought it got boring and the gameplay was a little confusing
we played this game for about  or  minutes and decided to watch a movie instead
usually when we rent a game we play for hoursthe shooting gallery was confusing because on one level we couldnt find the last bottle
the other minigames are a little bland
and there is one minigame where a hoop is on a wire which is a weird game if you think about it another reviewer mentions itthis game sucks pure and simple
i bought it because of the package  the graphics and the statements
we brought it home loaded it into the wii and watchedthats all you do in the first part of the park  watch the games as you get defeated
the sad thing is that you need to win tickets in order to open up other parts of the park
and in my situation we tried and tried but failed to win those tickets on these godawful games
my grandkids were so frustrated that they were ready to go play outside
i even tried my hand at the games and they were all terribleneedless to say we couldnt get past the first section
i did look in the internet for cheat codes to get  into each section but i couldnt find any
so this videogame sits on the back of the shelf collecting dust
and thats where it will staymy family would rather play carnival or thrillville
two other amusement park games for the family
and in the case of thrillville  one of the bestso for buyers who might think of purchasing wonderworld i have a few words of advice  dont waste your moneywonderworld amusement park is the single most disappointing game that i have played on mywiiso far and i didnt have high expectations to begin with
i have had fun withcarnival gamesbefore and was just looking for something silly and fun i could play with my wife when we werent in the mood for something more involvingunfortunately although it is listed as  players that isnt quite true
only the singleplayer story mode gives you access to the entire thirty games available
the coop stage only lets you play five games about two of which are worth playing more than once
there is a simple shooting gallery nothing moving though a frogfishing game whackamole an incredibly dull game where you move a hoop along a cord and one more that was so boring i cant even remember itas the singleplayer you can spend time unlocking the rest of the games which are mainly variations on the original five games
for instance whackaghost instead of whackamole but odds are you arent going to want to waste the time
better to spend you time and money on something more entertainingthis item didnt work as its for a different region and returning it will cost me more than its price so i didnt return itthere is a bad game which you dont enjoy and there is a game that your kid keeps nagging on you to play it because the controls are very difficult for him and you end up cursing at the game makers yourself because of how terrible the controls is
and then you take a deep breathe try to play calm do the right thing and for no reason walle is stuck and cant move in any directionload of crap licensed under the name of wallenotice the game is old and i had it for a while but i couldnt resist writing this review
least i can doi buy this and it does not do good the joystick are good but the dpad is not good and it is mad out of cheap stuff and its made in china and you know anything that comes from china is no good at all
dont buy this save your money
dont say i did not tell you that
and i dont under stand that way is avery one eles on this site are giving this a  or a  star and it should be only  or  at the most bad stuff
buyer bewearnot a sony brand controller   item no as described  entire controller was messed up 
controller would not register with the playstation
not a recommended purchase for replacement controllersmade of nothing easily worn down easily broken
you should go ahead and spend a few bucks more for something that will last
if you are lucky and the controller even works out of package well then you will literally be very very lucky if you get more than a few hours game play with it before it failsit is a really bad nock off of a wii charging station it does not work at all
i have gotten two of them thinking the frist one was just broken and nope it is just a piece of crap
just say no and get your self a real wii charging station yes it will cost you more but in the end the cost will be good cus
you wont have to deal with the head ack that is this stupid thingcomes with plugfor other than wall outleti thoght it would have a normal wall plug like my old one had
i dont see myself using thisfor meit was a waste of moneyhad since decnever got it to workcomplete waste of moneyi am on my nd set from this seller
the st set didnt work and kept powering off and back on
the nd set worked for about  days and i unplugged to move it and since it hasnt powered on
they did ship it very quickly but other than that not worth the money or time i spenti have now been through  wii charger docks
if you look at the reviews for most of these wii docks you will see that almost all them have many bad reviews
these things dont last more than a year and the batteries that usually come with them dont last more than  months
even the name brand ones like energizer do not make it for the long haul
instead i purchased an energizer aa rechargeable battery kit that came with  rechargeable aa batteries
the battery kit cost less than most of the charger docks as i only paid about  here on amazon
i am also purchasing extra rechargeable aa batteries for a few dollars so that i always have a set ready and charged when my kids need them
these batteries last much longer than the standard wii controller batteries that come with these charger docks and you can use them for other things around the house other than wii controllers as well
now i just use the rechargeable batteries for the wii controllers rather than continuing to buy these not so great charger docks and batteries
when the rechargables run out of juice i simply recharge in the wall outlet and a few hours later they are ready to go
plus the rechargeable kits rate much higher in customer reviews than do these charger docks and wii batteriesthis thing sucks
i plug it into the wii then i put the wii reomte on it with the charger in it the light showing its charging turns on and then turns off a second later
i tried it about  times and it kept doing the same thing over and over
dpnt waste your money on this
the only reasoni bought it was because it cheap but found out its extremely cheap qualtiy too
if your thinking about getting a wii remote charger just try getting a bit more expensive one because it will probably workthe save function completely ruins this game
you play for hours quit the game come back and you are exactly where you started
terrible frustating stupid
the game is not worth purchasingjust another game edios  ruined
missions are difficult to work within some ridiculous short time frame making this game a joke
you cannot save your gamebecause those eidos dummies never thought gamers have little desire playing the same old garbage over and over again
had to quit playing in the middlegood thing i bought this on clearance so im only out a few bucks
dont bother with this one a sure disappointmenti often judge the quality of the video game by the size of the file
in my purchase of this game who can complain too much for  it said gig for the dl so i figured the texture maps were pretty significant
amazon should correct the page data the download is only gig which makes it a pretty run of the mill download
ill come back and update this after a little game playok ive come back to edit this on gameplay
jerky movement enemy are grey stick figures targeting is for crap
i would say this game is worth about  the  i paid for it
move on buy something elseyes you read that title right
if you are still using windows xp like a majority of pc gamers are then you can not play this game
i actually purchased this game got it home and before i got it out of the box i luckily noticed that it said windows vista on the box
i promptly returned it for a refundi repeat no windows xp support be warnedwouldnt work for my windows   bit for some reason and customer support for this company is nonexistent
computer specs far exceed the recommended
waste of money in my book too bad though i looked forward to playing thisthis seems to be a running theme with me a pc games sometimes they work and some times they dont
i was really doubtful in getting this game since i never heard of it before but it was on sale so i figured what the heck try it out
well cant try it
before i get assaulted by haters i give this game that i bought on amazon  star because i cannot play it
now some of you are gonna be like  that not fair but i am grading this game that is on amazon and it does not work so it get one star
also i have a i gbs or ram and nvidia  gb graphics card so i meet the requirementsi do enjoy fps shooter games however some programmers seem to make repeated mistakes when designing the game play  most notably not being able to save your progress
the game gives you the impression that you can save your progress part way through a mission
but if you die during that mission any reload you do even if you think you saved your progress starts you back at the checkpoint at the start of the mission
it becomes really tedious to have to rerun the same mission over and over and over and over and over each time you die
after a while i became discouraged with not being able to complete a mission and finally gave up
the alternatives are to find a hack to invoke god mode or set the skill level on easy
neither appeal to methough the scenery is interesting it is just that scenery
few if any of the buildings can be entered and explored buildings are just obstacles to block fire and run around
i havent found a door yet that i can openthe game isnt worth my time to complete
uninstallgame has major issues on wini have tried  times to work around bugs and controls with little successgame will freezeunable to save if i get thru a portion without troublethis game installed through the steam client and as such a pitathe provided key code was not recognized by steam so im forced to go through the slow and likely useless steam support
the provided code is labeled specifically as the steam registration codeno response yet from steam so this game might well be returned to amazon as defectiveregardless of how good a game is supposed to be it isnt much good if you cant even install it or it proves to take way too much time and hassle to do sothe included additional mission pack key code was not recognized by steam eitheruselessthe switch over between the first games and this one from the original developers pandemic studios to this games developers sandblast games did this series no favors at all
loved the first two game to death so recently i bought this one but it is so bad i havent even completed all of the game yet
the humor is just terrible and the gameplay is bad and the story is stupid and lacks all of the humorous components is predecessors thrived onsold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a gameonly package
it is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band with aerosmith songs comprising approximately  of the soundtrack while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for aerosmith
the single player career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several realworldinspired venues interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past the good
guitar hero aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices
the next entry guitar hero world tour would introduce other roles to create a full band experience
the bad being shorter and easier than the previous guitar hero titles and difficult to justify its price point furthermore the games ultimate enjoyment rested on the players appreciation for the music of aerosmithi have the guitar and drums but it seems that the game did not detect them well because every time you try to touch it descordinan buttonsthough i dont own this game when metallica guitar hero is released it will completely destroy this game
oh wait aerosmith has been around longer than metallica but for true metallica fans we know where the real talent isthis is not an amazingor a crazyor a jaded gameit has none of those songsone would expect these songs to be obligatory in an aerosmith gameonly fillers on this mediocre gamethis game is very similar to guitar hero iii which i lovei just dont feel like aerosmith is guitar hero friendly
it just got boring for me to play
someone else already said everything i wanted to say
the songs get boring and some of them are ridiculous
a song featuring run dmc
what the hellwell whatever
its definitely not worth the  i paid for it and the controller
ah the controller here at least an improvement
the controller is modified though it doesnt look itfrom the wireless one from gh iii
it has the same detachable neck but it doesnt slide away from the neck
i played all the way through the game tonight with the controller and never once did i have the problem of the controller not reading the button i was holding
and they also fixed the strum bar which i found oversensitive on the previous gamemy verdict rent it
i hoped for some redeeming value in the bonus songs but theyre all aerosmith or joe perrys solo work
for shamei never cared much for aerosmith take it as you will that is my opinion but i always rather liked guitar hero
however this one lets down is near every way possible
even when played on mute just to achievement hunt it didnt seem worth it it just wasnt up to par
the only people who would like this are did hard aerosmith fansi had some time to kill after finishing the excellent mask of the betrayer and while waiting for fallout  to come out so i thought id take mass effect for a spinall i can say is buhbye fifty bucks
i played the game for a couple of hours or so then finally gave up in boredom and frustrationunlike most rpgs today in which you control most of the game functions and character actions with the mouse this game is almost totally controlled by keystrokes
this is a step backwards in technology of about ten years in my opinion and slows things down incredibly
further it requires memorizing all the appropriate key functions like stepping back in time from windows to msdosthe character inventory system is clunky and counterintuitive and very cumbersome to manipulateworse yet you cant exit cutmovie scenes to reenter gameplay so if youre having to repeat an action from a save you have to sit through these looooong cut scenes repeatedlynot ready for prime time folks
save your bucksi refuse to pay for any software that can only be installed three times without long distance calling some outsourced tech support lackey at my expense no less
i dont plan on ever begging someone to let me install a game i paid money for  or  years down the line
dont buy games with installation limits you end up the loser when such schemes are usedlisten when people say this drm is a problem and a pain
right now i have a fifty dollar paper weight
i wanted to play this game it looked great for xbox but it causes to many system problems even on a very powerful gaming computer
i went from trying to play mass effect which caused several software conflicts and system crashes to going back to icewind dale a game made in early  without codes and protection
now i must admit i will not buy any product with drm or anything like it
now i will wait till the hacker and piraters fix it and then if i want it ill play it
ive only felt the need to have one hacked game because i didnt think it would be good then i bought the expansion packs which still made the company some money
bottom line is this program only effects legit buyers making them get pirated versions
only get this for xbox if you own onethey need to eliminate the securom
i purchased mass effect as a digital download hoping that the faulty disc protection software would not be on that version however it seems the securom is on all versions
now every time i log on to play its hit or miss sometimes an error pops up stating a required security module could not be activated and sometimes it works
its like pulling a handle on a slot machine to see if securom will allow you play or not
ridiculous for a game i spent  on
theres a whole thread about this issue on the official forums
dont have this issue with other games that use less intrusive copy protection methodsthis game could have and should have been one of the great rpgs of pc gaming
but due to the instability of the game it is and will be remembered as just another buggy mess of modern games
i have done all i can do to get this game to run well and even at a resolution of  x  which is what most who can run it do run it atforget the fact that at this rez it looks like a  yr old game  it still crashes and freezes
and now after all this time bioware says they are creating a patch
just glad i waited for the  price tag before purchasing this messi was craving for a scifi rpg and mass effect seemed like a great game until i learned of the horrible drm system that it incorporatesyes this singleplayer game uses a draconian copy protection system where you need to be connected to the internet in order to activate
all you get is  activations before having to call ea tech support and beg for an extra one
so even though you are paying for it you dont actually own your copy of the game
this is even worse than starforce
at least with starforce i could install and play the game without being connected to the internetbasically it means that you can not install the game when you want or where you want
while pirates enjoy a painless gaming experience all fair usage rights are removed from us paying customers
the whole online activation process is very inconvenient especially in the future when the activation servers will go down or when you will want to install the game on a computer thats not connected to the internet
i guess this is how ea likes to thank their paying customersoppose this oppression of our fair usage rights yes it sounds cheesy but obviously thats exactly what eas intentions are
vote with your wallet by avoiding this game
there are plenty of other games with minimal or no copy protection to choose fromi played a friends copy which he actually returned when he learned about the draconian drm and limited licensing and installsforget about buying a game like this
apparently its easy enough to pirate although i do not advocate it or do it
aside from being free the version you can download from a bittorrent site isnt crippled with horrendous drm
yep if youre honest you will not get what you pay for
if you steal it youll love it
keep in mind that bioware actually paid a lot for this drm that taints their game and doesnt even slow down piracy
wow
thats just plain sillyuntil software makers finally realize that punishing paying customers isnt a good business strategy bittorrent and pp sites will continue to thrive
the drm doesnt even slow down piracy
it just reeeeally irritates the honest folks who expect to own something they pay forits like buying a tv that will stop working if you move it around the room more than  times
oh and of course you cant sell the tv to anyone else
oh and you have to have an internet connection to get it to turn onevery time
oh and it may mess up your cable box dvd player and stereo if it thinks you are trying to repair itwake up bioware
you wont be getting any more money from me until you dobuyer beware  the product description does not describe some important aspects of the gamethis game requires an internet activation so if you have no internet connection you cant play
also you are limited to  activations  so effectively you are not buying and owning your game you are merely renting the gamethis game secretly installs copyprotection software called securom which can cause many problems for your computer some of which are when installing the game the user is not informed that securom is being installed
securom denies administrators full access to their pc and blocks the administrator from editing certain parts of the registry
securom can interfere with the operation of hardware specifically disc drives
securom can interfere with the proper operation of software
when the game is uninstalled securom is not uninstalled  it remains permanently on your computer
the manner in which securom runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware and many people do indeed consider securom to be malwarecurrently two class action lawsuits have been filed against electronic arts ea for their use of securomi just bought the game for pc and installed on a brandnew gaming rig that is definitely pumped up enough to run it using vista bit
when i select play all that happens is the error message mass effect has stopped working and must close
i cant even get the game to starti went online to google mutiple forums to see if i could figure out the problem
well perhaps if i was willing to waste literally days trying all kinds of possible things which most people say didnt work for them
apparently this or that occasionally works for a person
but obviously this game was in no condition to be released for the pc market as it standsso i am posting this review to warn other shoppers
please go online and decide for yourself before ordering this pc game
it appears that very few people have actually been able to get it to run at all and those that can complain of various quality issues not being able to save games etcyou can only install this thing  times and if you upgrade or reinstall your os it counts as one of those installs
this is insane i wont buy from ea againive been playing computer games since before zork on the apple e
ive played all of the great games including system shock  planescape torment and arx fatalis
i love playing a well made game but i have to say i will not play any game that requires an activation on line and a rootkit in my computer
when half life came out with steam i wrote them a nasty letter saying that i would never play another steam game and i havent
i also refused to buy bioshock for the same reason
i always purchased my games and never pirated any but i refuse to go along with this drm nonsense
a good game can stand on its own merits and people will continue to buy from the same company
i loved far cry and i loved the witcher
if the witcher sold over  copies without drm then they must be doing something right
maybe if the customers hurt these companies in the pocketbook by not buying their products they will get the messagedont care about malwarespyware paranoia
developers deserve to get paid for their work
however this product is just defective
do not waste your moneysupport corporations like ea that work to take away the rights and freedoms americans have enjoyed for nearly  decades or make a statement and fight for the liberty not only of yourself but of all subsequent generations as digital society is rapidly becoming the dominant force in the worldturn away from this and any product that employ draconian drmone dollarone votewell here i am again giving the one star middle finger to a game program i never got to run the same as the orange box and fear
  all this through the mail in one weekso here it is
no minimal system requirments listed
this one isnt even listed on the box or the manual
you have to have the internet to run this programthats not listed eitherim gonna install this on my new quad coreand i dont even know if it will runupdate  it crashes right after i click on playrunmaybe the graphics card i guessbut since i dont know which one is needed i guess ill have to do a searchbyedont buy anything with drm
its the companys way of tricking you into buying something with a very short shelf life not to mention how it effects your rights as the owner
i still play games that are over  years old
you will not be able to play this game in ten years time because the company may no longer exist and not have a support function that can issue you with a new license
this is a very sickening display of corporate greed and it is destroying the spirit of pc gaming
it has nothing at all to do with piracyi was going to buy this game as i like the graphics and stuff but when i saw the reviews and realized that ea was the one behind it i said forget it
the last ea ubisoftthe settlers games i bought had the stupid drm stuff which makes it seems like i didnt pay for my game given how i am allowed to use the game
i read that even thq dawn of war  has the same garbage on it and to think i was going to buy that game
thq you let me down for i have  of the other warhammers and i wont be buying your drm versionthe game is mine if i spend my money on it so why do i have to activate whats mine
i got issues after issues with the drm garbage
i read where someone i think from their company had the the nerve to compare the activation of their games to the same means of activating windows
are you serious
i dont need to keep putting windows cd in my cdrom for it to work
i activate it once and thats it i have it to use for lifeits funny how companies like ea who have decided to implement the drm garbage in their products and chose not to state in bold on the product package that the product has drm
you can only know that the game has drm when you buy it and install it or if you are fortunate enough to see reviews that point it out and if you buy it without knowing drm is there then you cant return the software after finding it out so you get stuck with it and they get away with your money
how fair is that to the consumerhow different are companies like ea from game pirates
you say you lose money when people do piracy and i agree and so you must protect yourselves
yet you do the same thing to the buyers under the current system
you put out games and dont put all the info about the game and then we have no way of getting back your money when you find that your product has this garbage and is messing up our computers
so the pirates stiffs you with piracy and you stiff us the consumerwhen they have this crappy drm stuff on the cds you cant make a backup copy to play with which the law legally allows you to do
you have to play with the original cd or it wont work
that is simply ripping off the consumer
the law allows the consumer to make  backup for private use of movies music games and data softwares so why are you undermining the law by preventing the consumer the right to have a working backup of their legally purchased products
in essence you are breaking the law for denying the consumer the right to do as the law permits
you are pretty much in a crafty manner forcing your will on the consumer
the last i heard when someone forces their will one someone else thats breaking the lawi spoke to one rep once about this drm stuff and he said that consoles use one cd so whats wrong if pc does the same
well if i wanted a console i would have bought one but i like when i dont have to keep putting a cd in my computer when i want to play a game
i have a large hard drive to keep the data for my conveniencewhats even worse is if you just ever accidently cause your game cd to get scratched in a critical place or if the summer heat changes the dye of the cd which does happen and it becomes unplayable then you better go buy another copy and they just love that
so in essence they implement measures that hustles the consumer but they hate when the pirates hustles them
and dont forget the fact that you had better have internet so that you can activate the game or it will not run  you will be stuck with itput the info on your packages that you have the drm software so that we dont waste our money on your products
it is ok in your eyes for the customers to lose their money but it isnt ok for you to lose your money how hypocriticali wont buy this game or any game from ea ubisoft thq or similar companies as long as they are putting softwares in their products that makes me a paying thief for thats what it is when i have to buy a product that i have no control overi have bought very few games over the last year because of this and i intend to keep it that way till things change if not i will keep my moneyi am a committed customer to activision atari amongst others who isnt hustling the consumer
if those companies start that drm or similar nonesence then i will stop buying their products likewisewhen i buy something its mine just as when you buy something its yours
you dont like people ripping you off so stop doing it to the customersi certainly hope folks responsible for making laws will require you to clearly state that you have stuff like drm in your products and what it means to have it so that the consumer can make sound decisions and stop getting hustled by these companies
we cant return the software so make it so we can know exactly whats in it so that we dont make the mistake of buying itthis is another overhyped game from ea that is all hype and drm
dont waste your moneyi purchased this game but have not played this game
its not that i havent tried
it just doesnt work
if anyone complains that i have given this game  star without playing it tough s
it got more then it deserves  way more
between the drm which is an awful idea and this its over the topim  hours into attempting to install it and it still fails
its all over the internet now
the game shipped with a faulty installer
bioware has provided instructions on how to install it manually from the dvd
dont get your hopes up
about  of the files in the myriad of rar files come up corrupt as you unpack them
you have to go in and verify and extract them manually
after all of that no go
it launches and stops with a missng file message
its a mess effectif bioware and ea had spent as much time on quality control as they spent in implementing drm im sure everything would have been fine
thanks a bunch guys
you have managed to piss off a cash paying customer
i wont be purchasing anything else from you again
no wonder the  of games being pirated keeps geting higher
the honest buyer is being screwed royally and is just giving up
as we leave the  of piracy gets higher
when we are gone only the pirates will remain and your statistics will be there is some good news
word of mouth on this bad baby has spread fast
its already being heavilly discounted and its not even a week old
just remember it may be getting cheaper but its for a reason
bad is badi hate to have to say it but there are major problems with this game and i am not referring to the drm silliness
my own copy wont play after the initial screen and that was afterlt installing the latest patch weirdly enough i could get it started before the patch
prior to that the game forums have tons of complaints about multiple ingame crashes and they have not gotten any less with the patch
while some people are reporting no problems so many are that it suggests something fundamental is wrong
as much of a fan of bioware and rpg games as i am i strongly urge you to wait a couple of months before trying this one outthis is a steam game and i never could get it to work
i still dont knowwhy
i play all kinds of other games at steam etc but try as i may and askingfor steams help etc nothing gets it working for me
and steam doesntreally care if you cant
i asked for tech help at steam and got suggestionswhich i followedfromsteam but nothing worked and basically they saidtoo bad for you
and thatwas it
they dont promise that the game will work
so its on me i guesshere is my review on far cry   it has the same restrictive drm structure and this game is just as much a paperweight in a few years
this is a review of the product
not the game only but the product itself listed abovethe product installs a great game
that being said it also installs spywaremalware onto my computer
this is the same type of software that i have paid programs to remove for years
why would a user want to install it deliberately onto their machineif you buy this product know that one day it will cease to work
i dont care if it is  months from now or  years from now
you are not buying an actual product you are renting it until you change your computer a total of  times
considering i have  computers on my network alone and i use at least  of those as gaming rigs i know this would be relatively quick for me
either way you will most likely not be able to dig this out of the closet in  years and nostalgically play
you are buying a self destructing productthe drm on this game does not do anything to limit piracy as the company says
spore itself was already downloaded drm free k someodd times before the game was even released
securom is not a drm scheme as it does nothing to prevent piracy
it does everything to limit the value of the product to the legit customer and prevent them from selling it to a second party
this has been proven an illegal practice in multiple lawsuits throughout the years however they continue to install the software on end users computers without their consenti am not a pirate
if i was a pirate i would probably already be happily playing this game instead of being here writing this
again no pirates need to complain about drm
they are usually busy playing the game free this game uses the same horrible drm scheme that is found on bioshock far cry  crysis warhead spore dead space sacred  and red alert  i refuse to purchase a game that requires me to ask permission to install the game
there are several games that i own that i have had to install more than five times for various reasons
that is why i refuse to purchase a game that limits the number of times i can install the game let alone a drm program like securom that could be considered a trojen horseas a side note this drm method does nothing to stop piracy
all of these games were pirated within hours of their release and in the case of some like spore even before their release with the exceptions of sacred  and red alert  which have not been released yet however the developers confirmed that they would use the securom activation drm scheme
the only thing this drm does do is prevent this game from entering the used game marketinstall went okayclick to play configuration tool crashes over and over  badfigure out a way around configuration tool by starting the game through a ndary launcher inbeded in the program files
successfully launched skipping the configuration toolso that was frustratinggameplay  badfirst issue crashes caused by conversations with npcs which occurred from the start of the game and plagued it until the end when it first happen windows gave a solution of a mass effect  patch  which was easy enough to download and install but didnt solve the issue  its completely random when it happens sometimes a npc will trigger it sometimes not
lol it literally says file not found and crashes restart and presto it works very random but must of restarted me  times
save before each and every npc you talk to  to limit annoyancecover system made of fail  pulls you into cover just by walking next to something awkward and bad anglesitem cap of  fail blinks if your already allowing me to carry around items why the heck is there a cap at all
and sorting the inventory out was a pain
games in general need to stop adding caps like this ff was great and you could hold  of everythingactual fightinggameplay a form of torture clunky clunky clunky  dont bother with cover its uselessland rover  giggity whoever thought it was a good idea or even fun needs ran over by it
its like they never took the time to explore their own maps with it getting stuck going up a hill and falling back down is not fun
which brings me to another point whoever designed their map levels needs to lay off the obsessive amount of mountains on every planet
it was incredibly unfun having to explore with the rover when it bounces around like a weightless ragdoll on every little bump and dont have enough power to climb a hillelevators  horrible youll spend alot of time just tapping your foot waiting on the obnoxiously long elevator rides that are used everywhere in the gameits actually a thank god moment when you run into a short elevator ride in the game yeah its that bad  minutes stuck in a elevator staring at the screen is unacceptable especially considering they are so frequentsniper rifle wobble  shepard on some kind of drug
is heshe not a trained soldier
why cant he hold it still
even when you get the ability to add   weapon stability upgrades its shake is pretty bad  ill never understand what was going through their head on this one
as a amateur hunter i dont have any issue with shaking my gun like im hopped up on sugar pops or worststory  wasnt badi think i might of liked it better than me at least the end bad guy wasnt a ridiculous human reaper oh noes
 why they would even mechanically choose such a shape just shows lack of creativity
which truth be told this series lacks in spadesgenerally clunkyness of the game and crash frustrations ruin any immersiontake note my machine far surpasses its recommended system requirements by a tremendous lengthit did some things better than mefor example every star system you go to has something to do in it
but that is cut asunder by the horrible land rover you get to explore the planets withno ammo was a cool idea only overheatingability to sell stuff for credits  this is good but ultimately useless as there is very little worth buying and the  item cap drove me insane
 i ended with  max useless creditsoverall if i would of played this before me i wouldnt of bought me cus the genre would be dead to me
me is at least playable
this is borderline unplayable i managed to get through it by jamming to music in the background and reminding myself of the bigger picture memeas others mention this has nasty activation drm
ive been waiting well over a year to buy it but obviously skipped it because of thatluckily theres a decent alternativerent it or buy it for the   okay not ideal
for a variety of reasons id rather play it on pc but ive just rented it on the  and it plays fine from what ive seen so far
just dont support products that tie your game to a particular system or install through activationany fun this game could have had is instantly destroyed by the shaky cam enforced third person viewpoint where one third of your viewscreen screen is constantly blocked by the main characters back
the lack of a first person perspectivegetting rid of the nausea inducing wobble cam shows this game to be pure consolituspc gamers dont support bioware theyre just a cheap console gaming company nowadays evidenced by the fact they refused to put a first person perspective option into the pc portif bioware release a future patch that offers a first person perspective ill reedit this review but until then ill tell every pc gamer in sight to avoid this console port like the plaguethis is the second game i have purchased with steam online install and i hate it
both games have the valve logo so i should have known
it would have been nice to know before i spent  bucks
why include this feature is the
unless you plan to play online save your moneydont purchase this controller if you are on the latest ps firmware update this controllers peddles are blocked because of the ps firmware update that is detecting illegal controllers and this is one of themi received the item with great enthusiasm due to the good reviews above
however as i opened the box not the one from amazon but the actual thrustmaster box i realized there were small plastic pieces laying around
i realized the wheel was poorly packaged and therefore there was a crack on the plastic with a hole above it
not big deal really yes it was broken but i wouldnt return it just for that
however after i installed the drivers i realized on the windows test screen that the brake pedal is completely dead
i did my best around reinstalling drivers looking for updates for drivers nothing changed of course it wouldnt the drivers were just right the first timethen to top it off  out of the  racing games that i tried the wheel on didnt work right away
in both need for speeds the wheel was working fine through the menus but not in the actual race
so while im sure i couldve found a solution with some research i decided to repack the wheel and send it for a exchange due to the defective pedal and broken steering wheel plasticso yeah ill update once i receive the new one however having a  broken product due to poor packaging defective item and not completely compatible even with good driver installationupdate pretty much covers everysingle thing that could go wrong with a product from the customer sidethe game is fp
save your ten bucksthat said the game itself hasnt really aged well
the mechanics of the classes are derived from the quake days and the limitations showbiggest example is the soldier
now the soldier relies heavily on a move called the rocket jump where you basically fire a rocket at your feet and then use the energy to fly in the air towards your enemywithout the rocket jump the soldier is lousyhowever the rocket jump is also very hard to get right
it also does damage to you
it relies on what amounts to a bug in the original quakes physics engineother games have done it better
in particular firefall a game that is still in beta has the assault class which fires rockets just like the soldier
he has a rocket pack
and several movement boosting abilities
it works out quite well
also the jetpack class in warhammer space marine does it betterbeyond that death comes to quickly in this game
it quickly becomes stupid for thattf tried to implement a coop horde mode recently but it was terriblenow its filled mainly with novelty items
but for the core game itself it hasnt kept upthis game is the worst thing ive ever played
cs awesome
the original halflife awesome
the original team fortress or whatever it was called awesome
all those games had extreme depth to them
this game has no depth what so ever
i just dont understand how valve could have lost their minds and made this junk
this game just lacks any kind of strategy
you run out and shoot then die
wait  seconds and repeat
its just as stupid as thati purchased this game brand new and yet steam still said it was regestered to another computer
what the thats about itit requires broadband and i didnt know itit wasnt listed as needed
anyway to their defense they did list the system requirementsjust not broadband
now i  cant run itso thats thatnow i loved the sims  on pc while it lasted which is why i rated it  stars for fun my pc meets the required specs
i played it on a modern laptop for a few months till it kept on crashing create a family would not load half the cheats dont work and the families i spent hours on in the neighborhood i created from scratch and named after my home town all gone
in the summer of  i had to reformat cause of loss of internet and in march of  i had to reformat cause of corruption of my main local c drive
turns out it was securom it is what developers put in a game to prevent piracy but it does not stop piracy sure it might prevent a few inexperienced users from uploading the game cause securom intercepts the ripping of the cd but anyone can download and install it
i did not pirate it i had the actual cd
i never did anything foolish and never got a critical virus excluding securom or anything like that
i decided to make my main c drive wiped out there was an option to completely delete it using the recovery cd and reinstalled my computer runs much better without the game installedthats  down the drain
when will i learn
i really i mean really loved the sims  games
so when i had my computer built i just knew it was game on
yeahright
i was like one of the first anxious customers and bought the gamepreordered it and it was all good
but not so much with my new computer windows  blah blah
so i thought that id buy all combo packs
call me mcfly
because i just didnt get it  i loaded the game but cant launch it
so all of the discs of s are now going into the garbage
and as ive stated b i hate sims 
i will only buy sims  after i see  reviews and  have to be saying it is like sims i am not hating the game even though i gave it  stars
i gave it the  stars because on my system running windows  i could not get the serial number registered which is required to play the game
as far as shipping amazon was prompt
they were helpful in the return but did not give me my money back
fortunately i did not open ikea home stuff
but disappointed in amazon on this purchasei loved this game until i found out it was the reason my computer is now having issues
during installation it installs a hidden program called securom a bad excuse for copyprotection which will cause numerous conflicts in your computer
my antivirus software now randomly shuts off and ive had numerous other issuesi will never buy another electronic arts game for my computernot worth the downloadive downloaded the game  times and still it wont install correctlyi finally gave in and just bought the diski loved the original sim city and i thought sim city  was probably one of the best games for the pc ever i also had sim city  which is where the buggy interface started detracting from the gameplay and i had sim city  back when it originally came out and the game was basically unplayable
i had hoped after many years without thinking about it that theyd have fixed the game but they haventsim city  deluxe is too buggy to play i had it on for just an hour or so and the game just closed no warning no opportunity to save even during play setting up roads and water pipes arent fun because things just dont work like they should to get roads and highways to connect like you want is a real pain this is a game its supposed to be fun dont tell me these roads dont fit together just make them fit the same with rewards and special items like the marina it takes forever to find a suitable spot to place these things once again let me place them and let the game deal with whatever is has to to make them fitworse then the play options was the setting up of the game it takes  discs to install  the second disc however was badblank my computers couldnt see any data on the disc and the install wouldnt complete i had to borrow the nd disc from someone else to complete the install if i didnt know someone with it id be out of luckeverything about this box is annoying like this avoid it this isnt the sim city you remember
also laptop users fyi the outside of the box says that laptop video cards even if they meet the  mb memory requirement are not supported they may work they may not and if they dont the publisher doesnt want to hear about it so dont waste your money or time if you planned to use this on a laptopdoes not work with windows does not work with windows does not work with windows i wasted my money dont waste yours march  new simcity game to be released for pcyou can preorder it nowthe rtype series have always been funso i have never hesitated to purchase before reading about their reviewsand sorry to say i was so disappointed in this debacle of a game
who in their right mind took the most beloved space shooter and use that games name to destroy its reputation
i also enjoy strategy games but this is not even a good strategy game
it was frustrating confusing and boring to say the least
rent before buyingi grew up plugging quarters into rtype video game
i probably should have done more research into this psp game but once i got it i was dissapointed to say the least
the canned animations may look cool but the game play is about as sophisticated as games i have played on my first commodor  a hex grid turn by turn game played on a state of the art hand held console capable of d real time animation and interface
really
turn by turn hex game play
are you serious
i have had better games like this on a cpu driven computer
i deserve this for not checking into it further
oh well  bucks plus shipping that i will never recoveri tried to rent this game before buying but it was always checked out from the stores
i happened to find it on sale and decided to go ahead and buy iti wanted to like this game after all of the reviews i read about it that said adults would love it too but this had to simply be the most unfun game that i have ever played
maybe kids find some type of enjoyment in this but this game is definitely not for adultsthe concept sounded fun but the blob is difficult to control and difficult to make jump to places you want to paint
after you discover mixing colors and finding new prints to paint the buildingsthats pretty much all there is to the game
how long can you really paint the same buildings over and over again and have it still be fun or interesting
the save issues make the game less fun to play as welli sold my copy to gamestop and got another game after only  weeksthis game is definitely not worth buying for adults no matter the pricea different sort of gameinteresting but thats about all
not really interested in climbing buildings but the biggest dislike was the fact that there were no checkpoints where one would naturally assume there would be at least one
in fact i quit this game in disgust before i ever found the first checkpoint or save after going back to the start of the game numerous timesthe controls for this game are so broken doing simple things like jumping becomes a hassle
the story is not much better either
not funny at all like the other games
i would not recommend this game to anyone
even if you are a fan of larry do not buyits a very bad game its just bad
not even fans of the series will enjoy this turd its that bad i felt like i was going to throw up when i played i thought its just  dollars i was very wrong never buy this sorry excuse for a video game i think the developers were high when they made this game its that badyou cant invert the y axis when it comes to moving the camera with the right stick
game unplayableif you select to invert aim then yesit will invert while youre fighting
aimingbut looking around during the game sucks if youre a player that is completely attuned to inverting your camera controlsthis alone made me not want to play the gamehow long would it take for a developer to add an option to invert the camera control
im assuming not that long at all
if enough thought wasnt put into the game to allow this option that most gamers have become accustomed to then i will judge by that and assume not that much thought was put into the game in its entiretythis game starts out pretty good
and really really scary to say the least
but what killed it for me is the fighting sequences
also when the lung monster came out it just got really really redundant to kill him
and also there is not enough places to save you games
so if your tired or have something to do you either have to lose all your progress or continue to play for who knows how long till you come across one
needless to say i was very disappointed and upset because i was a fan of the prior games and i had big expectations for this game bieng on the ps platform big disappointmenti have to say that if there is one game in the past ten years that i believe was an absolute waste of time devoid of any entertainment value this is it
what didnt i like about this game
corniest storyline ever
i kept playing hoping it would get better but it actually got progressively worse
the ending
im not giving away specific spoilers but lets just say the last boss was freaky in a corny way and the end clip really got me poed
not a good way to end a game at all
the combat is clunky and cumbersome
also you are limited to carrying  rounds of ammo for your gun for no reason whatsoever
i angrily left behind ammo because i had too much
this forces you to do melee combat or run
with the crappy camera angles especially in hallways that translates to running
thats not fun
the enemies were poorly made
one in particular is a big man in the front with a woman body attached at the back
lmao
again the last enemy in particular was especially awful especially what happens when you beat him
repetition redux  you spend alot of time backtracking through areas youve already been through
id say of the  hours i spent playing  hours were spent exploring new areasi spent  dollars on this game and still think i got ripped off
avoid at all coststhis isnt a silent hill game
everything that made the originals great ie
 original meaningful monsters
 great atmosphere
 survival horror
 good story
and  horror
just arent heremost of the monsters are reused from silent hill  they were supposed to be based on james own person demons
so it didnt make any sense and was just lazy to have them in homecoming
only the boss fights had any meaning
but most of the game your fighting jamess demonsthe atmosphere is too dark and dull
it seems like they where trying to make the game scarier by making it so dark that you cant see but it doesnt workthis game is way to combatoriented for a survival horror game
it has this awful up and close combat system that wants you to fight almost every enemy
the older game wanted you to try to escape the enemys
this one you cant even run
this isnt a survival horror game its a really bad action horror gamethe story tries to hard to be like the movie
in the original most of the cult members were dead
it makes no sense for them to be alive why would silent hill let the other cult livealmost all the scares are predictable jump scaresthe only good thing i can say about this game is the soundtrack is amazing and there were a few good boss fightshomecoming is not a silent hill game
it contradicts all the elements of the good silent hills
if you want a boring action horror game homecoming delivers but if you want a silent hill game play first of all i have to say i really love the silent hill series
finished    and origins so far
of course every one had its flaws but this onedamnthe game has beautiful graphics sounds and an acceptable storyline
but the controls and the fighting system kills all that
there are also slowdowns in the game and several graphic bugsi only played  levels and then i rage quit and never played the game again
i watched all of it on youtube
its better than playing it trust me
spoiler alerti passed the following levels nightmare missing persons and i reached the hotelfirst boss sepulcherafter getting over the crappy fighting system slowdowns and graphic bugs i was excited to fight the damn bosswhile i was trying to hit the meat sacks of the boss the game targeted the boss itself and not the meat sacks
ok i dealt with that and i destroyed all or  meat sacks and the boss fell on the floor
the next step you have to hit his hands so he will collapse and you will hit his head and kill him
it was impossible to do that
i couldnt target his hands i was walking through his hands he could hit me but i couldnt harm him
i was swinging the axe into the air and could not hit the boss or his hands
after about  attempts youtube and walkthrough checks i rage quit and i threw the game awaytoo bad i liked watching the game on youtube but not play it
thats why im giving it  star for being unable to play itwow ive needed to write this for awhile so that i can move on and bring closure to this area of my life
that being saidthis game silent hill homecomingcoming out for me was a huge deal
again huge deal
flash back to the year  it could have been  whenever silent hill  came outmy best friend and i were in our senior year of high school thank god its finally over
and both worked  hours a week  days a week at our part time jobs
that being said we had little time for anything outside of work or school
my friend had played around with silent hill  and  and he had seen me beat the first and second silent hill over at his parents house
also he helped me with the third one
so silent hill  came out and we proposed it should be a joint venture all the way
so he got the game and the guide and what ensued was many wonderful saturday nights or whenever we could squeeze it in after school cussing and yelling at the tv eating cheetos and caramel popcorn drinking way too much soda all the while having the house to ourselves and playing this game with his  year old brother
he helped out so it was cool
to say we had a blast would be an understatementnow skip aheadabout  years
we had both been jonesing to play a new silent hill game together for a long time so it was another saturday night and we headed to the store and loaded up on munchies and soda so that wed be ready to go
no amount of soda junk food or good spirit could prepare us for the living hell we were about to waste our saturday night onfirst off
the story is stupid
this is really not a joke
you are left not really caring about any of the characters and you dont really feel a need to play through this game to help them get to the bottom of their issues and find out what is going on
in the first silent hill i wanted to help harry find his daughter
the second silent hilli wanted to help james find his wife and discover what was going onthe characters are so stupid and unenthusiastic about anything going on in the game
i really cant blame them either
i mean really everyone in the town is missing and  off monsters are roaming the streets
lets go post missing posters
thats exactly what your love interest in the game does
time to reconsiderthere are other fish in the seaalso i want some of whatever the main characters mom in the game is on
you see when you tell your mom your brother is missing she sits there and says something likeoh are you going to go look for him
come back soon
remember maria telling james they had to find laura in silent hill 
that was intense and filled with emotion
this nosecond the combat sucks
just sucks
you have to role many times and rolling doesnt work a lot
you still get hit
swinging a bat or another large weapon is likely to make you sit there and pee your pants in frustration as your character misses time and time again
so what are you to do
your best bet is to try to stab everything in the game to death with the quickest weapon in the game the knife
which just so happens to be the weakest weapon
this means you get your a kicked many many timesthird i hate the menus
they are in a stupid circle pattern which means twice my friend and i accidentally bumped the control stick with amillimeter of our thumb and accidentally ended up using much needed health items when we were trying to use another item
you see in this game one tap of the x button or whatever and it uses that selected itemi miss the old menus that were a straight line that you could cycle through stop at the item you wanted hit a button and it asked you if you wanted to use that itemfourth the levels blow
after trudging through some crap like a sewer level and a hotel which a mutual friend whos also totally into silent hill said looked a lot like the hotel in silent hill the movie we were coming to a new areamy friend was done being frustrated and said if i see a coal mine im done low and behold it was a coal mine with a fire below it
wow kind of like the moviefifth too many  enemies
with the sewer levels i was being charged at by like  or  white things that looked like a big headed praying mantis alien thing
also i went to a drs office to find like  nurses in there
no that is not an exaggeration
after being killed numerous times i ended up rolling which i died a couple times doing that too to get through that doctors officealso there is this stupid enemy who you can only shoot in the bright multicolored glowing pouch thing thats right
the enemies in a silent hill game now have rainbow colors
because he breathes smog at you if you get too close
totally waste of ammo
also speaking of ammo there isnt enough of it in the game
so your only option is to run away from everything and hope you survive
which you most likely wont
believe me i triednumerous timessixth damn the bosses to hell
i was fighting this doll thing and kept dying because of this stupid level design that placed a huge fan above you so that you have a huge shadow of a fan projecting down on you while trying to roll around in a dimly lit area and hit this boss
rolling surprisingly didnt work here either as we kept getting hit by this long armed retard
and since there wasnt enough ammo in the game and we had used up much needed health items we couldnt get more anyway because theres like a total of  in the whole game we were left using our approximately  remaining bullets on the boss and then whacking it to death with a pipe for about again and again for an hour and a half
every time we kept dying we were forced to watch the same cutscene over and over before the boss battle because there was no way to skip it
finally my friend spiked his wireless controller across the room
the controller bounced off the floor and the battery pack went flyingseriously i felt like crying after trying to play this gamethe next morning after playing this game i felt like i had been punched in the stomach because i was soooooooo bummed out over how bad this game sucked
i am someone who can find something good about almost any game not matter how bad that makes it worth trying or playing through
this is the exception to that previous statementmy friend and i both totally hated this game
in fact i asked my  friend to look up what to do in the game guide and he joked you turn the page and its a white page that says this game sucks
we gave up on writing a guide for it
also our mutual friend previously mentioned actually beat this gameand drum roll hated it
really this game should have never been made
konami is laughing all the way to the bank on this one
and is it really any wonder why this wasnt released in japan like the previous titlesand please dont try to tell me i didnt like this game because i had grown and changed since silent hill  came out
thats bunk
i played liked and was very satisfied with silent hill origins
so i have nothing against new entries to the series even if they are made by a new developer
this couldve come out a month after silent hill  and i still wouldve hated it for the same reasons abovei dont currently have a ps or xbox  but if i ever do get one i might pick this game up if it were about 
no rush to look though
i have a small urge to try again but believe mei wouldnt shed one tear if it was ten years or more until i got to play this game againit sucked playing this so bad because it shattered many great memories of enjoying the silent hill series
really if this is the future of the silent hill game series id rather have no more games released in the series and silent hill naturally fading away from our memories and dying with its glory and reputation still intact
its hard for me to write that but it needs to be saidoverall this game was as much fun as hearing about or watching a story on tv about a parent dying while trying to save their children
no thats not a joke and its not meant to be funny
its just the only close comparison you can drawi have never thought i would actually hate a video game
oh there are games that i find boring there are games that ive struggled with games that ive just given up on such as fear  but actually hate a video game
well now i have met that game
i hate silent hill homecoming
i loved the first three games and ive also liked the origin game for psp the forth game was a bit boringbut now i hate this game
there is no way to beat the boss scarlet for example
ive tried again and again
ive done my best to conserve all my health drinks and other healing products but even when i was well stock there was still no way to beat this boss
now mind you i dont care for butten mashing games like god of war and thats the only way you must beat scarlet
there is no other solution
so since im not skilled in those kind of games this game is worthless
again ive loved the video games before this one heck i even enjoyed the movie but this particular chapter has shown me that i will never pick up a future silent hill product ever again
this video game has ruined the entire silent hill series for me forevermore
i spent  dollars when it first came out for my xbox   i wish i had gotten it oh from some five dollar bucketbasically i have to say is that i think this was the worst silent hill game to date
it was too dark to see anything and the controls were terrible
the graphics were good but i preferred them grainy
i just dont have a nice thing to say about it period
in the past buying and playing a silent hill game has been a hit or miss venture not all of them were as good as sh or origins but this one is an embarrasment to the franchisecompletely overrated  dont waste your time
this exercise in frustration is extremely tedious and punishes per repetition ad nauseum
im all for challenging games but this one is about as enjoyable as the looping sound of a car alarm blaring in your ear
as for the game mechanics theyre somewhat cool if this game came out seven years ago
on top of all this the cut scenes look like those cheesy esurance commercials but at least the commercials are mildly funny and drawn a hell of a lot better
do yourself a favor if youre thinking about buying this game  download the demo first
after that if youre still thinking about buying or renting it go climb up on top of your roof look for a hard surface to land on and jump off
now imagine what that would feel like doing  times in a row  youve just captured the essence of what it feels like to play mirrors edgehey when i first played this everything was absolutely tough and boring
at first i thought it would be all fighting but i regret owning it now
you cant actually see the main character making it a lot more complicated
do not buy or you will have the same anger as me
trust me thats all i can sayi purchased this game because i previously played the demo last year
at first i though this game was great it had good graphics and it was a change from most first person shooting gamesafter the first three chapters i realized it was much of the same over and over and over again
not only that but i beat all  chapters  prologue in under   hours
i painfully had to force myself to beat this game because i wanted the trophiesthe graphics also became too much for me as well
on my sony  xbr which has been properly calibrated the colors just scream and everything is overly bright which is done on purpose
even when you go into the menu and lower the brightness and contrast in game its either too bright or too darki simply cannot recommend this gamefanboys out there are likely to send their wrath so let me preface this review by making it clear that i wanted to enjoy this game
i loved the demo and was looking forward to playing the full game
i just today rented it and started playing it and was truly enjoying the gamethis game couldve been great
it shouldve been great
it had so much potential
and it is different
it truly is unlike most games that come out
it has the player utilize the environment to escape the ever vigilant waves of police both on foot and in the air via helicopter
the emphasis is on exploration and evasionunfortunately this is one reason why combat is so shortchanged
on the times when the only options are to fight or die and there are plenty of them the combat is extremely difficult
many fights can be avoided but for some the only way to avoid being ventilated is to take down the enemyand as i write this i do so after attempting to escape the mall
there is a section which no matter what i do i die
if i fight the swat i die
if i try to wall run to the pipe i am supposed to swing from then leap to the catwalk above and then the next section somewhere in there i die
either i miss because there is so much gunfire and small minute changes in direction that are crucial to making the jump successfully are impossible to make youll get shot since faith the lead character cant seem to shimmy over on the pipe any faster if i actually do make the jump and land it doesnt matter because i become a lead spongeanother large problem that bogs this game down is the simple fact that the shooting never seems to stop
there are far too few respites and these all stop far too quickly forcing the gameplay to be relegated to repetitive and annoying
i was hoping to be able to explore and look at the city in all of its beauty
unfortunately the constant gunfire makes this goal impossiblespeaking of repetitive the game wouldve been far better if it wasnt so linear
the devs hint at looking for alternative paths
dont bother looking for them
they dont exist
the game has one way it wants you to complete an area and it will beat you over the head until you figure out what that one way is
until then you will see loading many many timesand its a real shame too because some of the most exhilarating gaming moments that a player may see can be found in this game
without giving anything away the subway has one such moment as does a construction level
theres a really good chase scene fairly early in the game too
immersion is handled extremely well
for years gamers could never see their hands or feet
in this game they can and the camera never pans out
ever
if you make a roll the camera will do a very fast  just like in real life
as you run you see your hands moving back and forth quickly and they change position as you gain momentum and faiths breathing gets heavier as she runs faster and for longer periods of timedice in the slight chance someone from your company reads this in the future dont just test your game for bugs and glitches
test the game to ensure that it will be fun
dont give us a great concept and bog it down with terrible frustrating gameplay
i do understand that youre owned by ea games the walmart of the video game industry but i am sure that even they are willing to give you a little more time to work on the game and ensure that gamers will thoroughly enjoy what you have to offerin all honesty dice i truly do want to see a sequel to this game
i do want to see this franchise succeed
i want to see you take video gaming in a new direction and i believe that this game is that first step so i am saying all of this in the hopes that when you take that next step it will be a good one
i really did not want to write this
i did not start playing mirrors edge hoping to find things to criticize
i really wanted to enjoy this game and i am truly saddened that i simply cannot do so
please make another game that is like this one only without the needless frustrations
if you do that and you can find ways to improve on what you did right and you did do a lot right then perhaps my future reviews of your games will look more like the other two that are here on amazon as of the time of this writingi tried this game via gamefly because of its refreshingly new premise but i was disgusted after less than two hours of playing
needless to say i sent it back the same day
and to think that i was considering buying it at one time
echokay lets crack my knuckles and prepare to rant
ha hathe biggest problem is how often youll die in this game over and over and over and over and over and over and over and yeah i think you get it
as youre being chased by cops who for some reason seem to commit the citys entire police force just to stop you you need to be on the lookout for your escape route that next jump that next ladder that next alley which will take you to the next checkpoint and one step closer to the levels goal
the problem is that these key passages are devilishly well hidden so its all too easy to pass them right by and run facefirst into a dead end
so by the time you realize you overshot your escape route and turn back youre cut off by the fuzz
oh and did i mention the cops shoot
yes they open fire on an unarmed nonviolent suspect
and you drop dead after just a handful of hits
stopping to survey your surroundings isnt an option either because the fastmoving cops are right on your arse you need to be constantly moving if you dont want precious faith painted red with her own blood
trying to fight the cops isnt the answer either since faith is a lithe agile athlete built for speed rather than combat trying to engage a cop with her fists is suicidal and will again get her painted red with her own bloodso its a cheap trialanderror system thats in place youll get painted red repeatedly replaying the same segments over and over again trying to find the obscure key passage
the hints that merc your boss feeds you over your radio is completely useless since he says redundant crap like cops are coming
get out of that building now
or get off that roof faith
i dont care how just do it
no really
cops are coming
wow merc you figure that out all by yourself
speaking of hints holding down the hint button does nothing except to confuse you further because half the time it points in a completely random direction nowhere near where youre actually supposed to gowait im not donethe control scheme also suffers from bad design
the up action function which is the games fancypants way of saying jump button is central to gameplay and the most frequently used function
this function is mapped to the left bumper one of the less reliable buttons on the  controller
your only alternative is the right bumper the other unreliable button
geniusi give the developer dice kudos for trying something new
i really wanted to like this game because it was so different and new the freerunning premise the mtvstyle cartoon cutscenes and the visual style of the city you inhabit are all fresh
the city in particular is rendered in blinding stark whites and grays which look artificial and sanitized
this color palette does a good job of reinforcing the games storyline wherein an allpowerful totalitarian government has established what seems like a utopia at first glance but at the cost of all freedoms
the concepts that dice tried to implement are a breath of fresh air in the video game industry but its truly a shame the games mechanics and design choices leave me frustrated and scratching my headnow having said all this i know all the fanboys out there will be looking to string me up but i dont give if i dont like a game guess what i dont like it
games are meant to be enjoyable not torturousthere is a reason this game is less then 
this game is terrible the combat is the worst
buttons should come up the screen and you preform other take downs
pressing y for a quick take down is trash
even in slomo sucks
the game is beautiful too look at the detail is amazing
i thought wow
beautiful game yeah
its a designer game
its great too look at but the game play is a mess so is shooting
oh my god
shooting an foe takes a bunch of bullets and what i dont get is
you get like no ammo
like at all
this game is not fun whatsoever
i am going to sell itthe game arrived within a decent interval of time
it just was not my style of game and i should have seeked a demo version first
