i got this version instead of the ps version which turned out to be a mistake
console versions of games look  percent as good as their pc versions but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows
first off the installation takes about  minutes which is ridiculous
i have never had a game take this long to load shift  took about  minutes which seemed too long also
next many of the latest games for pc are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games
shift  unleashed is also like this so be forewarned
internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes
the game pushes you but does not require you to sign up for a games for windows live account which is required to get the game patches and updates
more time wasted signing up for that
finally after about one hour the game was up and running  but the menu screen text had red blocky borders and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red with red reflections on the car and everywhere
so more time spent googling to find a solution to this
i had to download a hotfix driver update for my amd videocard driver which solved that red text and sun problem
finally after nearly  hours i was able to play the game which is perhaps the prettiest racing game i have ever played
magnificent graphics and fun excellent gameplay
good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel and excellent sense of speed and immersion makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to iti was really finally enjoying the game  when suddenly about  minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed
no error message or anything it just hung up and crashed to desktop under windows  i later tried it with windows xp on the same machine and it crashed less frequently usually only when exiting the game but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game since it might not crash during an entire  lap race or it might crash on the nd lapit is a great game when it works and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game
but hang on to your receipt just in casei am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game so i think i am going to buy a copy for my ps which has never crashed in over  years of game playing
i have been buying the top notch pc versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpus  but i have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space  minute or longer installation times  it takes less time to install windows    and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store and still you have to put that stupid little dvd in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax
i am pretty much done with pc gaming since the consoles are so much less hassle and they have  good enough  graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it
when the ps and xbox  come out i think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evidentthis really is a step up from dirt  better graphics cars seem a little more responsive
overall it was worth almost the money but of course i wait till the games are old hat and buy them cheaperthe really bad thing is having to buy tracks and cars
nope im never going to do that and i think it is a crappy deal but thats life
if i had known about the lack of tracks and cars i would have passed
theres no real reason to finish the game as its just more of the same without paying a bunch of money to get all the extras that should have been in the game to begin withthis is a pretty fun game but you have to buy most of the cars and tracks from the online store
the game claims to provide so much more content however the scam is that you dont get that content with the game
you need to buy it
if you win races you will get a message saying yay
you can now purchase your new car from the online store
omg really
i can spend more money on a game i already paid for
no wai
but overall if you dont mind playing with the same default cars all the time its a pretty fun game
i really only play online mode which allows you to race against other people
the computer on this game is way to easy so single player isnt any fun
you could drive backwords and still beat the computermild spoilersltltltlet me first off say that i was a huge fan of the first hawx installment and an overall huge fan of anything clancy
i was eager to get this game because i had seen some great ingame footage of the ac mission and landings were now included
before i start telling you why this game is a disappointment let me tell you what is good about it the graphics are just as good if not better than the first hawx
the detail of the maps are great and give you an almost there feel
the planes seem better as well
the plane graphics seem more realistic with a more war worn look thats not as clean as before its more realistic
even though you still have a ton of missiles available it seems the designers spent more time making it tougher to hit the target the ai
is a lot more difficult
gone are the days of sending out  missiles at a time every map at every threat
i only remember one map where multitarget was available and that was for ground targets new technology
you not only get to control an ac but there are drones and precision guided bombs that expand the gameplaynow for the notsogood parts of the game
i really like tough games they are a challenge and make for more fun but this game almost made me snap the disc in half
heres why your wingmen are absolute garbage
they dont seem to do anything other than warn you of incoming missiles as if the red warning lights picture in picture and warning buzzers werent enough you will spent  of your time dodging missiles and  of your time trying to have a decent dog fight
the migs are great they are extremely tough to get a lock on but as soon as you get any where close to missile lock you have to break off in order to escape incoming missiles the missions are scripted
you cant pick which targets to engage like you could in the first hawx
if you are trying to protect a ground base from tanks youll be forced to break off and take out incoming fighters
when you attempt to kill the fighters the ground forces practically destroy the base
once you get rid of the fighters and try to take on the ground forces again you are taken to a cutscene or the mission ends
thats what really gets me the enemy doesnt retreat if you overwhelm them like the first its just over the storyline is boring
rebel forces take over some russian nukes wow that hasnt been done to death
thankfully you can skip the loadscreens after about thirty seconds this isnt that big of a deal but the game is pretty sexist
there is a female pilot who talks quite a bit throughout the campaign and she is pretty much the only source of a team feel
when she talks she is almost instantly told to be quite by one of your wingmen
in the end she sacrifices herself trying to take out an enemy target and the game is like alright shes dead whos up next
 no choices of what planes or missile packages you get to fight with
you are given some really bad planes to take into combat and dont expect to play with to many us aircraft the game is set as a world conflict so you only get to play the f and warthog in a couple missions otherwise your russian french or englishthe first game was great it had creative and fun missions like protecting the president of the united states and taking on wave after wave of ground targets
this game is intense but i would say its not very fun
there seems to have been a complete lack of imagination on this one
i have only played the multiplayer a few times and it seems to be a rank up as you go system so maybe that is worth the price of the game
all i can say is the campaign is a huge let downall feedback is appreciated
thanks and good gamingnice cheap made cover it doesnt fot very tight but it does the job if you want to extend the life of your controller this is itits looks awesome but the down side is that it kinda slides when playing with the controller but still like itgreat protection and grip for a while but like a latex glove it stretches out after a little time
for the price a great dealnot the greatest but gets the job done
for the price i cannot complain it is pretty delicate but it is rubber what do you expectadvertised as more durable then they appear in personbut they are tight fitting and completely more protectionthen saynothing and they do look more styleish then plainwell atleast one of them worked what else could you want for the price
the other one works too just not all the timethey work fine but i feel like they have a little lag to the controls when i use it on my controller
and out of the two one is already ripping
they get the job done but i dont think they will last very longone of them broke immediately the other one still works i guess theyre just too cheap and theres no telling if it will actually work longer than two daysi have used these for monthsout of no where no matter what happened it always looked like the joystick always was stuck going right
no matter what game or what controller i used it always was going right
the other one is fine thoughif you find one that is better quality definitely go with that one instead of thesecool idea thoughlets not mince words here clayfighter   is a poorly puttogether game
the game had a lot of possibilities but everything lacks polish
characters are missing frames of animation backgrounds look decent but unexceptional and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of street fighter the speed of killer instinct or the playability of mortal kombat
in any normal world this would be a one star gameexcept somewhere along the way clayfighter   is so bad that it actually becomes good
character design is pretty good and the special moves and taunts are hilarious
the game is playable  not in any way that it can compete with the abovementioned games but it still makes you want to come back for another round if just to see all the things the characters can do
theres also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters though its frustrating that theres no save function that keeps these character unlockedcertainly not worth full retail price but the n is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap
also be on the lookout for the sculptors cut version this was a blockbusteronly release but most were sold off as preplayed games
it contains a hilarious singing intro  new characters and other enhancementsthis is the perfect rpg for beginners since it gives you the very basics of gameplay but nothing amazingly spectacular except for a few interesting  bits that will fuel your interest in the genre
just be aware of the fact  that this game is rather dullmy two reasons for not liking the plot is  that a there is no central villain and no villain at all for some three  quarters of the game so you basically get into combat for no reason at  all and b next to none of the six characters in your party exhibit  anything close to a personality unless you count the fairystyle innocent  frolicking a personality
well naturally a couple of minutes before the  final battle you are introduced to an actual villain quotkill the  goddess
kill the goddessquot but the personality or lack thereof  problem is never fixed
also throughout the entre plot the writers seem  to be trying to tap into a wealth of nostalgia when there simply isnt one
this game has it all friends parting and meeting again runaway  princesses guiltridden characters manyyear lapses characters willingly  dying in combat against you cameo appearances of characters from past bof  games and much much morethe combat in the game is handled in the  standard rpg fashion turnbased hit points magic points levels you  know the drill
oh yes there is the famous quotturnintodragonsquot  bit but there is no change in the interface  you merely look different  and have different spells for the duration of combat
i do not like the way  combat is handled graphically  the characters simply square off against  the foes there is no special battle screen and swing into the empty space  until the foe is dead
there are also a few annoying bits it takes eight  seconds to escape from combat during the eight seconds the characters  merely stand in place it takes equally as long to quit menus you travel  far too slowly etc etc etc
the music is nothing overly  spectacular
in fact i rarely even noticed it
the graphics feature d  sprite characters on pale lowdetail d backdrops bu since you can rotate  them the illusion of the characters blending in is lostlike i said  above this is a nice trial run of the genre
nothing spectacular but  nothing horridbreath of fire  is a traditional rpg with a combination of d and d graphics
the characters are what one would expect from a bof game
the battle layout is well done for the most part even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible
the masters system is a cool idea as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master
the feature that keeps bof  from reaching classic status is the story
it starts out interesting but about halfway through the game it seems to lose its purpose
another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game
the directions they give you are vague and confusing
worst of all however is after all the long hours you put into playing the game the ending is short and stale
if you are a seasoned rpg fan and have played through all of the other rpgs for playstation bof  will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives
if you hate puzzles and long loading times however breath of fire  may not be your gamethe sheer number of games bearing some form of the name quotstreet fighter iiquot is staggering
so when capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of street fighter games i was stoked
my excitement quickly cooled when i discovered the true nature of capcoms package
street fighter collection contains super street fighter  super street fighter  turbo and street fighter alpha  gold a slightly updated version of street fighter alpha  the original street fighter  champion edition and hyper fighting are nowhere to be found
the result is a shallow package that should have been so much more
the graphics and gameplay in the super games are almost identical to what you remember
every frame of original animation appears intact and there isnt any noticeable slowdown
however the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy
the sound is decent and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death
the second disc contains street fighter alpha  gold
the game is almost entirely identical to street fighter alpha  with only a few differences
first any character that was in street fighter  champion edition can switch between normal and champion edition modes
playing a ce version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there
the ce character graphics are still alpha style
also there is now an akuma mode which pits your character against akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters
also cammy is hidden in the game
she appears in her xmen vs street fighter costume
all this is fine and good but what about all the other great street fighter games
wheres sf turbo hyper fighting
or the original sf complete with guiles quothandcuffsquot and all the other weird little glitches
capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a quotcollectionquot that is obscenely incomplete
if youre really itching to play ssf or ssft this package is right up your alley
but fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waitingwell as far as the person who sold this to me goes the game came as described and in a well timed manner and i would shop here again
however the game itself is just not as fun as i rememberedwhat do you mean quota big glitchquot
batman amp robin is a mere better than poor
ive looked in a quiz and two italian plumbers mario and luigi both relate to this game
besides mediocre is  better than poormost teekns fans carer started with tekken   and if you were an aracde aholic it started with   had this been the easrly s this gamewould have got  stars hands down
but over the years this game is aged
tekken  was not an arcade blokc buster and really came to age on ome systems
most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements
thee characters while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early s are blocky and of little detail
although it was light years beyond virtua fighter   and the fact that this was one ofthe first dgames without chessy ringoutsand a highly detail and cue combo system
most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay
you could basically pumble the computer or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground
which was improved in later tekkens
and the  characters which again was appropiate for the times
the story of this game goes back to early tekken
heatchisp
was the final bossand was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only  moves
i dont remember if devil kaazusp
was a secret boss
but he was selectableonly through a very hard unlock process
anyway i know that the later tekkens blowthis game way but his is a classic
introdcuing oyung versions of tekken legends
law paul and kaazusp
this is a personal favorite of mines
but the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy
which again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkensi bought this because i enjoy fighting games
but the controls are so hard
if it used analog control it would be a lot easier
but overall its an ok gamei liked the story and the graphics werent that bad but the main problem was with the controls and the camera angles at times
if not for that this game wouldve been greatthroughout the years there have been dozens of street fighter ripoffs including fighting force
this is basically the same as all the others but it does have some surprisingly decent graphics for a ps gamefirst and best good to play with friends but this game can be a bit aimless at times
havent touched it in years thoughby far this game its much more fair than the original tomb raider
this one at least let you safe the progress anywhere in the game without looking for any type of save crystals which made original game incredibly difficult and punishing
this sequel may not be the best game out there for the ps but at least its a bit more fun to playi didnt beat the game so i guess my opinion shouldnt countbut here it isthis game has great historical value
prince sands of time soul reaver god of war and many others are based on some things that tomb raider made populargame would be perfect if save points were better placed
it would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old timeswhat i disliked i beat mexico levels playing each one two to six hours
i got to st francis folly levelthings started to look really tiresome first i spent too much energy beating pillar sublevel and didnt have spare medpack reaching ground floor
i restarted
i got enough energy by reaching ground but wasnt able to beat pool puzzle on top
then i figured out that i should have gone to the ground without using save crystals open all puzzle doors top level door is connected to ground switch and then climb back upwhich means another level restartmaybe this game is for hardcore fans but i am not one of themi got frustrated enough to quitunfortunately this game is just a hodgepodge of elements from the other games
there are some interesting new units and i did enjoy the much larger maps
my biggest complaint is that it is so short
you are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over
you never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations
this is by far the shortest game of the bunch
i finished each sides campaign over the course of three nights about  hours of game playremember command and conquer the realtime strategy that lets you build a base a lot of units and rush the opposing force
youd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel
while maybe they can they didnt here
not only is the game play unchanged it suffers from a weak story poor balancing and computer ai and several small problemsthe single player campaign story what there is of it is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together
there are characters and things happen to them but but there isnt a story progression to follow
you fight over here you fight over there then its the final battle
in fact i reached the end of the gdi campaign without realizing it
the live video cutscenes should have helped create a rich backstory but writing this i cant remember any of itthere are balance issues particularly with nod units and structures
a nod super laser structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the nod artillery is completely unbalanced
with a long range and a big punch the artillery is can wipe out any ground force and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small antiair backup is nearbythe computer is an easy opponent
it doesnt rush but sending units at piecemeal a handful at a time
it doesnt protect its harvesters either once you locate them its easy to cutoff the computers resources
the computer showed some initiative just once during a nod scenario several gdi engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures
i was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes
in the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again
i didnt try any higher difficulty levels maybe the computer plays better therelarge maps are hard to manage the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is
some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it
in the end the game is all about the mass rush once you build  or medium strength units nothing the computer cant stop you
on the technical side this game ran perfectly on windows if youre looking for more of the original command and conquer this games for youthe game works well on you computer
i downloaded it from sqaureenix and love it
i could not download this copy however since i have windows  and could not find any type of patch for the midi files
someone of better computer experience may be able to do itit is a fun game the first time around and it still is having some problems with the movies running on my computerronna cmaybe its me but half life is too crude to be an engaging play
been meaning to play it for years but never got to it
i played half life  first and that is simply the best experience in gameing ive ever had
it is brilliant
i can see how  is a derivative and continuation of but after a few hours i simply could not take the constant jumpingmissingdying
and the totally totally obscure paths through each scene
the long passages with no health
the obscure mazes and constant times of being squished
after a while i became so frustrated i simply stopped playing the gamethere were some jumpfallsqish episodes where replayed the silly jump part over  times
i think that the playability is dated just like the graphics
the peculiar movement where you always run and have to press shift just to walk and not fall or overshoot where youre trying to get to is simply not a current way to control movementall in all a charming prequel to the best game ever
im sure this game was truly groundbreaking  years ago when it first shipped
but by todays standards its not for me at least
i cannot wait for more from valve as they are fantastic
but this one ill pass foreverwell thats what cgw editor jeff green called quotunrealquot
after playing it im inclined to agree
it incorporates on a small scale elements of adventure games which slows down the firstperson action  without actually adding much weight to the alleged story
it does look  nice though at least for a  era gamethis has to be the most detailed and beautifully rendered game ever made
the monsters look real the weapons look sleek and the animation is very realistic with no jerkiness
unfortunately this game requires totally  unreal system requirements
anything less than a pentiumiimhz  processor runs like garbage unless everything is turned down and well  there goes the graphics
this game was the chief reason for my system  being upgraded
also remember the sleek weapons i described
well  theyre sleek but thats it
for crying out loud it takes three hits  with a rocket launcher to kill one of the basic enemies the skaarj
theres no bang to them at all
plus another good thing about unreal is  the multiplayer games where you can play against computercontrolled  opponents bots
sounds good right
wrong
unless you put the skill  level down nearly all the way simply aiming a gun at the bot will cause it  to zigzag in a way that is impossible to hit all while shooting at you  with godlike aim
other than the steep system requirements the  difficulty of the bots and the bangless weapons the game is very good and  highly customizable for all those hackers and map makers out there
youll  get your moneys worth but i hope youre good at strafing while shooting  otherwise youll never winwell going into it i heard that this was so much better than quake iii arena
i had played that game and i liked it
so i gave unreal a go
after playing for a while i played quake iii again
within a few minutes  i quit quake uninstalled unreal and went back to playing quake
the  difference in the graphics was incredable
all the sharp edges are fine  but i perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces
quake iii blew unreal out  of the water graphically
what about the game play
well i was kidna  dissapointed
quake iii is very intense the kind of game you get caught  up in
i found myself playing unreal just to see what it was like
it  had no draw whatsoever
i thought the weapons were fairly difficult to  use and were kinda cheesy
for me it is all quake iiii use to play this ages ago and use to be pretty good
i started playing it again and i now found that the controls at least for me dont seem very forgiving
in order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place at least pretty spot on
you also have to land in a specific position or else you crash too many crashes makes it so you cant finish the race
the halfpipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard
overall a not so bad game for that timeif you dont read anything elseif you find this game at a yard sale for    or online then go ahead and get it but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the n like big mountain  twisted edge or even snowboard kids or snowboard kids 
now i know that this was the ns first snowboarding game so we shouldnt expect the taj mahal in video game form here but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this there are some things that i dislike about this game
first landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill
first you have to press the z button when you land and secondly you cant move your control stick at all when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen
that right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game
also if you want to try to play this game i recommend plugging in an n controller that has a joystick that is still very firm
i started playing with my usually controller where the joystick is a little loose and i was pretty bad
plugged in another controller with a firm joystick got instantly better controlling my character in the game
second if you bump a wall you fall over
there are other snowboarding games on the n that do that but here it seemed really prevalent
third the music in this game is really annoying sounding
i liked the title track but after that i was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again
i would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here
fourth i noticed that pretty much the only way of winning a race against the computer player was to take a short cut hidden in each course
sure you could try to out board them but if you mess up  or  times hit a wall or wall over forget winning
fifth when you enter the competition events you only get so many continues and lets say you are playing on easy where there are  tracks and you want to quit the rd race because you know you are going to lose and dont want to waste a continue
so you go to select restart from the pause menu
you are back on the first course and have to do everything over again
aggh
sixth i did some of the time attack modes i believe thats the right name for it
i am not positive right now
anyway you have to board through certain goals they look like a traditional marathon finish line and i am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me that i had no chance of getting on from where i was and time ran out and i lost
why would they put something like that in the game
put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them
not up on a cliff that i could of went up on  seconds ago but now i am stuck
i loved the look of this game
thats why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game
i tried very hard to like this game but i still couldnt bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws
if you can overlook them and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game
happy playing and thanks for reading
merry christmas and best wishes for  and beyondazure dreams isnt really like other rpgs
its actually more of a random dungeon game
like chocobo dungeon and diablo
these games really seem to  fit into there own category these days
also it has a monster training part  to it where you brought you monster in the dungeon to fight for you
also  within the game is a very weird part of plot
you get to sees the faces of  the women you have gotten to become your loyal women while you save
if you  run the story correctly on all of them in the end your basically the town  pimpas far as game play goes when entering the dungeon you are always  brought down to level  and only able to take  items inside
this is an  annoying thing
your monsters do not loose levels but as they survive they  loose magic and leave way to fast
also to keep your weapons in poor shape  early you well have problems with rust traps which lower their quality
also there are items they raise the quality of the weapon and shield only  equipment you wear threw the game called sands
a good thing to remember  is gold swords do not rust neither do diamond or mirror shields
without  knowing that the game can get pretty boring faster
the game is very  repetitive
you end up doing the same thing over and over again while you  get to the deeper levels of the dungeon again and again
even though they  change every time it does get old to meet the same monsters hoping for a  sand so you can get to the next floor again and again and again
i fell  asleep while playing this game at least six timesas far as plot goes  the plot within  hours of playing you well forget the game had a plot and  you well only be reminded in the very endthe graphics to this game are  sprits
they are not poorly done sprites but i have seen higher quality
there are many different looking monsters and every couple floors the  dungeons floor takes a new appearance
but eventually it does some  repeating and none of the pictures are that beautifuland finally as far  as length of time it can stay interesting it depends on how patient you  are
this game involves a lot of patience
even though i fell asleep while  playing it many times i enjoyed it all the way until i beat it but if you  are going to play it its defiantly a buy game and not a rent  gameoverall this game is not for everyone but if your very patient and  you have a lot of free time to see a weird game that combines monster  raising dungeon exploring and rpg style control to dating
get azure  dreamsmany people believe that this is a copy of super mario  i have played super mario  ds and i must say that for the most part they are correct
the only thing different from this game is the puzzlefinding element to the game
if you are into strategy and action games the two games you should have in mind are super mario  and banjo kazooie
but suppose you could only take one
which would you purchase
both are almost the same
if you like games where you have to think and games that are tedious both are for you
overall since banjokazooie makes you think quite a bit more and has the extra puzzlefinding feature to it i would suggest you pick up banjokazooie first and then either get banjotooie if you truly enjoyed the first game or get super mario  if you want to play a slightly different video game
also banjokazooie is a lot easier than super mario  so when you go to the store to pick which of the two games to buy remember that unless you have a lot of free time on you hands you probably shouldnt buy super mario this is the third game in the main series of crash bandicoot
this game has outstanding gameplay and visuals
its a crash game so you should know its goodso here are the final results of the reviewgraphics  or sound  or gameplay  or this game is also the seventh best selling playstation gamecrash bandicoot warpedi have always loved the crash bandicoot series
the original three on the playstation were good and the ones that would follow were always decent
i went back to play this classic and discovered it was just as great as i remembered
still it does have its low pointsgraphics on the original playstation these graphics were fairly good
the characters look blocky at points but it sort of adds to the appeal
voice syncing is pretty well done
levels and characters are interestingly designed
the fact that most levels have another level that looks similar doesnt really bother me
they change the levels up enough to where it feels like you are playing a different levelstory this is the part of the game that is a huge letdown
neo cortex our antagonist starts the game off exactly like he was left on the second gamefalling from the sky
after failing to stop crash bandicoot from capturing all of the powerful crystals he plummets from his exploding spaceship and falls into a mountain
inside of the mountain just so happens to be uka uka a powerful witch mask that appears to have been giving cortex orders all along
uka uka was trapped in the mountain by aku aku to keep the world safe
now uka uka has escaped with cortex
uka uka quickly recruits dr n trophy to build him a time machine so he can find the crystals before crash bandicoot was even aroundthis honestly doesnt sound too bad
until you see crash and his friends at home
aku aku hears uka ukas evil laugh and senses danger
then you suddenly appear at the time machine that cortex is using and now you are using it
what happened to cortex
i have no idea
how did you find your way there
who knows
from there you use the time machine to get to the crystals before cortexsound i love the music in this game
every level type has different music and it works for every level
if you are in an underwater level you will hear mysterious sounding music
they just did the music very well
the voice acting is top notch as well
sound effects are the same old crash bandicoot sounds though
its not the best video game sound but its still really goodgameplay gameplay can make or break a game
luckily the gameplay made this game
they added more variety than any of the previous games in the seriescrash bandicoot is basically a sidescroller except the camera is behind crash instead on the side
you are still on a fixed path that you have to follow
sometimes you will even enter a part of the stage that is a sidescroller
the gameplay has always work very well like thiswarped is the third game in the series though and they needed to add something new
they did just that by adding power ups flying levels underwater levels jetski levels and motorcycle racing levels
power ups are gained whenever you defeat a boss
you get small things like double jump and belly flop at first
later on youll get a laser guided bazooka and running shoes which really change up the gameplay
one thing that i am happy about is that the power ups actually help you play the game
they arent just useless addonsthe new level types are just what this game series needed
the underwater levels play like a sidescroller underwater
its enjoyable to swim around instead of walking
jet ski and motorcycle levels are great vehicle levels
i admit that the controls on the motorcycle levels take some getting used to but that is what makes it fun
the flying levels are probably the coolest new things
there are only three in the entire game
you fly around in a plane and shoot down opposing planes
there isnt much to it but its a nice break from the other levelsdifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultythis game is extremely easy
you can go through the entire game without dying
not just that but the entire game only consists of around  hours of your time
one strong afternoon of playing and youll be done
the bosses on this game can become a little difficult but it only takes a few minutes to learn their pattern
also i felt the final boss battle was too easyoverall the gameplay is extremely strong
the story for this game is just all out of whack
if you are looking for a quick game to pick up and play this is for you
i suggest checking out the previous two titles first though
they arecrash bandicootandcrash bandicoot  they are better games in my opinioni played this game at a cousins house but i dont play games as long as i use to any more i love the level when i play as his sister and ride a tigeri like this game but its not really fun its kinda boring
its really confusing the game when you die you have too start over but i dont think you can press savethis game is boring get the one for gamecube if you can that is much more funthe very first grand theft auto is likely the most forgotten and for good reasons
though there is fun to be had in this game it is marred by one of the worst control schemes i have ever experienced the topdown camera is awful and the combat mechanics suck
the graphics are quite ugly as well
the overall presentation is a mess because of poor development skills the development team had apparently
like i said this title is passable overall but it is marred by some huge issues which is probably why its forgottengrand theft auto  circa good the roots or start of a super popular franchise sort of fun and different in its own waybad really really dated graphics even for its day gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for somewill it fit your taste a topdown run and gun game where you steal cars kill people and live a life of crimegame its most assocated too grand theft auto london  grand theft auto  the legend of zelda a link to the past but a lot more urban and violentadditional notes there is a version of this game for game boy advance there is a version of this game that comes packed with grand theft auto london  all three levels or cities in this game later on became their own grand theft auto game example the first level is liberty city which is the city from gtaiii the second level is vice city which is the same city from gta vice city and last but not least is the third level san andreas which is the same citystate for gta san andreasi dunno i loved the concept but the control kills it
i dont like having to push a gas button to walk
thankfully they fixed this in gta  amp   those games are incredible
buy those asap
i am giving the game  stars for having to cojones to bring this kind of gaming to the worldi played this game for weeks years ago against a friend or  and it was great fun on multiplayer
however when i played it one player i hated it
i thought it was too slow and real dodgy
but that was before i actually sat down and gave it a real go
and once you master the slidingskid turn booster trick it becomes a lot betterto do that you just hold the r button down when going around bends and corners and tap the analogue stick in the opposite direction  times
the smoke goes from white yellow to red then you let go the r and you have a slight boost
once i had learned that it plays a lot fasteroverall the graphics good and the levels are much bigger then the previous snes version
but it lacks the same competitiveness and fun of the original version
but dont get me wrong it is great for playing with friends but it is a different feel from the originalin my opinion the best mario kart out is the gba version because it is the snes version with more tracks
the original snes tracks are unlockable in the gba version
but none the less this version stands out on its ownthis version i didnt find to be as fun as the snes one for a few reasons
they should have had more racers to choose from
and i miss my favourite driver the little koopa trooper instead hes been taken out to make way for a slower wario
but once id mastered that thing to take corners with it was easy to place st in the ccoverall i give the oneplayer game  stars and the multiplayer cons not enough tracks and courses
once youve mastered the courses on cc there is no further challenges for you in single player mode not enough drivers to choose the sound effects can be very annoying after a while like toads whoawhoawhoawhoa sound no way to turn the objects off like banana peels and the hazards of the coarse it is really unfair sometimesmario kart  launched with the n and it sure did good with the sales but ultimatley this is disapointing
mario kart succeds in graphics departure but fails at the boring over and over gameplay that you indure in the game
dont get me wrong this is a great game but it just pretty much fail to fun factor
back when i got this game when it first came out i simply loved it but after the next day it kind of got boring for me
the game is great but fails with the overuse of boring driving and nothing exciting happens
if it were up to me i would have addes some really cool driving maze levelyeah it does sound lame but what everin graphics the game is simply superb
it really does make the n a really good lookin system
the level desighning and great setups make it one of the better looking n back in the days when it was still popular  it truly does make some ps games look like crapthe sound is pretty averageehh i rather not go into thatnowthe gameplayit just gets boring after awhile and nothing special happens and the single player is pretty short
but cooland thats pretty much itthe multiplayer is pretty fun
i had a blast playing it with my friends
it really is fun but like i said beforenothing specialwhen it all comes down to this
the boring yet kind of fun gameplay great graphics but doesnt help gameplay really fun mp but still fails to succeed in fun factorwell atleast to mei give mario kart  a  stars out of latesokay i normally love everything lucas arts puts out but thisi really honestly loathed this game
the gameplay was repetitive hard and booring
basically it is every vehicular battle from the trilogy put on a gamewhile this had great potential and awesome graphics i cannot reccomend itdo not get me wrong
i am one of the biggest zelda fans in the world
and i bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  allbut this just isnt a zelda gameits missing the fancy tunes  the story just doesnt seem that addictivewhen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games
but then after you beat  it its kinda boringzelda games should never get boring
zelda nes  i still paly that damn game
link not as good as the first but still i  like playing it
zelda a link to the pass on snes is the best zelda gamei just cannot love this game it did horrorble for a zelda gamethis game is fun but it is very overrated
it has not aged very well and the game feels sloppy compared to how revolutionary it was when it came outits not that this game is bad its just too hard
the levels consist of timed events eg
flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closesthe graphics are good as is the music
the story is nonexistent though
something about aliens and it includes one of the worst and shortest endings in all of video game historyits fun yet frustratinggraphics sound control fun tomb raider is a great series but has always had some flaws
no difference here
in this game you start out in india or something then you have a choice between nevada london or some other rainforest
you end up doing them all eventually but you pick the order
you then finish up by going to antarctica
the story line is something like lara is trying to find a meteor or something that killed everybody along time ago or something like that
the controls are very shaky but after a while you get used to them
the best part of the game is deffinately her house
this is the training level
if you want tips on how to skip levels and get the key in her house to the four wheeler email me at lazyboyadelphianet 
i have a bunch of codes
if youre a fan df lara and tomb raider get it but if youre not than dont waste your moneytomb raider  was by far the most difficult tomb raider i have ever played
ill admit i used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game
but can you really blame methe game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level but regardless youll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes and then surprise
jumping over another set of spikes and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go
dont go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are itll be the last dangerous think you look atfinally after a period of a week to a year youve finally beat the jungle levels without cheats
well i bet you were quite tempted
now choose your destination
the strategy guides all tell you to go to the nevada desert and then to the south pacific and then london
if you watch the entire story so farquot feature youll notice that the game plays the scenes with south pacific first and nevada desert last
so nobody cares what order you do it in it doesnt matter much
and believe me you will get frustrated either way so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you forever to finish that section of levelsfinally after godknowshowlong you finished the whole globe and get this you did it all without cheat codes
i congratulate you
now we get to go to antartica
yippeeantarctica is incredibly difficult and it ends with a big mumbojumbo motherofallspiders humanheaded thing
oh and one shot with the rocket launcher just wont kill it
and one thing to keep on mind onehit ko
as in if it hits you once it will kill you
good luckbut in spite of all of that i really enjoyed seeing lara in new costumes and playing in her new house
it was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack
i must say i really did enjoy tomb raider if you like challenges then tomb raider  is definitely for you
and regardless the mansion is definitely worth the  dollars that tomb raider  now cost at game crazy
but if youre anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated british woman in a jungle tomb then get ready to memorize quotl r l r l r l r l r l r lquot if you want to beat this gamei love the tomb raider seriesexcept for this one
its way to hard and it wont let you save unless you find a save crystle
after that i switched to the pc vesion which has unlimited saves but there is only one problemits to old for windows xp
so buy at own risk but if you want to play it and you have an old computer i recommend the pc versionthe second one was the best in the series for me still this was a good flick and many others just went off the deep end
the newest one is by far the best in the series and a complete reinventionyou run aroundlook for extremely hard to find switches and wander some more then well you know look for switches and well you then its ummmmm wander some morethen somewhere in the midst of all this maddening insanitya cool monster will jump out and you get to waste his butt with a dynamite lased arrowthen its back to the wanderingthis games graphics and animations are very well done and the story line is above average
the thing that in my opinion makes it average is how long the levels are coupled with the ridiculous death throes more on the later
it reminds me of the days of jaws and friday the th games for the nes where the levels dragged on and on and oneach level in this game will take you at least three hours to get thru and not only that but youll have to back track thru old levels to get new keys and items etc
after a while it gets to the point where you get tired of it and quit
and one more thing this game seems to have been made for a bored teenage kid or adolescent there are no puzzles or challenges to keep you intrigued except for the occasional switch to find and that gets boring
the game is basically just kill this dinosaur and watch the blood spew forth while it goes thru a ridiculous death throeconsidering how long the levels are use the cheats some have mentioned and you should get a lot more enjoyment out of it at least that way you wont have to be backtracking all the time
buy this game usedthe biggest grip that i had was the controls
they just didnt feel right and i got killed more often then not just trying to walk or jump
alltogether a decent game thoughin  twisted metal  was released for ps the sequel to s twisted metal  and the original twisted metal released in  a new developer  studios took over for singletrac who developed the first games in the series
this game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series
i have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of tm series
the cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game
its basically the same as tm where you travel around the world to places like tokyo london area  egypt hollywood just to name a few levels
a few characters from the previous games are in the game like darkside hammerhead sweet tooth thumper outlaw mr grim specter warthog minion as well as new characters
the endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike tm which was pretty dark
the game also allows you to hook up a multitap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourselfthis game was alright but definately had more flaws
the other tms are way better than this one
but this one wasnt that bad it was goodits decent but probably the worst in the series
the level design is very poor and i dislike most of the characters
id recommend any other twisted metal besides this oneas most already know twisted metal is a car combat game collect weapons and destroy your enemies as you drive pretty simple idea that can definitely be funsummaryread below if you wanted more info very goodgreat hit or miss with the more realistic physics hit or miss imo due to the character design styled more like    than blackfirst and best ps twisted metal arguably the best twisted metal of allhead ongood gameplay online mode included psp and ps spiritual sequel to twisted metal twisted metal  for psdidnt play this one but heard it was goodtwisted metal a great game revolutionary for video games of the first d era
still a fun game and the only twisted metal with the inside the car view no saving to memory cards there was a short code for resuming your game latertwisted metal  most fans will consider this to be the best twisted metal of all the final release with single track after this one the game changes its physics dramaticallytwisted metal  in this installment twisted goes for a much more realistic driving feel for the cars
now this isnt necessarily a bad thing but to most fans it just wasnt as fun
this was  studios first attempt to make a twisted metal game and fans trying out twisted metal for the first time tend to be the only fans that like  the best
however a few of the early twisted metal fans like  better but the game play turned off a large percentage of fans so this one is hit or miss try it you might like it best or you might not like it at all
in the end  failure to appeal to a large amount of the fans of the franchise put twisted metals popularity into a downward spiraltwisted metal  this game still made by  studios and after twisted metal  alot of the people who would of liked this game were no longer interested in twisted metal this one goes back gameplay designed to be fast and fun
i would say compared to  and  the default characters you can chose from are less interesting and useful however you can create your own cars
i think it was this that makes or breaks the game if you found a car you enjoyed playing you would probably like twisted metal  if not then your likely to turn away from it and say its a bad game
this game attempted to incorporate features that would make hands down the best twisted metal and to some it was
this is the last twisted metal game for the playstation twisted metal black first playstation  release and back in the hands of the original creators who reformed under the name incognito entertainment
best graphics easily so far and better than even the game to come after and gameplay thats arguably just or good or better than any of the other games
with nearly as many features as  including the first twisted metal game that was online capablewith a special disc not all copies could do that and official servers are shut down now  this game is considered the best by playstation  fans and many fans of the twisted metal seriestwisted metal head on this is the spirtual sequel to twisted metal  its graphics and gameplay feel like they derived from number  however i would not say gameplay is quite as good as number  it does have all new stages and solid gameplay with new upgrade system after you kill an opponent you can collect a drop from them to increase your fire power this could be considered better or worsetwisted metal one was good
two was awesome but now three isnt very good
sure there are new people and new levels but its not any better
if you like the series then get this
if youre not a fan rent itif youre a collector then go for it if not then this game is just more of the same
its still ok thoughalthough i should probably first say the disc its self was in perfect condition i was not satisfied
the picture led me to believe i would get the game disc case and manual
all i received was the disc
maybe i assumed to much and should have read the description better but the picture its self was misleading
read the fine print with this sellerif youve made it to this point in your life without playing a twisted metal game thats all right well explain it to you
the trilogy is probably best described as a vehicular version of midways mortal kombat or else a james camerons terminator take on a demolition derby
in it a horde of overthetop characters compete against each other in cars and trucks armed with missiles freeze rays and other assorted weapons of destruction
this time out there are a few new cars and weapons and you have an option to have a computercontrolled ally aide you in the tournament though he always seems to be the first one blown up in the fight
the biggest change to the series though is that its developer has changed from singletrac whove started a new but likeminded autocombat series under the moniker rogue trip for gt interactive to  studios a sonyowned development studio
this affects the game on nearly every level
graphically the game appears much differently from the previous titles in the line though its not necessarily improved
there are various shading and lighting effects at work but the end result is somehow grainy and washed out
the titles soundtrack which is comprised of songs by rob zombie and pitch shifter is very fitting but the supporting sound effects are very weak
for example the machine gun sounds like a cap pistol and driving through water inexplicably sounds pretty similar to thatthe games muchtouted new physics engine turns out pretty strange in function
the cars will now dip and roll upon collision which sounds fantastic in theory but in practice is fairly questionable since vehicles will often flip over after hitting a small curb or even a snowman
the collision detection is also highly suspect as instances where youll find yourself stuck on a ledge or halfway into a wall are frequent
its very nice to have analog control this time but the physics engine really works against itthe main downfall of twisted metal iii though is its lackluster level design
most of the stages are if not modeled after extremely reminiscent of levels from the first two games and those that arent are even more uninspired
the washington level for instance is a long rectangular courtyard with a ramped area on one end and teleportation sphere which sends vehicles to the ramped area on the other
snorein the two player modes the default horizontal splitscreen runs into the same problem found in singletracs rogue trip
since the levels are no longer as flat as in the previous tm games having half you horizon cut away makes it hard to see in hilly or rampheavy levels
fortunately the designers had the foresight to include a wide variety of splitscreen perspectives such as a vertical cut and variations on a fourway split where the other two boxes are filled with radar speedometer and weapons info these are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen
in the three and fourplayer modes the perspective is similarly cornered
both appear to cut into the frame rate and increase the visible seams between surfaces but not majorly
multiple views aside though the game is as much fun in multiplayer mode as it is in single player
as there youll be struck with the feelings of quotwhy am i herequot and quotwhy am i playing thisquot after a level or two
there are a few good ideas at work within twisted metal iii such as the multiple perspectives but theyre not nearly enough to counter the fact that improvements to the gameplay are pretty slight and the level design is a big step backwards making the game a real lemon overall
if this is the direction the series is taking it should probably stop right here
take a look at activisions vigilante  or gt interactives rogue trip insteadthey sacrificed the create a character mode but in its place are like oodles of wrestlersthis game was made during one of wrestlings hottest erasprobably still isso the wcw had lots o cash to hire lots o wrasslers and thats why theres zillions of them up for grabstheres the regular wcw guysthe nwoluchadorsravens flockjapanese superstarslosers youve never heard of beforeand every other gang from that timethe only real problem is the game is very simple to beatnow im not normaly one to complain about easy video games but this game got beat literaly in under  hours after i bought it on every levelits better if youre getting this for a kid i guesshave you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do
this is one of those games
although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics but its hard
you dont just go around firing guns at everything
although i did not like  the first tomb raider either only because many of the enviroments looked  exactly the same though
they both are good games but if your not willing  to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me your  not going to like this oneive conquered hundreds of video games but unless you have serious amounts of free time on your hand the tomb raider series is not for you
i especially dont like having to get a hint guide to progress through a  game
the first tomb raider was difficult but not unreasonably so the  puzzles made sense
the second one introduced a troubling trend of hiding  the solution to puzzles in nonsensical places and forcing a player to  backtrack and turn up the brightness constantly
in this game it is  virtually impossible to figure out swiftly where you need to go or what you  have to do
with larger levels come an increasingly frustrating inability  to simply figure out what youre trying to do in that particular level
i  finally gave up after defeating two areas
i refused to buy the hint  guide but after flipping through it i was enraged at how impossible the  programmers made it to find the extra weapons and ammo
the game is  tough enough already without having to defeat levels with just your pistols  if you dont buy the hint guidewhy the hell cant they just make the  game fun
the first one was just about right
ill never have the amount  of free time necessary to enjoy this series which i actually love
i have  more fun just wandering around and jumping then trying to defeat needlessly  obtuse puzzles
the only area really up to first tomb raider standards are  is the south american levels with the giant statues
arghtomb raider  was by far the most difficult tomb raider i have ever played
ill admit i used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game
but can you really blame methe game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level but regardless youll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes and then surprise
jumping over another set of spikes and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go
dont go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are itll be the last dangerous think you look atfinally after a period of a week to a year youve finally beat the jungle levels without cheats
well i bet you were quite tempted
now choose your destination
the strategy guides all tell you to go to the nevada desert and then to the south pacific and then london
if you watch the entire story so farquot feature youll notice that the game plays the scenes with south pacific first and nevada desert last
so nobody cares what order you do it in it doesnt matter much
and believe me you will get frustrated either way so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you forever to finish that section of levelsfinally after godknowshowlong you finished the whole globe and get this you did it all without cheat codes
i congratulate you
now we get to go to antartica
yippeeantarctica is incredibly difficult and it ends with a big mumbojumbo motherofallspiders humanheaded thing
oh and one shot with the rocket launcher just wont kill it
and one thing to keep on mind onehit ko
as in if it hits you once it will kill you
good luckbut in spite of all of that i really enjoyed seeing lara in new costumes and playing in her new house
it was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack
i must say i really did enjoy tomb raider if you like challenges then tomb raider  is definitely for you
and regardless the mansion is definitely worth the  dollars that tomb raider  now cost at game crazy
but if youre anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated british woman in a jungle tomb then get ready to memorize quot draw a flare take one step forward one step back turn around three times then jump forwardquot if you want to beat this gamethis game is so easy that it is beyond belief
and i mean that too
some people think that theyre the greatest nintendo players of all time just because they beat super mario on the n console
big deal
this game is incredibly and i mean incredibly easy
its okay but nowhere as near as good as zelda
however if you want a game thats excellent for the n get this game
heres my pros and cons for this highly wonerful and yet laughably easy gameproswonderful graphicsaddictive gameplayevery now and then theres puzzles that are mildly challengingunpredictableness with the creatures in this game make it funconsawkward camera anglestoo easy that you should beat it in about two or one monthcontrols are weird and at times confusinggraphics are good but at times there are major glitchesthis games levels look alike every now and thenthe plot sucks
it does
save the princess and jump through paintings and destroy bowser
come onbowser bosses are not difficult at all
you can beat all three of them in like less than a day if you try hard enough i did it in one day true story i swearand there you go
hopefully this review helped somebody outokay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings
some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get
and it has the exact same plot as every other mario game
omfg bowser stole peach whatever shall we do
get an ugly princess or something
and where the hell are the king and queen anyways
the hats were also poorly implemented
the flying cap is hard to use the metal cap is rare at best and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap
they should have stuck to the d side scroller
and also where is yoshi
the fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustratingi had a positive but more negative experience with this game
i did beat it a few times at the final level defeating bowser
but the game crept me a couple of times
i could not fully control the buttons on the controller in order to figure out where i mario was
plus there were some enemies that were scary and immortal
i could not stay in the water for too long or else i would die
however the game was the first d mario adventure type with cool graphics and soi rank this game the second in the list of most difficult mario games maybe  as total ever
the winner is super mario bros  in my opinionsim city  is good game yet it is the hardest game i have ever played
the main problem is getting money
i can never get any profit at the end of each year
sure i can use the  cheat code but it only works once
another problem is getting the people to work
even if you put residential areas where they live next to industrial areas where they work they still might complain that it is too far to go
some good things about sim city  is that you can build famous landscapes
also the graphics are great
if you are considering buying this citybuilding game i would suggest the sims or roller coaster tycoon insteadwhile the game itself is quite good
i enjoy playing my copy of the game and still find new interest and challenges of running cities
the replay value should be obvious as there is no quotend goalquot to meet though there are quotrewardsquot along the way
there are several problems however particularly when compared to sim city   first there are no scenarios
that is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game
second you cannot for your own landform in the new city mode before you start the game again unlike sc
both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game sim city  unlimited
additionally the online support is much better for unlimited
the building downloads on the official website are minimal and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game
still i will have to admit that  is still a vast improvement over the previous version
the buildings are better designed and they really do look different on different sides
also the graphics are much better over  while they are not vastly improved in unlimited which is essentially the same game with the additions above and additional buildings
i would recommend that you do buy unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates
and with the release of sim city  it is highly unlikely that even the unlimited website will stay up much into the future and it certainly will not be supported any moreat first glance this game may look easy but its notyou could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful citiesthe graphics are pretty good  but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothlymaxis has once  again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun  factoryou probably wont get sick of this game very fast
if you are  looking for a huge improvement over sck you wont find it herei have made  this game sound bad but it really isnt this a very fun and challenging  game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genresim city  is great for people looking for a game that is fun pulls you in mildly addictive and not too complex the unlimited version only offers more building sets and other things that some people would pay for but nothing relaventfrom  to oo this game would get a  why
becuase it just isn that good of a game im an expert ing gaming and pcs and have been in the business since windows  but this game is made for the average dumb american that is why it is so simple and lacks any depth
this game is perfect for teenagers soccer moms and stud people but anybody who likes a good challenging game shouldnt even look in its directionthese are the good things about the game it has playability value but not much from  to  maybe a  becuase once you master it spoiler it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city you just dont give a damn about playing it again
system requirements are low and it runs on the most ancient pc that is feasible
its easy to learn to play and inexpensive and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close highest zoom you can voyage out of reality and build a city of imaginationnow these are the concerns about the game
the game has very little realistic qualities about it it is not in check with the real word even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids
there is no names for streets no district and area setting and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small medium or large park different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic there are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city which is also unrealistc since all large cities have metros
the max loan size is way too small and the interest is a bit extreme
the airports dont generate as much income as they should
there are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game and the availabe ones are very unrealistic
the train option is just horrific and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building but transportation is a huge part of any city over  the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways and no street lights and signs
it is just about impossible to get a city size of over  million even on the larget plot availabe and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible since the large us cities have far more than million people in there central part
the game crashes and is racked with bugsall in all you see why this game gets a  if less this game is not just that great hopefully they will fix atleast  percent of these major flawsanything less is unacceptable in the next simcity and as for simcity  lets not just go thereand there will not be a five  i believe maxis is not in operation anymore and has just not announced it but the city simulation industry is still wide open and the demand is highsimcity  is a good simulation
the graphics are outstanding the music is ok it is fun to look down and see vehicles driving on the streets and the people walking around
even the sound effects match with the specific area of the city you are looking at
for example highcrime residential areas feature sporadic gunfire rapid footsteps and the clanging of a chainlink fence
the bustling commercial areas feature heavy traffic noises and sirens and industrial areas have heavy truck and machinery noises
you control the layout of the streets and the zoning
then the city develops itself according to land values and access to transportationthe notsogood  when areas become blighted and buildings are abandoned the buildings become black boardedup boxes that no longer resemble the original building style for example a twelve story apartment building when abandoned becomes a threestory black box with boardedup windows
you cannot have suspension bridges cross above highways or city streets
all the streets intersect no way to build overpasses except highways crossing streets there is no way to build elevated rail lines the railroad must cross every street at an intersection
also you are mostly restricted to a northsouth street grid systemoverall this is a great game
i just felt like pointing out some flaws that might annoy some peoplestar soldier is very reminiscient of older scroll sidetoside games but once youve experienced the graphics and the newer style of play ex starfox it is somewhat antiquated
the levels of difficulty are easy to navigate but the variety of scenery and the gameplay is very oldschool and plays itself out quickly
overall i would recommend it for those who want to play the old style but i wouldnt rate it better than the starfox series or other flying games to datewell theres tons of different levels and stages you can go througheach fighter has his own special powersbefore you get started youll need to inject caffiene directly into your thumbs to keep up with the computer guyat first you should take lou kanghes the easiest guy to learneverythings easy once your caffiene kicks in up un til you run into gorohes not even the boss but hes the toughest guy by far on every levelhes a big huge guy who can kill you in like  hitswhen you hit himit barely fazes himjust do something repeatedly like raidentheres a real japanese god called raiden and his torpedo spear or quan chis tele stompthe fatalities are very gruesomeone involves a guy ripping off the other dudes leg and then beating him to death with itpsfor some stupid reason all the cs are ks in this gamethe very first d mortal kombat offers great graphics new d worlds the return of several fighters tournaments  on  kombat and much more
scorpion goro reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game
another bad part is that unlike the past few mortal kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge
to make up for it though there are the most awesome fatalities of any game such as scorpions very realistic fire the spinal removal from sub zero with a total d effect and liu kangs throwing his opponent straight toward the camera
each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fightthough officially the th installment in the mk series mortal kombat  followed one upgrade game a compilation game and a subzero spinoff game making it around the th actual produced game for the series
it was the first game to utilize a d engine and the first mk game to feature weapons combatwhile the d engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale spritebased animation of the previous entries in truth mk gets dull rather quickly
without the d engine its pretty much the same as previous installments only with less characters and less finishing moves
the idea to finally drop the silly finishers like friendships and babalities was a good one but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities youve pretty much seen it all
the basic fight engine is solid but feels a little too simplistic and generic
the preprogrammed combos were toned down which should be a good thing but after awhile you miss the wow factor that came with delivering them
the sidestepping button doesnt really do enough to change things and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factormks still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around but only because the n seriously lacked solid fighting games
the playstation had plenty of d and d fighters that made mk pale in comparison
its still fun to go a few rounds with friends and its a nice precursor to the more advanced deadly alliance and deception but the game just doesnt leave you satisfiedyou just drive tanks around and blow stuff upits just like thatthe objectives are very decievingitll say like just go over across the bridgebut the bridge is across town and on every corner is a team of tanks armed with lasers nukesmines and all kind of nasty stuffme and the ol lady beat it in one afternoooooooooooooooooooonso what to do thenwell theres a really great deathmatch sectiongo there and play your friendsthe computer is a bit more powerful than on the regular gameby a bit i mean hell kick the crap right out of youso be carefulwhats also fun is to go into a big city on death match like san fran sisco with a buddy and kill all the computer players as a teamthen just go around and level the whole city brick by brickone very cool thing is the nukeyou set it off and wellyouve heard all about it in schooltry it outits awesomethis n title was exclusive for n at one point but that doesnt really matter
south park  looked really promising at first and it truly was with its shocking yet really great graphics some what game play
and i was looking forward to one of the things south park is best at
stupid funny plot
it kina had one but ends up failing and i love south park its one of the best shows out there
but for a game its justaverage
nothing new just run and gun but i liked the whole senario stories like the visitors and the turkey episodes
those were great
the game starts off really well as you battle your way through vicious turkeys but once you beat the turkey boss it just drags on with the same ol run n gun and then fight the boss with nothing new
its just the same ol same olgraphics are really good and one of the best on the n
it really shows what the n can do
one of the best parts are the bosses cause there d animation is sooooo good
but that is just itgraphics now lets get to the problemgameplay gets really boring after awhile
reallyits just the same ol same ol but the game is great for die hard southpark fans
i thought the game could have bin better but hey it wasnt but they still try to do a good job
but stillgameplay is just a lil boringsound is perfecttrey parker and matt stone do a great job as teh voices of those crazy boys
sound is great okprosgraphicssoundvoicesconsgameplay is just way to boring and a bit tediousseems like playing the first episode over againthe ending is sooo crappy i was really expecting something big and cool but just same lame endingthen again its just a game based on a show but seriouslyover all i give it a out of  starsget this game at your own risk but i recomend chefs luv shackmuch much betta and fun mini gameslatesnow being a big fan of the hit tv show i was a little skeptical at first if the game would bring down the integrity of the show but in the end it did not
south park isnt a great game but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it
you can chose between the four main characters kyle cartman stan and kenny
usually i pick cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults
they implemented the same humor they use in their tv show so the sound samples keep you the most entertained
the point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys aliens toys clones and what not
each level gets kind of repetitive so the game can be a little boring
there is not much variety to it but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained
i give this game credit for the humor sound creativity and graphics but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than soundoverall i rate this game a  out of  because although its cleaver and funny the actual game play of the game is not that exciting
if i wanted humor then i could just turn on the showwhat i must first say is that this game is incredibly easy and no i am not an adult
i am  years old and i got this when i was  the levels of the first world artisans are super easy with a very easy boss
its harder to get to the boss than it is to beat it
the levels just seem to keep getting just a tad bit harder but nothing significant
the hardest boss is the boss of the second level and he isnt very hard either
gnasty gnorc is a surprisingly easy boss once you figure out how to toast him
what makes this game annoying is that there is so much treasure spread out into so many different places that you will just rip your hair out in some of the levels trying to get it
but there are some pros
this game is a little bit long making for long lasting entertainment
the game also has great graphics with a frame rate that never slows down and because between screens the game is counting treasure so its like theres never a single load time
also some of the enemies are pretty funny like in one level if you do the right thing at the right time the enemy will actually moon you and its hilarious to see
also the controls are simple enough for anyone to figure out making for not much trouble otherwise
some points of the game are hard like recovering stolen eggs from the theives but besides that this is an easy game that i would recommend to anyone below teenage age
the only reason i gave this game three stars was because i know most people like a good challenge but it wouldnt be fair to give it four just because i personally like an easy game
still good thoughthe first tenchu to come out which is the reason why there isnt a number behind tenchu and the first tenchu i have ever played also the tenchu that forced me to fall in love with the series
when i first played the game it was love at first sight no onenight stand here this ones a keeper
the game takes place in feudal japan the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game
you wont find anything you wouldnt find in the time period yes feudal japan did have guns
some people would complain about the overexaggerated bloodshed and the sometimescheesey dialogue
i must disagree with these people these two factors made me enjoy the game even more
what the hell
why would that make a game better
you maybe asking well those two features made me feel as though i was watching an old japanese kungfu movie minus the kung fu thats how i believe you must think of this game to fully enjoy it
after watching the ending i believe thats the effect the creators wanted to put in this game after seeing the end sequence yourself youll know what i mean
of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying
in order to block your opponents attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner the reason i only gave it three stars
i dont think this is a game for everyone thats why
i believe this game will be a rare collectible in the future so buy this game now and save yourself future troubletenchu stealth assassin  circagood easy and fun stealth gameplay nicetight controlsbad really dated graphics stealth gameplay can be overly simple little replay value with not much to unlockwill it fit your taste ancient japanese samurai and swords theme ninja stealth gameplay more fun hack and slash then overly complex think more metal gear then splinter cell two playable characters one male and one femalegame its most assocated too tenchu  birth of the assassin metal gear solid siphon filteradditional notes getting a better ninja rank at the end of missions unlocks much better itemsthis is not a bad game to play
but i did not really like as much as i thought i wouldi loved this game when i first played it
it has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are
it took me  hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode
you can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on
this game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character you can be claire redfield or leon kennedy
but it will be a bore when you finish iti used to play this all the time when i was little
the graphic quality is low because its the first one but i still love this gameit doesnt get much better than crash
i love all his games
note to those ps unsavvy people as myself this will play on ps but you cannot save
you can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful one mistake and you loose your game
this was irritating
so i got out my old ps memory cards from ps are not compatible with ps so i ordered a ps from ever reliable amazon and all is good now in crash bandicoot world
people who live and breath playstation stop rolling your eyes at me and saying duh
this is just a hobby
live and learn
happy gamingseeing as how this is the first crash game it pains me to have to give this game a  the only thing that makes this game not quite as good as the others is its lack of a very big storyand not to mention a horrible ending
otherwise this game isnt so bad
i give this game a  and a half
the graphics gameplay and music are fairly good
this game got me into the whole crash bandicoot trilogy and the games just get better along the waythis game was fun and all but it was hard as heck
it was so hard that i had to put in a cheat to get all levels so i could skip the levels i couldnt beat
i dont know who the people can beat it because i cant
i mean does the guy who created this game expect us to beat it
i mean you cant even crawl
you have to play this game
but beware its the hardest game everback when the sony playstation and nintendo  were first released people were getting all excited over super mario  in   it was new it was innovative
it had something
meanwhile the sony playstation got crash bandicoot and this was described as a game that could take mario on at his own game
that of course didnt happen as mario still holds the torch
however crash bandicoot wasnt a bad game
it was however a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty
there were of course other mitigating factorscrash bandicoot carries theeven thenoverdone save the damsel in distress storyline ala mario saving princess peach over and over
much like mario however crash wasnt about storyline
it was about gameplay and here its just as simplistic as it is in your average d sidescroller
crash only has two attacks
his spinning attack and a jump attack
youll use this to take down your enemies
there are advantages to using one attack over the other
for example the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives crash some extra air which is actually needed to access some of the games little secretsthroughout each level crash also has the ability to obtain akiaki
a mask that serves to protect crash
if you have one you can sustain two hits before you die
if you have two you can sustain three hits
if you have three youll be temporarily invincible
the game also makes it a point to give you an akiaki if youre dying too many times in a certain level and believe me thatll happen a lot
the good news is that crash bandicoot isnt shy about giving you extra lives
the bad news is that youll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly
a lot of the times things are just unfair
the camera is permanently fixed behind crash so sometimes its hard to predict jumps or sometimes even where some enemies are
also the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well
like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that youve no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose
thus youve no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levelsto its credit though crash bandicoot has a variety of levels
theres the basic d platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being d sidescrollers
there are also levels where youll run from a boulder in indiana jones style levels where youll ride on a hog
youll get your fill from these levels
although many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward
theres not a whole lot of exploration to be done and even when you can veer off course youll only be backtracking to get back on the right course
in short many levels are just too linearmastering the game is also fairly difficult
throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash
if you smash all the crates you score a perfect
seems simple right
well the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying
and again with some unfair camera angles in some levels and the trial and error youll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times
likewise it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken downincluding the final boss dr neo cortex
most boss battles arent a challenge but getting to them sure as hell iseven the games save system is flawed
as you go through each and every level youll find tokens thatll let you catch a glimpse of the girl crash is out to save in this game
the problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level
the second problem is that you need three of them
the third problem is that you have to go through some stupid minilevel in order for your game to actually be saved
theyre played out in a d sidescroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some d elements which again require trial and error to get through sometimes
at least you dont lose a life just the chance to save your game
the fourth problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not you cant get them again
thus in each level youre only given the chance to save once and you may not even get it
this is inexcusable
the later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature
theres also a password system here for those who dont have a memory card and thats really nice to have
again however it sucks that you only really get one chance to save
you can save after scoring a perfect on a level but again thats a one time deal
you cant go to an easy level score a perfect and save againdespite its gameplay issues crash bandicoot looked good at least
especially for a game released in   it runs fairly smoothly and just looks great for the time of its release
it wasnt a launch title but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes
the levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it
it cant hold a candle up to todays graphics but in  this was a charmer
the game also didnt sound so bad either
some tunes do get annoying but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels and the sound effects are brilliant
as far as presentation goes crash bandicoot really knew how to hand it to usunfortunately its unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while
was it a good game
sure it was
but the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game
its not bad for a first outing but a game shouldnt be so unforgiving in its difficultyprosits a good looking gameit sounds goodsimple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learna variety of levelstons of secrets and little things to do youll be busy just trying to complete the game consthe difficulty level of this game is unforgivingbad camera anglesthe games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easya lot of trial and error momentsmany levels are too linearthe save system set up is absolutely horribleits still a good game but later games in the series do a far better jobits good
but my favorite was warped
play it if u like adventure gamescroc is one of those games i only had a small chance encounter with when i was younger
the demo disc that came with my playstation back in  had a demo of the game and by all accounts i was pretty taken with
the graphics were bright and colorful the world it presented and by extension croc and the gobbos were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid d platformer
developed by argonaut software who developed the super fx technology used in nintendos star fox on the snes in the early s i ordered a copy of the game based on those memories but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error
unfortunately if the title of this review is any indication croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the bit generationalmost all of crocs problems center on the controls
well its not completely on the controls rather its a combination of the controls and a camera that does whatever it wants  but if it wasnt for this i firmly believe more people would remember it
the games controls are not unlike those in core designedios tomb raider series  which in todays world some people find rather archaic  but im still at home with them since i grew up with that game
what makes croc different and ultimately more problematic is the camera is not completely locked behind croc at every moment
this makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like tomb raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares
this isnt the case with crocwell thats kind of a lie because the further you get in the legend of gobbos the more technical and challenging the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability
even worse are the controls when croc is underwater or doing a minigame as these sections are simply horrendous
the situation with the controls is a real shame since the game aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles would still be astounding today if it wasnt for them
its kind of possible to enjoy croc despite its problems but i personally had to play the game in small bitesized portions to really avoid my building frustrations  a red flag for a gamer if there ever was onedespite crocs shortcomings i cant really tell people to flatout avoid the game
i still have a soft spot for it and the characters despite what i experienced while playing through it
still if you can id recommend trying  or revisting  the game before you buy it
for those that played croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it but those without an attachment to the ip will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it isthis game has everything it needs to be great
it is great
ive never played croc  scared off by difficulties in the first one
yes i agree the controls are horrible
i can remember spending  minutes climbing platforms only to miss a cage jump down take  minutes back up and fall down right before the top
ltscream it made me even madder because the characters are the cutest you collect things like spyro and ty its the cutest story and i want to play it so so badlybut the diificult controls make that impossible
for greatest hit couldnt they have fixed that one problem
if they fix the cameracontrols and make croc  i will preorder itcroc original released in  had the same appeal that crash bandicoot had
it was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at
obviously inspired by crash bandicoot and super mario  croc was a game that couldve been for everyone
however lackluster controls and a bad camera make croc more frustrating than funas with most games aimed at the younger audience croc has a simple story
the gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil baron
its up to croc to save the gobbos and stop the baron
and hell traverse four worlds to do itthe level layout of croc is surprisingly good
levels are pretty straightforward but youll be able to veer off path whenever you need to
in every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong
along the way croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters
in every level youll also collect gems
from level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other
for every  gems youll get an extra life and youll need those lives
there are also six gobbos in every level you venture to
five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly
however the last gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level
upon finding those gems and opening a special door the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last gobbo
some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating
for example in one bonus game youll have to make croc jump on buttons in order to whack sheep in a sort of whack the mole fashion
however it speeds up and the controls arent all that friendlythat may very well be the biggest problem with croc
the game is such a pain to control
youll suffer a lot for this
up always moves croc forward but the camera is always moving
croc doesnt turn sharp enough so youll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way
this wouldnt be so bad if there werent enemies on your tail or if you didnt have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform
even worse is the camera
you dont get control over it at all
the view doesnt shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you dont know where it is or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform
these issues make crocan already challenging game as it isharder than it has to be
its frustrating as well
the game has potential and the right gameplay elements but the controls make it too hard
however it is still a good challenge
completing the game  by finding all the gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itselfwhat croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else
the game looks stunning
especially for a playstation game in   the fmvs look incredible the bosses look spectacular
the environments look incredible as well
there are hardly any playstation games that look this smooth or run this well
the soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack
in terms of production values croc is an astonishing game to beholdin short croc is a good game but a game that wouldve been so much better if it didnt suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera
its a fun game but only barely so
there will be many gamers who wont be able to let those issues slidegraphically jet moto is one of the worst games ive played for the ps
i prefer the second jet moto over this one
its extremely hard you only get boost refills once a lap and the computer controlled players try their best to wreck you
just an overall frustrating experiencei will confess i never finished this game but thankfully i wont need to curtsey of the remake for gamecube
i had originally started this series with re  and decided to back track to the first one for the sake of finding out who chris was and why claire was looking for him
however the horrid control horrid graphics were bearable but the lousy voice acting was not
i couldnt stand it because here was a great classic bmovie story and i love bmovies with fmovie acting
everything about this game became cheesy
i then bought the directors cut hoping for better voice acting well at least i got my wish a couple weeks ago
i then bought the dual shock edition yeah im kind of bitter but i wont hold a grudge because capcom and nintendo provided me with what i wanted recently
but this game could have been better even for the time it was released at least the voice acting could have been better
now that the remake is available with all the good things about the original intact plus some fiercely improved graphics sound and dialogue although i miss the quotmaster of unlockingquot line there is no need to bother with this gamei have played this through several times because the puzzles are excellent and you kill zombies
there are many puzzles i still havent solved and i may end up playing though again just to see whats there
also some of the graphics were nice and i love the fear even though i played res amp first this one scared me the most but being the first i played only re gave me nightmares for months
i will agree this game is hard core and there is plenty to like about it
i love interactive movie feeling like final fantasy vii and wing commander prophecyhowever now i will list what i didnt like
why i only gave it three stars
well to start off the cinematics are not only outdated but horribly done to begin with
if i made the game i would have just said quotyknow that was really bad lets just not have a cinematicquot  also the movement is quite shabby and fake looking and while a zombie hovers into a standing position you cant shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward youif you think that such a picky thing about positioning picking up items is worse
you can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly but you cant pick it up because its really  degrees to your left or something like that
with these positions you are forced to listen to mindnumbing music
i thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find for any game or bmovie
the only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive and so you must endure the music as wellhowever the music is beaten in abysmalness by its dialogue
the script is terrible and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement
it doesnt end there
the pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most clicheridden plots ever devised
you have police traitors huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you and worst of all you have about three dozen times through the two stories which are almost identical where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other
that type of stuff makes me sick
you are alone for about two hours when suddenly a trap goes off right as your partner happens to be right outsidelets rate everything images   movement   script   sound effects   background story   music   voice acting   puzzles   mosters   weapons   fear   plotsequence of events today i posted a review for silent hill for the sony playstation in the interest of fairness i figured id post a review about resident evil
like silent hill i played and beat the game within a week of its initial launch
i didnt have alot of gripes about the game being as i was blown away by the very idea of a survival horror game
let alone playing such a game for the first time in my long gaming historythe music and graphics for this game are by no means good to todays standards
back in the day as with silent hill they were top notch or very near it
as far as puzzles go resident evil had both passable and challenging puzzles nothing that took away from your gameplay or experience which was a nice touchas far as gameplay this resident evil game directors cut was my favorite up until resident evil  and more recent resident evil  as i said with silent hill neither game is better than the other but i would strongly recommend skipping this game for this system and get the resident evil remake for gamecubethe remake enhanced not just the graphics but the over all story and appeal of resident evil the original classic survival horror game
in closing i have to say that i graded this a  as i did with silent hill they are two different kinds of scares and two different worlds but the graphics and dated sound leave me empty
allinall a must buy for any resident evil fanboy or person looking for a quick cheap thrillthis is a good and fun game but after you beat it  or  times you lose all interestor so the prologue goes in the soul games
this game came out on the playstation before the soul calibur series
you might could say that this is a prequel to the soul calibur series
anyway i bought this title after i had already played soul calibur ii and soul calibur iiiby the time i bought this game i was already accustomed to the great graphics fluid movement and responsive controls of the ps versions
that is the reason why i did not enjoy soul blade
i am sure that it must have been topnotch back in the days of the old playstation but today it definitely cannot compare to soul calibur iii
the basic idea is the same though
you have a small cast of characters who are seeking soul edge
soul edge is a sword with magical powers
it consumes the souls of those who use it
however in return they stop aging and they obtain combat powers that exceed that of even the very best warrioryou might want to buy this game and add it to your collection if youre a fan of the soul series of fighting games
however i would not recommend buying it if you actually want to playif you didnt like the original twisted metal dont bother reading this review  nothing substantial has changed in the sequel
if you liked the original twisted metal dont bother reading this review either  theres plenty of new cars and tracks in the sequel
if you dont fall into the above categories read on
the twisted metal story is simple
each year a dozenorso misfits and malcontents meet for a battle royale in soupedup cars straight out of death race  the last person alive gets any wish granted by calypso the man behind the twisted metal competition
your job is to take control of one the these cars in a variety of locations and then blast your opponents to kingdom come
graphically the game is identical to the original twisted metal
on the plus side the landscapes are richly detailed and the battlefields are complex
on the minus side the texturemaps still look horrible up close and clipping and popin is still plentiful
the game also controls much the same as the original
this means you will eventually choose your ride based on a combination of  how cool it looks and  how often its handling doesnt make you want to throw your controller through the tv screen
this time around there are plenty of tracks and a wider variety of vehicles
it appears that single trac listened to the folks on usenet and included cool new cars like a hearse a bulldozer and a grotesque mancar thing axel that gives me the willies
also new to this game are quotspecial movesquot that anyone can pull off
these include a freeze ray a shield and reverse weaponsthe game still shines in the two player mode
life doesnt get much better than chasing your buddy around in a cop car and nailing him with a tazer
in fact if you are into twoplayer games theres no reason for you not to buy this game
overall twisted metal  is a cool game with plenty of replay value if you like beating a game  different ways or are into twoplayer games
its just a bit surprising that the game looks so much like the original
i guess they decided quotif it aint broke dont fix itquoti see a lot of negitive reviews here
you have to remember this is an old game now but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers
this game was released in arcades in  and two years later it finally made it home
but unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it e
this game just came to late
it was still a fun game but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too
but in  it was still really well liked but just didnt age well
but for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the  release datei used to play cruisin usa a lot back in the days of great arcade gaming and i was excited to hear that it was headed to the nintendo  this port though is really for the die hard fans of the arcade game it is based on because the good qualities of the game do not outweigh the bad qualitiesthe good qualities this port includes all of the cars stages and music featured in the arcade version
the controls are spot on so you were able to get into this game easily
it even includes the secret cars by hitting certain buttons at the select screen such as the busthe bad qualities this game was one of the first titles to be released soon after the nintendo  made is debut and it shows
while the graphics are crisp and bright they were also choppy at times during gameplay and this game was one of the first to feature massive pop up graphics graphics that suddenly appeared out of thin air
while the arcade game suffered from this as well it wasnt as bad and the overall draw distance was better than the n port
the digital voice samples along with the audio in the n port were muffled it sounded like it was playing out a paper bag
the cars controlled in the same way so there was no difference in what you picked to play during the stagesif you were a fan of the cruisin arcade series be warned that this is a decent port of the first title in the series and like the first arcade game had little variety in the control of the cars and the stages
i like arcade racers so that is why i give this a  star rating
peacedo not get this game it sucks
try san francisco rush or california speedthis game is very fun but isnt very groundbreaking or original but youll have so much fun when you configure the controls to your liking you wont really care
i however think the wii downloadable version has much better graphics and sound quality and the controls are easier on the wii compatible game cube controller than the nintendo  one
there are better racing games available but this is still one of the best old school racing gamesthis game is pretty entertaining for the first couple weeks that you have it
after that is doesnt really have much to offer
the game just gets really easy to beat and extremely repetitive with all the says of the various characters
although the characters with names like slippy and peppy give some extra flavor to this boring game
multiplayer mode is just plain bad
all of the escape moves make it too easy to dodge your opponents fire so the game takes forever and the multiplayer levels themselves offer you nothing interesting
this game does have its value for a little while so if you want to try it then rent it dont waste your money buying itthis game is okay im not really into this type of games but this one ewas pretty good for its typeeveryone tells me that starfox  has it all a great story mode creative bosses well thought of voice samples and a fantastic multiplayer experience
starfox  is another classic game on the nintendo  its designed to be a space shooter where you fly through levels shooting down enemies and occasionally saving your friends behindsnow never playing this game until very recently it was hard for me to judge the game based on my opinion
all ive heard about this game is that it is a classic but when i played it for the first time recently it was hard for me to consider this game a classic
the game play was very easy and also very short
ive heard that there are some secret levels but none that i have discovered yet
during the game you are accompanied by some of your fellow pilots who constantly need saving
a few times is ok but in my opinion the creators of this game should have made pilots that knew how to take better care of themselves because there always whining and complaining
dont get me wrong this game was really fun it has great graphics for when it was made and definitely managed to keep me entertained throughout it
the only problem is that im not a valid reviewer because i didnt play it when i was a kid and i have been influenced by the greater technology and systems we have todayoverall i rate this game a  out of  for its graphic appeal but its lack in greater story mode
i only wish my mom got this game for me as a childthe solo game is the cheapest most annoying game to play
the computer flat out cheats and its totally agonizing to watch the computer play its mini games and take their endless turnswith some friends its more fun since you can make fun of each other when you lose
if fact ill only play that can with at least two other people
i suggest a rental as long as you have a group of friends to play withas adam drake you go back in time to stop an alien force from totally destroying the human race
you have a colorful array of weapons and about  different vehicles at your disposel
but overall the storyline is a little predictable and the objectives are a little frustrating but it is a pretty cool gamethis game is like blast corps only you can go into all the houses
driving around and shooting things is kinda fun but it can get boring
the game seems to be more like an rpg game and since i like rpgs i  enjoyed the game a little bit
but its not really a game youd want to  go back and playive had legend of legaia for a number of years
ive picked it up and tried to play through it countless times
the verdict it starts out ok story wise has a nice battle system on it but it falls flat after a while
let me elaboratefirst off the good about this game
an rpgs battle system is one of the most important elements of the game
about  of your gameplay time in an rpg is spent battling
that being said legend of legaia has a very nice battle system
its turn based which means you can stretch between hits and offers what many have called a fighting game inspired attack system
basically what that means is that the directional buttons are used as the primary selection tool in battle the x button is only used to confirm attacks and select magic
combo attacks are initiated by entering certain combinations in attack mode up high kick down low kick left left hand blow right right hand blow and not only are nice and damaging but are pretty spectacular to look at too
but the good stops thereheres the bad
first off the random battles
i love rpgs but i hate random battles with a vengance and in legaia they spring on you every two steps in any given dungeon
this ensures that the player will quickly become tired of the battle systemsecondly the way that the magic system is set up is a pain in the butt
creative but a pain in the butt
unlike most rpgs where the characters aquire new magic by gaining levels or buying it from shops legend of legaia has a somewhat pokeacutemonesque method whereby the characters must absorb the powers of enemy seru into their raseru in order to learn new spells
this wouldnt be too bad if the chance of absorbing a serus power werent so low maybe a  or  chance and that for a character to aquire that serus powers he or she must land the final blow him or herself
that can lead to hours of frustration trying to learn new attack and healing magic
when trying to learn new spells becomes a chore you have a problemthird of all the story line
the plot is really thickest toward the beginning of the game then becomes less and less engaging as you play
i mean it starts out promising but never really picks up the pace
the most exciting moment in the game is the attack on rim elm right at the beginning of the game and from there it never really takes off
for the love of god they had a demigod that sleeps in the form of three freaking infants giving random prophecy in a freaking cave town that keeps falling apart
what the heck
thats the part when you know whoever wrote the script for this game was having some monster writers block that never really went awayfourth point the music
now i know most people dont care much about the music in an rpg as long as its bearable but the music in legend of legaia would be better replaced with the sample music tracks from rpg maker
its ok for short sperts of playing but after a few hours in a dungeon it gets redundantnumber five the graphics
now i know this game has ok graphics for its time but its more the way that the graphics effect the navigability of dungeons that has me
the color pallet for this game tends to be overwhelmingly dark especially in caves and in certain areas its hard to tell a wall from a door from an extension of the floor because the colors and textures merge together so much
not fun when youve been through  random battles are low on health and healing items and are just looking for an exitlastly the two most annoying things about legend of legaia save points and the price of upgrading equipment
in this game you can only save on the overworld map and at save points
the problem with the save points is that they are so far apart from each other in the dungeons
the save points tend to be one per average sized dungeon and sometimes two and always about an hour or three apart from each other
this can cause headaches when you just want to quit but there hasnt been a save point in sight in the dungeon for hours on end
and the price of equipment upgrades is just plain wrong
to afford new equipment you have to run around in circles of about an hour or so fighting to just be able to afford the next swordafter fighting every monster from the last town to the one youre in now without running from a single battle
this leads to hours and hours of trying to get into a fight which as it turns out is the only time when youre not jumped every three steps
this in turn leads to boredomso in closing legend of legaia is a decent game if you can stand the frustrations stemming from its faults
the battle engine is good and you can always mystery science theater on the plot if youre so warped in humor
but if you hate getting hit with random battles being over charged for equipment never being able to find a save point when you actually need one and getting lost in confusingly rendered dungeons then leave this game alonethe expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer n games the differences ive seen on episode i and supercross  are very noticeable but for the extra bit of eye candy im not sure this is worth  the money
if you really enjoy crisper graphics then go for it but i  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhereanother  thing to keep in mind is that the n is becoming dated
the expansion pak  will help it a bit but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  i would save your moneyit was very difficult to take out the filler of the slot
i enjoyed being able to finally play my copy of majoras maskluckily i got my expansion pack with donkey kong so i didnt have to spend  bucks for it
there is a significant difference with the  megabytes of extra video memory but its nothing revolutionary
however because quality games like donkey kong and perfect dark require it it must be purchased
there are also several games that dont require the expansion pack but benefit from its use top gear overdrive rouge squadron
the bottom line if youre a  ownerplayer you should probably buy the expansion packthis thing is only worth the money in games like donkey kong  and perfect dark where it is required to play
all it does is enhance graphics and add memory which isnt worth the  price tag in my opinioni went in to syphon filter with high hopes and was somewhat dissapointed
while the levels are large and fairly well designed the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces
the games controls also suffer from problems mostly in terms of the targeting function which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces or when an enemy is moving fast yet will often aim for enemies you cant hit when you are being shot at by ones you can or even aim behind you throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control
fortunately autoaiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances
in some places infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration just to be fair i did set off an alarm but still
some puzzles are good without being dumb and contrived but some were just plain stupid especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level
some triggered events especially spawning are odd for example on one level if you havent completed a certain objective you will die without much explaination
while these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience the story is fairly good certain levels are very fun and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that its agrivating at you
one battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemiesoverall syphon filter is a great game executed poorly but i have high hopes for the sequal
i hope im not let down againstar wars racer features excellent graphics
you get your choice of pods and their corresponding character
during the race the graphics are very smooth and the controls are very easy to master
during the first few races expect to break lap records in finish first
in the harder levels expect nosetonose finishes
the only drawback is that the game is pretty much the same from start to finish
this is a must have and still today it will show off your graphics cardthis game is good so far but im having a hard time since i can barley see my gameboy screen
i would recomend this if you have a game boy sp since you can see the screen better
im trying to find a sp so i can play it better
i wish that you could play gbc games on ds
so try it out if you get the chance
i would probaly raise my rating to  stars if i had an spthis is a side story and it is implied that the whole thing is links dream
play this if youre bored but if not dont bother its not really worth going out of your way for
it is long and occasionally boring
i would suggest ocarina of time links awakening or if youre just looking for gb get oracle of seasons and oracle of ageslinks awakening is the first handheld zelda and the first one to diverge from the triforce ganon and zelda structure
this one instead takes place on a random island
i didnt like the story
a lot of people love this game but i dont know why
in my opinion its one of the weaker zelda games out there
oracle of seasons and oracle of ages are far from my favorites but they are both better and more interesting games
they are similar to links awakening but they both have a better story and overall have more to offer
as i remember links awakening does have some decent game play but most everything else about it is pretty dated
the soundtrack has some good compositions but its hard to listen tolinks awakening isnt excessively difficult like the two first zelda games but it also has almost nothing to with the rest of the games so overall it really doesnt add much to the seriesthis game was a good start for the pokemon franchise but to strictly say
very straight forward game and not very difficult
in my opinon this is the kinda game you would play in your free time or for old times sake
the controls are identical to blue and yellow and gameplay is simplethis game is fun but not very much of an objective all you have to do is beat the champion in the indigo plataue and catch em all but thats it get yellow because you always have to make your pikachu happy theres a lot more to it but if you want to get this get it its not a bad game it just doesnt have much replay valueout of all my friends i must have been the last kid to get this game
i was not regretting it when i asked for it and got it for christmas because this game was so cool at first
on christmas day of  i must have played this game all day
in three days i had all eight badges and enough to take on the elite four
it took me a little while to beat them i did
and thats when i got sick of the game
the thing is after you beat the elite four what you have is a group of superpowerful pokemon that can only fight wild pokemon and you need to catch the rest of the pokemon
the game becomes a big nothing
its fun to raise low level pokemon if you still have trainers you havent fought but besides that its a pretty big nothing
all you can really do is fight wild pokemon walk around get lostwhich is hard because the games map is too easy to figure out and go shopping for items you probably wont need
i have never gotten all  pokemon because it gets so boring at around  that i cant stand it
the game is fun if you use cheats like starting off with mew and multiplying items but besides that its pretty boring
id say to buy it but the fad is over now and nobody cares
playing pokemon these days makes you an outcast
only buy this if youre not afraid of ruining whatever reputation you haveps dont say my review was helpful just because youre an angry fan
i get that a lot
if you didnt find it helpful thats when you criticize my review but otherwise just dont say anythingin this game you play as a boy collecting and battling creatures called pokemon
there are plenty of worlds to explore pokemon to catch rivals to battle badges to earn and items to find to keep you playing for a long time
its one of those games that you cant beat in a day
training pokemon can be fun and also hard depending on the level of your opponents
you earn money each time you beat another pokemon trainer which you can use to buy items to strengthen or catch pokemon
the moves you teach your pokemon and what attacks you use require strategy so its not just random moves and thoughtsmy only complaint is that this game is almost unbeatable
to win you have to collect all the pokemon in the game which is just a few tens short of  if i remember correctly
a bunch of things are required to do this
you must have two game boys and two pokemon games or a friend who also has a game boy and pokemon game to trade with each other because there are some points in the game where you must choose between one pokemon or another and whichever one you dont choose is impossible to get again in the same game
also required is a game boy link cable which you need to attach two game boys to tradeso basically its going to be very very very hard to win especially because everyone is past the pokemon phase
so unless you have multiple game boys and pokemon games and a link cable youre going to have tons of trouble beating the game
i think the people who made this game purposely made the game this way so that kids would have to spend more money on game boy suppliesoverall i still like this game
i know ill never beat it but its still a lot of fun
i cant say who i would and wouldnt recommend this game to so ill leave it up to you
either way i hope youre satisfied in the endthe phantom menace
sometimes this game seems like an excellent one while at others it is downright boring and sillythe graphics while not the best are certainly the best ill ever see on my fastapproaching  obsolete computer
they are still pretty impressive though as are the  reflections particle trails and other little graphical effects
the  sounds and voices are all pretty good toowhile the first few levels and  the last few levels are pretty much fun the tatooine levels are boring and  silly
also after playing the jedi for half of the game you feel  immeasurably weak when you are forced to play as panaka or the queen with  her wimpy quotdroid stunnerquot gunthe first time you play this  game it is pretty fun and challenging
most of the puzzles arent too  difficult but then you get to those jumping puzzles like the one on level  three and due to the awkward pov and controls it takes twenty minutes to  cross that little bit of water
this becomes a constant problem  laterlittle jumping puzzles that take a vast amount of time and get very  annoying very fast
its also annoying running around tatooine running  when people try to kill you but not allowed to kill them and trying to  trade things back and forthfortunately the darth maul fights are  pretty coolthe second time you play the game its extremely easy and  i dont think i died once and i beat the game in one sitting
boring  fast this game is fun the first time but has no replayability value
add  to that the lack of variety in enemies s of battle droids with once  and a while a destroyer thrown in and the lack of multiplayer and you  get a game which is decent but not worth the original  pricenow that  the price has gone down if you like these types of games id recommend  trying it but if you prefer shootemup action games stear clear of this  onethis game is super hard the first time around
then when you beat it and go for another try it is sooo easy
you can get through  the game in an hour because almost all of it is puzzles so when you figure them out after  an hour next time it takes  minite
also i found it fristating that there are no big fights where you can fight about  battle droids
the biggest funnest fight is in the very beggining when you are up against  battle droids
if lucas arts had put in a few more units and better levels this game would be worth buying but as it is it is not all that goodi loved the game the first time i played it through but as with most not all games it got boring the second time aroundit strays far from the movie
it has the basic characters but is not like the movie
you will recognize a few items and place from the movielike the palace of the last part of the game where you defeat darth maul but it was just kind of a game to sell and make moneyits fun but doesnt lastjason andersoni was excited to get this game
its apparently a sequel to sonic adventure  battle though i hardly see how which i loved but it wasnt as fun as i expected
there are four teams with different stories and varying difficulties but each team plays through the same levels in the same order
the areas have a decent variety but when you play through each four times it gets boring
there were sometimes changes to the levels but not muchin terms of gameplay each team has three characters and you can switch between which one you control
one is a speed character one is for flying and one is better at attacking
this is kind of fun and it is mainly what makes the game uniquei also think the game could be too hard
i dont mind a challenge but the game could be too ridiculous at times
it wasnt even fun many times because of this
once you practice a lot its not so bad but it took a lot of practice to get good enough that the game finally became somewhat fun
i believe there was a final story after the four main ones which would have been nice to reach but i couldnt get all the chaos emeralds so i couldnt
so try to get them as you go along or you must redo levels
not much happened in the part of the story i actually got so see and it could have been interesting but i dont knowso i really wouldnt suggest buying the game unless you really want to and really like sonic games
its not terrible
it can be fun and the gameplay is unique but repeating levels and the difficulty is what disappoints me about itstar wars episode  racer
well in this game you play as one of many characters that can be unlocked by winning races and setting records
after each race if you place high enough you can upgrade your podracer by  buying new parts or searching through wattos junkyard
there is a  multiplayer but it is pretty standard just a split screen racing option
this is a pretty good game and  its a great buy
i commend  lucasartss for the feeling of really fast racing but besides this and the  ability to buy parts this game is essentially nascar on different planets  with space ships and a winner titlefirst get this straight
if youre one of those nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at goldeneye mario party beetle adventure racing and all those other multiplayer classics super smash is the game for you
unless one of your friends has it
you see super smash doesnt really achieve much in the single player adventure
this is due to the fact that it simply isnt fun to beat up people by yourself
who are you going to taunt and yell at
the television screen
ill give you some inside information it wont yell back
the levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast
but as a multiplayer romp super smash achieves all that a fighting game can
it is fun but only in groupsif you love meele you will not enjoy this
if you have this you would say it was fun for about  weeks
 maybye
i think the game is excellent but it wasnt addicting at all
but meele is still my favourite game and is fun to play
so buy it if you hate being addictedit was nice to see some of the greatest nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore
again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simplethe game repetitive  annoying  trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic but only the characters can stand out
nothing else not even the game play my little bro loves this game so i guess its worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks  gamerscar handling is a bit sloppy and hard to control
feels like an arcade game
i can usually play this for about an hour befor getting fed up with the blocklike graphics
best part of this game sadly is the music and announcers
would recommend for little kids or someone who doesnt care about graphics or storylinehaving the rare opportunity of trying it out the game boy color is a considerable leap from its predecessor
besides the main feature of processing  colors with specially designed games the gbc is backwards compatible with classic monochrome game boy titles though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears
also though the systems slimmeddown design is pretty convenient for pocket games its a bit too narrow for big hands
it offers no shortage in battery power and the ac outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter
the biggest oddity on the handheld for me is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up
as for the gbcs lessthanstellar resolution after discovering the japaneseexclusive game boy light theres no excuse for having to find a proper light sourcethis system is recommended for players over this is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it
the screen is way to small to use even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse u have to be in direct light to see the screen and the sound is really annoying
nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse
i like the older one better
like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad
it is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket
this one could have been beteri dont see how any body cant like this game
i remember when the playstation first came out and this was the first game i got
i thought it was the coolest game ever and i still think its my favorite playstaion game
and im  now
its a classic duke nukem game i know the graphics arent the best and a lot of the stuff is cheesy about the game but regardless its fun to play and is easily a classici really dont understand why this game gets such a high rating
i mean all it is is an exact duplicate of the  nes version converted to the game boy with a few extra modes of gameplay and extras added into it
i suppose for those who were to young and have not experienced the  bit nintendo days it is good for them to experience the game too
but lets face it if there is any game that most video gamers have played at some point in there lives super mario bros for the nes is it
all this game boy version is is a fine conversion of the first super mario bros to the handheld console and not much more
great for kids that are young now though who missed out on the nintendo  bit daysthis game is fun because it has the orginal super mario bros in it
the nostalgia is there on the small game boy screen
the down part is the fluff like images to print out
all this is a total waste of memory on the cartridgethis game is to short it is to easy to finish
there is not enough to keep you interested once youve finished the actual game
there are gimicy  little things added but they only keep you interested for about half and  hour
more levels neededi live in a neighborhood with around  children in it that all play nintendo
i love nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily
that is why so many colors and versions of them are sold
the buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed especially the l and r buttons the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left
because of the handlebars on the side of the controller that allows the plastic bends quite easily
i have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars causing them to break bend or crack
however a controller is a controller but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliablei bought a used n from a friend a few years ago he gave me an officail n controller and a third party controller
i still have the original controller and i put the third person controller quotout of its miseryquot  lighter  third party controller  bad smell and lots of smokei feel so hypnotically enchanted floating through endless rings as superman with the distant soaring effects peacefully sounding in the background
for the first few minutes superman seems challenging as an early d experiment to figure out which ideas work and which ones can be tossed aside and youd certainly think that floating through ring after ring would get boring after a while but the opposite happens
you get unusually attached to the endless taskafter a while these floating rings just seem to call my name
its like im destined to fly through them for all eternity
i dont want to do anything else in life but fly through these hypnotic rings
sometimes i bump into bad guys and shoulder bash them away other times i pick up items and toss them at specific targets but the rings
they always call me back for several minutes of peaceful daydreaming hypnotism at its purest
im enthralled in this games beauty
the graphics are decent too
i have to go now
the rings are waiting for me
stares off into spacego to the options and turn on easy mode
all the rings disappear and you can fly straight to your objective
it makes a terrible game suck a little lessi bought this game and actually tried to play it rather than giving it one star and paraphrasing the angry video game nerd
its actually not as bad as most people would have you believe
would i have paid  for it even in 
nothe graphics are about average for the n nice but full of blurry textures and gourad shading as well as a tiny draw distance
the stock music is odd but the voice clips thankfully used sparingly are crystal clear
sadly they dont do anything to make the story any less incomprehensiblenow we move on to the controls
flying superman is simple if a little loose
making tight turns is a problem but you have a lot of freedom with the controls you can even do a vertical loop without the need for a second analog stick see superman shadow of apokolips
getting him to stop is tricky which can be a hassle if you need to land somewhere fast
camera control using the  control pad allows you to rotate the camera around the man of steel and his movement with the control stick is characterrelative
zooming in or out is also possible so any superman fans who want to make machinima about the last son of krypton go right aheadfor some reason you cant save at all unless you have a controller pak but when i did have one it never prompted me to save nor did it do so automatically
perhaps i didnt get far enough into the game
theres not even a password feature so playing later is difficultthe mission structure consists of vague objectives linked by timed flights through floating rings
unless you have completely spastic fingers the ring stages shouldnt be too hard i was able to do the first one in two tries not  like many people seem to needoverall the game certainly isnt the worst ever made not even close
it could have been so much more but thankfully people learned from the mistakes of titus and made the much better shadow of apokolips and superman returnsokay first off when i played the first version of this game on the seaga cd version i practicly fell in love with it
it was one of my favorite games of all time
when i herd that working designs came out with a new version of lunar i just had to buy it
but was dissapointed in several areas
for one you got wayy more spells on the sega cd version
the story line was better
and the music was better
and the gameplay hours are about the same
however the graphics are better on this one and it has wayyy more cartoons
thats it
i love this game but working designs didint put enouph effort into it
you think they would at least put out a way better version on playstation but oviously it was just a quick  process to make a few bucks
but it is a good game and i would recomend it
the enemys are more chalanging then most rpgs and the voice programing is awsome
pluse the battle systum rocks
but i wish the story line was as good as the old onewhat is this
no but seriously
they used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful
but it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology
it doesnt really need to be easier  we just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do
but it sold very well and spawned some sequals riven being the best of the seriesthis is for the most devout of adventure gamers who dont mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves quotwhat the heck is thisquot  quotwhy am i playing thisquot  quotgah
what am i supposed to do
quotbuy then and only thenthe puzzles are a bit wonky for the most part but keep in line with that special myst look and feel
get a walkthrough off the net and you will experience much less frustration at weird oddities that keep you from getting further in the gamei enjoy playing the myst games once through they are fun and challenging
however my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason and i was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover
even if i had i would never play the game again i would know how to do everything and therefore what would be the point
at least it is better then myst in which you can win within about  minutes of starting the game but still any  dollar game as it was when it was released should last longer than this
with the detail put in the game itself is rather short with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time
also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do but cant the stopping the scopes thing the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island
i thought it was a beautiful game but i wouldnt get it unless it is below  dollars otherwise i dont really think its worth itriven looks like myst
riven sounds like myst
riven plays like mystsort of
the producers emulated myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing they made it more openended
in myst you start on a small island told what to do collect pages and have unlock other areas to proceed
in riven you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do
to find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time
my advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as neededa technical note i could not this running in windows  riven requires apple quicktime  to run and after installing that i could get the sound to work
it may have a conflict between quicktime  and quicktime itunes also installed
the game ran fine on windows many years ago i played this game at a demo station and wished that i had gotten a ps instead of an n
having recently gotten a ps memory card for my ps i decided to get this game which i had very much wanted
i started it up and the game hasnt aged well
its full of good ideas and originality but the draw distance is pitiful and really diminishes the sense of exploration and it sticks to some very outmoded design conventionsif youre interested in videogame history however this is a fascinating game as it shows what early attempts were made to justify having two analog sticksto wit this game quite fun
since my game play style tends towards using the analog controller whenever i can this game seems to be custom made for myself
and of course it is
its a pretty neat concept having the monkeys i dont think the manual writer did a lot of research on monkeys since the book uses quotbaboonsquot quotapesquot and quot chimpsquot interchangeably  escape from the zoo and having your job to chase down and capture them
nice non violent plot really one of the very few games that i buy and my girlfriend is willing to playand while the game has a nice plot the programmers also spent a little time on the graphics in the game
since the psx is showing its age there is only so much any programmer can do
but the programers did a very good job
the smooth graphics quotlargequot worlds and a grand variety of scenes make this game a delight to explore never mind the obvious use of some of sonys stock sdk files usually evident by the quotpa rappaquot look in some areas
throw in a huge variety of weapons and usable quottoolsquot make this a winning formula indeed
in fact it is likely that after the psx goes the way of the atari  that this game will be one of the reasons that die hard fans of the psx will dust off that gray box or blue if they upgrade to the psx and play a few levels
however i have one major gripeit shocks me that many people consider the ape escape camera to be nice and well behaved
this camera is one of the most illbehaved ive come across in a long time
just what are some people comparing this camera to
super mario 
if thats the case then thats a hard judge
sms camera was pretty bad but at least it was aware of walls and didnt go behind them too often
ape escapes camera not only goes behind walls but it goes through them as well
havent the programmers at least heard of a quotjelly camquot
cmon there are numerous examples out there of what to do and what not to do with the camera
ones with decent mind you decent not perfect cameras include spyro  mdk  and zelda  all of these games had cameras that were somewhat well behaved although none show the classic quotjelly camquot a jelly cam is a camera that when it goes through a wall turns the wall or anything else into a semitransparent entity
you know its there but at least you can see whats going on on the other side
ae does not fall into that category
i cant tell you how many times ive run back and forth in a level looking for a way out only to discover the camera wasnt quotswingingquot in an appropriate direction
some pundits may tell you that only adds to the difficulty of the game
someone should remind them of the difference between skilled difficulty and annoying frustration
never never should any one ever lose a life because the camera wasnt doing a good job of showing what is happening around you
quothow about blind spotsquot some may ask
what about them
it is very possible to design a game and camera to allow the classic quotleap of fatequot my gripe lies with the camera refusing to shift at appropriate times so that i can at least survive the darn jump
or shifting to an appropriate angle to allow a fair fight against a baddie
all to often im getting pummeled by a monkey with a machine gun or rockets simply because the stupid camera doesnt know enough to swing around a column
and using buttons to quotfixquot the cameras faults is a cheap trick
sorry sony a big company like your self should know betterthis game gets three stars due the rotten camera work
if the programmers spent more time with this crucial element then the game would certainly win five stars
too bad sony the frustration with the camera is simply too high
for those who think the camera works quotperfectquot play a few more games for comparisoni wont lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasureat that time it was only my second  game i ever borrowed sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me however this isnt one ill call a classic its no zelda perfect dark  donkey kong  and i can go on and on if you dont believe me try to play this game now
you will find yourself saying yuk
yuk
yuk
n i am being nice its worth a try but most likely true gamers will find it bogus it has not true replay value and all in all it had its time and thats all it will ever have in my opinion for those who loved it i am no psychologist so i cant say whats your problem is but
maybe you need to play real good game laterzzzzz folks  gamerssince this was the first pure rpg i had ever played there were alot of things i found really neat about final fantasy  i liked most of the secondary characters and found their plot development well executedthat being said this game has one of the worst protagonists ever
cloud
the reason he doesnt take the top honor of this
because there are far worse protagonists one of them being squall
i guess emo kid protagonists just dont do it for meit also relies very heavily on plot that came before it in that it shamelessly rips off  and previous final fantasies to the point of hilarity in order to stand on its own merits
most final fantasy  rabid fans probably couldnt actually play this game due to the fact its frankly no longer pretty enough for them
these are the same people that will try in vain no less to convince you that x is a great rpg
and boy is that one terrible at the end dont get me started on the sphere grid love story anyway back to if final fantasy  had never existed and  was original id have a much higher opinion of this game but between the rip off nature and cloud it really kind of drags the game down for me
i never quite got the hype yes there are a few characters that still stand out as pretty neat vincent and cait sith red xiii aeris tifa and cid
but almost everything else is miserable
even the iconic of bad guy sepiroth yeah ive seen better since him
far betteri wouldnt recommend this game really there are much better things you can do with your money such as xenogears final fantasy  and  final fantasy tactics ix or even xiii did enjoy this game a bit while i owned it but i do not at all believe its the best of the final fantasies that honor belongs to vi and ix in my opinion and i certainly dont think its the best playstation rpg that belongs to ffixnow on the positive side this game did have an interesting story pretty good music except for the dreary town songs and some good development on a few characters cloud tifa red xiii
the materia system was also quite unique and originalunfortunately though this game also has some major flaws that seem to be generally overlooked
for one thing this new scifi setting  now dont get me wrong
its not just the plain fact that its scifi that bothers me
i can deal with that
after all another cool rpg series i liked phantasy star was also scifi
what bothers me though is that the atmosphere here is so drab and gloomy that it provided no motivation for me to continue on through the game
now this problem was compounded by another major flaw  cloud
he was the most unappealing hero i had ever seen that is until squall leonhartthe other problem lies within the materia system
while it is original it also causes some trouble
mainly it completely wipes out all the uniqueness and strategy from designing a party
it doesnt matter who you put together at all
in fact there are no real differences at all between the characters except for their weapons and limitbreaksi do believe that the best ff game on the psx was final fantasy ix for a number of reasons particularly the characters the gaming system and the much more inspiring atmosphere and music
now i dont dislike ffvii just because its different
i think its a cool game but the fact is it just isnt final fantasy
you just cant take something and remove every familiar feature about it then slap the label on it and call it a sequel
its an entirely different productoverall its a good game in its own right but i honestly prefer the original final fantasy ffiv ffvi or ffixfinal fantasy vii was a revolutionary title to say the least
the game contained several things that wowed gamers everywhere such as beautiful graphic new battle systemlimit break materia and actually engaging plot
when i played it in 
 i absolutely loved it and thought that it was one  of the greatest game ever madehowever i cant say i should recommend this game to new gamers right now 
once beautiful graphic looks horribly jagged in todays standard ie
clouds hair and frankly battle system is just another japanese rpg battle system now gamers are more exposed to japanese rpg than ever so it doesnt feel so special
in another word you have seen it beforemany aspects of game are outdated and i am not sure new generation of gamers would appreciate final fantasy vii as we older gamers did
i am sure about one thing though
it is not worth  bucksso if you are looking for new solid rpg to play look elsewhere
a lot of innovations have been made over  years and most of it is for better gaming experience
it was a great game in  but you will enjoy other newer rpg more nowthis is a decent game but it quite overrated
the linearness of the early game is strangleing
the lack of a pause function also hurts the game
many of the characters are sorely weaker than the others
plus there are far too many subgames that are annoying that you have to waste lots and lots of time to accomplish something that should be quite simple
being able to make all you characters steal or cast great magic usually from the enemyskill materia is great but it kills individualityif you need your rpg fix get it but be forewarned that it is nowhere near as good as ff ff or chrono triggerif you havent purchasedplayed final fantasy vii and are the least bit interested in doing so i strongly recommend purchasing it
for the first few months after completing it you will swear that no entertainment device comes close to meeting the caliber of this game and this isnt necessarily unfounded
an astoundingly large proportion of people who have played this game have made this claim and i admiti was guilty of this as wellafter you play a couple other games after your first runthrough of ffvii though the problems with the game become glaring
the character controls for one are stiff as a board
whereas one year prior to the release of this game nintendo was striving to revolutionize play mechanics with the fluid movements of a bit mario square seems to have been perfectly content with giving the player control within barely twodimensions
the menu control battleitem screen etc
is acceptable but its time these engineers help consumers buy something new instead of the th installment of a stale interfacegraphically the game is well cool
from vistas to closets ffvii gets environment design right
quite honestly there is no other game final fantasy or not which has matched the coolness factor evoked from final fantasy viis graphics
the character graphics are hideous and the fmv is unimpressive but squaresoft had absolutely hit the nail on the head with its world design
melodically the sound is wonderful and i would argue tied as the best in the series with ffx but the technical aspects of the sound is horrid
midi
on a cd
and those gunshots are laughablebut there is no denying that final fantasy vii is a kick to play through
the story is so convoluted and impossible to understand clearly that its just fun trying to summarize it impossible by the waybut not for any good reasonsfor a really good psone squaresoft game go with chrono cross
ffvii will give you some enjoyment until thenafter completing and love ffx and x i had high hopes for this game and they fell a bit short
the bosses were extremely simple the world map was irritating  i found myself aimlessly wandering for long periods of time the bosses were really simple and many of the monsters were just irritating not particularly difficulthowever the story and characters were great and very long and in depth with many events that blindsided meoverall i enjoyed the game and with the presently dirtcheap price you really cant go wrongid recommend using a guide to complete it because its so complicated thoughfinal fantasy vii had huge hype when it came out
the first final fantasy game to be on the playstation and the first to use the newer graphics the playstation offered
i really enjoyed playing the game and thought it very good
i do not judge games on graphics and thought ffs was pretty good although sometimes it was frustrating but was very much made up for with the gameplayim going to go out on a limb here with some of the ff lovers and say that this game was extremely overrated
i agree its a great game deserves more than one or two stars but i will confess that it seems the creaters of this game were lost a bit
upon research i found that yes final fantasy vii was not slated for a playstation release and in fact was for a super nintendo but then switch to the playstation
the grpahics were put together rather hastily but in my opinion serve there purpose and work
the storyline however feels like it was changed around a lot and there seem to be holes all over itthe gameplay is awsome and the materia system is great and i truly love the summons and there attacks
although it was repetative watching them over and over during battles with big enemies the only disappointing thing about this game is it tries to lead us away from the fantasy elements of the previous games
yes i agree ff is a fantasy rpg but it has strayed from the way in which its older siblings fared
my only complaint and this is a big one is that the story just seems to be fragmented
when playing the game i can see writers changing there minds and new writers coming and going and the script being changed again and again and many forgetting what happened earlier in the story while writing the endno matter what others say this game is not the best and definately not the worst rpg out there and is definately not the worst ff game
come on mystic quest wasnt that baddodges tomatosit is true this game was highly overated and the gamers that started final fantasy with this game hate the older ones only because of the old grpahics and the fact vii was their firstthis game is great and i highly reccomment it
you will find the storyline to have problems but they quickly fix themselves as this final fantasy game is a bit more faster paced than previous ones
added snowboarding and bike racing gamesoverall i gave this game three stars and four for the fun because i feel it could have been much much better but its still an awsome game and will always becadefinal fantasy  is a great game
it has a decent storyline with good characters but it is absolutely terrible compared to the mighty final fantasy 
 amp  arent bad but they are nowhere near the same standardi remember when this game came out and  the psxsony had a iron clad deal with square for their new ff
i remember when i overheard these kids talking about the graphics are going to be great and i thought yeah but what about the story line and battle systems etc
but all that went out the window since game manufactures started catering to  not the die hard rpg dungeon crawler shadow  gate ff  on the nes fan but to the people who didnt know anything about games except  they have good graphics it all started with this gamethe of course tifa was all the range because her extra large pixles and all i heard was young boys every where talking about that and it was sad 
the story itself was a departure from the traditional ff series and this is a more post apocalyptic and dark
i myself did not like the graphics because the characters look silly to me all blocky and the backgrounds while interesting  i had a hard time seeing where i was supposed to  or could go
so therefore i had to spend a lot of time checking all areas this game to me saddens me and makes me thing of the turning point in games when game companies started marketing not to kids but to adults and that made me sadnot only the most overrated ff but one of the most overrated video games of alltime
sure ff vii isnt a bad game and while it was responsible for bringing rpgs into the mainstream and showing other companies how a d rpg is made i dont see anything that special about itreleased in  ff vii has been played by millions of gamers and its most of the newschool gamers first rpg
its simply overrated
the story is averagechasing a villain sephiroth and ending up in a quotsave the worldquot situation
character development is also average
while a few characters are developed very well cloud comes to mind others dont have enough
it wouldnt be so bad if one character didnt have much development but there are a fewgraphics were pretty good at the time but i just dont really like the popeyelooking arms on the characters
when it comes to challenge this is probably the easiest ff not including the optional bosses which will give you a rough time
you can easily save your limit breaks for a boss and beat it in a very short time
magic and skills are learned through equipping materia which is a pretty cool ideaas for extras mini games side quests optional bosses ff vii is a mixture of good and bad
i couldnt stand the chocobo breeding idea
give me chocobo hot amp cold anytime over that
but the snowboarding mini game and the motorcycle riding were pretty neat
ff viis replay value is alright
it doesnt have much that wants you to really go back to it thoughmost people give this a high score because it was their first ff
others just want to go along with what other people have said
dont let that fool you
ff vii is totally average and i dont like seeing all these high scores for a game with nothing special
so it brought rpgs into the mainstreambig deal
im sure another rpg would have done that if ff vii hadnt come along at the time that it didas need for speed games go i must saythis is the poorest installmentim a racing game fanatic and have always been a fan of the need for speed series but this one is mightily flawedthe graphics are average at best but the videos and information on each of the cars was superb
the graphics and frame rate take a major hit when you go really fast and actually the cars at times dont even feel like theyre on the ground when drivingthe cars control just okaybut on the more difficult tracks it is really hard to keep up with the leaders of the pack because it isnt really that easy to take hard turns and hairpins all perfectly like the computer always doesbeing able to drive a ford gt and my dream car the jaguar xj is what made me buy this game but then being able to use them in the game made me really wonder if they should even be dream carslook to gran turismo  if you want a better selection of excotic cars that are actually controllablethe sounds of the game are just sosoall the cars seemingly sound alike when acceleratingand youll get used to the grating metal sound of nailing walls at high speedsthe best aspect of this game is the music quite possibly the best of the nfs series but when you buy a racing game for the musicthats pretty patheticif youre a fan of the nfs series and have to have every nfs out there sure pick this one up for a very cheap price
its not worth more than  or  bucks nowadays so dont pay any more than thatdiehard racing fans
look elsewhereoverall  out of if i had to be simple and brief in my review of this video game i would say  boringwhat to say code veronica sure looks nice but does it play well
in my  opinion it does not
the story is boring and a bit over done
am i not the  only one who is sick of blasting away at zombies
its just getting old
for those who love the resident evil series you will love this game
for  anyone else looking for something fresh look elsewereso how does resident evil code veronica compare with the previous re games
despite the new look and outstanding visuals resident evil code veronica hasnt really offered anything new and instead delivers more of the same re gameplaythe story is very awkward
as the game progresses code veronicas storyline begins to lack the cool plot twists and startling mysteries found in the last resident evils
recv relied on too much puzzlesolving to drive the story
there arent any interwinding plots like before
instead the story reveals a weak cast of characters
this includes transvestites and unnecessary characters who have nothing to do with the main plot and re storylineas you might expect the graphics are mindblowing
its the bestlooking resident evil yet
gone are the prerendered backgrounds and still perspectives of the old games
code veronicas sound is good but has some bad voiceactingwhats disappointing is that the dodge feature from re nemesis has been removed and the autoaiming is so annoying causing you to aim at unwanted targets and wasting ammunition
recvs puzzlesolving boxpushing and switchpressing which will eventually become tedious especially to experienced resident evil playersresident evil code veronica pales in comparison to the other resident evil games in almost every area
once you forget about the awesome graphics youre left with nothing but same resident evil weve been playing all alongi was not expecting the cartoonish graphics
i was hoping for a game more like soul calibur
this game bored quickly even playing with a friend
the special moves were hard to pull off leaving us to just punch each otherwell there really isnt much i can say
i got the game in a timely manner original case and all that and theres nothing wrong with it
i think this game deserves a  out of  because the actual game just kinda sucks
i mean you figure that for dreamcast the graphics would be better and that there would be a more in depth storyline
it simply put falls short of other versions
honestly i miss arcade systems i use to like this game alot when it came out
but after trying out street fighter  third strike
this game is for the original fans of the alpha series
the cool thing is now you get to choose a variation types of super styles
more modes making fun to play than the arcade
the weirdest but could be cool is the mode where you can already fight bisonvega mode
if you beat him you get to see the ending for you chosen fighter
why bother playing arcade mode then if you want to see every persons ending
i hate the two button idea of grabbing and two button recovery after being poped
couldnt they just make it like the original alphas
capcom seemed like they tried to add some street fighter  flavor to this game
i say it is fun if you challange your friendsthis was a little boring and you couldnt go through alot of adventures
but the fun side of it is that baby mario cries on the floor when you losethis game had its pros and it had its cons
pro  fun for everyone good clean fun  con  nothing really to difficult just making sure you stop the line on another line
pro  lots of different ways to play you can play tournaments or practice putting challenges and you have to get birdie badges
con  usually mario is the bomb guy but in this game hes a really bad golfer   but overall this is a good game that a five year old can play so go out and get your copy todayjessethis game could have been a heck of alot better
the idea of the game is pretty stupid
they should have taken things from different episodes and made that the game
the graphics are good since its only playstation
the multiplayer is pretty fun
too bad this game wasnt released later on and they could have put jimmy and timmy in it
im glad i bought this game thoughthis game is pretty bad and i dont mean that in the good way
the graphics are horriblebut when it came out it was considered okay graphics and the story line is just rediculous
but this game brings back some memoried of me and my brother when we were younger and i enjoy just having this game around the house just to remember those dayswell this wrestling game was it and i played it a lot
the moves were  tough to pull off and sometimes didnt work all the time
nevertheless  this was a hell of a lot of fun
trust mesave your money and buy  smackdown
or something else from thq
it blows this awaythis was acclaims sequel to the horrendous  release of war zone
and while i will say that attitude was x better than war zone i wont say that it didnt feature some of the same flaws that war zone didill start with the goods first
there were a hoard of new match types added to the game
and while i wont list them all i will say that some of them were a triple threat fatal  way fatal  way elimination handicap gauntlet stable battle royal i quit last man standing first blood royal rumble king of the ring survivor series and many more
the variety was overwhelming and was bound to keep players busy and satisfied for the time being when playinganother plus to the game was the realistic entrances of the superstars
in war zone the entrances only consisted of you seeing the superstars come to the entrance ramp before cutting to the ring
in attitude they diligently take time to accurately add a touch of realism to every superstars entrance
for example when undertaker is on his way out the lights will slowly dim before he makes his entrance
the only thing i dont get is why the entrance way includes steps for them to walk down on
you could also pick from the raw sunday night heat or custom arena to fight in
this was another cool feature as you could pick the ring skirt choose the lighting color the color of the ropes etcwar zones challenge mode was replaced with a career mode
the superstar you choose to play as starts off on house shows trying to work their way up to raw then eventually ppvs and earn challenges for the european intercontinental and wwf championshipsperhaps the most frustrating thing about this game is the gameplay
the moves are slow and extremely hard to perform and sometimes dont even work
how slow you ask
lets just say that when you try to attempt most moves it gives your opponent enough time to attack you
the gameplay is what makes the game completely unenjoyable
its too slow the simplest moves are too generic and easy to perform and get boring easily and the crowd will let you know their disapproval as well as they begin to boo youoverall attitude is better than war zone but only in aspects that dont involve gameplay
more options to choose from but the gameplay is probably worse than war zone where at least in war zone most moves were easy to do
i still say that in your house was the best of the  games made from acclaim
but fortunately this would be their last wwf game they ever made
wwfs next major video game was smackdown that would be developed by thqthis game is only worth checking out for the great voiceover work
the gameplay itself is pretty bad
if you can pick this game up cheap do itacclaim sports release of attitude revolutionized the way wrestling games look and sound
the wwf superstars faces and bodies were scanned with stunng accuracy and detail
along with visuals each competitors theme music and partial entrance was added as well
collision errors and long loading aside this game is something else
however the controls were less than responsive
acclaim used the mortal kombat button combos for each set of moves and to be frank it was a like chris beniot a pain in the necknemesis is one scary mess
so beware
he seems to be around every corner imaginable and hes quite invincible until the end so dont get those hopes up
a decent runthrough but a bit difficultdifficulty difficulty compared the hardest resident evil re remake graphics characters sound replayability  you get more guns i believe as well as other hidden bonuses starsi really loved playing re but this installation to the series wasnt as goodi beat the game very quickly and did not see much need to go back and play again like the dual storylines and multiple endings re  hadthe nemesis following me around thoughout the entire game was just  plain annoying
for key plot points it made perfect sense but at other  times he just ran around after me while i was trying to exploreyou only  switch characters once and for a short amount of timeall in all i was  not as impressed by this game as i had expected
i definitely recommend  rentingbuying re it will take you longer to finish thats for sure  and then renting re if you are still interested in the seriesresident evil  nemesis  circa good nemesis enemy adds a new twist to the game and makes it more intense good story with twists and turns some nice bonus mini games to unlockbad graphics look pretty dated voice acting is not that great controls feel datedwill it fit your taste slow moving survival horror game which is more about moving boxes managing items and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life a scfi horror game set in a city over run with zombies and a super zombie called nemesisgame its most assocated too resident evil  dino crisis  silent hill alone in the darkadditional notes half of this game takes places during the events of resident evil  there is a remake of this game for the nintendo game cube which doesnt really upgrade anything the playable character jill was also one of the playable characters in the first resident evil in japan resident evil  nemesis is called biohazard last escapeim a huge fan of the older resident evil games and have enjoyed every one however this was my least favorite
i did enjoy exploring raccoon city but didnt like the forced encounters with nemesis
the game actually was made to tie up loose ends from resident evil  which  it did but the story just seemed to be an after thought lacking the attention the developers gave to the previous games
the game looked great as usual and the developers managed to push the ps hardware further than previous games in regards to graphical effects
the little details like water shooting from fire hydrants moths around light fixtures and mice running about on the floor as you walked by added to the ambiance
all in all a fun game though not quite as good as the others in the seriesnemesis was obviously an expansion of the mr x element found in senario b of resident evil  upon each encounter with him the screen flashes white where you must make a choice between two options of how jill will handle the situation
for example you get to choose between hiding in a chest or running out the door
the game takes place mostly in the streets of raccoon city and there are more zombies
a quick turn around  degree move was implemented whick makes running away easier
also you only can only play as jill as the main character
the graphics are better than res but the theme is not as dark which takes away from the moodthe controls and camera angles are the same as the games before it but what drags this game down is the weak story and regenerating zombies
things have gotten a bit cheesy this time around i cant really tell what it is but it feels like a washed up version of re
its like zombies are now common place and the novelty of the idea was wearing off at the time re came out
its the story that doesnt bring much to the table that really makes the game feel dull
combine that with the wack controls the dated ink ribbon save system and the limited inventory space and what you get is the negative aspects of the resident evil series without the soulpersonalitythe best feature is the nemesis element but that even at times gets annoying
the choice system sometimes punishes you for logical choices where an option seems like youll be able to run away and the other indicates that you want to stay and fight but the outcome is actually the opposite
its like those choose your own adventure games where you make an innocent choice and jump to the given page only to find you got gang raped by baboons or something like thatbecause the streets are more open there are a lot of dead ends and back tracking and what pissed me off was that zombies would regenerate for no reason or maybe for the reason to show you can never clear out a whole city of zombies
whatever
because the story is pretty mediocre i didnt get much satisfaction from beating the game aside from finally being able to put it down
that was back then
now with the recent play through taking turns with my brother we died a stupid death and immediately decided forget this game
technically its not broken its just the overall feeling of indifference that gave no incentive to soldier on
luckily capcom was able to rebound with code veronica
 starsthis game is alright
it is pretty fun and kind of scary but the game has alot of backtracking that gets annoying
dinos become very smart and mean
this game is fun but just get ready for a couple of hours of boredom before you get to the real action
the puzzles are pretty hard as well
the music is pretty good
this game is decent overall
buy if you are looking for something different than zombies chasing you aroundill do the pros and cons of this gameprosit actually feels like a survival horror game
in resident evil there was some emphasis on enemy skipping but no where near to the extent of dino crises
in this game you really do need to save your ammo
there simply isnt enough ammo to kill all the enemiesraptors are a hell of a lot scarier than zombies or dogs
petty much every common enemy in this game has the difficulty of a re hunterstory choices add great replay value to the game
multiple endingschallenging puzzlesnow for the consannoying itemmenu system
the re item system you can basically get what needs to be done in like  seconds or less
the item system in this game is so overcomplicated and annoying i almost didnt feel like giving this game a chance
this game has a sluggish startno memo copying system
if there is a password or a number you are supposed to remember youbetter have a real life pen and piece of paper next to you because i guarantee you are going to forget one of them and have to backtrack to read a memofew weapon choiceslack of a variety of enemiesits not clear at all what youre supposed to do when the caution
icon appears
leading to countless recontinuespainfully easy end bosscontrols takes some getting used to and the cam sometimes prevents you from seeing whats about to attack you and most of all this games crashes too many darn timesokay i like this game becasue its the most fun one to play more than re but if i saw this as a movie this is complete hollywood like batman and robin

it boasts high  graphics  bit yet the only tvs that are capable of handling such high  memory graphics are in the  rangethe dreamcast also boasts a  k modem which they claim will launch them into the internet gaming  market
problem k modems are narrowband and slow  anything more  graphical than tetris will get laggy over multiplayer networks especially  if the gamers are not dialing in from close locations
the highgraphic  nature of the games is not easily supported by such a harsh net  connectionhowever the dreamcast has a highly innovative game engine  allowing for opponent ai to adapt itself to your actions
this combined  with the systems graphic capablities and yes its impressive game  library make it a system worth checking outespecially with a   rebatethis system has good graphics but it was released between the time of ps and ps
sega whould have waiting  a year
while they do that they should have upgraded the system
therefore this system was not in the competition of gcn xbox and ps
nothing more to say its a disapointment that i bought this piece of junk for the price of  ps which is way better
there are only  games for this thing
im sure never gonna buy any sega consoles everthis review is directed more towards the gamer that is looking to get into older systems because i do get the feeling that most not all of the love that the dreamcast gets comes from people that owned one from the get go
i have been a gamer since the colecovisionatari days and i do still very much appreciate good old fashioned games but something tells me that many again not all people that have grown too accustomed to  anologue sticks will have a hard time going back to  stick for d games
personally psone d games havent aged well with me either and have preferred the sega genesis for my old school kickthe dreamcast does offer a decent set of adventure and survival horror games but is rather sparse in rpgs and platformers  if you love rpgs and little else then this system is not for you
there are a couple of really good ones skies of arcadia grandia  however they are also offered on other systems which might also be of interest
the dreamcast also doesnt offer much for the fps lovers that have gotten into the genre after the ps and original xbox came out
yes there are a few unreal tournament quake half life but most that love  sticks with their fpss will probably squirm with  sticknow where the dreamcasts library really shines is d fighters and space shooters
if you absolutely love either then the dreamcast is pure heaven and buying one is practically a no brainer
actually you can throw d fighters in there too since games like the original soul calibur and the power stone series are still incredibly fun
sports games are another strong suit for the library if you dont mind playing with outdated rosters sega really gave ea a run for their moneysega also had a knack for releasing some quirk that was easy to fall in love with  games like chu chu rocket and ooga booga are still  very fun multiplayer games
unfortunately some of that good quirk samba de amigo seaman are best used with accessories that have gotten rather expensive and tough to come by although im sure collectors wont mind at allin the dreamcasts favor is that it has gotten cheap
although some of the games that makes the system a worthwhile purchase have gotten expensive there are still some moderately priced options that are totally decent for those with a passing curiosity for the systemi do view this as a very niche system and i dont think that it will appeal to everyone
again this review is geared more towards people that never grew up with or owned a dreamcast
i do think that any gamer could probably have some fun with this system but i also think that many of the passerbys that picked one up years later will wonder what all the fuss was about
sure it was revolutionary in its heyday but that doesnt mean much to people that are in love with their pss wiis and s or people that simply skipped the dreamcast on their way to a ps gamecube or xboxif youre thinking about picking up a dreamcast i would suggest doing a little homework to make sure that the library suits your tastes
although it is not expensive you might end up spending a bit on games just to find out that youre really not that into iti was going to buy dreamcast but i heard people keep sayingthat dreamcast breaks a loti gave  stars because i havent used it yetthank you for pay attentioningi will state why i like and dont like the dreamcastprosgood graphics controller portsk modem built in mem
card slots per controllersmall sizeconsvery noisyno dvd playervery small amount of gamesthe games stinkcheap controllerseven though the ps is alot better system the dreamcast is cool
it was far ahead of its time though
and the games were absolutely horrible
there were very few good ones and no sonic is not one of them
athough it is a good system i would recommend getting a playstation  the dreamcast is dead and they are not making any more games for itthe vmu has some cute features like mini games and it can be your watch so you know what time it is
it has other cool features
but i dont reccomend it because all it holds is  blocks of memory
get the  slot  block each slot memory cards
it worked great for me
i just forgot what brand it was made by so youll have to look for it closely if you want it
the vmu is just kinda a waste of money
only get one of em dont even think of getting one of the coolest things dreamcast offered was the vmu
after all it was a gameboy like memory card that fit into the controller perfectly and gave it a little screen
yeah wow a screen
i still dont see how the screen is useful
in sonic adventure it displays a freaky little chao pretty much the whole time
in crazy taxi it just had an animation loop
so the ugly useless screen is out for me until i find a game that uses it
then the buttons
what are the buttons for
it goes in the controller and the buttons are covered up
when i take it out it just sits like a brick and does not display anything
so why the cute little dpad and tiny little ab
as a memory card it functions well and is conveniently placed
yet after five games i ran out of memory
five games
my gamecube memory card has close to  games on it and is only half full
even my junky third party ps memory card holds more
i could hardly fit a chao onto it
so while this is the official memory card you might be better off with a third party modelfor those of you who have not played the tekken game series it is a d fighting game that uses the same button configuration as street fighter  fierce kick medium kick weak kick
what makes tekken different from other fighting games are the moves smooth animations and the cinematic movies for each character that is used to beat the game you also get a new fighter when you beat the game however that becomes the point of the game seeing these movies
each movie unravels part of a mystery as to why your even playing the game
a person can beat the game in  minutes because each fight only lasts about  seconds so the pace is pretty fast and you dont need experience to beat the game
unfortunately there is not much noticeably different from tekken i bought it to finish my tekken collectionit runs well and still runs well no problemsyou know those games that the magazines all say is cool and your friends tell you about and its the talk of the year and when you buy it its great but your playing something else in a week
i think tekken  is one of those games
ill be honest the game itself is fun but repetative
youll soon find that all of the characters and levels never change and the tekken force mode does very little to improve
it just like the game gets old
i guarantee you will play the game all the way through just to unlock all the player videos though
if you can get the game used and very cheap buy it
its a fine game for a while but nothing youll play for yearsusually im an adventure game fanatic at heart but this game was bought for me as a gift and i found myself greatly caught up on it as soon as i installed it on my computerthe game is very much a dungeon bash situation
you create a character and assign them attributes buy them weapons and then go out to the local dungeon and pound every monster you meet bather up as much treasure as you can and then buy better weapons so you can kill even more monsterswhile youre in town the villagers will tell you about items that have been stolen that you can find and return for rewards or people who ask for your help in killing a particularly nasty monster or they tell you a bit about the big creature youll find yourself facing at the end of the game
your ultimate goal will be to gather several crystals together to gain an item that will allow you to take on the evil dragon lord at the end of the game but theres dozens of other quests to keep you occupied meanwhileone of the most innovative features to the game is that it maps each area and dungeon differently for every new game you start plus it juggles the quests around so that no one game is exactly like another
it was an interesting detail that wasnt necessary but was nice of the programmers to addall in all i was quite pleased with this game
theres times when one gets bored with confusing puzzle games and you just want to run around in a dungeon and hack up monsters
darkstone offers adventure by the bucketload and will hold your attention for awhilesystem on which this was tried out pentium iii  mhz nvidia tnt  pro  mb ram win with a monitor with  x  resolution
hardware acceleration is requiredin this review ill only consider darkstone from the viewpoint of singleplayer
darkstone is a fantasy actionadventure game but along the lines of diablo rather than black isles addstyle baldurs gate
i consider darkstone to be a diablo derivative darkstones release was after that of the original diablo but long before that of diablo ii so it has a different spin than that of diablo iigraphics are much more cartoonlike than those of diablo but as a tradeoff the different kinds of monsters really are different instead of just being a few basic types varying only by colour
some of the monster types skeletons with varying types of weapons and armour giant insects wasps bees with electrical attacks bats rats snakes lizardmen nosferatuvampires ratmen cute actually of varying strengths and armament
very occasionally a dungeon chamber will be full of vicious little chickens
quests come in two flavors and each game has a different random quest mix a minor quest consists of a townsperson walking up to the player and naming the item to be located in an appropriate spiel
the questassigner exchanges a lump sum in gold for the item a major quest on the other hand has a plot and even a puzzle to solve and ends with the award of one of the  crystals to the playerdarkstones graphics have less atmosphere than those of diablo but there are a greater variety of enemies and settings and the player has more freedom to enter higherlevel dungeons  of course after that its the players own fault if heshe is creamed for tackling highlevel enemies before the character can cope with them
on the flip side the save mechanism allows multiple save files unlike diablo and theres no penalty for dying something diablo ii adjusted
similar concepts to diablo health and mana potions and fountains magic door spells that gate back to town monsters cant follow you into town or between levels and dont respawn once youve cleaned out an area something diablo ii adjusted ability to range the countryside rather than just having a dungeon crawl something diablo ii also picked up random quest mix something diablo ii dropped unfortunately where the major quests have more eye candy and more mental challenges than diablos at least on the first visit characters have active and passive skills something diablo ii also picked up randomized dungeons except for the setpiece areas specific to major questsextra concepts the character must eat and rest but can pay for lessons in skills as well as practicing on the town training ground
while town is a safe zone the player can pickpocket town characters  including stealing eggs from a chicken
items and attacks have a more complex diablo iiish flavor including poison spells and cursed artifacts  things that can be fixed for a price
the blacksmith can upgrade as well as repair buy and sell weapons
the town usurer is a good idea
incidentally as in diablo ii the player may have a sidekick but unlike d the player can fully control either player character at willas for the dungeons themselves theyre more elaborate than those of diablo or than several of those in diablo ii  not graphically but in terms of content pressure plates to open some doors teleport pads doors that open only when switches are thrown in specific sequences
outside individual dungeons the map can be used to direct the player character to a specific locationsome poor play balance aspects the player will amass huge amounts of money and the usurer doesnt even charge a fee ais cant open doors and hold still once a door closes between you and them which leaves them at the mercy of a ranged attackannoyances voice acting ranges from ok to rotten player can replay everything said by any npc more than good morning but cant sift out just the quests left open those must be tracked on the players own time
consequently for a game thats been underway for a while the playback feature on npc conversation isnt usefulif you have a dfx card if you have a more advanced card like tnt or  geforce just dont update your drivers and you should be alright
you  dont get all the graphic benefits but it goes pretty fast in  bit mode  at  x   nice selection of cars and cocpits too
music very good
engine noise could have been better too synth but better than most racing  games
i havent driven in a while but i know what its like to go above  the speed limit on a winding road
and this game is decent at simulating  itespecicially if i play in a pitch dark roomthis is a really good game
great graphics good game play and chalnging levels all are some of ds major features
however the graphics are so good that you need more then mg ram to play
my mg  ram can run slow and im not even on the higher graphics setting
also the levels are way to hard
it sounds pathetic but im stuck on level  dont buy this game unless you are a interplay fanticstar ocean is an amazing game
however dont let the commercials it had fool you it is very linear in plot
the characters dont have very much  personality
but it has many interesting and unique points to it
it does  have many endings but the ending is not a movie and it is not chosen as  much by actions taken that have a real effect on the plot as
it is by  little things and how much character kill monsters with each other and how  they treat each other that actually chooses your endingas far as game  play it a lot better then average
it has many unique points to it
there  is a skill system for creating items from other things
also there is a  weird real time combat system where you can walk around up down left and  right to dodge but when you attack you just walk up to the enemy
however  the characters are not balanced the two main characters well probably never  leave your party being the most powerful
the voices have been translated  which is something i loved but i was not crazy about the musicas far as  plot i do love the plot
you are either claude from space who accidentally  gets teleported to a planet where he meets rene and then is accused of  being someone they call the hero of light
or you are rene the person whos  past is a bit mysterious for a while who meets claude when he is sent to  the planet
which ever character you are the game well move in the same  direction though and be  the same so dont worry to hard over which  characterthe graphics are nice
most of the character pictures look  good except for the  eyed characters who dont look very well done
the  enemies normally dont look very good but the background they are in looks  nice even though graphics were not this games strong pointand finally  as far as length of time it can stay interesting it can stay around for a  long time
as an rpg after you beat it there isnt anything left to do with  it
it does last a while though
it should take you around a week to beat  if you have a lot of spare time and play it more then  hours a  dayoverall i recommend buying star ocean but there are other games you  may want to get firstthis game was immense
the sheer volume of options in character development was overwhelming
if you want a game on a grand scale this is the one for you
the storyline is very good and the skill system was a  very good idea
characters are not developed enough but interaction  between them was interesting especially the way that it affected the game
the final battle is unfairly difficult
it requires more skill than luck  to complete
replay value is probably this games greatest attribute
because the game is so affected by your actions it can be very different
also there are a wide variety of characters that you can use
these  things combined with the skill system can make this into a somewhat  different game each time you play it
if you are not short on patience  this can be a very fun game with a lot of replay valuei waited over ten years to play this game
i bought it over ten years ago around   even by that point it was in the bargain bin shelf of jewel cases
unfortunately i was too busy in my life to play it and waited nearly a decade before i had enough free time
getting it running on vista definitely took some moxie  i would have saved hours if i had simply played through it ten years agoi had heard how original and fun the game was but frankly it was a lot better before i actually sat down to play it if you know what i mean
once you learn how to play the campaign stages get quite repetitive and the games sense of humor gets trying
additionally i feel the gamemakers attempt to shoehorn d into this game didnt add much and could have been completely dispensed with  at least it should have been optional
finally it ultimately gets to be unsatisfying to make your dungeons since the fog of war prevents you from planning intelligently and the space you are given to dig in seems inadequate even in the later campaign missionsanyhow here are two big issues  the thing is full of bugs and the company that made it is now defunct so there wont be any more patches issued
the latest official patch was   this was meant to run on windows     me according to the packaging
ive also never had a problem running it on xp
it is possible to get it fully running on vista or  and i am here to tell you it can be done
try some combination of these starting with f then da
right click and run program as administratorb
on the compatibility tab set it to run in windows  disable visual themes disable desktop composition anddisable display scaling on high dpi settingsc
although dkii puts a shortcut on your desktop i found have it not to work with vista or   you must go into the original bullfrog folder and launch the game directly from the executable keeping in mind a and b aboved
right click on your desktop
under display settings disable hardware acceleration
if you cant do this sweepingly eg because you have an nvidia go to the nvidia control panel for dkii and disable virtually everything especially texture filteringe
bear in mind that dkii not only runs its own executable but it runs another program simultaneously which is actually the game engine
the process shows as ipexe
so anything you do to the dkiiexe should also be done to thatf
run dkii
go into the graphics options uncheck all those boxes  visual translucency environment mapping and especially the last  hardware acceleration
set shadow detail to   what you do with gamma is irrelevantg
you can get quite discouraged if youre going through all this and you keep getting those black squares on the menu screens
but if you go into the graphics options and keep finding that upon being restarted the game has rechecked hardware acceleration without your permission do not be angry
simply accept
go back into the main menu and load an actual pet dungeon or a campaign dungeon
when dkii reloads one of those that check should go away and stay away even after you close the game
in other words when you uncheck hardware acceleration the game must actually load a dungeon for this to take effect
if you simply uncheck it and exit the game it wont takein addition i have posted a link to a youtube video in the comments that i found helpful in this struggleh
it is not my experience that setting graphics options to low or running the game in x is going to help you at all when trying to get it to run under windows vista and windows i
it shouldnt matter whether you applied the patch or not  i have gotten it to run both ways on windows vista and windows  although only with the final  patch  i dont know about the three or four patches that came before that all of which are still available on the internet as of this writingj
if all else fails be aware that it might be your sound card thats causing a problem not your video card
this game seems to like simple sound cards and has a reputation for not working on account of the newer snazzier ones
if all else fails try disabling your spiffy sound card in the device manager to see if the onboard sound on your mother board will give this a passby the way i want the world to know that it took me longer to figure out how to play this under windows vista and windows  than i actually spent playing the gamehope this helps someonei bought the original version of this whats advertised here as well as the upgrade disk to gold the full version of which is the betterknown version and recently bought the steam versionthere is a patch to this which gives you a few extra features
i have never been able to make it work on xp and definitely cant make it work on modern hardware in xp
there may be a way to do so but ive never found itthe gold version can be made to run on xp with modern hardware and there are some fanpatches out there that improve that somewhat
its still a challenge howeverthe gold version has a number of improvements but one massive downgrade
thats with the ingame videos
the original version this one has videos done by actors not great actors but competent ones
the gold version which is also the basis for the steam version has ingame videos using the game developers playing parts and doing so in horrible fashion keep the day jobs guys
for anyone who doesnt know what im talking about these arent fmv bits theyre the things that show up on video screens throughout the game which are supposed to drive plot points and tell you what your next task ought to be
the improved versions are almost unintelligible and embarassingly badlyacted
the original ones in this version are far better even if slightly lower resolutionthe good thing is that you can put the videos from this version into the other versions
so  that alone is a great reason to buy this versionnow the steam version which is essentially the gold version has somehow been altered so that it plays perfectly on my highend modern pc
but it has the cruddy developers as actors video bitsmy recommendation
buy this  and buy the steam version and put the vids from this into the steam versions fmv folder
thatll give you the best possible solutionif you have an older system youll be able to run this just fine most likely of course but its a real challenge  one ive never been able to achieve  to make it work on a modern systemthis is just one of those titles that you pop in and expect to be taken back to a similar time
eh maybe not so much as youd think
its not a bad game by any means but it is one of those early d games that just hasnt gotten the camera down quite yet
that and big the catbuy this game if you really want to go back down memory lane but just remember to temper your enthusiasmsonic adventure is a pretty good game
i came into this one expecting a game like the old sonic games
it is nothing like that
it really is a fullblown adventure
personally i was looking forward to more side scrolling action
navigating the d can get a bit tedious at times
if you have no problems with that then this game is for youthis game is broken down into three components
there is the adventure mode that is quite subpar minigames that are mediocre and finally the stages that are very fun to play
once you clear a stage or minigame on the adventure mode it unlocks and you may just play it by itself from the main menu when the game boots up
you may play as  different characters all with their own unique stories stages and minigames
i thought this was a brilliant implementation of the game
although admittedly the sonic and tails stages are way more fun the the stages for big the cat knuckles or the robot
the amy stages are somewhere in the middlethe controls are somewhat frustrating at times particularly in the adventure mode
the npc humans in the adventure mode look downright like stick figures graphically and stand there like manequins unless you knock into them
then they flinch for a moment and go right back to their original positionthe adventure mode plays like an exploration game
you must figure out what to do to get to the next cutscene minigame or stage
you must find the object or area that will take you to it
this is a rather mundane and boring sometimes frustrating part of the gamesometimes the camera angles in this game make it so you can not see your character or get any sense of direction
again this is most often in the adventure modethe cutscenes in the adventure mode are well presented and timed
the fade from the adventure mode to the cutscenes is well paced
the graphics look great and soundtrack well performedi highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the sonic characters as you can play and develop so many of them
if you like action or d platformer type games you will probably enjoy this game as wellthis game is definitely worth a play though to see if you like it
i did i own it have beaten the game with several of the characters and still enjoy playing it to this day
however this game is hardly the best the dreamcast has to offerthis is the one game that by now every dreamcast owner already has
and deservedly so its easy to pick up and its blindingly fast
problem is its so fast youll blow right through it in a few hours
its too bad sega felt the need to tack on the other characters
all the nonsonic levels are boring especially the big cat levels where you fish
then theres the terrible music
i recommend muting your tv and playing your own music on a cd player because the ingame music just doesnt work at all
or you could listen to it for a good laughi had heard all the hype about virtua fighter tb for the dreamcast and when i saw it for cheap i picked it up expecting a hell of a fighting game
what i got was a mixed bag this game is nowhere as fun as people say and cant hold a candle to other fighting games like soul calibur and dead or alive  for the dreamcast in terms of graphics play modes and playability
the graphics dont even look like dreamcast graphics they look like the game was developed on the sega saturn but the cons end there
the gameplay is deep however the fighting styles take a lot of time to master for each character and after you do the game is a breeze
its a decent fighting game but nowhere as good as it is said to bei am not a huge fan of the d fighting games i prefer d fighters but i must say virtua fighter tb is a great game
i bought this game a few days ago and played it and i liked it
it is different from d fighters in the sense that it adds more realism to the bouts no fancy fireballs or stuff like that just pure strategic hand to hand contact fighting
it takes a while to know your moves but once you get it you will enjoy this game
i gave it three stars because i still havent learned the moves and i hear soul calibur is the better choice but do not dismiss this game just yet it will definetely deliverin the varied and overcrowded plateu of firstperson games its always  nice to see someone try to break away from the mold but unfortately  system shock  comes a little too late
having missed the chance to beat  halflife to the punch this game is a fun play but one best borrowed from  a friendss is a good quality game
like others i find the atmosphere creepy and the elements of gameplay innovative but the same elements of gameplay are just too difficult to adjust to
i made the first mistake of assuming that if i brought up the items screen the game would pause thanks to conditioning from deus ex and morrowind
it didnt and i got the snot slapped out of me by a hybrid
lesson learned i made damn sure to clear an area out first before i did anything with inventory
that quip aside this is a fairly decent game
the only other problem is that as you progress the ability to travel between areas perviously explored becomes less and less and you have less freedom to explore whole areas since many places are closed off it feels like being herded down a ramp to the ending like when on the rickenbauker
as a note i borrowed this game from a friend since i refuse to purchase a game that is older than deus ex but cost more than deus ex
if the graphics were stellar and on par with halflife i could understand
but seriously charging  plus dollars for an older game such as this when i got the goty edition of deus ex for  just sort of kills the initiative to buy it not to mention it is a gross ripoff of customers
i would consider purchasing it if the price went down to say at the least  flat at the most
again great game when a few flaws but not worth the cost when all you get is a jewel case and a cd
do you really think someone is going to fork out  for just a cd case and no manual
didnt think sofirst off why do top designers make mistakes like  building a game thats so dark i cant see the gamma controls in options
believe it or not they used a dark blue control for the gamma and the page is black
the other  controls on the page are light green
this little artistic flourish sent me  on a three day journey of frustration to play the game and get the  brightness up
navy on black is idiotic
too many designers use tiny  letters and obscure illegible fonts for games
we dont all have  inch  monitors you know
please keep an eye on the fools you hire to deal with  the simple things like choosing fonts and background colors
now on to  other issuesthe story is intriguing
the opening music was great and  got me interested inspite of the rather choppy and low quality cut scenes
what happens to that great opening music later
it turns into action  disco buttkickin game music that i hatetraining could be more  involved
i needed to play over and over to get to any proficiency with the  many controls and seemingly endless information kiosks
i dont really play  games because i want to read so why not just give all the information on  the mfd or pfd device in voice format instead of having us read all this  drivel
better yet build a training  mission with us actually having a  stress free environment to really work on skills and become familiar with  controls
hey
heres an idea
you know those training missions i fly off  on but i really dont go i just watch the movie
i wonder if my ugly  woman is still waiting for me
why not really send me on that mission to  learn
what a thoughtwhy cant i choose a weapon or get some health  when im in user mode
the action doesnt pause and the monsters just keep  pounding away and sneaking up which i just find stressful
i know youre  trying to put me in the situation but i like to pause and think
you can  forget that in this gameheres another annoyance
you go to this  vending machine to buy bullets and health and soda or whatever and first  you have to select what you want on this complicated interface after you  figure out what it costs from the tiny numbers buried off on the side
thats already annoying but then you have to pick the items up  individually and then you have to go to user mode and quotusequot them
just forget it if youre bein attacked and most likely you will be
a  possible reason for all this difficulty is that you should learn to turn  off the security before trying to purchase anything
once again this is  annoying to meis this a new genre
action adventure role playing
sort of
i think of it as an action adventure with a tedious learning curve  and a lot of dull reading
its a boring second year college course
the  psionics have me interested the inability to use guns is frustrating at  first and theres too many monsters to deal with wrench stylethe  ghosts are great
i didnt have any kind of religious moment or anything  like ive read some people describe but then i knew the ghosts were there  because id read the review beforehand and now so have you
the monsters  or ex crew or whatever they are are scary but they are also blurry and  unlike some people this game didnt really scare me to death and make me  wary when im alone or anything like thatthere are a lot of good games  out right now and im having a hard time devoting much time to this time  demanding game
i do appreciate the innovation involved in this game but i  also loathe the geeky qualites of unnecessary complication
then again  without all the skills this would be just like half life or doom or  whatever
doom with ghostswell this is a bit tricky
ya see as far as light gun shooters go this is by far the best ive ever seen on any system at any time
on the other hand some things are just plain awful
well lets start with the goodthe graphics are just plain jaw dropping
the backgrounds and environments are a little simple but the zombies and the way they react to being shot is insane
the first time i saw this game i couldnt believe me eyes
the sheer amount of enemies the fast pace the gruesome look
you wont really notice the bad when youre looking through the sight of a gun blasting down anything that moves trying to stay alivethe way zombies react to being shot is amazing
youll have to pump several rounds into the body to kill one usually blasting a hole clean through them
even a well placed headshot may not do the trick though as some zombies will keep coming at you even with half their face blown clean off
others are armored and armed to the teeth and know how to use tools for protection
it makes it quite interestingso far as zombie graphics and good shooting fun go this game is simply unmatched
story wise however it fails so hard it hurts
the script and voice acting is just atrocious
one of the worse in video game history
i dont know if its meant to be some kinda b movie joke but its not funny
its just plain awful
thankfully you can skip it all and save yourself the headachesadly you can beat it in a single  minute sitting or so but these games are never really all that long
a training mode adds some length but that doesnt last long before it just gets dull
this isnt a deep game this isnt genre busting its just a good and fun ol fashion shoot em up with some gruesomely cool gore
i still play it whenever im in the mood for something different and for the most part its still a lot of fun
thats a lot of replay value
if you can still find it its real cheap these days
great game to play with friends and after trigun marathons
well worth the sub  range rirathcomi bought this game thinking that it would take up hours of my time and that it would be fun
i was right in thinking that it was fun but the game is way too short
theres almost no strategy in this game if you know how to mash the buttons repeatedly for a long time then youll beat this game in about twenty minutes
sure there are a plethora of weapons to use and you can play with a friend cooperatively or against each other but it wont entertain you forever
although you get to chose from three players and chose from three differennt starting points all routes in the game are basically the same
if you like fighting games with tons of weapons then get it
however if you want to be satisfied with a game for more than twenty minutes im sure you can find something betterdynamite cop is a  player d beatemup in the tradition of final fight and streets of rage
you choose from one of three characters plus a couple of secret ones and pummel your way through room after room of thugs
the graphics and sound are decent and retain the same feel as diehard arcade
the action is quite frantic compared to other games in the same genre and it is a bit on the short side it only takes about  minutes to beat but dynamite cop does offer a few new fun elements
the ability to use almost anything as a weapon is one of the main draws of the game
pistols grenades rocket launchers tables chairs and even food can be utilized to dispose of opponents
torturing the enemies with grapples and throws is also an extremely fun feature
it could have been longer and more in depth but if you are looking for a  player brawler and some cheap thrills dynamite cop is a decent pick
especially if you consider that there arent many quality games of this type around anymoreworks okaythis game is a little on the boring sidethe graphics are gooda nice twist on the board gamethe ai is a bit dumbafter playing the demo for mechwarrior  i was less than inspired and unlike the venerable mechwarrior  saw no reason to buying it
well  boredom and impulsiveness lured me into finally purchasing the game mainly  because it was on special
considering there is four years of development  and technology in mechwarrior  over activisions older title  mechwarrior  is the better
sure the graphics are inferior and there are  play touches evident in the newer game but there is a much grander feel to  wherein you have to combat jade falcon clan across several worlds whereas  in mw you take the role as a mechwarrior with eridani light horse tackling  clan smoke jaguar on only one world
this lack of scope hampers the game  tremendously plus the game also lacks the connectivity that mw had to the  entire battletech universegame setup is simple and once installed  the user is treated a rather nice opening segue of light horse forces  fighting a desperate battle against superior clan forces and eventually  luring them into a trap
from there the player is given the option of  campaign training instant action multiplayer options amp credits from  the main screen
training is tedious and drawn out so i suggest using the  instant action option and scaling battles up as you become more and more  familiar with mech controls and systems
i havent tried multiplayer yet  simply because i know there are going to be way too many cowards cheating  for me to enjoy battling against other players
campaign mode deals with an  invasion of the smoke jaguar home world and using it as a stepping stone to  strana mechty in  yawnnot much of a story here im afraid  and thats only half of the troubles for this game
its buggy
while my  system exceeds system requirements by light years the game routinely dumps  me back out to my windows desktop once after my mech overheated and shut  down
worse the games sound effects get so messed up that pressing an on  screen selector to move lrms to your mech results in a burst of  autocannon fire issuing from your speakers instead of a beep
this happens  mainly in the arming amp load out menus with sound effects overriding  what was originally there
it also happens ingame when your mfbs encircle  your mech unit to repair it repair sounds are replaced by explosions  weapons fire mission successful mech powerup detected etc
it gets  annoying fast
my jump jets on mech units have never once worked  properlythe graphics are a mixed bag of some very nice designs in  buildings and other structures that give a nice sense of scale while in  your mech
terrain is quite good but very limited in variety
the  battlemechs themselves are well designed by surface bitmaps are very  busy giving the mechs an extremely cluttered look
mech animations have a  very nice look to them conveying a sense of weight in motion
microprose  for some reason changed the damage model and suddenly time on target  becomes a necessity in order to deliver any appreciable damage you your  target
if your med pulse laser does  points of damage and you do not  concentrate it on a single location such as a limb it gets spread around  to the rest of the mech
very quickly does the player learn the value of  twin ubac s
or god help you twin gauss cannons
whoohoo
i actually  made a daishi in the instant action section that mounted  gauss it had  limited ammo but anything i shot stopped shooting backmicrosoft  will be doing mechwarrior  and given they are also making the xbox  sounds like something charles xavier might make to battle magneto or  something i am not sure if pc gamers will see it
however it is also  looking that the xbox will be based on pc architecture which means the  games might be cross compatible
for now however mechwarrior  is a  mixed bag of some very good things but perhaps at least in my case too  many bad things to make it very much fun
maybe ill try the multiplayer  option and see if it gets any better
until then i still have my old copy  of mechwarrior  kicking around and theres a dfx version of mercenaries  available as well
this game could have been so much better but too many  problems drag it back into the realm of mediocrityages in the making and a bit of a disappointment mechwarrior  isnt sufficiently different to the ancient venerable mechwarrior  and suffers from the lumbering nature of mechtomech combat  even the best simulation of big slow robots fighting each other boils down to a series of largely static duels
its not complex enough for there to be a strategy hook and not cartoony enough to be fun on a visceral level
fittingly for a sequel to one of the nicestlooking games of  the presentation is excellent although the fantastic music from the original game has been ditched in favour of some anonymous inferior imitations
as before the weapons you have are an odd bunch  although you can kit your mech out with a variety of equipment you eventually realise that only heavy lasers and heat sinks are any use
machineguns and missiles are strangely ineffective and it seems unsatisfying to spend the entire game painting the legs of enemy mechs with weedy lasers
despite a fouryear wait the game seems underwhelming
not bad as such just very forgettable
there arent many missions and only one of them in which you have to intercept a train presents a major challenge and when its over it just seems to fade from the mind
except for the voice acting which is fine but having them say aff
as a salutation whilst true to the battletech universe sounds extremely camp
the intro movie is fantastic by the wayfor those of you wanting a good flight sim
turn to janesi am a hardcore flight simmer
flight sims even convienced me to join the navy aviation
but this games graphics are rather sad
i mean i have a serous  system mhz p mb ram mb videoram nvida geforce card
well enough  about my system
back to the game
the flight modeling is good but the  game in the nicest way possible sucks
spend your money on fa usaf  or flanker  if you are a hardcore flight simmer looking for a new game  for the arsenal
take my military honor on itfirst of all you will not get what you see in the picture
the controller is very light and the buttons are stiff and stick way out
the buttons on the front also feel loose
also the cord is very short
it is maybe  feet long
so i have to pull out my console to use this controller in my recliner
i bought this controller to use with my retron  and it works
bottom line if you are picky about your game controllers then i would suggest that you get an official nintendo licensed controller
if youre not picky this controller will work for youi bought two a few weeks ago and i almost need to buy two more already
definitely not made for aggressive gamersnot great but it does the job just fine and for the price it makes no sense to complain about an item that worksthis is a fun game until you complete a park
it gets dull and boring
and one thing that makes me a little upset is that this game has one park that has a ton of rides and the other parks only have one ride already built
so thats all folksi am what you would call call a tycoon junkie but not much into the scenerio games that come with the tycoon gamesif they only had more freeform games this game would have gotten a  stari suggest you wait until november when they release rct this game is average
it is a pretty fun sim
i played it for about a month straight
you get to make your dream theme park
one problem i didnt really like is there isnt enough room in the parks
it gets pretty boring when there isnt enough room to build a really cool roller coaster you want to build
but all and all this game is funi bought roller coaster tycoon because it looked interesting and the option to build roller coasters reminded me of disneys old game coaster
i played it for a while and bought the expansion pack but it just didnt hold my attentionwhen i bought it it looked like a game for all ages but after playing it for a while it really seemed like it was designed for kids not adults
the whole nausea feature with guests vomiting all over really got old after a while
also the graphics arent bad but theres no variation in the guests they all look like bald men even the staffonce youve played all the scenarios theres no more and there isnt a create your own and just play option everything has a scenario
you can keep playing them after youve won them but youre limited to the land and the setup of that scenariothe speed is also an issue you either have go or stop theres no way to slow down or speed up time and most scenarios require a time limit like a year or three years
unfortunately if youve won the scenario at the end of year one of a three year scenario youre stuck
you have to wait out the next two years and theres no way to set the game at a top speed so it will end faster
the opposite is true as well if youre almost out of time and havent met the conditions you cant slow down the game to help you plan things outon the good side the general graphics look nice you can figured the game out pretty well on your own and theres a nice variety of roller coasters
you have plenty of things to play with in the game but theres just enough to it that i wouldnt consider it a fantastic gamewell i dont really see what the big deal is
its one of those games that completely addicts you in the beginning but after a while you start to get sick of watching the roller coaster you spent an hour on just go crashing to the groundonce you meet the first challenge the rest are basically the same just a little harder
all of the people i know who got the game got too tired of it before they could finish iteven though i dont like it now there was a short period when i stayed up past am playing it
i guess its an average game at first you are totally into it but shortly after you loose interest
i recommend this game to gamers who dont really have anything to do and are just looking for a cute game to waste their time playing
rollercoaster tycoon probably wont be as popular with some of the older kids a little too young
also its a little too tedious for really little kids
i give it  starsi bought this item at best buy  for use with my nes emulator on my laptop
on the plus side winxp recognizes this thing right away and youre good to go
however like a lot of other users i found the d pad to be a problem
i screwed in the quotjoystickquot thingie and didnt find it made any difference
when i would hold it up or down it would move in different diagonal directions
there were certain movesfunctions i could not do in my nes games because of this
so yeah its usuable if you dont need to hold it up or down for more than  a second
not bad for the price but if you want full functionality spend a few more bucks and get something betterthe fact that this controller is cheap usb plug and play ready and so similar to the playstation controller is the reason its a solid bethowever here are the problems the directional pad is innacurate on precision
if you just need to walk around in a game its great but if you need to hit a specific direction it will come off usually as a diagonal
the buttons are very loud and get stuck
the green button doesnt pop out most of the time anymore
it seems like a small problem but it can get very frustratingthis is a good buy but not your best choice
if you need a quick cheap way to not having to use your keyboard its well worth your moneyamong emulation gamers this is a common gamepad
its a mix between the snes and playstation pads the one before they went analog
you have the  candy colored buttons like the japanese super famicom pad us snes pads just had grey buttons start and select exactly where they should be and  shoulder buttons  of those would be l and r the other two id map to the save state  load state function on zsnesi cant say i care for the dpad though its bumpy and has a screwhole
nothing like the tried and true cross of my yesterdays
its a fair pad for just zsnes but if you wanna do other stuff get a liksang adapter download joykey and dig any standard or aftermarket psps pad out of your closet
you can map keys to buttons and mouse to analog sticks
works even with the pc games that normally were keyboardmouse onlya game that could of been one of the best games in the world for me
i love star wars from movies to games
and stratagy scifi battle games are my favorite usually out of all electronic gamesn pc playstation etc
but this was a dissapointment
for one thing the battle graphics are horrendous
on the battle screen one starfightera squadron of  unless they are weakened and shoot one laser to symbolize them battleing
and they fly around like they were on strings
now how cheesy is that
the capital ships in the battle screen are low in detail and have the symbolizing lasers
also it is a pain to get the ships to do what you want them to do
all in all the battle scenes are one of the worst ive ever seen
but i can sat it could be worse
now in normal game play it is a little better
the main galactic display is fairly easy to use an descent graphics
also the sound and music in this area are ok too
though it is more of a pain than a good time to start a new game
it takes several hours just to get of the ground
few planets have shipyards and construction bases and the ones who do have them are slow and transporting buildings all over the galaxy can take forever
one good thing about this game is it has a breif encylopedia of some of the things in the star wars universe  i think force commander was another attempt of this game on the ground instead of in space and it was much better but still hard to use
i think the next star wars rebellion type game should be more like a star wars version of pax imperia entiment domain
final verdict i wrote this review to educate all of the hardcore gamers out thereespecially those who love long rpgs
dont get me wrong the playstation has a lot of great games and the the controllers are quite durable and well designed
the problem with the playstation lies within its hardware
if you play games a lot especially role playing games be ready to invest in a new playstation about every  months
i use my playstation about  hour a daysometimes more when playing through a role playing game and ive had to go through  playstations in the past couple of years
there are several factors that contribute to the breaking down of the playstation
overheating the track wearing out and the cd chuck under the lid that falls apart after a while
the overheating problem can be aleviated by investing in a cooling fan but there is not much else you can do for the other problems
typical signs of overuse include skipping longer load times and freezing
dont bother turning the system on its side or upside down doing so will only further ruin the playstation and your disc and is probably also a fire hazard
my only advice is keep your playstation out of hot places away from lots of electronic equipment do not put it on top of a vcr and always unplug it after use the ac adapter device is internal therefore causing the system to heat up even when not in use if you do not unplug it
hopefully sony will learn from this and the playstation  will be a lot more durablethis makes for a great addition to any game that supports it
however it makes an already awkward controller that much harder to useif you are a roller coaster or amusement park enthusiast then you will find this game entertaining at least for a while
the problem with the game is that you can pretty easily build all of the rides and attractions and then you dont really have that much to do
this game simply lacks the mental challenges that are needed to make a game like this a masterpieceoverall it has excellent animation graphics and virtual reality features like when you ride your own roller coastersi would recommend this game for a novice quotsimquot player or for childrenteenagers
above that it isnt challenging enough to make it worth your whilesim theme parktheme park world are part of what i like to think of as the bullfrog trilogy
these three games this one populous the beginning and dungeon keeper  all from british company bullfrog all use a similar spectacular graphics engine and all fall roughly into the realtime strategy category
there is a marvellous aesthetic sense which pervades each of themin stptpw a sequel to s theme park you lay down paths and theme park attractions then open your gates to an evergrowing throng of youngsters eager to buy your burgers and fries right before going on a looptheloop mph roller coaster
vomit figures heavily into your equations
rather oddly for a theme park sim though absolutely typical for rts you hire researchers who research advanced rides for younot to mention advanced concepts like the gift shop or the restaurant
with the right balance of attractions and staff and financial savvy you can change your
park from a travellingcarny level experience to a nighdisneyworld extravagaznawell sort of
each of the four parks has a specific theme and must stay within that theme
no disneyland style division fantasyland tomorrowland etc
in a single park
understandable given the strain that would put on the hardwarebut unfortunatelike the other games in the bullfrog trilogy there is considerable well thats cool factor
and bullfrog created a downloadable ride patch which theoretically could give the product some real legsbut there is even less actual game here than in the other two
and after you finish your first park youll find that youre playing the exact same game on your second park
and third
every park has the same number and type of rides sideshows refreshment stands and miscellaneous objectsplaying is not unlike eating a huge cone of cotton candy sweet but not particularly satisfyingits also a good example of a product at crosspurposes with itself
theres considerable toy value in the game its a pleasure to build your park
typical of bullfrog games the interface is clean simple and rewarding
experiencing the game from the first person is a real treat
butevery moment you take to smell the ft high artificial roses wonderland park is a moment where something is going wrong in your park
this is where the gameplay comes in unfortunatelywhen you have grown your park to a good size youll be stopping whatever youre doing every minute or so to schedule repairs
now theres a simple rule you dont run rides in the red so you check your maintenance report and shutdown any rides that are going from yellow to redthing is its so mechanical it wouldve been easier to just set a bar for the point at which the mechanics would go repair things
they could shut the rides down when they got there
the way it works now is you have to shut the ride down and wait for a mechanic to show up or drop one there
this is true of the rest of the staff too
they wander around their patrol areas one presumes because they dont have access to your big park map showing all the problem spots
and you cant stagger their breakwork times so they can all be waiting for an opening in the staff breakroom while your park goes to heckif bullfrog had taken that out though there wouldnt have been much left to do except adjust the amount of fries on the salt
and typical of the implementation of business simulation you have to adjust each stand individually as you build it or flip back to a stand that has the settings you want and click the global setting buttontheres the crosspurpose trying to make a business simulation out of it
building a park at the microlevel is funmanaging it at that level is a choreif they had gone the other way with the business simulation and allowed you to handle things like promotions suppliers unions and lawyers one of your pleasures could have been taking a break from it all to go to the park
but that wouldnt really fit neatly into the categories that all games must now belong
anyway its hard to actually dislike such a goodnatured easytoplay game and theres a lot of fun here despite the flaws
hence three starsi am yet to find an electronic arts game that does not provide me with hours of entertainment
however with all the quottheme parkquot simulation games on the web i advise you to chose the roller coaster tycoon gameswhy do i advise you to chose the tycoon games
the roller coaster tycoon has better more realistic and more playable graphics
of course if you are one who enjoys the cartoonist preception of the characters this will be an okay feature
however i recommend looking for screenshots of this game to see if you like the graphics
sim theme park clogs up your computer system much worse than roller coaster tycoon so unless you have a pretty fast system be prepared for some freezing where with roller coaster tycoon you can pretty much play with out annoying slowness
sim theme park gets boring fast with its last of great rides themesdont get me wrong i love simulation games
they are my ultimate favorite but i sincerely recommend the roller coaster tyoon games
they cost less have better reviews better graphics in my opinion and more rides and themes and in addition they dont freeze up your older computer as much as sim theme parkas with most people reviewing this game check out the roller coaster tycoon games i guarentee you cannot be disappoint with themwhen i first got sim theme park i thought it would be a great game
a week later it got very boring
unlike roller coaster tycoon everything is very expensive
a trash can for example costs 
in roller coaster tycoon a trash can costs 
also theres this advisor that shouldnt have been so picky
hell say your janitors patrol areas arent just perfect or one person just littered
big deal
again unlike rct it has only four themes one per park
i also dont like the idea of golden tickets and golden keys which you need to access other parks
its really hard to get things just perfect and since everything is expensive and you cant charge for rides your cash balance is low all of the time until five years later in game time
you dont have a very large selection of rides especially at the start
overall this game really bites the dust and if you dont have roller coaster tycoon yet get that insteadthe game has som good qualities and som things other theam park games dont have includeing adjustable resurch and ride proformance and the ability to walk the park and ride the rides navigating the controls and menues is easy however u cant paint anything or change the colors its good but it cant compare to rollercoaster tycoon sim theme park is bullfrogs answer to the crown that was stolen from them by roller coaster tycoon  bullfrog made the first theme park developer game theme park and comes close but falls short in many ways
first the  good stuff stp has a fantastic graphic engine which makes the rides look  fantastic
the ability to ride the rides you make and walk through your  park is a major plus
but the bad part is that the game lacks depth
beat  the first park and the game is basicly over you get  new parks but there  just the same rides with diffrent looks
the game requires a d card and  some hefty space on your computer to run some what smoothly
if your  looking for a great game with more options and fun that can run on your  computer no matter what go with roller coaster tycoon and youll be hooked  and love every minute of it
by the way dont pay  bucks for it either  id sell my copy of it without the box just instructions and game for   or less
only get this if your a diehard theme park fan or are looking for  a couple hours of graphic blisssim theme park is a bad copy of rollercoaster tycoon which was way better than sim theme park
i you buy it buy it usedsim theme park is both complex and simple at once which can get confusing
it seems to be aimed at the grade school set yet includes controls which end up being complex
the d graphics are eyepoppingly fancy and the rides and attractions are clever but the theme parks dont seem real like they do in roller coaster tycoon
nevertheless this game is a fun addition to your sim librarythis game is equipped with a tutorial mode which introduces us to an annoying little character who talks all the time attempting to explain how each control works
after i turned the tutorialguy off i found it much more pleasant to play this game in which you design a theme park complete with rides sideshows restaurants a staff and other attractionsthis game features parks with disneylandworthy themes such as halloween coffin restrooms
and prehistory think a kinder gentler jurassic park which have clever rides and attractionsone really cool feature is the quotride itquot option which allows you to see your ride from the perspective of someone who is on the ride
you can also see things from the perspective of security cameras
this is fun but the novelty wears offi enjoyed checking out the various types of theme parks in this game which you get to play by earning golden keys for reaching certain goals but i ended up going back to roller coaster tycoon which i think is a superior game
i give this game  stars for anyone over  but possibly more stars for anyone youngerthis will not be a very helpfull review but read anyway
this is a very fun game but i gave it  stars cuz the graphics were never really that great especially for todays standards and  multiplayer mode has too many cheaters who upload special weapons from their computers and kill you instead of playing the game
its a great deal at  nine bucks thoughwhen i first played this game  years ago i was blown away by its reality and detail
it was a rpg brought to exceptionally detailed life
todays games have left diablo behind but i still never did manage to beat it with the sorceror character who was just too darn weak
despite its age and quotprimitivequot technology this game is still worth its low price because it can provide a couple of weeks of entertainment before it is beaten
diablo ii is definitely worth getting after this one and has lots of terrific addons and the warchest is a great deal overalli got this game when they came out with diablo two and i was disapointed by the spells and some other stuff but i found myself playing it a good amount and  if you cant aford diablo  wich now probley doesnt cost much this is the right gamethis was an amazing game when i first got it a million years ago or so
funny thing is they were talking about diablo  in developement back then but i didnt see it for at least another  and a half yearsif you happen to be running a computer that is older than dirt go ahead and buy this game i think it is great but it is way past its time
as a matter of fact i think i saw someone playing it the last time i was in amish countrymeh this game isnt too great as far as rpgs go just about average
just really a dressed up pokemon and when ure playing a system featuring games like chrono cross final fantasy ix and breath of fire  this is very inferior
really just for the fansthe game is cool however its an online game with just a single player tutorial
the game would be a quotquot but because of the attitudes of the children playing online it only gets a quotquot
dont waste your moneymany people praise starcraft for being a great rts but i have found my money spent better elsewhere
starcraft begins as a whole lotta fun very challenging but the cons outweigh the pros in this botched gamelets start with the good
the internet play is excellent use map settings offers many different types of games to play and make
the campaign missions are challenging and fun as well
the units are fun to  and to employ in your armyok now the bad
the units are horribly unbalanced
the three different races play so different from each other you actually have to get used to each of them
the unit balance is something that really disgusts me as well
zealots simply rule over marines even though in a sense they are supposed to be equals for the two races
the next concern is ai
the ai is simply terrible
i was appalled at how horrible the computer played
i wonder how long blizzard worked on the ai
the coding must have simply been quotbuild miner mine attackquot
the graphics are outdated by this day but that is not so problematic that anyone should care about it in their decision to buy the game
the map editor could have been improved but instead people have to download the map editor hacks to make a good map
the voice acting is good nothing to be ashamed of
the cinematics were excellently done that is true
but the cinematics dont come in abundance once youre done with the campaigns thats it
goodbyethe use map settings feature is one thing that saves this game from the abyss
its fun to make custom scenarios that are actually able to be played for a long time rather than melee games which are simply quot quotwell if you really want a good rts i do not suggest starcraft
however if you like strictly military based rtss that have good sound effects and a nice system of play this is your gamethis is a pretty good game
i just couldnt get into get like some i do
game play is simple and the plot runs along well
im a bit old fashioned and like a little simpler game layout but the game will pull you inthis exspantion pack increase the defensive and offensive cappablilities of alot of old favorites and adds some new characters to the scene
this is a must for any true hard core starcraft lovin zerg smashin freakvery old tech but fun for the younger set in the familyi bought starcraft as a gold box deal
the price was right but again i have learned the hard way
the nestalgia of playing an older game is tough to get back when the game runs in a much smaller resolution than my current systems
even a high resoltion hack doesnt help
it is best to remember the older games and move oni am a huge fps fan but i dont get why everyone likes this game so much
i found it rather boring and dull
the gameplay was slow most of the game was just going around looking for buttons to push to activate different things which got old in about the first  minutes of gameplay
i admit this game is very good but i just cant see why it has gotten so much hype
if u want to get the coolest fps then get clive barkers undyingmost critics insist that halflife is the best game ever but i must disagree
i will say that it has perhaps the best gameplay of any shooter but it does have its drawbacksone of the best traits of halflife is that although it has much the same gameplay as any other shooter it  seems to have done it exceptionally well
like most shooters you walk run climb jump crawl and shoot of course but in halflife its so utterly engaging
im not sure why but i believe the great gameplay is a result of the intuitive nature of the puzzles and combat
you can look around and say quotah ha
thats the wayquot  and in most cases you are right giving you a satisfying feeling of knowing that you used your brain well
however as another reviewer noted in some cases you get nailed with a quotgotchaquot you die and its time to gawk at the ol loading screen
nevertheless its not that hard after you play the game for a while and who doesnt want a challengethe weapons are average and include the standard machine gun shotgun and pistols along with grenades and other weapons you pick up along the way
you can also use guns set on turrets
all your weapons pack a punch and you shouldnt be dissatisfied with any of themenemies include monsters and quotgruntsquot  theyre decent looking and the grunts have good ai
some of the quotbossquot monsters need to be killed with special weapons that you fire from pressing a button on a wall
its very satisfying to see one of the big monsters finally go downthe sound is exceptional except for the voices of the npcs
im not sure why their voices are distorted
it might be a bugspeaking of bugs this edition of halflife has a bug that causes you to stick to some of the lifts which can be very annoying
sierra should have fixed this bug by now
i used cheat codes to get around this problem howeveras for cheat codes use them
as difficult as this game can be you can finish it using these codes but try the game without them at first of coursewhat really drags this game down is the graphics
although they arent poor they arent that great either
in some of the levels the design is so plain and smooth i feel like im in a tin can
this problem gets in the way of halflife being a truly great gameto sum it up id say halflife is a good solid shooter
it can be so absorbing but it wont wow you either
and such an opinion will get me in trouble with all those rabid halflife fans no doubtthe initial buzz regarding this game was enormous leading some publications to regard it as the best videogame ever
but hindsight shows that the title simply hasnt aged wellfor starters the plot is void and simplistic  seen a million times before
the game is also overly long and the puzzles get old fast
for a similarly themed game quotdeus exquot outdoes hl as it actually delivers on the promise of realism
in other words the gameplay adjusts to you and not the other way aroundpossibly the strongest point about hl is the mod community built around it
mods are addons which can be downloaded off the net for free
although the quality of the singleplayer mods leaves much to be desired the multiplayer mods are often spectacular as is the case of day of defeat and counter strikemy advice is to purchase it solely for these mods provided you have a good internet connection so that you may spend many sleepless nights playing the various realismoriented mods availableokay but not the best
i highly enjoyed gk and gk with their excellent plots but this has yet to be desiredfirst of all the game ran too darn slow on my computer
its the first time that ive played a game on my computer with such slowness
it was torture just to get gabe  movingsheeshalso the characters
i didnt feel that much for gabe  and grace as i did in the first two
i enjoyed tim currys voice in the  first one in this one it was too much forced with those annoying quipsbut one thing that was a huge let down for me was the storyline
i would  have forgiven gk for all the other minor peevesif the plot was just as  good as the first two
but it was not
the story was boring
it didnt even  hold my interest
the  plot didnt feel horror
in the first two  stories there was a suspsense scary edge to it
the theme voodoo in the  first one and werewolves in the second one was spread through out but in  gk you really dont see any of that until towards enda dreadful  dissapointmentim surprised that with so many constructive and positive comments that sierra hasnt commissioned another gabriel knight game
this is the only one ive played so i cant compare this game to the first two in the seriesi think the decision to use the quake  game engine was in hindsight a poor one
the quake  engine always uses excessive browns in its color palette
this is particularly evident in the outdoor scenes  particularly in areas like montreauxs mansion
the mountains look way too blockly and polygonal to be realanother odd glitch was that the town was totally deserted and even with the dengine it still seemed a bitsmall
we didnt see any people walking in the streets even in the daytime
the only inhabitants either stayed at the hotel or lived in the church
this is a totally unrealistic approach that marred the gamebut at the time the game was made what other dengine was available
conclusion i think gabriel knight  was a game that couldve been great
in the end the two parts that let it down were the sad ending and the game engine that was used
i hope ms jensen writes a gkalthough i very much doubt itafter passing gabriel knight  and  long before this game came out i was very quotintoquot the gk series then the third installment came
i was expecting it to be like the first one cartoonish and not very realistic i was right
in my opinion gabriel knight  is the best of the series only because the personalities of the characters stand out the most in the gabriel knight series
gabriel knight  uses real actors whom gave a great performance the use of d and going back to tim curry in gk was going down a step
gk is basically gk in polygonal format with a less interesting backseti was very dissapointed in the story of this game in the end after i confirmed the whole story i said quotnice tryquot
nice try as in nice try but the story just doesnt work out
one thing that makes the gk series good is gabriel himself
he was protrayed well in this game because they used tim curry as the voice as they did in gk
another character you play in the game is grace very frusterating when it comes turn to play her the game totally changes from fun and comical to extremely boring
in all fairness though playing grace is boring in all  gamesso to cut things short the only incentive to play thie game is for the d graphics they are indeed nice eye candy
i recommend playing quotthe longest journeyquot or if you want a taste of the gk series gabriel knight  is the way to goi enjoy the gabriel knight series and still play the other two games even if theyre a little outdated
the storyline is excellent and you really get to know the characters
unfortunately thats not the case in the third installment of the series
some of the characters are as  quotwoodenquot as queen amalia from the quotstars wars the phantom  menacequot movie
you hardly get to know them at all
plus the  storyline is a bit weaker than the other gk series
i spent a lot of time  scratching my head trying to make sense of what happened a minute ago
when i finished the game i was still stratching my head but this time  because of the ending
in addition to that the graphics are totally  unlike that which you would see in a game like this
i also like the  kings quest series but since they quotpolygonifiedquot the eight one  my interest has been waning
quotsierra gamesquot as i call any game  where you walk around and have multiple icons that you click on different  things to get responses text or oral should not have graphics like this
i would recommend this game to fans of the series obviously but for  everyone else wait for the price to drop before you make the purchase and  while youre waiting play the first two gks
i highly recommend thoseone of the most entertaining flight quotsimsquot i have ever played
this game has given me hours and hours of enjoyment  especially online
unfortunately there are some perplexing and conflicting elements involved here
although the game has a quotrealisticquot setting there are no stalls andor spins during flight
the program allows a virtual quotred baronquot to do things with a plane that are simply against the laws of physics
also for all the detail the programmers put into this game in many areas the guys and gals  for some reason  dropped the ball in certain places
there is no weapons loadout screen for the planes and there seems to be a never ending supply of crude rockets and bombs  whether you want them or not the bombrocket load doesnt seem to affect the performance of the planes
in quotreal lifequot these weapons are loaded as needed per each mission and then expended
most importantly the game only shows its true graphical splendor in the dfx glide mode
my geforce  card only allows software rendering the ground looks like a purina checkerboard
in summary be careful  this one is addicting as hell
also note that there is a good online community out there who are ready and willing to help new quotpilotsquotwatch out with this one
if you have a newer graphics card like a geforce then you will not be able to get the d graphics
this game does not support d acceleration with newer cards
i was really upset when i learned i would have to buy an older voodoo card just to get better graphics on this game
a great game other than that but if you want the highest graphics make sure you also have an voodoo compatible video cardhow do i start
the monk is a nice addition but the fact that the  better characters are hidden in the game without skins to make them visually appealing was a drag
network play is also available via using a text file  with specific wording
the barbarian was probably the most useful out of  all  of the characters available in this expansion pack
i was very  diappointed by the terrible levels added on to this
they did not fit in  with diablo at all
the new weapons and spells however rocked
and  wellrunning in town that was worth the  bucks alonefirst of all the game graphics are sharp and fast
the flight physics are on the ball
when you are looking around in your cockpit this where the game shinesshooting a plane is very rewarding with debre falling offand yes you can in fact shoot wings off planes and smokeunloading on a plane and then pausing to move the camera all around is worth way more then  starsunfortunately the campaign brings it down for imersive play and lasting interestthis quote from reviewer filmfanman sums it up perfectlyquotthe campaign modes are the least interseting aspect of the game and leave a lot to be desired
i want a sense of quotbeing therequot from my sims outside of combat
i want detailed debriefings after a mission
i want to feel a sense of camaraderie with my fellow virtual pilots
i want to know who made it back and who didnt
i want to see how many kills my squad mates got so i have a benchmark with which to compete
i dont care if the missions are scripted or dynamic so long as they have that feel that really immerses you in a campaign
the campaigns here fall flatquotbut the game is good for a few hours here and there
and i would encourage you to fly the ones that are not terribly long to get the most out of the simulation aspect
otherwise like what someone else said
it will get boring quickall in all a very solid game where the campaigns brings it down  stars
sadcombat flight simulator is fun but not very realistic and it has really bad grafics
somethimes when your playing the game a enemy shoots your plane and then theres bullet holes in the cockpit window and you survive
if that really happened the pilot would be dead
also the planes dont try to move away from you when you shooting them so it is really easy to shoot down planes
i shot down  planes once
combat flight simulator is not alot of money to buy so it kind of worth getting if you like ww combat flying game
combat flight simulator  and  are a lot more fun and realisticnaturally others will have a different experience of this game depending upon their proficiency at aircraft sims and the game controllers used by their system
this is merely my experience with this particular game
the concept is great particularly for wwii buffs like myself
graphically the game is superb no complaints there
i do however have major trouble with the handling capabilities of all the aircraft used save for the spitfire mark ix
this is the only aircraft which seems to be able to keep its nose level long enough for me to get is decent shots at another aircraft
most of the other planes fly like stuffed pigs and no matter how often i hit the quotbankyaw centerquot key the moment i make a slight correction the nose buffets wildly
maybe i am not doing something right but reading the manual and using the tutorial does not give any clues at to what i can do to alleviate this game spoiling effect
so basically i am limited to flying the spit which doesnt bother me too much as i prefer the raf
unfortunately as most seem to feel the combat campaigns and missions are lacklustre particularly for the raf
some are just plain goofy
too many missions involve attacking ground targets which are difficult and dangerous to hit slamming into the turf or surf is a constant hazzard
i just get the feeling that the game has been overprogrammed to include spoilers that reduce the handling capabilities of the aircraft and if i have this trouble playing at the easiestslowest level then obviously the designers dont know the meaning of the word rookie
everyone has to start somewhere i just dont think this game offers the novice the support necessary to acquire the gaming skills needed to operate it
i have tried the downloads for new missions and aircraft but these are just sitting on my hard drive like junkers on the tarmac
there is no use in offering them if they dont load themselves
if these files need to be modified to make them run then there is no use in offering them to any but the advanced computer buff
i and no doubt most computer users wouldnt know how to configure these files even if microsoft was kind enough to walk me through it
but heres the beef why didnt they include these features before releasing the game
microsoft has left it up to the gaming community to modify their software for them
i give them poor marks in the customer service department
so for me the game is more the spitfire flight simulator which doesnt make me unhappy but clips my wings a littleas an experience microsofts combat flight simulator is rather akin to watching your parents dance  its an attempt to inject some fun into the  staid flight simulator series and whilst it retains all the virtues of  the longestrunning flight sim series ever it doesnt totally work being  not much fun to play as a game
the presentation is solid and extremely  unspectacular  the graphics are very rough and the sound is nothing to  write home about although the trails of debris that fall from the back of  enemy aircraft is attractive
you can choose to fly a limited set of single  missions some of which seem oddly hard simply because you dont have  enough ammunition to destroy your assigned targets or a campaign but  disappointingly the campaign is just a set of single missions one after  the other generating no atmosphere at all
it isnt a patch on the  campaign mode in microproses european air war or the modern falcon   in which the course of a war is modelled and remembered from mission to  mission
the end result is that the game quickly becomes quite monotonous  and with no real incentive for you to do well from mission to mission the  thought of taking off for another round of bomber interception palls
special mention must be made of the manual which didstyle has lots  and lots of information but doesnt actually tell you much about flying  fighting and most importantly dropping bombsthat said all of europe  is modelled and if you have the time you can try flying from london to  paris by landmarks and compass if you so desire
and a thriving community  of flight sim buffs will ensure that the cd you get in the box is only  the start of an ongoing affairthis is the original cfs
though cfs is out by now those owning older computers even those that can run cfs should consider cfs as an alternative
cfs is set in europe  allowing you to fly fighter missions using the tried and true microsoft flight simulator engine formerly the bao flight sim engine
surprisingly this is a pretty effective sim for one that many could easily boil down to flight simulator with guns
unfortunately despite the challenges of adapting skills amassed flying combat flight sims with less realistic flight modeling cfs never really becomes more than flight simulator with gunsin cfs you can fly online single missions or campaigns
using the msfs engine it is as adaptable as any edition of microsoft flight simulator in terms of addon aircraft scenery or missions
be aware that while theres no shortage of modern military aircraft available for sale or for download the inherenent design of this game is towards premodern aircraft
neither the sophisticated systems nor guided weapons are available
there are actually  campaigns  the battle of britain summer of  in which you intercept or escort waves of the luftwaffes medium level bombers or dive bombers against industrial and defense targets in england or channel shipping and the daylight bombing campaign against europe starting around   cfs is entirely a fighterdriven game  barring user customization you cant fly big bombers
on the flip side fighters can be armed with rockets or bombs
while you can fly for the luftwaffe in either campaign your choice on the allied side is limited
i can understand being stuck with the raf for the battle of britain the attack on pearl and americas entry into the war was still over a year away but didnt the raf fly at all in 
the campaigns are short and scripted you fly the same mission until you get it right
to be honest the mission goals arent demanding im more likely to get snagged by crashing into a wingman or getting too close to an enemy and the repetitive aspect of prescripted missions would be little improved by a dynamic campaign since most missions would be the same anyway how much of a mustang pilots time wasnt spent escorting waves of bs
one tip for escorting the bombers  you may have caught edmund obrien as a p driver in fighter squadron  who chafes under rules that require his pilots to stick with the bombers and not chase enemy planes to the deck
just remember the time youve spent after you break formation to chase an me away will easily be exceeded by how long it will take you to rejoin especially if you went for the deck and must now claw back up to your formations flight level
this is especially critical since other mes will exploit your absence to cut into your formations
stick with the bombersi cant say how realistic flight modeling was  id expected worse remembering how pitiful i was on the wwi mission included on the original bao flight sim c 
visually the planes are lovely though this is an old game and it wont bowl you over
damage modeling is suspect  cfs is stuck in an era of sims in which your plane will have a fixed response to damage this is despite a more effective damage model in secret weapons of the luftwaffe  in which a given hit from an enemy will lead to progressive deterioration in your planes condition
ground targets and ships are completely implausible  one hit from your rockets and destroyers uboats and merchantmen which remain parked like sitting ducks disappear in fireballs ala battlestar galactica which hints that this project was rushed to shelves
the other hint is the appearance of me jets  they only appear in one mission and as ground targets
how did that happen
so whats really wrong
a weak mission generator and the same aircraft weve seen in over ten years in flight sims
ms probably guessed that it wasnt worth their time to do more than add guns and damage models to the fs engine  people would just download the missions flight panels scenery or aircraft files they wanted anyway
sure the game has the big planes of that theater of the war  but then did cfs have to wartime europe
with its flight engine cfs would have been the perfect vehicle for a korean war sim  an idea that ms inexplicably ignored for this and the next  additions
wwii europe simply has been simmed to death
terrain is incredibly flat and especially down low doesnt even look like terrain
its almost at the point where unless you go on the net for addon files there really isnt anything to simulate here
in short ms was hot to create a military flight sim that would adapt to any users preference they forgot to give it features that people would prefer to keep
i couldnt get decent performance on my pmmxvoodoo pc
obviously hardware wasnt an issue when i moved up to a p no windows xp compatibility issues hereon a final note cfss disappointments are not completely covered by cfs
i own both games since i wanted a pacific war sim
though cfs is obviously an improvement cfs holds up pretty well  cfs owners can download or buy addon files to capture the pacific experience
in short if youve got cfs dont feel like youve got to spend  for cfs or to upgrade your machinei got this game in dec  and for months me and my best friend did nothing but play it
at the time it seemed so cool and interesting
today it seems dated and dull
weird isnt it
i have aoe and it is much better but that too already seems old hat
even with all the expansion packs available for this game it will never come close to the complexity of the sequel or age of mythology
buy it if you can find it dead cheap thothis game is medicore
at first it seems good but after a while you get more and more things happening to you
certian comp
allies always turn on you
the graphics are okay
the sound is something that you will turn off and listen to a cd instead
the controls are ok and all together everything is fine it just doesnt mix at all
you will soon leave it on you stack of computer games and will play more dencent games like starcraft
i havnt played it in at least a month and you shouldnt waste your hard earned cash for it
the history is great and makes sense but after a space you get sick of all the same units  civilazations all only  tech tree
they just make certian civs
not able to get some units
its sad
now if youll excuse me i have a good game to play called total annihilationjust because i only gave the game  stars doesnt mean this is a bad game on the contrary i love this game the only problem is with age of empires  and age of mythology out i find it hard to go back and get the original but it definatly is a fun rts and extremly user friendly at that not overwheelming like some rtss start out recommened for beginner rts fans but id buy the second one or age of mythology before this game
if you get this game do yourself the favor of getting the gold edition with everything togetherit look stunning  the artwork is obviously inspired by chris foss and peter elson scifi artists of the old great space battles books from the  lates and its gorgeous even more so than conflict freespace
not  only is it technically impressive it has style too  space itself is a  colourful nebula and the vehicle designs and paintwork give the impression  that you have a gigantic set of cool toys at your disposal
surprisingly  the battlestar galacticaesque story around which the game hangs is a  cut above the average  whilst not exactly war and peace its still much  better you might expectthe flow of play is less interesting though
with no terrain as such its not so much a tactical game as a strategic  one  the side that can field the most amount of units wins
as one of the  other reviews mentions a gigantic asteroid field would have helped things  enormously
furthermore as in urban assault the ai requires that you  manage every significant unit at the same time something which gets on  your nerves quite quickly
and it gets very very hard later on   especially as your status is carried from mission to mission
often you  realise that youre going to have to start again from scratch in order to  complete later missions and having to spend ages after you have won  mining for resources in order to build up your forces is very dulldo  you want this
its more or less one of a kind and its utterly stylish  although in the long run both starcraft and the older total  annihilation are more fun to playsadly this doesnt run on the latest version of windows
this was one of my favorite games
i love it more than the other civilization games fresher a lot more fun and a little less on the micromanaging
i wish i could play it againi have enjoyed the kings quest series very much but i didnt get started until kings  i got this set but the gameplay and graphics though a head of their time in their day was real tough to play in this current day and age
while these all have great stories graphically and challenging wise kings quest  amp  are the only  that are really playable now
kings  is graphically very good and the story and gameplay is pretty cool
the only thing missing from this set is the mask of eternity which is actually kings quest  graphically its a stellar upgrade over these and the gameplay is faster paced with alot less puzzles to solve
roberta williams was definitley ahead of her time and i hope she continues to create these kings quest gamesgo to gamespotcom and look for an article on roberta williams
it was an excellent storyi remember getting this game a while back when i was younger
the game was difficult to master which i attributed to my young age but i loved to play it because of the nice atmosphere it gave beautiful fantasy surrounding pleasant music pretty landscape the d terrain had an enhancing effect over other strategy rpgs i had played on the pc before
overall i enjoyed the game a lotmoving back to the present day i had lost my copy and was itching to play it again having all but forgotten what the game was like
my girlfriend and i had gotten hooked on age of wonders and i wanted to investigate similar games for heri ordered lom se on amazon not too long after
after installing and playing the game for a bit i was a little dissapointed
i was still the game that i remember but it seemed deficient in ways i hadnt noticed beforefor example the graphics did not age well
i can go back and play much older games from my childhood such as quest for glory i  ii sci engine and still marvel at how beautiful the graphics are despite only  available colors and a screen resolution of x
this is double edged because while i feel that lom has pretty graphics they still seem to work out poorly in the long runsecondly i still find the gameplay to be difficult
im not a kid anymore and i have since mastered other fantasy rpgs but the system in lom seems a bit awkward and difficult to master
i couldnt play it for more than a half houroverall i think its a good game
even though its not my cup of tea anymore i can see that lots of other people really love it so if you like the genre then i give it a good recommendation
the price tag is very cheap and its well worth a grabthis game is very much worth buying at its listed price
this game has so much potential but is somewat awkward and buggy in its interface
let me give you some examples real time combat  as mentioned in the editorial review this is extremely problematic and awkward
because it is based on a  view you lose sight of some of your units and often it seems they do not immediately respond to your commands
units end up in a scrum at the center of the screen and dont readily disengage or advance
this is dissapointing considering quotlords of the realmquot which was not perfect either had a much cleaner interface and it is an older game
lords of magic would have been a much better game if the battle view was adjustable and the speed of combat as well
if the units were more quotdiabloquot sized or somewhere in between it would have been a vast improvment
also in ths same area when entering dungeons and the like your party can randomly turn up in strange places on the battle scape map eg
your sorceress is on the other side of the map all by herself next to a group of trolls when all her protection is on the other side separated by a physical barrier like water
this can mean certain death for a character you have spent much time developing and makes no sense
if your party goes in as a unit they should appear that way on the battlescape
this is just poor design
hero status bars  on the quotoverlandquot view your heros have a pop up status card showing their items level etc
these are so sparse that once you gain multiple magical items you have to create new heros just to have someone to offload the items to in order to take an inventory of your items
when you have many parties on the board this is maddening
overland spells  there is no feedback on overland spells spells you cast while in the quotworld viewquot
you have no way of telling whether they worked or what the affect was
also there are some spells that seem to not work at all like transporting a magical item via magical means
fortesses  these are far to weak and are awkward to defend
if any of you have played lords of the realm you know that castles are easily defended
not in this game
there is no ability for your archersjaveliners to man the walls of the castle
you can direct them to that area but often they just stand there or run around
they also gain no advantage from the height of the walls or the cover provided thereby
you just end up with a scrum at the front gate with everyone bunched together like mattel vibrating footballthis game is worth playing just to be able to use balkoth after you complete it
the spells that quotdeathquot can cast are really cool
overall i recommend this game at its current listed price
it has some beautiful graffics interesting story and combines party based roll playing with rts and turn based strategy
with some conceptual changes this could be the greatest game everif i had a choice between sc  or sc  id have to say id choose  though its graphics are not as good its a lot more fun and easier to start
ill have to admit when i first began playing i was shamelessly addicted
but after two days of playing i had my map completely filled and no more room to build
the game is fun for a short while but gets old real fast
i still highly reccommend this game for a boring tuesday afternoonthis game is a great game for anyone who enjoys simulation games
the point of the game is to build a moneymaking metropolis
you start with a gigantic plot of land your goal is to build and make your sims simulated residents of your city happy
you can do this by not raising taxes to high and supplying their demands
the game simulates time very fast but you can pause and modulate the speed
overall this game was great but the graphics are bad and gameplay is nothing compared to sim city i thought this game could have been better from maxis sim city  is  much better so go check it out instead of sim city pros difficulty mode select
ability to turn vibrations and subtitles on or off
colorful eyecatching visualscons no tutorial
no save option if played on psii
no pause option pushing select will make you start from the beginning or quit no level simple enough for younger children  notes can be quick and complex
oftentimes bad music with vocalists that are too goofy or difficult to understandi picked this up hearing it followed along the parappa games
familiar with the others i i conquered this one  only having to do  songs twiceat first the songs are clear and catchy in my opinion
but the last half really disappointed me  the lyrics became difficult to understand and the voices were either too goofy or grainy to rely on them for help with the beat
additionally the songs themselves were musically displeasing and i found myself wanting to hurry up and get through a song just so it would be overin conclusion i think its a fun game for people who like the musicbased style but not anything special
buy it used and cheap if you wanna play it  like i didbetter musicbased games see amplitude and taiko drum masterive never heard of this system
i never saw it in stores or anything
how have people heard of thissame thing over and over
i played the old microprose b on my  mhz computer and other than a graphics improvement this is not any real improvement
if anything because the older game had to rely on good gameplay as opposed to eyecandy the older game may be better in that respect
you take off you gather in a group you go to the target taking gunner spots on the way there you get on ip you take the bombier spot you drop and you fly back home
over and over again
its fun for a while but not for long
even the fighters are not that much fun to fly as it is the same thing as other ww fight sims
no improvemetns no innovative items
pretty much this has all been done before and done as well or better stars
its as average as it getscastlevania is a darkly digital adventure into the gothic world of the dracula legendtheres the ubiquitous vampire hunter this ones name is richter belmont a   year old mortal hunting the lord of the undead estimated to be over  years oldrichters year old girlfriend maria renard goes looking for him  is of course captured by count vlad tepes dracula sic so she ends up presenting an additional problem  obstacle for richterthese magnificent creatures so easily beaten by inexperienced  pathetic mortals
pleaseobviously the philosphical theme is that of the good vs evil simplicity but remember it is just a game after all
there are some idealistic disturbances such as werewolves being slaughtered  of course theres no real choice of actually being dracula himself or a demon for that matter but the player does get an opportunity to battle  even kill themalucard draculas confused  ingrate son is an option however he has the same type of mentality besetting nick knight that is to say unappreciative of the magnificent being he is  the dark gift bestowal
death thanatos makes a special appearance giving alucard a dire warning  ends up making off with his weapons he he heafter some brief scathing philosophical arguementation in which the dracula character makes a rather good point the battle begins amidst the triumphant  haunting strains of an organcastlevania comes off as being a cross between a movie  a videogamecastlevania contains magnificent scenery  some pretty damned good musicone major warning watch out for demonsi didnt play this game that much something about it hasnt really caught my attention yet but from what i played it as pretty funits a soso game
the graphics are soso and the gameplay is pretty bad
but the price is great
but for  bucks its worth itwipeout is getting a little longinthetooth
great game but you can only add so much before getting redundant
stop with the sequels
make a different game with different challengesthis game is very fun while it lasts anyway
the graphics are great the music is fantastic the moves are cool and the levels are cool too
but even though it can be a little challenging the truth is the game is just too short
the game is not enough of a challenge there are only  tapes in  levels with three competitions and the game takes no time to blaze through
even though it is harder to combo the game often gives you more points than it should
if youre just going after three gold medals a person could beat this game with two different characters in a day
if youre going for all the tapes it depends on the person
maybe a day maybe two
there isnt much depth to a lot of the gameplay and it gets old really quick
the length of the game and how easy it is cut two stars off the games rating
the game had more potential than the hype and what it really was but for now and even in the second its not muchback when this game first came out it was a groundbreaking effort for extreme sports videogames most of which were and for the most part still are mediocre at best
the tricking system was simple and easy to learn
the level design was the best in the genre and the level objectives were funbut that was three years ago
today even for the incredibly cheap asking price i just cant recommend purchasing the original game in this series beacuse for just a few dollars more you could do a whole lot better with any of the sequels in the series
provided the latest two sequels  and  were primarily designed for nextgeneration consoles but they did come out on playstation  game boy advance and dare i say game boy color so you should be able to find the game of your choice on the platform of your choicetony hawks pro skater is a fun gameprosreally funlevels are huge player mode goodalot of tricks and specialsconsgraphics are choppycharacters are jaggycontrols get difficult in small areasgameplay gets a little repedativeso if you have a playstation and are looking for a good skating game dont go for tony hawks pro skater go for the new ones
it was good for its time but is now old and out datedthis is one of the games i still play on dreamcast
in an effort to keep the fewest amount of equipment around my tv i decided to get the playstation version of this game
i must say that i was disappointed in the graphics and how grainy it is
you cant see to far in the distance
i thought it was going to be the same
oh well
if youve never played this game before its still the same fun
i can give it that
i dont want to draw any comparisons to twisted metal
i like both
for the price its worth a shot but if you still play dreamcast get that version insteadi really did enjoy this game
the gameplay was fun and original the sound was great the graphics were good but it felt like i was paying to be a beta tester
this game crashed many many times and crashed my  computer many times as well and this is even after downloading all of the  latest drivers and checking all of the troubleshooting notes on the  messiah website
there are some very funny parts in this game as you might  expect being based on a cherub named bob
the ending was a bit of a  letdown but makes way for a sequel
overall a game that could be great  with some patches but wait until they are out because there is nothing  more annoying than playing a game halfway through and downloading a patch  only to find that it does not work with saved games
when a patch does  come out and i am hoping one will soon i would recommend this to any fan  of thirdperson action gamesnot for the faint of heart
its a hard game to describe but its basically a rdperson  view type of thing with lots of depth if a wack endingyou play an angel named bob who is sent from heaven to stop evil forces from taking over the earth
how do you stop them
with your one lone ability bodily possession
as bob you can do little else than flap around and be a target and everyone is gunning for you
but when bob inhabits a police officer or a mindless behemoth or a pimp its a whole nother ballgame
you then have the ability to slap punch kick shoot and maim your way to the head honcho himself satanlots of violence and mayhem and a waytoohard to figure out stretch of logistics at some point youll be going online to find out what the heck you should do next only to find out you messed up six hours ago when you didnt get the blue id
card from the security guard at the power plant only to find out you didnt save your game far enough to be able to manipulate backwards through the gameugh i dont recommend it for people looking for a simply fun gamegreat graphics great sound and incredible depth but too hard for even morethancasual gamers and with too little a payoffdidnt like the game in general
im sure this is a good game for others but im didnt like itim sure that this addon was pressured by the public to be released  quickly due to the great succsess of baldurs gate but at the time of  release the price tag seemed a bit high for so little substance
other than  some new areas and quests to complete the only redeeming quality of this  package was the experience cap being rasied a tad giving all those  dualclass humans a chance to shine
as a nice bonus there are some  really cool new magical items that could ease the time an import character  will have in the next installmentwhen i played baldurs gate it was a wonderfully long experience of exploration and balanced encounters
if you ran into an overpowering encounter you knew your party had ventured into the wrong place at the wrong time
this expansion is a bucket of cold water in the face
its short just four areas with a dozen or so levels and brutally hard
maybe i didnt levelup correctly in baldurs gate but i found every step a struggle of highlevel encounters traps my their couldnt disarm and worst of all key puzzles
additionally the expansion didnt have of the story elements of the original game
the game itself had almost no changes although there was a new autopause feature that was very helpful
hardcore baldurs gate fan with a highlevel party  will love sword coast but other should probably skip itbaldurs gate is an entertaining game but a great one
no way
it has too many major flaws to be a great game
the ai of the characters that you control is quite possibly the worst ai in the history of computer games
the characters cant move more than an inch on the screen without getting out of the marching order
the path making functions for the characters to go from point a to point b is pathetic
sometimes characters will wander around the screen aimlessly or get stuck in a corner when you need them somewhere
this tends to get your characters severely injured or killed
it is a major annoyance
this game is designed to run in realtime with the ability to pause but because of the terrible ai you find yourself pausing the game every two seconds to micromanage your characters
so much for realtime combat
turnbased would have been better
this game has scores of encounters that swiftly slaughter your party with no chance whatsoever of you surviving the first encounter
the only way to get past these points is to reload your previous save game which you will find yourself doing more than a thousand times
after you reload you cast a bunch of spells to make your characters more powerful and redo the encounter
after trying enough times you win
what is the problem with that you ask
it is pointless to use your wits to better prepare yourself for the unexpected because the unexpected will easily wipe you out and you can then reload anyway
its almost like quotcheatingquot
wheres the challenge in that
the game is pretty stingy with experience points
 hours of gameplay only moves you up about  or  levels
the inventory system gets annoying
not enough slots and a gemstone takes up as much space as a suit of armor
supposedly this has been taken care of in bgon the upside the combat is fun when things go your way especially the visual and sound effects created by the spells i always wanted to know what an exploding fireball looks like
also i thought that the plot of the game was very good
the game has a lot of quests and sidequests which make it nicely nonlinearbaldurs gate is a fun game but its too tedious to be a great onebaldurs gate is the best adampd game to come around in a while but it drove me absolutely insane for the first few hours
why
because in the beginning there are quite a few people who want you deadincluding a few  powerful at least at that point wizards
at low levels a guy can walk  up to you say quotokay im going to kill you nowquot and quite  suddenly knock you out in  hits
after a while though youll get into  it
man you have to watch yourself in this game because there is are  deceptive people in every town
  lots of characters walk up to you asking  for help and end up being villains
to wrap it up its a keeper
especially the bundled version wthe expansion pack but dont get  discouraged at the beginning because thats the hardest part
once you  get by that youll have a good game with lots of side quests and  longitivityi had very high hopes when i ordered this game due to a number of the reviews that i read
however after installing and playing the game i was somewhat let down and i find that im not excited about continuing the adventure
dont get me wrong this is a fun game but in light of todays advanced graphics sound and storylines this game just seems a little outdatedi found a very frustrating aspect to the game seems to happen when encountering a new creature
at the initial encounter i was hardly able to do any damage and i would usually be killed very quickly
however after restoring from a previous save point then attacking the same monsteri would prevail without an extremely difficult fight
this seemed to happen over and over againanyway here is my rundown of the pros and consprosthe game is huge and will take a lot of time to solvecharacter creation and development has depthlarge number of magical itemsseems to follow the dampd rules closelyadventuring decisions impact future interactions and character moodsconscharacter level progression is slowthe game is extremely hard even on the easiest settingthe numerous restores from save points gets old fastsmall inventory for each character requiring you to leave numerous items in dungeons or in the wildernessaccumulating gold for weapons armor and health potions is very difficult in the beginningto me this game is like a bad movie that you continue to watch in the hopes that things will get better
however just like the movie things have not gotten any better and im now a little frustrated
although i have had some fun playing i was not able to become imersed in the story and i will probably stop playing
if you enjoy challenges you might like this game more than i doa good game the first in a long line of similar titles though theyve mostly died out now
the icewind dale and neverwinter games were semisequels to this one which is essentially a computer version of a dungeons and dragons board game with the boring stuff taking place behind the scenes like the dicerolling
the odds are still there you just see them in a different and in my opinion much more entertaining way
if you ever played dd and wished it could be more lifelike and engaging then this is the kind of game for youbut this is not the best example of it
this is just the title that set the standard for the others which easily surpass it in almost every respect
the graphics were good at the time much more detailed than in previous topdown role playing games like ultima  for example but introduced certain disagreeable changes for example the world was no longer one open field but a series of stagelike areas that had to be loaded one at a time and that you had to progress through similar to the way you had to play the shooters of the same period
characters and creatures are also noticeably smaller and you can no longer interact with the environment
no more moving chairs turning off lights etc
the game arena is mostly staticstill other areas are vastly improved combat story dialogue inventory you name it
and you travel through a beautiful land with authentic sound effects and haunting musictwo things however prevent this world from being as much fun as it could have been st the following of the dd turnbased rules which is just plain frustrating especially if you are familiar with the ultima  games and nd the limited size and scope of the thing
youll feel like you just began playing and developing your characters when oops sorry theres nothing left for you to do
well save that for the sequelso overall id say this game is good if you want to see where it all came from and if youre such a fan of the series that you want to experience it all
otherwise its better just to go with the later titles
neverwinter nights in particular is a great gamegraphics are okay for its time and character development is okay
one small problem
overemphasis on hack and slash and horrid problems with using spells in combat
also being stuck at leveling to such a low level  bitesi played for a few hours the original version and the reloaded version the latter has amazing graphics however after a few hours i got  bored
i also tested many other european rpgs oblivion morrowind fallout  the witcher divinity ii neverwinter nights  and none of them stood out to me except nwnin any case its messy awkward battles boring items boring npcs repetitiveness complete a quest get a new one kill get some unexciting items repeat the processthe only thing i really love about these games are the soundtracks which admittedly are really topnotchso i tried something different persona  a turnbased battle jrpg
i cant put the game down
lovable characters fantastic battles
i was sick of this boring real time battle thing its a mess
i really longed for some good old turnbased battles where you fight a boss for close to an hour or more using all you can with the battles showing special effects and special moves and while the camera always change
what a difference
great items and spells also moves
i think i am done with european rpgs
too bad as usually the plots in those are better than jrpg although persona  has the best jrpg plot i have seen in any rpgsno doubt bg has been an innovative game just not what i wantmy almost yearold and i got hooked playing spyro  earlier this month
weve been playing endlessly
to take a little break we tried out toy story  what a disappointment
i dont think the graphics are that great unless youre comparing them to a super nintendo
and the games are much harder to play
we couldnt figure out what we were supposed to do in some rooms and the skill required to complete most of the tasks is just beyond my youngster and imy other complaint would be with the helpinstructions onscreen
in spyro the characters read aloud the messages as they appear on the screen
this means he can play the game by himself
but because he cant read he cant get help or hints onscreenwhile he does seem to like it because of the characters he just cant play it by himself and his frustration level is pretty high with this one
not to sound like a broken record but if youve got a younger child try spyro  or  or the graphics are not very good and it is easy to complete
toy story on ps is alot better
but it is a fun game to playtoy story  is a good game
it has its fair share of mindblowing colors and characters but its worthy of three stars only
while i would say that the original story and the graphics are worthy of five stars the gameplay is the problem
this game is geared toward children and its cartoonish features and snappy music will appeal to them
however the controls are overly complicated for kids and the levels are frustrating more often than not reminescent of a bugs life
but then again kids usually figure things out before adults so maybe im the problemwho knows
rent it first to see if you are interested in the purchasetoy story  for the pc was one of the first video games i ever played and one i grew up with and loved as a kid
lacking a decent pc i chose to pick up the ps version instead for nostalgias sake and in most regards i see relatively little difference between the two versions
toy story  is a d platformer game in which you play as buzz lightyear as he sets out to rescue woody in the events of the movie and more or less runs parallel to the events of the film visiting familiar venues like andys house and als toy barn while introducing some new locales such as als space land and andys neighborhood
platforming mechanics are solid if not as fluid as i remembered them combined with decent graphics for the playstation and gameplay is varied with the gradual addition of new environmental challenges and powerups that allow for new means of exploration and combat
although only comprised of  levels and  discrete boss the levels are fairly substantial and new powerups encourage you to revisit previous areas to find secrets you missed
nonetheless the game will start to get a bit repetitive by the finals levels while rarely offering any decent challenge the level bosses and minibosses in particular are some of the easiest i have seen in any game to date usually involving blasting away with your laser in their general direction while mashing the spin attack to deflect attacks and are almost always defeated within a minute or two
emperor zurg in particular was so laughably easy compared to my original memories that i will never view him the same if i rewatch the filmthe main problem with the game one which chronically ruins the enjoyment is the terrible camera mechanics
rather than locking the camera behind buzz rigidly or using the right directional pad to control it freely the game either keeps the camera in place and then realigns to follow buzz a couple seconds after he stops moving or allows control through the shoulder buttons
neither option allows for vertical adjustment making platforming needlessly challenging and leading to a lot of frustrating falls
both options work poorly in practice as the active camera cannot adjust on the move as you are battling faster enemies and the passive camera moves far too slowly to be useful and in both cases the camera routinely gets hung up on terrain or decides to suddenly change it movement if buzz turns in certain waysif you are a fan of toy story or have a kid that is and are a relatively casual gamer then this is a game for you
if you or your kid are a more serious gamer though then it will be hard to enjoy the games charm in light of its gameplay flawsi acctully quite enjoyed this game when it first came out  years ago when i got it for chritmas i did beat it but i still perfer future tony hawk games more it was fun to do all the skate tricks like grind jump off ramps lip trick etc
but you cant mannualfrogger is a hard game but the original was no walk in the park either
good level design overall even if the difficulty should be tone down a bit sometimesthe multiplayer race feature is pretty fun but its nothing near classickingpinwhere should i start
the main highpoint of this game is the impressive and funny songs by cypress hill that were made exclusively for this game
aside from all the profanity and blood and gore this game is  ok but not one of the best games from interplay
this game is basically  your quake mod that has a story and some additional features added to it
however it is funny to see the reactions of people in the game when you  pull a gun on them
if you are up for lines and lines of profanity tons  of blood and gore and missions that require you bounce heads with some big  boys then this game is for you
the only drawback is the long load times  so make sure your computer chair is comfythats the censored versionits the most vile st person game ive ever played
not in terms of violence just in the language
that in itself makes this game a total riot to playwhere else can you use cusswords in practically every sentence in a gamewell theres that the interaction with characters various weapons and upgrades and the buying of muscle for hireon the downside the graphics are blocky and ugly and there is no manual saving
that is the biggest upset of allthe other issue is that this game is ridiculously hard
you shoot your enemies in the face five times and they wont go down
it gets to the point of sheer frustrationtheres the fun sound fx and music from cypress hill that give it an extra boost of pulp fictionyoull have a fin great muthn time you holes
addendum  after much aggravating gameplay i stopped playing this and unistalled it
its just ridiculously hard in any setting and annoyingsubtract  fun star from my original reviewdespite my liking for gore and profanity this game leaves for something i would say gameplay value
when i first started playing it i enjoyed the nice quake  based engine and the d audio but it quickly got me saying quotwhy am i playing thisquoti understand the plot clearly you want to become the boss the kingpin and you have to fight through gangs and other obstacles to get there
these obstacles include ridiculous missions of running back of and forth doing favors
such as giving a bum some whiskey to get a combination safe number
i thought if a game has a mature rating slapped onto it it might as well have some mature thinking puzzlesthe profanity is something that probably turns away most audiences because most of the gamers are young and probably need parental admission to get games
to me the profanity is interesting to hear not annoying or disturbing
i have never seen a game so daring to use so much violence until soldier of fortune and profanityall in all i would suggest anyone who likes graphic violence in gangrelated environments and nonstop profanitythis game is very interesting
i never played warcraft  for more than   minutes before i bought it
i really got into it
but then you play the  second race
they are the same
if you want to play this and starcraft
play starcraft second so then you wont find this one at times mundane
yet it still gets kudos from me
just play tides of darkness and beyond the  dark portal with your favorite looking race
take into consideration the  annoying orc voice
still good
does not need to rely on graphicsrailroad tycoon ii is a real time strategy game by poptop software with complex interactions interesting graphics and lots of thinking
the gameplay reminds me of chris sawyers transport tycoon in which you play a tycoon who control the trains buses planes and ships in the tycoon world
in rrt you play as the railroad baron and control the train transportation buy and sell stocks set the train routes lay the railway tracks stations and take over companies
there are lots of real life trains and cities
the gameplay is quite good it takes a while to learn to play and be good at it
rrts graphics are very good the towns are very beautifully desinged there are lots of beautiful terrain and real looking buildings the world looks real with rivers forests snow and hilly mountains
rrts screnarios are also very well desinged and a lot fun to play it also comes with a screnario editor for you to create your own screnarios
railroad tycoon ii has got a clumsy interface it is very hard to lay the tracks with the mouse
there are other annoying factors like you dont get enough money its hard to manage things when you have a lot of trains and stations you need to pay a lot of attention at the stock market to make money ect
railroad tycoon ii is a very good game but quite hard to play
if you like this game get transport tycoon it is more intresting lot more fun and quite easy compared to thisstar trek borg like klingon doesnt really do much
you are a new cadet who is assigned to a ship that is about to investigate the borg
with the help of q you get to learn about your father and his battle with the borg
all of this is very interesting but there isnt much for you to do
like the early game dragons lair you just have to deside when to shoot when to go left when to go up etc
if you like trek this is an interesting collectors item
otherwise it would be wise to skip this gamethis game is completely live action
you are a young ensign whose father  was killed by the borg ten years previous and now finds himself having to  sit in the sidelines as the borg attack again
suddenly q shows up and  offers you a chance for revenge and a chance to save your fatherif  you play it through and dont make any mistakes you have the equivelant of  a  minute star trek episode that takes you around the various spots in a  starship to deep inside a borg cube
the game has a great cast of  characters although the only known one from the series is q himself and  some really thought proviking puzzles
plus as a side bonus you have a  special tricorder that you can use at just about any point in the game to  find out about things and people and the history of the area and crew you  exist withthere is a downside though firstly for a point and click  game the controls can still be very difficult
there was one point where  you had to push a button on a phaser but the durned camera wouldnt hold  still long enough for me to manage it
plus if you click the mouse too  quickly the game will get confused and nothing will happen something that  happened to me quite oftenalthough not a huge classic i thought this  was a great diversion from the usual fare of shooters
consider it to be a  long lost episode of star trek with you as the herothis game is much more of a cinematic movie or episode of star trek than a game
with a compelling well written story depicting a federation cadet up against the borg at wolf  and a mischevious q this game is a must buy for all star trek fans
when playing there are some quarks to the game the mouse cursor can only be clicked at certain places in the cinema
sometimes the click of your mouse does not register with the games functions and some puzzles take a few more minutes to figure out than others  this leaving the player to view the same cinema when you make a mistake over and over again
this game comes with  cds and is almost  hours in length
this means you have to cd swap in between new levels
the upside to your hard work is that you can save the cinema and watch it all over again like a real episode of star trek the next generation when the game is finally completed
i would recommend buying this if you are a hardcore star trek fan
if you are not i would recommend something more action packed in the star trek games such as star trek voyager elite force and expansiongameplay  graphics  sound  value  instead of all these ones from newbie gamers who are fixed on graphics
alright
instead of calling this the best playstation game of all time or even more laughable one of the best games of all time or even sadder the best game of all time lets get a couple of things straight first shall we
while not bad metal gear solid left me wanting more and getting less than youd think
hideo kojima set out to make one thing a movielike experience game
on that level hideo created an unrivalled masterpiece that has few equals in the action and story category of movies but thats just it movie were supposed to be playing a game here not watching a movie
and on that level while hideo didnt fail he didnt succeed either you play solid snake an exfoxhound just out of retirement cold something living legend whose whole life seems to circle around the battlefield
your mission is to infiltrate a nuclear weapons disposal facility in alaska being ran by terrorists foxhound and rescue hostages darpa chief donald anderson and the president of armstech kenneth baker
on top of that you are to find out if foxhound really has the capability of launching a nuclear attack like theyve threatened and stop them if they do
this is one job you wouldnt want to take for all the copies of radiant silvergun in the world
the controls are fairly simple nicely responsive and easy to pick
the music ranges from the typical stuff youd expect to hear to an action game to some beautiful almost operalike vocal performances that are dark and astonishing
the sound is also well done and very detailed
you and your enemy can hear everything from footsteps to tapping on the wall to gunshots that youd swear were the really thing even the most jaded would be impressed here hey stop looking at me
speaking of the enemy the ai to the game while not all that intelligent at times walking a course
come on is very interesting
they pick up on footsteps gunshots knocks on the wall and even good ol davids i mean solid snakes coldimpressive
the characters are lively and very real
i loved all the characters minus otacon and meryl otacon who i was hoping would quotaccidentallyquot get shot and meryl who well just felt out of place
the rest though were amazing
personal favorites were sniper wolf and vulcan raven who are hands down two of the coolest bad guys ever
there are also some cool bonus stuff to do like the vr missions and taking pictures
you can also talk to your friends that word being used loosely through codec which is like an ultra hightech walkietalkie
occasionally the voice actors sound out of place quotjapanese animesquot
hello
 but thats very rarely and the rest of the time they manage to not only avoid the trap of the resident evil trend but do so with grace
then theres the problems of this game the small ones would be the overhead camera which gets annoying quickly
there are times when id miss an enemy who was five feet away from me all because the camera wouldnt give me a good view
no big
then theres the length of the gameits extremely short
scenario i buy the socalled quotbest game everquot for  thats what it cost when it came out mind you
i play game and enjoy the gameplay i do find
metal gear solid is beaten in less than a day
argh
i think you get the point not a major major problem but enough to deduct a star
but the worst problem is the story itself
sure its impressive and one of the best stories of all time forget game of the year call it movie of the year but as hideo himself said combining a movie and a game is like combining water and oilthey just dont mix
meryl and snakes relationship quotmaturequot
please
by video game standards yes
i suppose squalls and rinoas was too i still shudder at the mere mention of those two dawsons creek stars
but by the real world standards it seems like cheesy puppy love that quickly becomes hard to swallow
thats not the problem the problem is this the story takes up way too much time of the game
and thats where everyone whos giving this a topnotch perfect five star rating which seems to be everyone from amazon reviewers to nextgen to your own ma and pa gets confusedmetal gear solid is supposed to be a game not a movie
as a movie its a masterpiece of epic proportions that can rival even t
as a game its only fun for the few hours it actually lastsor should i say the hours where youre trying to stay awake through all the codec talking
sure sure you can argue that xenogears was the same way but a xenogears had a groundbreaking story that just so happens to be the best story of all time and b i actually got more gameplay time out of the short and heavily texted second disk of xenogears than i did the entire two disks of metal gear solid
it gets sad when youre spending minutes upon minutes hearing about snake talk about how he has no family when youre supposed to actually be playing the game
and while the gameplay that is here is fantastic its toogood story is not so surprisingly its own downfall
just an idea but wouldnt it be fun if we i dunno say actually played a game not a movie
great idea huh
afterall thats what this is supposed to be a video game not a moviemetal gear solid has won just about every gaming award possible and has been lauded by critics and fans worldwide
despite the fact its not really my area of interest im a resident evil type guy i bought the game heck it was  bucks why not
this was last year
i never finished it and finally sold it
why
good question
i finally decided that ultimately i wasnt involved at all with any of the characters or story events
i didnt care what happened
do i think mgs is overrated
well sort of
granted the graphics controls and audio are as perfect as perfect can get and there is no doubt that there are innovative elements especially the sneaking about and the enemy soldier ai but i found the characters and story as cold and sterile as the arctic location in which most of the game is set
it has no soul
for this type of game i feel this kind of personal involvement is vital
i wasnt swept up in the events like in parasite eve or vagrant story
metal gear left me with the feeling i was performing a chore rather than embarking on a worldchanging adventure
the story felt scripted and unnatural the characters flat and lifeless
i think metal gear affected me the same way as this years shenmue for dreamcast  an undisputed technical masterpiece that felt devoid of humanity
in any case any gamer with a pulse should play through it for the sniper wolf bits if nothing else but be prepared for snake and co to keep a distance from your heartwhen thq lost the rights to wcw and gained the wwf this game was a must have for me
i loved this game for ages more then revenge but as great as it was for a while i must say i advise you get the step up version wwf no mercy it was the new and improved version and left this one for deadif you want a good adventure starter game and like unusual mindtwisting you will enjoy this game
i also liked mcgees alice in wonderland journey to the center of the earth and darkfallbeing a big wot fan i couldnt wait for this game came out
but i only had a  pc
then i got a much better pc which left me with nearly nothing moneywise
or i simply couldnt find the game
so i downloaded the demoas one person said here the demo is a horrible representation of the game ill take their word for it
but from what i did play i was most impressed at first playing it often then there was a severalmonth period when i didnt play that game at all
the architecture is fantastic in this game
not exactly how i visualized it in the books but pretty close
multiplayer is okay but not great
the battle system i think is kinda clunky
when you need a certain terangreal right now its hard to get to it without accidentally skipping over it
there isnt much of a variety of bad guys from what ive seen
wheres the draghkar
myrddraal
darkhounds
gray men
etc
the atmosphere is nice in this game though
very dark at times
ill probably still buy this gamehence the  stars
but if you want my real opinion i feel that robert jordans wot series should be made by squaresoft the company that makes the final fantasy series
squaresoft has experience with rpgs and if anyone could do justice to rjs masterpiece squaresoft can
like many of you have said there isnt much of a quest element in this game
anyway i dont know about you but im going to email squaresoft now and see if i can convince them to make something that will be what this game should have beeni thought this game was sort of fun
yes its a shooter only with terangeals instead of guns
the story is nice but i only wish that they would have made it more of an rpg
my guess is somebody will probably end up doing one anyways based on the popularity of the books
just hope its a good developer like square enixyou make units that make other units that make other units
thats how you progress
then these units fight eachother and destroy buildings and stuff
its fun to a pointthe fun rating here means the overall emotional effect of the game
there are some pretty genius and breakthrough things in this game ie
the radio and the flashlight the atmospheric effects achieved with the fog and darkness and switching between the real world and the altered world
one of the most impressive effects is where you are running from monsters in the dark with your weak flashlight while the shadow of whats chasing you can barely be seen behind
they did a hll of a job with the creepy level design and sound effects very scary but its also a negative just because looking at rust colored bloody rooms and listening to hums and whistles is unpleasant
i also found the circle motif used in boss fights to be pretty genius
some issues the pace is stalled right from the start with a tedious key finding quest this could take hours if you search manually i got frustrated after  minutes and looked at an online walkthrough
that really becomes a problem with the game all the locked doors and barely being able to see where you are going it isnt fun
this was my first vague impression of the flawed game play its really a lot like festers quest for the nes its gray empty you navigate repetitive looking areas and swarms of hopping things are out to kill you
the story in outline is good and has a clear goal that keeps things moving forward basically save cheryl but the scipt ranges from adequate to boring down to mstk type badness like something from the touch of satan
the camera can be a problem and its easy to get spun around and moving in the wrong direction when everything looks too similar
the puzzles on the last level feel too contrived theres a key but i cant reach it because a piece of glass is in the way why not shoot the glassokay after reading all of these crazy awesome reviews of this game and being a huge fan of silent hill  i bought this game from here for 
and boy was i disappointed
lets list the good and the badprosimpressive graphics considering its a playstation  gamegreat music by akira yamaokaamazing camera angles especially during the opening run down the hallway type thingfun to playgood atmosphereconsnot fun at all in the daytime so you have to wait until night to enjoy it at its fullestthe atmosphere is not backed up whatsoever
this was my biggest gripe about the game
stuff like resident evil and dino crisis have less of a crazy atmosphere but what atmosphere they do have is backed up by the sudden and unexpected appearance of enemies and the extreme difficulty of killing the enemies
plus with a lack of ammo youre usually panicking
silent hill has great atmosphere but plenty enough ammo to kill the generally weak monsters that are found throughout the levels and most of them are slow and dont do much damage to you therefore they dont pose much of a threat
silent hill  had pyramid head and at some points i actually was too scared to continue on with the game on the fear that he might show up and slaughter me
silent hill has absolutely nothing to back up this atmosphere and if you can get past the disturbing look of things and realise that there is nothing making the scary noises youre just walking around a deserted area that has the lights out some monsters and creepy music
whats so scary about that
nothing
and when there are an abundance of enemies its not scary its just annoying because if you cant pick them off one by one then youre overwhelmed and you dielike i said above absence of enemies makes the game far too easy but too many enemies makes the game too hardthey should have had your character have crashed on the outskirts of town and had you walk to town in the middle of the night
that would have been scarier and better than just appearing in the townthe alternate dimension is overused
this problem was fixed in silent hill  though and was executed perfectlyafter my list of the good and the bad you tell me what you think
i wasnt scared playing this game maybe made nervous a few times but never terrified like i was playing the sequel
its definately a good game but terribly overrated and you can tell its their first effort at the genrein all being the silent hill fan i am i own the first  games and origins have seen the moviewhich sucked btw and plan on buying the third and fourth titles when i have the money im glad i bought this game but its not as good as the hype leads you to believewell i finally bought this game after hearing so many stories of how people catch scare attacks and whatnot and not for nothing i was totally
let down ive played fatal frame and found that game to be downright terrifying and was hoping to get the same feel with silent hill but nope not at allmaybe its because iv ebeen spoiled by fatal frame
or maybe i should have played it when it was first
released but i actually found this game to be kinda cute lol
following the monsters in the dark when they cant see you is funny and beating them in the back of the head with a pipe when theyre not looking is even funniersome
things that seemed errie were the camera angles the music and some voices that you hear
the darkness factor is alright but that radio
ugh the worst
attempt to a creepy sounding radio noise the puzzles were ok and the monsters
zombie dogs and flying bat things arent scary ill finish playing the game hoping to be scared to the point were i scream like i did with fatal frame although i dont think itll happen
an ok game to add to a collection just so you can tell whoever was scared of this game that they need something more to scream aboutsilent hill  circa good considered classic to many hardcore survival horror gamers was sort of considered too scary to play in its time for some gamers a complex story with twists and turns travel two different worlds this one and a demon onebad graphics look pretty dated fog is not graphically very pleasing voice acting can be bad at times controls feel datedwill it fit your taste slow moving survival horror game which is more about solving puzzles managing items and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life a horror game set in a town over run with all kinds of odd creatures game and story are similar to books by steven king and hp
lovecraft multiple endings and even some bonus unlockablesgame its most assocated too resident evil alone in the dark mistadditional notes this is the first silent hill game in the franchise and from what ive been told this games true squeal story wise is silent hill  and not silent hill i searched out this game after i read up on it a bit
quotgenuinely scary suspenseful atmosherics disturbingquot screamed the fansites
for starters if youve ever played a resident evil game this is too familiar territory
there are differences yes but once you set foot in the school or hospital areas its re all over again running about in frustration opening doors checking the map every  seconds puzzles accompanyed by daft poetry riddles etc
the other thing that sounded good to me were the nasties
the sites again babbled on about quotsinister zombie children that brandish kitchen knives and scream with glee as the slash you with themquot errr hello
they appear to be teddy bears with spikey claws that just seem to fall in front of you gnawing at your shoes
the rest are all re moonlighters  zombie dogs giant spiders giant moths nothing origional or vaguely creepy
the games most interesting point to me is the alternate reality sections with are rang in with a strange air raid siren
basically what happens is that all your familiar surroundings are given a very hellraiseresque makeover all bloody chains crucified corpses and rusted metal
but its really just the backdrops that feel creepy the monsters patrol around with the same stupidity as ever
the monsters also cause a radio transmitter to crackle so that you know when youre not alone but that kind of ruins any jumpy moments as you just stand there waiting for any wouldbe attackers to reveal themselves
also the crackle gets annoying after a while
anyway buy this if youre not familiar with resident evil as its far to familiar
actually no buy re  or  insteadas the world awaits the next installation in capcoms flagship resident evil series konami has stepped forth with silent hill a horror concoction all their own
instead of merely riding onto the gaming scene on res coattails silent hill strikes out into bold new territory and clearly distinguishes konami as a continued force to be reckoned with in the videogame worldonce you plop in the game youre treated to a seemingly peaceful cg intro showing young widower harry mason on a tranquil late night drive with his sevenyearold daughter cheryl
the pair speed down the highway on their way to an aging resort town known as silent hill
but somewhere along the way their trip is cut short as a young girl appears in the middle of the road captured in the headlights of harrys jeep
as harry attempts to avoid hitting the girl his car spins violently out of control and the world blurs
as harry regains consciousness in the drivers seat of his wrecked car he turns to check on his daughter only to find that shes missing
where did she go
welcome to silent hill an adventure masterfully crafted by the use of sound sight and even touch
played mainly like an adventure game and not an action title silent hill neatly sidesteps any obvious aping of the re series by taking a more literary turn into the world of horror
with an emphasis on character and storyline silent hill prefers to appeal to gamers imagination by limiting their vision to a small range of light surrounded by inpenetrable darkness or by jarring any grasp of reality that the gamer might have on what exactly is going on in the game
in fact its the storylines refusal to adhere to a formulaic premise with harry confronting apparitions chasing down demons and puzzling over diabolic visions that makes the game so incredibly unique
chills and shivers aside silent hill is one strange trip into nightmares left untouched by the more actionoriented gameplay of resident evil
the most important factor of the games immersive qualities ranges from konamis depiction of harry as a regular guy with whom gamers can identify with to the excellent use of ambient sounds to catch players offguard in their most vulnerable moments
harrys plain appearance translates seamlessly into how he actually plays through the game
his aim is awful and his running pace though quicker than most enemies still keeps him only a heartbeat away from being mowed down by the demons running amok on the streets of silent hill
in fact because of the limited amount of ammunition available in the game and harrys inexperience with firearms youll find yourself evading enemies more often than confronting them
and this is one of the finest features in the game
not only does this strengthen the adventure element in silent hill but it also draws the player into the world of the game by mixing in enough realism into the madness
on top of this feature in the game silent hill also refuses to ease up on the game in regards to atmosphere and mood
backed by an ambient soundtrack the game features some masterful effects that are sure to have even veteran racoon city warriors quaking in their boots
from the inexplicable sobbing of an unseen child in a bloodstained school hall to the loud rattling of an invisible something underneath the floorboards that youre standing on the game never sinks into predictability
imagine all of this while never quite being able to see past arms length into the darkness
equipped with only a pocket flashlight harry is forced navigate pitchblack areas where demons insist on lurking just outside of the range of sight
often youll hear them before you can actually see them pushing the tension factor in the game to whiteknuckled heights
but as masterful as silent hill is it still cant claim perfection
in a completely d polygonal realtime game environment there are always going to be issues about control
silent hill slightly suffers from this
maneuvering harry in some of the games tougher spots and getting him to go from dead stopped to run and back again can prove an exercise in frustration especially when you find yourself trapped in a narrow hallway filled with murderous demons 
with only  rounds of handgun ammo left
visually the game remains grainier than whats expected of a playstation game released in the systems fourth year
but the overall look of the game with its murky fog effects and clever use of lighting makes good use of the graininess adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay throughout the game
in the face of silent hills brilliant gameplay these flaws only take so much away from the game and leaves us wondering how great the game will be on a nextgeneration systemi got this because i am a big simpsons fan but since its a older game it can barely be played on newer computersvs allows you to take a humorous tour around springfieldoccasionally finding keys that will allow you to unlock certain placesfun and funny to look at now and thennot that cool
this is an old slow program that is kind of fun for a minute but really is not that great
if you are a hardcore simpsons fan then it is kind of cool for the itchy and scratchy cartoons and a few other assorted things but really not that greatit is worth checking out for a couple of bucks but not much more than thati think metal gear solid was thee greatest video game ever and so i had to have this addition
i was a little disappointed
some of the msssions are a little drab
the really good ones where you play the ninja do not happen till late in the game and so the fun is short lived
some of the missions are so basic that i blew through them in no time and others so boring that i could finish them in my sleep
this was not awful but not great and that leaves you with three starsid say its actually  and  stars but they dont have that option so whatever
when i first played everquest i was an extreme newbie
i had never played a mmorpg massively multiplayer online roleplaying game
it took me awhile to get used to it
like a month or  maybe
everquest is not very newbie friendly but once you get the hang of things it can be your best friend or your worst enemy
it can result in you dancing around the room and cheering in happiness having gotten your epic weapon after months of doing those massive quests
or it can have you slamming your head against the keyboard as you get ready for another cr corpse run as its called in game after dying once more and losing experience
however i made great friends playing everquest you can join unions of players called guilds and i still talk with some i met today i recently stopped playing
eq is extremely addicting in other words if youre a husband than prepare to invest in large amounts of flowers and other gifts for your wife for neglecting her for several monthsthe game is great fun though but you need to watch your standing with the many different factions in the game
killing a certain thing may give you good standing with some factions but bad with others
there is a complex in game economy including a zone called the bazaar where more than  players can be found at any different time selling thousands of different items
i liked to go to that zone and stare at all the cool armor and weapons and stuff lol
the customer support people are all very nice
theres even a volunteer customer support program called the guide program for those over  i spent a couple of months in it before quitting everquest had been playing for about two and a half years
the game can get boring however
endless hours of camping killing monsters and waiting for them to respawn to kill them again can be tedious especially if you keep dying
however expansion packs keep the flow going with new zones quests items and playable races and classes
the variety of classes and races in everquest includes classes such as warrior wizard shadowknight and druid
as well as races such as barbarian wood elf troll human and dwarf
sometimes youll hear arguments being shouted in a zone and they sometimes can get nasty thats what the guides are there for to handle those issues and issue warnings to offending players
but parents should keep in mind that this is an online game with real people and kids sometimes may hear things theyre not supposed to hearbut all in all this is a good game and i recommend it for its fun value and the aspect of making good friends like i didhype
what hype
i didnt even know about this game until i downloaded the demo
i havent been exposed to quotthe hypequot so my review is going to be completely unbaised
so what do i think of this gamein  many aspects simply vanillai dont care what engine a d game use as  long as i enjoy the game
just as the realistic gore and fun seperated  soldier of fortune from the rest daikatanas storyline set it apart
plus in daikatana you can quotlevelupquot and alter your stats as  you kill more enemies
you can increase your weaons damage speed your  jumping height maximum health and your running speedthe weapons are  innovative to say the least with  unique weapons in each of the four  episodes
along with the daikatana itself
when you use the daikatana at  first its a slow as crap
but as you kill more enemies with it the  sword becomes more powerful until it reaches level  at which point a  flick of the wrist can kill anything
the downside to this is that you  dont get levelups
oh well youve got to break a few eggs to make an  omelette i guessalso the locales are especially unique
you travel  through four time periods and in each one there is unique architecture  that really sets the mood of the level from the icy lands of  ad  norway to the temples of ancient rome
unfortunately those are the only  things that set daikatana apart
the rest of the game is the usual  quotfind keyswitchartifact open a door repeatquot formulanow  for the bad part of the review  the ai
in the game youll get two  sidekicks that help you
a few levels later though youll want to call  them quotgroinkicksquot because they will impede your progress so much  that youll want to give them just that
the sidekicks get in the way of  your aim they shoot you when you get in their aim they fall off ledges to  their deaths and theyll go after an enemy even if they have no weapons
and guess what
if they die so do you
most of the time youll order  them to stay put and finish the level yourself
and the enemies
theyre  cannon fodder
no brains at all
with the exception of the civilians all  they do is rush you
believe it or not the smartest enemies arethe  doors
id swear that they have the minds of sadistic killers
they just  love to ambush hapless heros  they stay open until either you or a  sidekick walks through the doorway and then they suddenly close crushing  all that are in the way
enemies know well enough to avoid them so i  guess in a certain respect they are smartoverall as i mentioned  before daikatana is vanilla
there are new innovations but when you get  down to the gameplay its more of the same thingcontrol is a lacking feature in this game
it alos seems to be a bit too linear in its play making it lack in the rpg category
all in all i found it to be enjoyable and i loved the jerry garcia herb dealer
nicely donein all my years of gaming i can truly say finally that sega has a good shootingdoomwhatever game
the problem is you cant really aim that well without getting shot about fifty times
the multiplayer is average onlinecapability wouldve been sweet
all in all the graphics are like any other dreamcast game worth its salt breathtaking
the sounds are nice with explosions and speaking roles not too bad voice acting if i might add however the gameplay tends to wear thin and becomes stale after about three weeks
but thyll be the best spent three weeks of your life
get it
nowa decent oneplaythrough game title
there are  missions with only a little variety mostly charge forward and beat the next boss
even with sometimes massive slowdown and even sound glitches under heavy fire such as sound cutting outand no music
 this game does provide some good rdperson blasting actionyoull find that the main impetus to continue is not the bosses or new levels
those really all look too similar
what attracts is the weaponry you find as constant upgrades
some of the later weapons pack a very meaty punch in effect visuals and soundguaranteed though once you defeat the stupidly lengthy easy but requiring  full minutes of repetitious attacks end boss battle and see the quotendingquot thats it
its done for goodthis game is goodup to a point
like the bots in quake  the senarios are either very easy or very hard
ive also noticed that when you start a mission if you enter the cheat that reveals the whole map youll notice  that the enemy always has more than ten chests of gold and at least four  artifacts right within easy reach
all this while you have to scrounge by  to surivive in the early game
later on when you control vast armies  which would make waterloo look like little kids playing war youll run  into computers which will naturally have armies approximately three times  larger than your own
the game cheats
trust me youll be screaming in  rage too when you enter the scene with twenty of your best units and find  that the computer has seventy of his
at least its not as bad as homm  which had one mission put you up against more than  bone dragonsi always have have mixed feelings about the heroes games
they are a combination of civilization and rtss like starcraft with a turnbased combat engine thrown in i really enjoy the building and exploration parts
however when i get ready to start conquering most times i find opponents who are ten times more powerful than i am
most herons maps require either a quick rush or a build combat force only tactic
this is especially true on large and extralarge maps
if loved previous heroes installments this one is more of the same
if youve never played heroes before its harder to recommend since the gameplay is monolithic
fortunately you can pickup other editions such as heroes iii dirtcheap
i encountered no technical issues playing this gamewell being new to the tomb raider games i just tried this game for a few moments on my new playstation   whoa this was not what i expected at all in both a good and bad way
first the good sidei was always a nintendo gamer naturally with a nintendo   in that case this game was the first ps game ive ever owned
knowing that ps came out much earlier than n i was amazed by the graphics in this game
voice and backgrounds are all very nice and realistic
plus you get to play as a teenage lara which makes it even better
you also get even more weapons moves and length in this game as wellin this aspect i was very pleased
but there always is a downfall  the controls
what an impossible game to play
and im not talking about difficulty the controls make it difficult
you move the analog stick from side to side and instead of moving lara sideways you just changed the direction of her view
then when you are lined up you must push forward to move
it is very difficult and some of the views do not helpjust to show you how hard this really is to master ive been playing this game for  and  hours now and still havent advanced past the training at the beginning
ha and the training barely helps with the controls
all you will hear is quotto do a long jump press forward
then immediately push jump
then push action to climb up the ledge
  yeah like you even know what they are talking about or when exactly to push these buttonsoverall i give it  stars
why
first off if you are an experienced gamer with lara im sure this is easier for you
second it is rather enjoyable considering i have tried to play it  times now in a course of a day
at these facts alone the game deserves a   but hey its  bucks
thats it
for that price it deserves a better ratingbottom line  youve played and like lara get this one too
if you are a beginner like me try an older version or another consoles version of tomb raider insteadwarning just a warning for all ps users if you only have a ps you cant use your normal memory card to save
you need a ps memory cardtomb raider
ive played trtr and i was looking foward to trtlr
know something
this aint a bad game but it isnt a great game eithernice  fmv lots of jumping and shooting
maybe its really fun but i still think  that i could do without the long long levels that sometimes stretches too  damn long that it seems that i would give up firstlots of backtracking
graphics and sound pretty good but not spectacular or amazing
the story  is kind of good at the start but becomes ridiculous as the plot  thickensthe last boss an egyptian pyschofreak is pretty dumb too the  tr last boss was better much more excitinglara dies in the end or  maybe not they have milk this moneycow
anyway id suggest you rent this  game first
and while i feel that the negative reviews of this game are a  little uncalled fori have to say that it does get boring and it does fall  short of greatnessbut sadly its the only ps franchise i truly admirei got this from gamestop for  used
i kept wondering if it was good or bad
well it breaks down like thisprosgreat graphicsgreat voice actingnice selection of weaponsexcellent storylinehas a bit of comedy in itlike when hana takes her towel off in front of a soldier and deke snaps his kneckconspuzzles are complicatedi died and tried many times trying to get them rightthe inventory system takes too long for me to get a weapon so i died sometimes trying to get my favorite weaponafter you play it the first time theres no real thrill to play it the second time unless youre trying to get the best ending on hardi still play this game when i want to its just that its just not the same like the first time i played it cuz i didnt know what was going to happeni didnt use a guide because i didnt want to ruin the suprise and man it was a painful long jurney  if you like games like silent hill or resident evilm i would definitly recomend this game but rent it firstpeacei love this game fear effect should of been a trilogy fear effect is a action game that is kinda a horror game at he same timethe prequel fear effect  retro helix  is more of a puzzle solving game but still is very goodthis game is the predecessor to fear effect  and the upcoming fear effect  infernothis game and gameplay are very similar to tomb raider resident evil and all those actionadventure games where you have to solve puzzles
this game actually does deserve a mature rating  with unadulterated gore some suggestive sexuality and mature discussions of vengeance and underthetable monies
the graphics is also welldone using a combination of anime and dimensional graphics
the childs playroom in the hell level is particularly creepy and it is very reminiscent of nightmare on elm street
the voice acting is done well but hana has the whole valley girl thing going on that becomes very annoying after an hour or so
hana was actually much more mature in fear effect  than in fear effect
the music in this game also wasnt as good as in fear effect   the cinematics in this game are great and are nearly as good as metal gear solid as a datetodate comparison
the only faults of this game that i can see are the long loading times  before and after deaths
i liked the fear effect series over the tomb raider and resident evil series because you have to have patience a whole lot of moxie some more brainpower and a whole lot more reflexes
overall buy this game cheap and you wont regret the purchase
otherwise stick with fear effect  retro helixthe dating sim thing is fun the first few times but there isnt much else to do here
some of the girls are really obnoxious and the gameplay is soso
the battle system however is simply terrible
i played it once and sold it
its not worth the money reallyso this is old school gta
its not a bad game for its day but it has some definite age to it now
the biggest problem you may run into is that you cant save it on a ps system
you either need a ps system or try to play it on ps without saving itgrand theft auto   circa good a better version of the original sort of fun and different in its own waybad really dated graphics even for its day gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for somewill it fit your taste a topdown run and gun game where you steal cars kill people and live a life of crimegame its most assocated too grand theft auto grand theft auto london  the legend of zelda a link to the past but a lot more urban and violentadditional notes there is a version of this game for dreamcast with slightly better graphics there is a version for this game for the pci first played gta  on the pcwindows  when i played it on psx alot of things were missing like the rocket launcher and weapons near the start area and alot of the voice bytes  wasted job failed frenzy failed
busted
arent in the psx version
thats why i like computer version betterthis game is complicated and you have to have a vmu cadr to save this game
i hate thati know there are a lot of mixed reviews
i am a disappointed consumer who will be returning this game
i love playing one personmulti person shoot em up gameslike quake  arena
i like stealth strategic planning spyshooting gameslike metal gear
but rainbow six should not have been made for the dreamcast
it just doesnt suit to go on a console system
loading time is horrible the graphics arent impressive for dc the sound is not so good and the controls are quite hard to maneuver
the gameplay however is potentially good
if you like stealth slow strategic game this would be an okay game to play
but heres a warning when you are playing against many enemies you will get frustrated with how difficult to aimcontrol the joystickits a cute gamei dont like the word cuteits over used
this game is fun and quite colorful
enjoy
i recommend you do some gardening this spring and summer though and play this game on the sideamber is different than most games youve been playing
there are no puzzles to solve
thats right
no tricks no frustration
amber is the name of a paranormal psychic energy measuring device that leads your friend roxy to utilize the new equipment in an old haunted house
something goes awry and you travel to this home to see what happenned to roxy and her new equipment
sound fun
it ismysteries
mysteries
why is roxy unconscious wearing the amber head gear in the garage of all places
should you experiment with the equipment
sure
beware as you follow in your friends footsteps while trying to figure what happened to her
this pc game is fun
it takes you through portals of time to uncover the secret of the hauntings
i found the game to be quite thrilling
things really do go bump in the nightso why only three stars
while the idea of mystery puzzles vs physical ones seems original and fun the game is easy
a young high schooler could figure the quotmovesquot out
you are given a place a circumstance and an enviroment with tools
everything you need to solve the mystery is staring you in the face
go ahead and give it a go
the plot firstperson scenario and all the truly frightening hauntings make this an easy going game
a perfect breather to play in between the usual brainfrying choicesinteresting little game though its nothing to write home about
graphics are passable acting pretty good writing fine better than the execution unfortunately
takes a while to get started but once it really starts its got some great moments
not scary except in a pleasantly spooky slumberpartyghoststory sort of waythis game has plenty of diverse levels but the camera is difficult to handle
for this reason the game can become very frustrating
the character does not really increase in difficulty or skill
my yearold son seems to be the only one still playing this gamei bought this game because i had played it many years ago
i was feeling nostalgic and thought id pick it up so i could play it again but it ended up not being particularly fun
the ingame camera is quite poor making it hard to see where youre going at times and the sound effects for the game are frequently annoying and overly repetitivemaybe i liked this as a kid but after a number of years this game definitely does not hold upyoure an oversized mutant version of whichever animal you chooseyou destroy major cities all over earth and all the other planets by climbing up them and punching in the wallsits like that the whole wayso if your say drunkover medicatedbored to teers or something like that then youll get a huge kick out of thisotherwise its  quickly loses its warm appeal just like cold oatmealrampage is a classic series no matter what anyone says
but rampage  universal tour isnt that much different than the previos rampage world tour
granted yes there are new boards new challenges from both mankind and outer space
and you do get to use new mutants but when it all comes down to it the game gets a little repitive after a while which always makes a game boringthat and this game was really long and if you had the continue option i couldnt find it and thats another dimension that made this game too difficult for what it was
i wont deny that i had fun while i played but after a while it seriously goes out of normal rotationi loved the fact that you like the last one could rampage with  of your friends and wreak havok on the world but still i would make this a renter first before you committed to buy
im not saying its not worth to buy but i am saying that you could easily get tired of this after a weekend or tworampage  is awesome
its more of the same from the orginal but moooore monsters
i was up all night with this game plus theres a twistyou have to save the monsters from the original in order to earn them
thats pretty friken awesome
the  new memebers of your team are a krab dude a ryno dude and rat name kurtus i think
i dont remember there names because i played this game awhile agothere is also another monsters thats and extra for the game
i think the monsters name is miyakis or something like thatway to go midway
this was a great gamei hope they make another sequal in the future rampage  which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean i guess if they do thatall im saying is they should make another sequal
its bin to longthe sequal to the original is better if not just as good as the originalwhen i bought this game i already owned a ps and a gamecube
so obviously i never saw it in its primebut as a stand alone game to todays standards i can tell you this
it is an enjoyable game with a mortal kombat style button mashing fighting system mixed with some long distance directionalaiming assault rifleslevelling up in this game is a cool feature too since you get new combos which can do progessively more damage or just look cooler
its also satisfying to watch jaxs metal fists pound into the face of some guy in a suit and watch him crumple but maybe thats just methe sniper rifle was also well done and all the sniping areas are an enjoyable part of the game that lives up to how future titles run sniping
headshot
the combos get repetitive quick especially when you reach about midlevel and you find yourself doing the exact same  hit combo  times every level
then you get new combos and they actually arent more damaging so you just keep doing the same  hit uppercut combo
there is a few interesting specials that you can do which are pretty darn cool but because you have an extremely limited power bar you never get to use them that much
and with only  specials anyway that kinda gets old after a while toothe puzzles are just mindless trash find all the lisence plates get the key off the boss run around in circles till you find the secret door you missed and other stuff that just gets in the way of killin some more baddies but does do us the favor of breaking up the monotony of the hit combothe announcer voices are entertaining and the chick over the radio has a pleasant voice too but jaxs voice overs are corny and barely passablethe music isnt anything too memorable the graphics are actually a nice par for the playstation  and the storyline is totally uninvolving until the end where it starts to get interesting for about  levelmy biggest complaint with this game is that it is too short
i dont remember how long it took me to beat this game but i would guess it was in the  hour range
after buying and taking it home that day one could guess i was a little dissapointed in my ten dollar investmentthis game is fun but hey its a game if its not fun it should be burned at the stake for having magical witch powers of evil that can somehow make a game unfunpersonally i wouldnt recommend buying the game unless you were just bored and wanted to try something new or there really wasnt anything else to buy at the timedefenately not the best mortal kombat game
although not pityfully awful like stated in other reviews the game isnt extremely fun
i spent hours tring to beat the game and when i finally did i was very diapointed
the graphics werent bad at least not too much
the story of the game isnt great eitherbut its the link that shows what went on between the shao kahn tournaments and mortal kombat  however the game plot also contradicts few things to the typical mortal kombat legacy
for example arent the four elemental gods supposed to be good
then why are they on the bad guys side
so in the end the game is somewhat fun and long lasting but is it really worth your money to me it was and at times it was but the final decision is up to you you decide i ll just give you a little advice dont get itrampage world tour did well in the arcade scene as it picks up from the first rampage title back in the s and updates it for the s back then
then midway decided to port it over to the n and in  it was released and sold a decent number of copies
its exactly like the arcade and its decent fun for awhile
then it just gets old fast and you realize you do the same thing over and over againyou pick one of three characters the gorilla the werewolf and the lizard
your job is to just cause as much destruction and mayhem as possible on each stage youre in
the stages take place in various cities based on the real world so youll see famous landmarks along the way
the police and military are hot on your tail so grab various health power ups to stay alive or eat the many innocent people running around
eventually youll fight all the way to the moon where youll defeat the mutated ceo of the company responsible for turning you into a monster
theres only one mode to play so grab  more friends to play along with you for even more destruction
at various points youre allowed to save your progress and since its a big game it will take you awhile to see everythingthe pros midway did a nice job at duplicating the arcade game so it looks plays and feels just like you are standing in front of the cabinet
playing by yourself is fun for awhile but its better when  other players join you and you can either work together or just beat each other up
if you meet certain conditions youll access secret areas just like you can do in the arcade versionthe cons the fact that its just like the arcade game is its biggest drawback
even if you play with your friends youre doing the same thing over and over again destroy cities eat people and rack up as much points as you can
the repetition kicks in pretty quick and just seeing it to the end will feel like a chore
its also easy as hell since you have unlimited continues and theres no penalty for not clearing out stages in time
the stages pretty much look the same except for the major ones since they feature famous landmarks but overall there is little variety
midway didnt bother to put in extra content to unlock so when you beat the game thats it
the only replayability comes in finding the secret areascities tucked in somewhere in the gamerampage world tour is not a bad game at all
it can be fun if you play it in chunks and it certainly is even better with other players
if you loved the arcade game and cant get enough of it this game wont disappoint
but with no extra content and repetition sinking in after playing it for awhile it keeps it from being better than it should be
get this one used if you want to try it outthis was the first mk game to try d so it was okay but not great
the controls arent bad but there not as good as other mk games and the graphics are just okay nothing special
id say this is more for fans of the series than general gamersthis was the first mk game to be in dusing motion capture technologywhen i first played this game i did not like iti could not grasp the new idea that midway had with this gameover time thoughit kinda grew on methis game included some klassic mk charactersalong with a few new faces toothe fatalities here were all done in djust as the gameplaythis playstation port is decentbut not greatfar from it actuallythe textures on the characters are pretty badthe characters look a bit blocky and the gameplay can be a bit choppy at timesanother problem is this game loads alotoverall thoughthis port of mkis just okay at bestif you got a sega dreamcastpick up mortal kombat gold insteadits the same as mkbut it has extrassuch as bringing back charactersbarakamileenakitanakung lao and cyraxplus the graphics are alot betterthey are very smoothpick that up instead if you canif you just own a playstationplaystation you might like this toojust dont pay too muchshao kahns final attempt to control the earth is upon usyou have no choice

over  moves and fatalbrutalalitites never seen in the arcade
new brutalities let you pound opponents until they explode
 humiliating stage fatalities that send defeated opponents plummeting out of the arena to a grizzly deathi bought this game yesterday because i wanted the nostalga of mortal kombat
i was very unimpressed with mkda on xbox so i bought this game
the store only had this game on playstation and not n which i what i wish they hadi took this game home dusted off my playstation and popped this game in
almost immediately i remembered how cheap and chessy these game can get
i had no problem getting to the bosses but once you get to motaro and shao khan the only way you can win is with luck and not skill
they both do the same chessy move over and over and over and over again and there is nothing you can do about it
if you try to do a move the computers apparant pshychic ability counters your move before you even do it very lame programming
they also added a throw to shao khans already cheesy arsenal which makes him even more cheap
this game is better when playing other human players   it takes more luck than skill to beat this game
another drawback is the slow loading times on playstation
  these slow loading times and also slow loading times during shang tsungs morphss helped me remember why i hated playstation so much and stopped playing it in the first placeeven though this game is fun i must admit this game is realy old especially now that the newest mk game vs dc comics is coming out this fall
this game is pretty fun like i said before but the game is almost impossible to beat and i think i only beat the game a couple times
if you want something challenging thats classic get this gamehard
this game isnt hard a all that is y its not fun the cpu  is like freaking retarded even if you put it in very hard  mode the only people that present a challenge are goro montauro and  khan other than that the game is like cake  i wwas able to beat the game with subzero by cheaply refreezing people over and over again  and doing it with ease  i like the one for sega genesis more it was much harded a challenge and better music unless you got human players to play with u  dont waste your time with this gamemortal kombat trilogy a fighting game that takes all of the characters from  and ultimate mk and placed in a massive at the time fighting game
basically all of the same sprites from the other games excluding johnny cage which is the only new looking sprite in the game put them in a fighting game that is just mortal kombat  with a few missing levels missing the pit  fatality animation and adding  older versions of the characters with some horrible animation
i still like the older mk games but with the age of the newer mortal kombats deadly alliance deception and armeggedon these games feel a little too outdated
i think this is a great game but it has a ton of glitches and theres only one good glitch in this game
when you turn on the  button fatality option and when you try to finish your opponent with your  button fatality it doesnt always happen
sometimes you might end up still trying to finish your person off and no matter if you hit that person or whatever you have to wait until the match is finished
when you play this on a ps if you have the speed doubled and you finish a match it freezes on you if you have the graphics level doubled and you either finish the match or something else that you do it might or will freeze up
if you dont have either option on and you decide to start over from the beginning that stupid buy in screen is what i am talking about it freezes on you
the only good glitch in this game is that when you play as noob saibot and you do that jump and grab move if your opponent is to the point to uppercutting himher off the bridge and into the pit  spikes you can actually have that person fall all the way to the ground instead of just landing on the spikes and having them stopping the opponent falling all the way to the ground
you can actually see a little bit of blue on the bottom of the screen when this happensbecause of these horrible flaws thisis why i am giving the overall rating of  if this didnt happen then yes i would recommend getting this but because armeggedon is coming out in a few days which has all of the characters from the series including chameleon from the psone version of mk trilogy meat from mk and  new characters from the konquest mode in that game and hopefully wont have any horrible glitches like this game does its probably pointless to get this
if you dont like psone and you have a n get that version
if you dont have either but have a pc try getting midway arcade treasures deluxe edition and the pc version of mk i think they released it for pc too
if you hate either psone or n wait for armeggedon
if you dont like the  systems and dont care for armeggedon get deadly alliance or deception on the ps gc or xbox
if you dont like that then youare out of luckfor those who hate gore violence  evil creatures this games not for youfor starters its a violent shooting game sequel from psxs doom versionunlike in duke nukem d you cannot jump nor crouchthe enemies are the same but theyre more plentythe mazes are harder but your weapons are still the sameeven though theyve added extra levels like plutonia and tnt the graphics and the handling are quite the samebut dont fret idsoftware would release doom iii sometime this month on pci was always a fan of mk
i always felt that the first mk gave the best atmosphere and the sequels killed that aspect instead adding more characters and neat moves rather then the goth dark horror i perceive the mk universe to be
this game steps back into that style with a feel for what is truly behind the characters and the meaning behind the tournament
however this game has some bothersome aspects like too few lives too precise timing required especially in the second stage with the windmill platforms and too much to guess at
over all this game is better then average but could have used a little more in controls
a good buy for mk buffsfalling down pits in the wind and fire stages are awful
the fighting scenes are kind of difficult as well
it can be fun but only with a low difficulty or the cheat codes
only get this if youre a hardcore mk fanomega boost is an okay game
the graphics are probably the best on playstation rivaling final fantasy vii
the music is cool at the beginning but later okay
the gameplay is not too bad but could be worse
after you beat it  there is not much left afteromega boost  circa good overall fun game to play fast and furious gameplaybad graphics might look a little dated controls can be a little tough game gets pretty is tough on higher levels short game with no real unlockables or bonusif it fits your taste a d shooter which plays like a fast and furious version of panzer dragoon simplistic arcade style presentationgame its most assocated too panzer dragoon colony wars zone of endersadditional notes static x the s rock band did some of the soundtrack i believei have had problems with not only the ultima s but exodus and ultima  as well
they barely work on my computer and are a mess to start or deal with so i dont play them
as for  and serpent isle these were very good games even graphic wise but now that my old sbpro card has been damaged i cant play them despite the fact that i have a sblive
i warn you there are no cards that use isa slotsrequired for these games you cant buy them you cant special order them and half the quottechheadsquot i talk to dont even know what they are
youd better have a good isa card if you want to buy this product
or roland daughterboard which cannot be purchased anywhere these daysi recommend buying this because its a compilation and its worth it to get all those games
its even cooler because it has video interviews with the creator of the games and i like to see stuff like thattheres  only one real downside about the games
if you want to play ultima vii  both parts you cant be running an expanded memory manager and some sound  cards require expanded memory managers to work so on some systems mine  included you cannot have sound in the game
the audio in the rest of the  games work finethe ultima collection include what could possibly be the best rpg games of all time
uc includes all of the ultima titles from akalabeth the game the ultima series was based on to ultima viiiin order to run these games you literally have to be a computer expert
you have to run these games from the dos prompt
before you get to play any of these games you have to fix a lot of settings which an average computer user would have no idea how to set them up or even what they mean im still trying to find out what an quotirqquot is
also many of the new computers do not have a pc speaker which all of the games require to play any sound effects and musicby the way do not expect ultima i exodus to look anything like its nes counterpart
in ultima i through iv graphics are very poorly defined everything consists of plain colored squaresif you can actually manage to setup and execute the programs smoothly then have at this game
otherwise i would recommend playing the nes and snes ultima titlesi picked up this title a good ways back
it was a final fantasy i had played when it was new and then lost access to
so being somewhat of a game collector my series of choice to collect is final fantasy and armored core i picked up this one pretty cheap on amazon
the gameplay itself is pretty much standard fair of when jrpgs or final fantasys were still you know
good
im sorry i cant stand in any way shape or form the horrible atb system that square seems to have such a hard on for in their semi turn based gameplay
i couldnt stand it in x was even worse in x
i cant call it   its degrading and guess what horrible thing they are including in 
yep you guessed ittwelve gets a reprieve from this sentence because of the gambit system and the fact that unlike   and x it actually has a plot worth mentioning
but i will get back on target nowmy biggest problem with eight is it has a large slew of happy coincidence that would make even charles dickens cry
i mean seriously damn
squall being wellsquall ugh
why couldnt this game be about laguna instead
head desk head goes through desk squall continues the paradigm set by cloud in that they have to stick the worst or one of the worst characters in the game as the main character
because the guy that makes the  tactics ix and xii aside cant write good characters up as protagonists to save his life
i hate squall
really hate squall
almost as much as selphie no scratch that more than selfieunfortunately as squall is a core component of the game he drags down what could have been a good story down to mediocre
every other character in this game is far better than he is in terms of character development
the plot itself is standard fanfare of a group of mercs end up fighting some evil big bad thing bent on world dominationdestroying the world im trying not to spoil things here and discover their significance in the greater scheme of things as the story progressesso they have a solid working core for the story and the secondary characters stories are fairly well constructed but squall again rears up his head and smites the story down from any high heights this solid foundation can achieve
just like cloudthe battle system can be turned into turn based combat which given that there are no ai scripts for allies is a very good thing thankfully
but there are hints of cracks in the franchises integrity that appear in this gamei think personally these cracks were evident in  in abundance but the majority of gamers were too busy doing naughty things to themselves over d graphics to notice
s coming out did not receive the fan fare because by the time it came out gamers were used to d these cracks become larger as the series progresses
at first of course its the little things like those dickens coincidences and a poor main character later it becomes things like basic premise and story
all in the trade off for shinier and shinier graphics
and of course stupid gamers buy more and more into thismy biggest beef with  is that reviewing it four games down later that honestly you can see the start of squares fall with it
and that fall started when they let go of the original final fantasy creatoreight should however be cherished though as it in my mind is one of a dying breed
good jrpgs
jrpgs in general need to smack themselves silly and ditch the tropes they have been running with for umpteen years japan is quickly losing relevance on the stage of the gaming world because quite frankly american and european rpgs decided you know what
lets make a good story rock solid characters and an enjoyable non turn based experience and you know what
you cant argue with the results
i doubt anyone would disagree with me when i say this
mass effect and kotor are some of the best rps ever
fable ii easily blows the post  ff series out of the waterso dont hate on eight
hate on its maker
there is alot of gold left in  to be enjoyed all of these years later
theres still rock solid gameplay a good enough to get the job done story damn you squall damn you and even better its cheaper than the modern jrpgs to pick upthis game is just ok i would not say great but i wouldnt say its bad
they sort of destroyed the game by trying to make it more like ff but its oki love the final fantasy series but this is definately the worst one in my opinion  is the best
it has a pretty good story but you have to draw magic from your opponents and its just pretty lame
i guess its worth the  bucks to have this in your collection but any other final fantasy title is betteri really did like this game while i owned it
its a nice attempt by squaresoft and i think this game really could have been a whole lot better than the way it turned out
i give it  stars for its good aspects and for the potential it had
well lets get startedfirst as anyone will notice the graphics are excellent
they are some of the best that the playstation could possibly put out from what i can see
but aside from that everything else about the game gives me mixed feelingsfor one thing theres the music
music is very important in an rpg because it sets the whole mood of the game and affects the mood of the player
unfortunately there are not many quality songs in this game
the battle music is somewhat blah and a bit overdramatic and the music in towns seems a bit uninspired
this is compounded by the fact that many tunes are repeatedly recycled
quoteyes on mequot wasnt bad but as far as songs of that type go i think marles theme in chrono trigger was just a little bit better that is her fully orchestrated theme song not just the little music box tune
the worst song though by far is the overworld map music
it is so uninspired irritating and boring and i know it could have been much better considering the world map songs in previous final fantasy games even the original on the nesnow the storyline of this game is excellent
there are enough twists here to satisfy those who like depth and the story goes far beyond the simple quotgroup of heroes out to save the worldquot plotnot that theres anything at all wrong with that plot mind you
every rpg since the beginning of the genre has ultimately boiled down to that anyway
really what stronger motivation is therenow despite the good story the game was hindered by poor character development
somehow everyone seemed very dimensional in this game
i think one of the problems is that the characters looked too old
this might sound odd but let me explain
the characters are supposed to be teenagers and they have teenage personalities but the graphics make them look like theyre in their twenties
as a result the characters personalities dont match their appearance at allmy other problem with the character development is squall and rinoas love story
dont get me wrong i like the fact that there is a love story here
but i dont think it was handled very well here
rather than developing over time or having some reason for it it just seemed to come out of nowhere
one minute rinoa just gets on squalls nerves and the next hes head over heels for her
all of this happens so suddenly that it makes their relationship lose all credibility
squalls personality is horrible all the way up to the th disc and rinoa is just sort of annoying at times
i think chrono triggers romance between crono and marle was handled better
even though crono does not speak you can tell that it developed properly over timethe next part and probably the most important is the gameplay
there are some nice innovative ideas here but i have the same problem with this junction system as i did with ffs materia  they both take away all the uniqueness of the characters
in ff and other games around its time each character had a unique ability that only he or she could use and the characters had different strengths and weaknesses
but now with junctioning all of the characters are basically the same except for their limitbreaks
so there is no strategy involved in making a party
granted there is strategy in the junctioning but its just not the same
also the draw command is far too tedious
i think the junctioning should have functioned more like the espers did in ffat any rate though i did enjoy playing this game while i had it but once it was done there was really no replay value
it has some major flaws though
those introduced to rpgs by ff and the like might enjoy it but anyone who prefers squaresofts older rpgs should be careful with this onefinal fantasy  begins with a cg video so impressive you think yet again squaresoft has managed to create an excellent rpg adventure
the opening sequence switches between an intense swordfight between the games hero squall and his archenemy seifer and scenes of squalls soon to be lover rinoa dancing through a field of flowers
its artfully done and very exciting
however the results of said battle are underwhelming
both men receive as wounds a scratch on the cheek which happens to deliver squall to the hospital
and so in a matter of moments the game switches from awesome to disappointing that its hero is such a wimp
despite some triumphs in the graphics area ffs lame story uninteresting characters and step away from the traditional rpg norm make it a forgettable experiencethe main problem comes from the games plot which wouldnt be so bad if cutscenes werent so long and there werent boring and cliched characters populating the story the only nonhuman characters in the game are enemies
squall is a cloud wannabe only he takes his role a little too far
he becomes an emo depressed teenager who delves too much into his own thoughts to notice that the games three beautiful female characters all have feelings for him
right
squall along with his archenemy seifer is a student at a school called seed whose purpose is to train teens to fight and undergo secret missions
seifer is a much more childish version of the frightening sephiroth from ff
he bullies fellow students by calling them chickenwuss rebels by not wearing the school uniform and intimidates his teacher
just an immature little punk if you ask me
the other characters include quistis the teacher barely older than her students zell the friend easily fumed by such comments as chickenwuss selphie the vivacious girl who tries to be so cute and airheaded its annoying irvine the cliched ladies man that cant get the ladies and last but not least rinoa  who finally gets squall out of his thoughts of himself and into thoughts of her
i would have liked it more if the characters were mature teenagers rather than your cliched selfabsorbed onesff takes a stab at a rather unique combat system which is great but the problem is it doesnt work very well
you dont get money or weapons the traditional way
the money part is pretty neat
you earn a weekly paycheck through employment with seed and you earn more money by being promoted to a higher rank
the weapons part is a problem however
the only way to earn stronger weapons is by taking material to junk shops and having it made into a weapon
the problem is the game doesnt give you these items very easily
you can only retrieve these items by fighting monsters that have what you need
problem is you cant know what monsters have which items unless you glue yourself to a strategy guide
for those who want to play the game without a guide or those who dont want to spend their time fighting monsters and hoping theyll drop the item you need youll probably finish the game still equipped with the games weakest weaponsnot upgrading your weapons means youll only do minimal damage with them so you will want to look to other sources of damage
there is magic but magic doesnt operate on mp and is limited
its more like a usable item and the only way to get higher quantities of said items is by drawing it from enemies
plus if you junction certain spells to your characters you most likely dont want to use those spells in combat
that leaves the guardian forces
these summons can do a lot of damage and while you are waiting for them to be summoned they protect the summoner from attacks
the gfs will carry you through the game though they have the drawback of having to sit through sometimes lengthy summon sequences every battle
making matters worse is the experience system
every  experience points earns your character a level but the worst part is that enemies grow levels with you
this wouldnt be so bad but it means random battles last longer than they should
random battles tend to be tedious as they are so its awful when a game adds to that tediummy very first final fantasy experience came from ffor ff in the state and i loved every second of it
what i must say must say is that final fantasy series does separate itself from rest of rpgs out there with the excellent graphic skillfully done music score and last but not least story linehowever ff was something different from rest of ff series
for couple hours i thought it was good then it became apparent eventually that the game doesnt live up to its legacy
i easily stopped playing it because simply the magic it used to pull me in from ff series wasnt there anymore
i didnt think the plot was something which i would go wow nor characters were fresh visually for being realistic rather than superdeformed but other than that there was nothing nadapersonally i love dragon warrior series
it doesnt boast any graphic nor has well plotted story lines of ff series but dragon warrior does a really excellent job in game play balancethe ff series was able to go head to head shoulder to shoulder with enix because of their graphic music and storyline
but this time it was way out of its own league
graphic was good enough music however didnt give that masterful feeling and ultimately storyline was justhorribleits a decent rpg
however i would consider it as a failure from ffs perspective
i really did expect alot from ff since the main theme is love
i really did anticipated alot  play this game when you have plenty of time to kill no other game to playi bought this together with final fantasy vii and when i played viii i was somewhat displeased with itlet me start by saying that the graphics for this game are the best youll find out there for the playstation game console the cutscenes almost seem realnow the disadvantages  tutorials make the game extremely boring
towards the beginning of the game some lady teaches you something about quotjunctionsquot for a half an hour and i couldnt remember any of it afterwards
there is also no plot
you seemingly walk around different towns and fight random bosses that have nothing to do whatsoever with the actual story if there was anyso i recommend that you try other final fantasy games first like ix and vii those are excellent ones
if you cant help yourself rent this one and see if you like it or notwell this was the first in a series of disappointing games from squaresoft released for playstation followed by saga frontier  and  chrono cross legend of mana vagrant story  dont get me wrong even the poorer squaresoft titles are a cut above most games but compared to the innovation and quality of previous stories final fantasy viii really falls short
the magic system is irritating at best and the story isnt nearly as compelling as final fantasy   or   worth playing but not worth playing instead of ffi like all of the ffs but this is the worst ever
i do like this game and the love story is great but no matter how hard you try when you get on disc  and beat the game all you can say is quotwownow wheres my ff discquot get ff before this onea lot of elements in ffviii are pretty creative
the storyline as in most ff games is awardwinning good
the graphics are good for its time and the customizing system junctioning is really innovative and simple to use
music is really nice also as well as the sound
but still not among squares best final fantasy games
this game tends to be almost too easy through the story but getting some things is really hard eg
getting malboro tentacles for doomtrain
i really hate malboros
also junctioning makes the game even easier than it normally is which makes it less and less fun to play and the card game is addicting but silly
but nevertheless a good gameafter final fantasy vii this was a significant disappointment
the graphics were ok but the character movements were very jerky which defeated the attempyt at making them look more lifelike than those of vii
the junction system is an interesting attempt to make magic different but  it was rather complicated
id say that replay value is very little and  the battle system was nothing exciting
its a decent game with some nice  new ideas but disappointingff in my personal opinion is not as good as ff
the story is an epic something squaresoft is famous for but the way its told is not as good as it should have been and that is the most nagging part for me and it just brings down the game
also the materia system which i grew to love as been destroyed and replaced with this stupid junction system
i see its good points but its too confusing
even with the ingame tutorial and even to this day i dont fully understand it to my personal satisfaction but good enough to beat the game
the graphics have been greatly improved
the people look like real people
they have hands instead of blocks and dont have lethal looking hair cloud
the fighting is the same turn bassed action as before and some battles can take up to  minutes not a good thing when youre in a hurry
another bad thing is how much you have to rely on the gfs summons
its nearly immpossible to beat a boss with out using them and most of them take a long time to use
the anamaters ovously had a lot of time on their hands and decided that summoning a simple summon like brothers will have to take a couple minutes instead of a quick  seconds
sure its great for the first few times but after a while it gets old
the world is completely futuristic and has nothing to do with its title quotfantasyquot
sure its not a big deal but im just pointing it out
the story is good but the character development is terrible
they have to make a game where you actually like the character you play and not one where you constantly yell at the screen calling him an idiot for doing something stupid or saying quotshe likes you cant you see that
quot because this games story is based around love yet the characters that are in quotlovequot hardly show it or at least the guy
i still dont see what she sees in him
the fmv is greatly improved and also the ingame graphics as i said before
ff fanatics should get this game but just be warned the story has a lot going for it its interesting but the characters just make you want to screama great rpg but it doesnt play anything like the rest of the final fantasy franchisemeant to give this  stars
a lot of ff junkies like to pound on this game and i can understand why the junction system really is strange its honestly an annoyance so i have no idea what squaresoft was thinking when they designed it
on the other hand everything else is just too good to pass up  the story and characters really hit the mark for me and squall is one of the most interesting protagonists ive come across in an rpg
be open minded and dont pass this up  this is squares last great effortokay what is wrong with squaresoft
ff had a pretty good plot and ff was awesome but ff was just plain bad
how can anybody play this game without committing suicide
im sorry but what is up with the characters
let me give you my opinion on each onesquall can you please have feelings you stupid
i mean come on the only feelings you have are falling in love with the biggest ditz in the game rinoa and just wait till i get to her hehezell the best character in the game
i feel bad that he has to be in such a terrible gamequistis rotten fighter ugly and stupid
thats allirvine what is up with squaresoft trying to make this rebellious cowboy in a futuristic game
it just doesnt make senseselphie she is also one of the cooler characters but is ditzy too
she jumps around saying woo hoo lets go
im sorry but i dont want a cheerleader as a character in a ff gameseifer hes pretty much only in the beginning and is in love with sorceress ultimecia or something
he is insane
i feel bad for him also cuz rinoas like in love with himlaguna he was one of the upsides of the plot for a while with the dreams squall has about him and also theres a major secret about him so hes one of the cooler characters also but definitely not one of my favorite ff charactersrinoa oh heres the worst character in the game
shes just too ditzy and is so niave
shes like in love with seifer and squall
face it theyre both stupid rinoa
face the facts
but i guess since youre stupid either one of those guys would be perfect for youso thats the character list
doesnt that make you want to just run to toys r us and buy that game as soon as possible
i hope not cuz if it does you need some therapy
i do have to admit though it was a pretty good game at the beginnning and the middle but squaresoft should have done something with the end and the characters because whenever i try to play it again the same word comes to mind wretched
so if you want a quality game buy ffix ff and one thats better than viii vii will dosquare only seemed to spend time on graphics and fmv
they didnt seem to take the time to review the storyline much because after the first two discs everything tends to get rather dull and boringfirst of all i really wasnt fond of the battle system all that muchi didnt like the idea of the enemies leveling up with you
i guess square did this to make the game go quicker but that just made things dullsecond of all the junction system wasnt a bad idea but the idea of relying on the gfs and squalls renzokuken doesnt really appeal to me or any other gamersthird of all it just seemed too rushed
they didnt spend the proper amount of time on this game as square did in number seven and number nine
it just seemed like everything was assembled in only a series of two monthswell i dont wand this to seem negative so ill just jump to the positive points
first off the graphics
everything looks crisp clean and very attractive to the human eyesecond of all the music
nobuo uematsu is a very talented composer he comes up with some amazing musical scores that is well on its way to blow you off of your chair
however it seems that he was rushed on some of the pieces and it didnt look like he had enough time to finish some of themthird of all the storyline is a good storyline but the game just seemed far too linear and extended over a long period of time
when you first play it you cant get away from it
but after you complete it you may not want to start a new game right away
and the second time you may not play it as often as you did the first timeso in conclusion it was a rather inconsistent game
it had its ups and downs but all in all its not a bad gameokay first of all this game like any other final fantasy is different from each other which is good but you have got to know how  to divide yourself from your predecessor
this game was very good on certain standards but i expected more
i have played every final fantasy and this one is in between the good final fantasy and the bad final fantasy
i liked this game and in fact i own this game but i was dissapointed
overall it is a game to check outfinal fantasy viii  circa good considered a pretty good ps rpg by many people famed liberi fatali songintro as well as other pretty cool cg movies between gameplaybad graphics are pretty dated game play may feel a little dated not considered as classic to many as final fantasy vi vii or xif it fits your taste turn based rpg no voiceovers so there is lots of reading card battling as a mini gamegame its most assocated too final fantasy vii final fantasy ix legend of dragoon chrono crossadditional notes there is a version for the pc
as well squall the main character makes a cameo in kingdom hearts and calls himself leon note all final fantasy are not related to one another think of each final fantasy a its own game not connect in any realtrue way to another final fantasy the only exception is final fantasy x which is a sequel to final fantasy xah yes this is my final fantasy vii review
those that have seen my review for ffix and ffvii know how i revere the sixth game in the series
which apparently most of you have never played
having stated my reasons of reverance in my ffvii and ffix reviews ill review viii on its own merits this time aroundfirst this game quite possibly has the most stirring and excellent fmv of any playstation game i have witnessed
epic battles grand dance numbers moments of comedy personal trauma action and despair are all rendered through cg and look throughly excellent
the in game graphics are remarkable as well
created too show a realistic sci fi other world feel
space ships sleepy meadows and fierce monsters all look remarkable even without the looping fmv
a true breakthrough for squaregameplay this is where the game falls flat
first of all the juction system was creative and dynamic yet flawed immensely
do you mean too tell me my characters cant use a potion unless they have a gf junctioned too them that allows them too use a potion
that sounds like a little thing but represents just how little thought was given too the junction system when creating it
its almost as if square wanted too make a system so complex and intricate that they forgot tradition and past gameplay staples
then theres the summon animations
okay shiva looks cool the first ten times you summon her the twentieth is repetitive and the th while watching the same minute long animation before you can actually play the game is just not fun
then we have the draw system
yah we can cheat and draw  spells from a weak monster
but youll have too do it  times per character per spell
which gets old
real old
real fast
the music helps too redeem the game
while uematsu sat on the bench entirely in this game much of the music that is here is well composed and fitting
but only the ending vocal track is a piece of music id want too listen too over and over again
the rest of the music despite being very fitting for the game just doesnt have the staying power too warrent a non fanboy like myself too buy the gamelastly the story is probably the most personal tender complex and emotional tale of love that square has ever written
layer by layer squall is peeled back as he finds himself leading his comrades falling in love and facing his nemesis
its the love story that eventually develops squall the most
and is the main crux of the game
other elements like the time warping are very well played and scripted
laguanas goofy yet charming shinnanegans are a perfect foil too squalls poker face and indifferance
but its the supporting cast that seems too fall flat in terms of development
we have one character in which the plot points out that he was a mamas boy as a child but grew up too be a martial artist
he still cares for his widowd mother and has a secret admirer
but the game doesnt let you explore either of these relationships besides pointing them out too you
this is standrad practice for the other supporting cast as well
its sad that a character from laguanas past who is in the game for a total of ten minutes is a more well developed person then the remaining characters in your party
character related subquests are even scarcer in ffviii then in vii
which was weaker in comparison with its predacessor
shame since its really the story and characters that make an rpg truly memorabletoo wrap up this review i did like the personnal and tenderness in ffviiis story
it was a nice change of place from the i should save the world tone of most rpgs
in ffviii you do indeed save the world after you grow up and learn a bit about love and maturity that is
and the ending is the most tender and heartfelt since ffviim glad that square learned all that it did from ffvii and ffviii
for the ninth game and onward they didnt have too prove thier technical wizardry any further
safe and secure in thier mastery of technology after this game square has since gone back too focusing on story and gameplay which are what matter the most
final fantasy viii is the best movie on the playstation  but final fantasy ix is the best game and story
and is far more reccommended provided you want a story and not an interactive movie too drool over
if that is all you desire stick with ffviii until you come too appreciate that video games are too be played and too challenge you not too give you pretty picturesafter just finishing final fantasy  i was very disappointed by this game
the first thing i noticed were the graphics
the life size characters just werent working for me
they tried to put too much detail into them and ended up making their image distorted
the world map is terrible
very grainy and terrible music
not to mention uninteresting
the best thing about a final fantasy game is the amazing storyline
not so in this
im not really clear what the storyline is in this game and ive played it
you never get to know the enemy in this game or why heshe is evil
that makes fighting them pointless
the fighting in this game is horrible
in order to get strong you need to draw from enemies which leaves you open to attacks
if you use magic you loose your strength
i did like the gfs having their own health though
rather than taking away mp when summoning a gf will take hits for you and they can grow their own levels
they have too many levels though
in order for some of them to get strong you need them at level  which takes many many many hours of countless fighting
i havent seen the ending of this game
the final battle is the only thing i have yet to do
i got bored and quit
ive switched to final fantasy  for now
ill finish up  after im done with  which is a far better gametheres a lot to like about final fantasy viii coming out of the experience of ff but theres also some things not to like
i admired the more realistic and correctlyproportioned characters in the game but disliked the final battles and the preparations needed to have some chance at the final conflictall rpgs tend to have super bosses and lengthy final battles but the story itself wasnt compelling enough to make me really want to care or really curious to bring the game to its conclusion
ff and ffx both have been a lot more compelling in this respecteveryone kept telling me that this one was the best ff ever
well i disagree
i actively disliked most of the characters
the goals are not well explained nor the means to achieving those goals
the graphics are only good when compared to earlier installments in the saga
the sound is terrible
i couldnt get into the storyline
i was fairly irritated by how long the game took to get into anything like gameplay
if i wanted a tutorial couldnt i have asked instead of being forcefed every  steps
im going to try to struggle through the rest of the game but for my money youd do better with ix or xim not going to go too indepth as it has been done to death already  just giving my two cents as i recently decided to play my huge backlog of rpg gamesto the goodas an avid rpg player i found that the most important part of the genre is the story and this game does not disappoint
the whole piece is a cinematic love story with various plot twists to make it interesting to find out what happens next
the graphics were beyond phenomenal for its time and has hold up pretty well over the ages due to its prerendered back grounds
the cg as most reviews have said are a work of art
music are up to the veteran composers standards and the new junction system is an interesting departure from the normto the badthe only thing about this game is the story
there is nothing to roleplay in this game
none of the choices i make have any lasting decisions and i am just left pressing the okay button to literally tens of minutes if not more of dialogue and ingame cutscenes which are admittedly gorgeous before the next few random battleboss battle only to repeat it over and over again  i am not kidding about this either  let me interact and play
its called a game not a book
you also cant really explore the world until late in the game every area is offlimits until the appropriate time its introduced
you cant modify your equipment as readily as you were able to in previous games and there is little point to the weapons themselves as the entire battle system seems to revolve around the junctiongf system unless of course youre doing limit breaks
magic too is not as effective as the gf system  which is another fault on its onas beautiful as it is to see these gargantuans of magic come to life to slay my enemies each summoning takes around secs and there is no turning off this animation  the worse part is that the amount of damage they do does not correlate in any way to the amount of time it takes to summon them
this means that every random battle and there are a lot until you learn the appropriate skills takes about some amount of time to finish just due to the summoning animationi had some high hopes for this game as i really enjoyed the preceding games in this series  overall its not a bad game as some would suggest but its nowhere as addicting or fun as it couldve beenwhenever a roleplaying game has the words final fantasy in its title gamers immediately attach the loftiest of expectations to it
in previous final fantasy titles square did not disappoint delivering rpgs that blew away their closest competition
sadly final fantasy viii is a bitter step back for the series a decent borderline good rpg but not worthy of the final fantasy namein an effort to be different final fantasy viiis magic system is cumbersome forcing many battles where upwards of twenty minutes can be spent drawing spells from enemies
then later in the game when spell inventories begin to fill because you cannot discard learned spells you then spend hours casting old weaker spells repeatedly to make room for newer more powerful magics
worse yet is the seed ranking system which actually punishes you for taking time to explore when exploration is the inextricable heart of any rpg
and because puzzles paths and graphics are often times not clear you sometimes get punished just for trying to figure out where to go nextvisually the game is admirable but fmv cutscenes often seem to be inserted just for show not for flow
the soundtrack is decent but lacks the epic qualities found in previous titles
and the plot of the game suffers from stoicism with character development being forced at best nonexistent at worst
these problems in tandem with the illconceived game engine make final fantasy viii a choking aberration from an otherwise stellar serieswhile adequate on its own merits placed against the rest of the series final fantasy viii clearly lacks the elements which make other final fantasy games so beloved
final fantasy junkies will pick it up no matter what but newbies to the series should start with final fantasy viiout of all the final fantasys of this generation i enjoyed this one the least
i had a feeling of blandness when i played it
the main character was very bland as well
still it was good enough to play through to the end but thats about itthis game was kind of disappointing
i am not sure if it was the story line or the characters themselves that did or did not do it for measide from the beautiful cut scenes and graphics this game left me feeling sort of aching to play a good rpg
which is sad because this is a final fantasy game and i should not feel like that after having playing itin fact i can honestly say that i enjoyed ff better than this game
the higher points in this game were the complex battle system and the orchestrated musicsquare decided to drop their morals a few notches by letting you summon buttnaked women to smash your enemiesummmm where do i start yeah this game isnt that great how everyone loves ff and ff and you know what those two in my opinion there not that great there really boring so i mean if you like ff then try it out i bought it many years ago and i still havent finished iti rated this game  out of  stars because its okay it doesnt beat final fantasy  far as game play is concerned
the reason why i dislike this game is it takes too long to level up once and the game gets harderfinally theyre getting star trek right
this is a thoroughly enjoyable  game with incredible graphics and wonderful if not always engrossing  sound
there are a number of significant but not crippling flaws which  mar an otherwise great game but for trekkies and scifi sim fans this is  definitely a game to getthe gameplay here is solid and easy to  understand
the designers understand that youre flying a capital ship not  a snub fighter and the physics reflect that through lethargic turns and  gradual acceldecel curves
even though this may sound like it would lead  to slow and boring gameplay its anything but
the tension builds and ive  found myself squirming trying to get my targets lined up for that perfect  shota great feeling of satisifaction when i succeedthe controls are  easy to understand but slightly cumbersome to use
though innovate the  vos voice order system takes too long to utilize during the middle of the  battle
vos relies on the use of the keypad to issue orders and to  distribute power to the ships various systems and between maneuvering your  behemoth mass of destructive power and then using that power to blast your  enemies you just dont have a third hand to play with shields weapon  charge rates damage control and countless other things
hotkeys are  available scattered through the keyboard but they are far from intuitive  and too numerous to quickly memorizethe designers tried to compensate  by creating power macros and its a great move
using the ff keys and  a control board under the engineers screen you can define preset levels  for all of your ships systems based on the tactics you plan to employ
which is fantastic if the battle goes the way you plan
still the power  macros enable the player to quickly redistribute power during the middle of  battle a vital necessity but one that looses the need to quickly change  small details like overcharging weapons after youve made your approach  under cloak for a devastating first strike
the graphics are incredible  with fantastic debris fields and damage representation
blast a photon  torpedo into the enemies hull and see the flames consume the decks
the  movies are equally well done but are prone to stuttering youd think  theyd have this problem fixed by now
yet when the movies do stutter you  dont loose any of the lines it just keeps repeating until moving out of  the trapthe sound is well done with quality music and a delightful  environmental background during battles but will occasionally cut out  without reason
other reviewers have had this problem as well and it just  seems to be a problem in need of patching as reducing the demands on the  soundcard make no differencethe game has also caused the system to  freeze up on occasion and blue screens on exiting are common
all of these  bugs are typical of interplay productions in my experience and i got  klingon academy expecting them to be there in one form or another
and  ironically enough thats testimony to how good this game is
despite these  problems its a great game and the gameplay isnt seriously affected by  these problemsin summary theres nothing particularly revolutionary  about this game except the fact that they finally got the star trek genre  right
theres a great feel to the game and a good plot line to carry you  through it
the gameplay is solid and easy to understand if a little  cumbersome during the middle of battle
and the bugs in the most basic of  program functionality ala interplays legacy are really unfortunate as  they add frustration to what is otherwise a great experienceid have  given  stars if it werent for these
im running on a pent iii   coppermine with m ram at mhz with a viper v m and soundblaster  live
valuethis is my second review of this game
ive managed to progress further into it but still dont think its a great trek game
so far ive made it to the fourth cd with six in all but its just too boring and difficult at times
i think they should come out with the romulan academy or maybe even the borg academy
ill keep up with it though
ive made it this fari remember this game being  highly anticipated back in  to be the greatest star trek combat sim it was sort of they promised  all sorts of stuff in the game addons  etc then they disbanded  degs leaving everyone that bought the game for  bucks with a broken half made game game going wtf and interplay then went  bankrupt a year or later
they released  minor patches to fix  bugs but that was it the game had real potential
i still play it on occasion it brings back  great memoriesi admit that i was one of those nailbiters waiting eargerly for q to be released
when i got it running i was more than a little unhappy with the single player mode
it is completely different than what you got from q  and q
in single player mode you fight in well simulated deathmatches  with computer bots
now when i read this on the back i thought gee what  a great idea
unfortunately most of the bots act like what they are  computers
the scripting on these things is way too linear
not to mention  that the difficulty settings are completely out of whack
the second to  hardest hardcore is almost impossible even for a seasoned deathmatcher  while the nightmare setting is absolutely impossible
my final complaint is  this
why am i holding the same double barrel shotgun and rocket launcher  from all the other quakes
the game offers only  new weapons which is  sadnow there are positive aspects of the game
the funfactor of a   player human deathmatch is unbeatable
if you have the means to play in one  of these with q you can expect all the fun as from the previous versions  of course you will need a fast internet connection or a local area network  to do thisall in all quake was ok it saddend and disappointed me  that the loss of a storyline did not produce lifelike and enjoyable bots  in single player
however mulitplayer is still a riot
you want a good  single player first person shooter
get soldier of fortune you will not  me disappointedlousy deathmatch appeal
uninspired retooled reused weapons very unfun level design and a shoddy skeletal system for models
that had to beef up the speed so it would be hard to tell
other than that for some reason it just is not fun
i do not know what it is just that it seems the fun had been yanked out
i played q and q religiously and was chomping at the bit for q
it got released i grabbed it and was very disappointed
at least other companies put the engine to good use for entertaining gamesut offers more gameplay modes more innovative weapons smoother graphicsquake  unfortunately cant compare to utquake iii arena is a first person shooter unlike the first two quake games it is a single player deathmatch game with ai players and ofcourse a really good multiplayer deathmatches
quake has the best graphics i have ever seen in a computer game environments look breathtaking charecters look really great and the multiplayer maps design is excellent
sure there are very few orginal weapons but the weapon detail is superb the firing makes us forget we have already tried them before and the way they shine after picking up the quaddamage is really beautifull
the single player gameplay is good enough to tell players who have never experianced an online or lan deathmatch quotthis is how a multiplayer deathmatches experiance would bequot with an excellent single player deathmatch with ai players
but sadely it is not that much fun for players who have played online or lan multiplayer deathmatches
quake has the best multiplayer deathmatch ever there is not a single dull moment as you keep seeking and destroying your friends or enemies before they get you
finally a quake game not having a great single player experiance is ok but i hope doom  has a great single player gameplay and not just a doom  arena
quake iii arena is not that disappointing it has great graphics and an excellent multiplayer deathmatch and that what gamers expect from a quake gamei have to admit ive been a bit of an unreal fan in the quakeunreal debate over the years
sinlge player wise mulitplayer and engine
i prefered unreal to quake  single player but liked unreals bright graphics  better
quake ii multiplayer was the nutswhen quake  came out i found  i had played the unreal tournement demo more when i first got that
it  doesnt detract from a great game but any game i can complete in one  evening on level  leaving me wondering if i can be bothered to do it  all again on a higer level doesnt warrant a classic game for methe  engine is the best ever and the bots are gorgeous as is the level design
it just lacks the cutting edge that ut has and im still playing that now
i do go back to quake  to make a change to ut but having completed it in  one evening i really cant be asked to go all the way back and do it on a  harder setting  the lastability just isnt there
still a great game  though  just not as good as unreal tournement demo
hathe improvements of the graphics are very good quake engines are always constructed well in sounds and graphics being a reason of buying a new graphic card most of the time
but this time in terms of playability it wasnt quite a succes for quake
i dont have any complaints about the lack of the single player mode i play quake multiplayer most of the time
bots are ok if you want to play in single
the problem is quake  turns out to be a game that rookies have more advantage
it is easier to frag than quake and quake ii and i dont get the same quake pleasure i used to get
it is not a bad game
even a good one for somebody new to multiplayer first person shooters but for an experienced player it is a disillusionment
ill continue to play quake and counterstrike but when im in need of some more blood it is still a good gamethis review will be cut very short
the graphics are goodvery goodbut not many graphics cards can handle it on middle graphics resolutions
gameplay is ok it gets boring after a while
basiclly this  game was over hyped and youll need one heck of an internet connection to  run this game smoothly online
dont expect this game to hold your  attention for a long period of timei am a star trek fan
i admit it
and i look forward to interactive games about star trek
however most releases are not very good starfleet command starship creator to name a few and it makes we wonder if we are  finally going to get a great star trek game
hidden evil is a good attempt  but has many faults
there is no mouse or joystick support
the game is  pretty easy and way too short
and for the best quotcut scenesquot you  have to install the complete game on the hard drive
to say things in its  favor the graphics are good i only tested the dfx version the sound  and music are well done and the game approaches greatness several times  but falls flat
if you are a star trek fan and like to collect the software  titles i would recommend this but dont expect too much
i give this  title a quotcquotin many ways quothidden evilquot hits all the right notes in a genre that has had precious little serious attention paid to it
in its star  trek adventure debut activision comes close to reviving a disappointing  genre
the storyline is strongstronger perhaps than the movie on which  its based
the voice characterization is no pun intended engaging
and  the puzzles while perhaps easy for hard core adventure gamers are hard  enough to amuse those of us with busy liveswhere the game fails  really is in its graphical quality
the graphics are hardly better than  designers obviously believed they were doing better work than that early  entrant into the genre because they keep forcing artful camera angles on  the player whether she wants them or not
these constantlyswitching  camera angles dont quite make the game unplayable but they are annoying  enough to waste your time
often youll lose track of where you are in a  particular room because the cuts from the various camera angles are so  severe your location is in no way obvious
in a few rooms the problem is  so acute that you have to move on faithdont worry though
the  gamemakers have made it largely impossible for your accidental movements to  get you into trouble
in one especially laughable scene its impossible  for you to fall off a railless bridge but entirely easy for you to get  gobbled up by an unseen monster
this of course is a significant problem  in a game which otherwise strives for plausibilitywith these  somewhat glaring design faults hanging over the game the inevitable  insurrection
it does wonderfully amplify that plot
you should also buy  it if you need to keep abreast of the development of the star trek genre
this is an important stepping stone in that process
and if youre a young  adventure gamer still uncertain of whether you like adventure games this  one will help hone your adventureplaying skills while keeping you in a  familiar environmentbut if what you really want is to be immersed in  the star trek universe be surrounded by known characters and solve  puzzles while galavanting around the galaxy buy the much superior  quotstarfleet academyquot on dvd
its often miscast as an action  game but in truth its a grander adventure than thisenter the challenging world of rayman and suddenly reality seems far too tame
free your mind as rayman takes you on arduos adventure through a complex realm of psychedelic landscapes absurd characters fomidable opponents and uncharted levels of dementia
this mindaltering platform game features menacing opponents that learn your playing style to defeat you
incredibly intense visuals with  colors and four independently scrolling backdrops
 surrealistic levels
over  demented characters
exhilarating cdquality sound effects and musicto start out rayman is this unique character who has cool powers which he gains along his adventure to save his frog friend globbox who is being held captive by pirates
it is a mario type game with tougher bad guys and rayman can throw balls of light at everyone
this game takes you to a whole new d world with a few dozens of levels each huge and challenging
the challenges are full of puzzles traps and monsters
it is a good game to improve problemsolving abilities
despite the challenge they are all fun challenges that differ from level to level
such as one level you must fly through a tremendous lava tube another you must ride a rocket through a twisting and turning pirate ship
fun for younger ages and it will take about six months to beat
you may want to rent it before you buy it but when you rent it you will be hookedrayman  is a decent game
i bought this game mostly for my younger brother but ended up playing it a lot myself remembering the first rayman game i had on pc a few years earlierthe graphics on this game are some of the best suited for the n
there are other games with better graphics but those are games like perfect dark which has realistic characters that under  bit graphics still look choppy and somewhat ugly compared to the newer consoles
rayman s graphics are cartoonish in nature so the lower quality display does not effect them too much therefore the game wouldnt look all that much better on the ps or gamecubethe one thing that i did have a problem with in this game was the camera
the camera usually places itself dirrectly behind the character but seems to have a mind of its own  of the time
and although you can control it to an extent it always snaps back to the over the shoulder view once you start moving againall in all a good game both for younger gamers and older gamers who just want to goof off and have a little funfirst of all the major highpoint of evolution was the graphics
they are very good
it was really a good show of the power of the dreamcast
everything looks good especially the characters
they even have facial expressions which is awesome
the graphics are even greater when you consider how old it is
terrific
i guess the graphics are outdated now and obviously they cant stand up to newer games and systems but they are still great
in the end i didnt actually care too much
im not too much of a graphics man
they have to be extremely bad to detract from the game
great ones like in evolution add some but not too much seeing as how it is an rpgthe combat system is okay
it has a system in which you can vary whether you stand in the front back or middle
if you are forward you deal more damage but also take more
you take less and deal less if you are in back
fairly straight forward
some special moves and monsters can move you forward or backward which can really add a tactical element you know most games add some sort of tactical elements except maybe ffthe monsters are wandering on screen rather than being random which i think everybody prefers
if you hit monsters in back you get to ambush them if you are hit in back they ambush you
that is great
what isnt great is the dungeon design
the dungeons are random which is cool in itself but it was poorly done
for one thing they really should have randomly decorated the walls
every level is the same long bland march to the next set of stairs
the later dungeons are  levels deep
not too great
once you get to the end you get to fight an interesting boss
which is slightly gratifyingthe character design was wonderful
i liked all of them enough to actually use them all despite some of them being less good which i dont do normally
they were cool
the story however fell flat
there wasnt much to it
most of the game was going through dungeons to get money to pay back the adventurers society
that is a nice setup but they dont do anything with it
it is fun once you actually get to the plot but it still isnt anything special
this is probably my main complaint
a better story even with random dungeons would have done evolution wondersthe level up and experience system wasnt anything great
it was fairly standard
you spend points on new special moves which gives you a sense of progress slightly beyond normal leveling up
you also find new parts for you combat suit things within the dungeon which all have their own special moves and stats
that is a lot more fun than just buying things
as a side note i dont really remember the music
it wasnt good enough to stay in my head or bad enough to distinguish itselfeverything considered evolution was a good twenty hour holdover until more rpgs came out for the dreamcast although regrettably not much else came out besides skies of arcadia
it was fun but not spectacular enough to hold its own
the lack of plot and random dungeons were what really forced evolution down from greatness
if there was anything else out for rpg fans it probably wouldnt have been successful at all i dont think it was anyway
go for it if youve got nothing better to do
it shouldnt take too longthis adapter is the right size for the right gameboy and is totally new but theres one major flaw its the wrong color
its pink not purple
so it doesnt go with my gameboy color i made the mistake of installing this before i was finished with the original roller coaster tycoon and it replaced all the old scenarios with the cork screw follies scenarios
i could not find a way to go back and play the old scenarios so i had to start with these
that alone really upset me
i thought there might be new coasters and things to research for my existing scenarios like other software companies did in their addons
also theres still no option to create your own open ended scenarioaside from eating my old games corkscrew follies isnt bad
its nice to have new scenarios and things to do and the game play didnt differ from the original
the graphics are still like the first a little cartoony but still fairly goodoverall this isnt a bad addon but i was sorely disappointed when it took away the original scenariosi bought this game not too long ago never having played a turnbased strategy game although i am a longtime veteran of rtss
at first it was a lot of fun researching new stuff taking over towns etc but it began to  get boring
three or four levels into the single player game it was still  extraordinarily easy and i already had access to most of the upgrades but  it was getting annoying
you cant have parties of more than eight so  when taking on a castle garrisonning  enemies things get quite  ridiculous
all of the units are pretty even in strength and the  cutscenes were not very good basically a bunch of still shots blending  togetheri do buy games for the singleplayer though
i dont have a  great internet connection so my reviews dont apply to multiplayer aspects  of games
it may be great online i dont know
however offline it is  fun and addictive for the first few days and then it quickly becomes yet  another game junked onto the shelfcaution  when youre playing this  game becomes one of those quotjust a couple more minutesquot games that  you never stop playingits fun for the first  hours but it gets really boring really fast
the graphics are poor and theres no real plot or storyline to it
its very annoying to have cops on your tail and its really hard to get the the next level
the entire game is filled with pointless pictures of people pointing guns at you just to fill up space
its a pretty cheapi cant recommend it completelythe stories there are  seperate stories to play but arent connected to one another are interesting
the mood is creepy
its in the resident evil vein of playbut the negatives ruin the gamefirst off this game nd only to the last tomb raider game has the worst controls
they are clumsy and obtuse
the movement is jerky and inconvenientsecond the game itself is way too dark
you can barely see anything at times which is frustrating
there are no ways to change the gamma settingsthird the angles
much like all the re clones the angles make it difficult to see where you are or where youre going
this is hands down the worst use of angles in a gamefourth the game tends to crash
one minute youre character runs into a corner literally disappears and the game reboots to the desktop
i never found any patches for thisfifth the autoaim is clumsy and slow
most of the time the baddies are attacking and you cant even get a lock onto themsixth the voiceovers are awful
worse than re because they are so bad that you cant laugh like in re
all except when the stranger says 
that was hilariousseventh this game has the most useless flashlight ever conceived
the battery runs out in mere seconds and take forever to recharge and when it does work you can only use it with a weapon
also it doesnt illuminate much of anything  its just plain stupidso trying to play this game is a matter of i just want to finish this and never see it again
attitude which should never be the case playing any gamebeautiful graphics good story nice voicesunfortunately the control factor shoots this one in the foot
nocturne takes its control queue from the d shooters the only problem is that it is not a d shooter and the  gameplay suffers because of this
still all in all it is an interesting  play
worth a buyin the interview from eidos prior to the last revelation release fans were promised a game  that returns to tr roots  is puzzle based and  laras objectives would always be clear probably in response to all the  complaints received over triii
eidos also promised that lara wouldnt  have to run around so much to find objects and that the emphasis on bad  guys would be downplayed
put simply tlr would be a return in sorts to  the original tomb raiderusing the eidos interview as basis lets look  at their claims
first yes tlr does a nice job returning to trs roots  at least in terms of atmoshpere and looks
thats my number one praise
but in terms of gameplay tlr is far from puzzlebased
it starts out so  but about halfway through the designers decided to return to the convoluted  ploys that plagued triii
and having just finished tlr id say that  laras objectives are far from clear
there are still a lot of thugs to  kill off and lara does an awful lot of running across multiple screens to  obtain objects
there arent really levels in tlr lara passes from one  area to anotherwith a download time in between
i think the biggest  problem is that the designers simply ran out of great puzzle ideas which  occurred sometime after trii where you actually have to use some logic and  your brain
this is what made tr so fantastic you knew that if you sat  in front of the screen long enough youd eventually figure out whatever  challenge tri threw at you
tlr however beginning with the cairo section  becomes frustrating because it stops being puzzle based and to make up for  this lack of puzzles resorts to annoyingly complicated nitpicky  nonlogic based ploys to make the game more quotchallengingquot and  thus ensure more sales of their strategy guide
ive never had to use a  forumwalkthrough site so often in my life
let me make my point as clear  as possible puzzles require brain power and logic
trial and error is not  equal to good gaming and is not fun
i seriously doubt that there are many  gamers out there who made it through the entire cairo sequence without the  aid of a walkthru
this could have been a great game and it was for the  first half  the graphics in tlr are outstanding and the desert railroad  level is innovative and fun
sadly though this game was ruined by  ridiculously complex illogical levels that surrogate for a lack of puzzle  ideasas ive said in other reviews of this series the first one is the best
it wasnt needlessly difficult and the puzzles made sensei just played through the first few areas of the last revelation and to my  disgust eidos has not fixed the problems that first appeared in tomb raider  two and became rampant in tomb raider threepuzzles are okay puzzles in  which you cannot figure out what you need to do or cannot find obscure  items because your brightness is too low or the items arent logically  connected to the problem at hand are not okaythe series still looks  great but frustrating backtracks and endless wandering looking for the  hidden button have consistently robbed this series of the splendor we saw  in the first incarnation
remember just wandering through the lost valley  or jumping into the waterfall over and over again
if that level was  redesigned under the current standards you would have to endlessly reload  the game because the waterfall kills you and you have to hit a button on  the way down which you dont know is there and cant see so that a door  half a mile away opens up
and theres no reason to think a button a will  even open the doori refuse to play a game with a hint guide on my lap
guns and ammo are way too hard to find otherwise
i gave this game one  more shot at recapturing my interest in the series
i guess im done with  lara which is a shame because ive really loved the seriespharaoh is different in the sense that the workers in the game tend to act randomly and can be hard to control
this game just never really clicked with me
starcraft warcraft age of empires and civilization were more enjoyable to me
but if you have played these to death give pharaoh a trypharaoh is every positive thing mentioned by the other reviewers
i wouldnt argue with any of them
it is a great game great in terms of magnitude and scope
but it fails to be fun
its one of those bizarre instances where a game is addictive and enthralling but also infuriatingly difficult
ive just spent eight hours on a particular mission only to have a glitch in the behavior of the bazaar traders wreck everything
a few more courses to go on the pyramidoops so sorry start over
unfortunately problems like these have been commonplace since i started my campaign
even when things go smoothly most missions require four to eight hours
im sorry i cant spend my life building cyberspace pyramids
pharaoh is definitely a case of more is lessi downloaded the demo version of this game and ive decided not to buy it
the first two hours of hacking slashing and managing inventory were very enjoyable
the simple inventory interface and character management felt like a relief compared to something like baldurs gate  which can get overwhelming at times
it was good simple levelingup buy and sell weapons armor and magic funbut then my face started to droop
this game is so repetitive depression sets in
nothing but clicking on monsters until they die
click click click click click
boring dark scenery stupid monsters and clickingi dont criticize others who like this game its seems like it would be much better playing online with others than by yourselfprosreally cool weapons armor and magic management interfacemany different ways to level up your characterpretty good sound and musicconscertain game players will get incredibly bored afterthe th click and may feel their life slippingawayi think i leveledup myself more by simply mowing mylawn todayi have a lovehate relationship with diablo  the new characters are wonderful i especially like the sorceress
and all the characters have special abilities that they can put quotskill pointsquot into
blizzard simply went crazy peppering powerful magic artifacts throughout the game
be ready to spend long hours contemplating if you should wear the armor of the fox or the beryl chain of light
i like the townportal function a lot which the baldurs gate games dont have
this saves you the time of traversing through multiple levels of dungeons just to get to town
there are also things called quotwaypointsquot scattered at intervals that transfer you back to the townbut
i hate the fact that you cant save without exiting the game
when you do save and exit you start in town again regardless of whether or not you were in a dungeon when you saved
any town portals you have will disappear so you have to take a waypoint to the nearest area
unfortunately the areas are repopulated with monsters
so if you just spent a bunch of time killing a difficult unique monster get ready to do so again
plus although you can hire mercenaries to aid you on your quests they have little or no combat value and are basically a waste of gold
diablo  is very extensive
too extensive
if you are searching for anything be prepared to spend a lot of time going over seemingly endless areas in search for items to satisfy the quest youre on
also the plot isnt very involved so sometimes playing feels pointless
but i still devote much of my time to playing this game
the reason it got three stars is because my notsominor annoyances have won over my overall enjoyment of the game
i would think twice before buying this escpecially with games like bg out and things like myths of drannor and bgthrone of bhaal on the waywell after about  years of delays to get it right youd think this game would be the greatest thing since sliced bread
blizzard is one of those companies that i hold to a little higher standard
in my book they have  fallen a little short
there are no glaring flaws with the game but it  just isnt the next step id hoped it would be
sure there are nice  additions  like a few more skills being able to run and a stash chest  but its the same depth lacking rpg the first one was just with a few  additions
dont get me wrong im not slamming the game
it is a very  decent game its just not a great game
if you like myself have been  burned out on diablo for years and were hoping that dii could rekindle the  flame i believe you are going to be disappointed
if youre looking for  some easy hop right in point click and slash action then this is for you
if youre looking for diablo but with more depth and more emmersive game  play then you may want to pass it by
if i were on a limited budget and  needed a gaming fix id look elsewhere firstthere are obvious improvements with diablo  such as improved character developement and better graphics
but there really isnt a whole lot better about this game than its predicessor
also the fact that the game has been  delayed and delayed some more has really got me wondering if they are ever  going to get this right
who knows maybe the final version might change my  mind but this latest beta doesnt make me want to go stand in line and buy  it whenever it does come outill start by saying this yes quotdiablo iiquot is a good game but no it simply isnt where it should be considering the huge hype and all thatthe gameplay is still the same
you choose your character from five different classes and than wear out two or three mouses as you battle your way to the lord of terror himself diablo
the most significant difference is the new character skills
you now how the ability to choose from a set of skills as you gain in level and thus customizing your character to fit your style of play
the game levels have moved above ground so that you can explore wilderness areas but also dungeons
theres a weather effect which allows for rain and lightening
and theres different npcs you can interact with and even hire to aid you
but other than this the game is exactly the samethe graphics is the biggest letdown of the game
theyre horribly outdated
the cinematic sequences however are the best ive seen
so if you dont mind going over the first game in a bigger scale youll probably be able to extract some excitement from the gameblizzards diablo certainly made waves in the gaming industry when it was released in  its strange mix of action and roleplaying kept many glued to their chairs for months on end and spawned nearly as many imitators as the legendary doom
in  the formula worked splendidly  but its the new millennium now that diablo ii has come to store shelves and it just feels a little long in the tooth
that hasnt kept it from becoming one of the most overwhelmingly critically praised games of  though
one pc gamer reviewer went so far as to call it the best game ever at the time
apparently he enjoyed the minimal story the pithy roleplaying elements and the repetitive clickfest that is diablo ii  or maybe he just needs to play more games because this one remains tremendously overrated
i really want to stress how gratingly easy critics were on this game just because it had the blizzard logo on the box
much better games have taken critical beatings and justice dictates that diablo ii is put in its proper place
even so its certainly not a bad game and can become very engrossing despite its lack of depth and dearth of varietythough the diablo games can often be found in the roleplaying section there is little actual roleplaying to be done
you are offered five character options at the beginning of the game and you pick one of them as your avatar  its that simple
it should be noted though that each character plays quite differently and all have unique and impressive skills or spells that they can employ when things get rough
of course you will also tweak your characters stats to your liking as you gain levels which is why this is considered roleplaying at allin reality though diablo ii is a topdown isometric action game and thats just fine
wading through hordes of demonic baddies is certainly an enjoyable experience  though i myself couldnt help but wish there was more to the game
combat only ceases when youre in one of the games three cities one city per episode and you really only visit these cities when you need weapons or other items or perhaps when youre ready to receive your next quest
quests are extremely linear as well
while playing through the game i didnt encounter a single quest that was designed to boost experience and was not somehow related to finishing the games main storyline
i enjoy linearity personally but the inability to do your own thing even just a little bit keeps diablo ii from maintaining its freshness
it all boils down to hacking and slashing leveling up and repeating that process until the credits roll
its certainly fun at times but its not enough for the game to stay compelling for long periods
great games transport you to another reality but diablo ii will never allow you to forget that youre just staring at your monitor and constantly clicking on things with your mouse
even the outdoor environments just feel like the spruced up tabletops upon which you are playing with your fantasythemed action figuresoh yes and i cant forget to mention that quotdiablo iiquot has a truly awful save system that would be more at home in quoteverquestquot in other words theres an autosave and thats about it
it makes casual sittings with the game become more frustrating than they should ever have been since when you die youll lose key items in your inventory like your primary weapons and youll have to find your body to recover them
to make matters worse enemies respawn like rodents when your back is turned and its just so bloody  aggravatingin the end i have been focusing more on the games faults than its virtues since i feel that its faults have been least touched upon in the press  but it really is a good game
it is far from achieving the greatness others have claimed but its good
if youre one of the few people with a pc and a penchant for gaming on planet earth who hasnt yet picked up a copy you could be wellserved if youre in the mood for some lightweight action
dont put too much stock in those editorial reviews youve read though and take note that games like icewind dale baldurs gate divine divinityquot and quotnoxquot have all done this isometric roleplaying thing considerably better than diablo ii
they actually offer depth as well as frenetic combat
well all except quotnoxquot but it was just so bloody fun
its inevitable that blizzard will eventually begin working on diablo iii and though it will certainly make plenty of money for the company if its to attain true success it had better acknowledge its peers and offer more than its shallow predecessorfinal score cfirst of all let me say that there is a large audience who loved the first diablo and will undoubtedly love the sequal
this review is targeted for the rest of you who may not have caught on to the craze or the hypelike many long awaited sequals diablo  was destined to receive as much antihype as hype
one of the biggest challenges diablo  had to overcome was the treemendous anticipation and expectations that revolved around it
i wasnt one of the fans who were waiting with baited breath for the release so ill try to remain objectiveone of the nicest things about diablo was the cool cg scenes between chapters and at the beginning of the game
the story was well thought out and after watching the first movie i was really hyped to play
while not a facet of the overall game they were impressive and worth mentioninganother cool aspect of the game were the tons of weapons to choose from especially with the barbarian who can use two weapons simultaneoulsy
unfortunately you cant leave things sitting on the ground like you could in the first diablo
gold and weapons go into your stash
once its full anything you leave on the ground will disappear when you quit the gamediablo  is entertaining but failed to really captivate my attention to the very end
i found the game to be unstable on my system which meets the minimum requirements which was a constant annoyance
it may not happen to you but it was a contributing factor to my level of satisfaction with the gameone of my biggest complaints with the game is that it seems repetitious
the hack and slash elements are fun but rpgs have come a long way since the first diablo was a hit several years ago
there is little in the way of variety
the same monsters are colored differently given new names made a little tougher and were supposed to believe its a new monster
eventually even the combat the saving grace of the game gets old after you wade through wave after wave of monsters that are far more irritating than threateningthe other big letdown is that they really havent evolved the rpg aspect of the game since the first one
unlike other rpgs which ill get to in a moment the hirelings and npcs are static and almost worthless
you cant interact with them you cant change their weapons and all their really good for is taking some of the heat off your back until they are inevitably slaughteredthe game is far more interesting in multiplayer as long as your not trying to connect to battlenet
if youre like me however and are barely able to meet the games minimum requirements and arent priveleged enough to have a cablemodem you might as well give it up
the lag will drive you insaneall in all diablo  is a nice little distraction for a couple of days but it is no t the best rpg or dungeon crawler on the market
if you want a real rpg and not just a dungeon crawler get one of the many fine interplay games on the market
baldurs gate  may be available by the time youre reading this but you can already get icewind dale torment which is fantastic baldurs gate  and the expansion pack and even the fallout games which may be dated but are far more entertaining than diablo okay
i was never a big fan of the first diablo game
one dungeon
many levels
many monsters
many weapons
many left clicks
that was really it
the story was decent but as far as quotengrossingquot rpgs go it couldve been a lot betteralong comes diablo ii and i hoped it resolved the problems of the first game
first off the graphics werent really updated
in act  the monsters looked bitmapped and the animations werent too hot
as the game progressed the graphics got a little better but still i dont play games for the graphics foremost its the gameplay that counts
and again this is where the diablo franchise stalls
i like the  different classes it makes for terrific replay value
but then again when icewind dale planscape torment and baldurs gate i and ii are out there do you really have time to go ahead and play the same game again as a different character
the skills were pretty cool and the plot was masterfully written and detailed in breathtakinig cutscenes
but something is missing in this game
i found some of the quests tedious and boring without any real fulfillment when i completed them
it was like quotgo here kill this thing and come back when youre donequot still i did find myself battling hordes of demons well into the night so it did keep my interest simply based on the fact that i wanted to kill the big dude at the end
i worked hard to build up my barbarian and i wanted it to be all worth it
the different locations were nice although slightly formulaic desert jungle ruins etc
 and the ability to customize your character was a breath of fresh air
npcs were okay as your interaction with them was limited to mostly gossip and a few quest checkpoints
but dont get me wrong diablo ii is a nice game and probably worth the money
but if youre looking for a real story with a quottruequot rpg feel a la different characters in a party format do yourself a favor and pick up baldurs gate or icewind dale
but if youre into triedandtrue mindless hackandslash diablo ii is your gameliterally too expect your clicking finger to be tired after playing this game
its just hours clicking on the screen endlessly to hack and slash the enemies
i dont even know why this game is called an rpgits more action than rpgthe good thing about it is the cg cutscenes
flawless the best cutscenes in any game
period
other than that not worth the moneydo you really need a review
if you loved diablo youll probably love diablo  its the same hackthingsupandrevelinthebloodshed good clean fun of the original but a whole lot bigger
everything about it is wonderful except the save game quotfeaturequot and thats bad enough to knock my rating down two stars
now when you save youre forced to exit the game and you start back in the main city where you begin whichever act you happen to be in
if youre between quotwaypointsquot and there are sometimes rather large expanses between waypoints especially in act iii theres no easy method for saving
it seems blizzard forgot computers are used for playing anything but diablo and thus didnt feel the need to create a game that can be saved when necessary
if you can get past that though its just as much fun whacking monsters as it always was
the nod to trilogy of terror is also wonderful
take a real close look at the rat mensoul killers then go watch trilogy of terrorits really hard to nail down how good or bad this game is
when i first got it i thought it was fantastic
and for awhile i played it every day
but i think it gets old more quickly than it shouldin comparison to the original diablo diablo  is a better game on all fronts
higher resolution graphics presented in fantastic detail
high blizzard standards hold true for the voiceacting
and absolutely fantastic cinemas that continue the storyline between acts
the  classes all stand on their own very well each utilizing different strategies to complete the same game
and even better the classes work well with each other in multiplayer
the spells and skill trees add a new level of depth and complexity that is a welcome change from the static growth of the original
the list continues to cover every fact of the game
of the two games this is the diablo to getthe bad side of all of this is that i felt it should have been more
in a way its wrong to feel that way
it is just more of the same with some upgrades
the repetitious hacking and clicking wore on me to the point that i stopped playing
but that is what diablo is and what i loved about the original
but i tired of the original a long time ago and this one kept my interest only long enough to finish the game so i could see the final cinema
aside from that the graphics appear dithered and dated in comparison to what we are used to
the use of d acceleration seems to be tacked on as a buzzword more than anything else and in many cases the software rendering is superior to the d accelerator rendering
and at that its only for some of the spell and lighting effectsmultiplayer was a mixed bag for me
i got the game when it first came out
the realms were plagued with problems and i gave up trying to use them
i have a consistent group of friends whom i played tcpip games with constantly
i never played the game in singleplayer mode cant imagine why anyone would want to
but i have no basis to judge the realm servers on
as they are the only means aside from trusted friends to protect yourself from playing with or being victimized by hacks youll have to decide on them for yourself
its all free so its well worth an attempthad it come out closer to the original i think my review would have been better
but after so long i expected something more perhaps wrongly so
nonetheless it is an excellent hack nslash game with fantastic cinemas
id recommend it to anyone with some warning of what to expecti got d oct   and began playing as a paladin
as it unfolded i saw where torchlight fate and titan quest immortal throne got many of their ideas
it is those three games iplayed long before getting d and i realized that i could be perceived as being spoiled if ididnt like d
i  played about  hours before wrapping it up and tossing it in the trashi only spent  bucks on it and got a ultimate strategy guide tossed in for free so little waslost
though the graphics are every bit  years old its not the reason i tossed the gamein contempt
actually i value a game by how much fun it is to play and not how it looks ltill revisit that pointthe movement behaviors of my character were so erratic and clumsy they reminded me of how aroach skitters across a floor
some examplesi click on a skeleton to attack and my paladin runs right past it to a door and opensitopens the door
to allow a host of other foes to flood the room 
why did it dothat
the door was yards away from the target 
how about standing in front of a target andswinging and swinging and swinging your weapon only to whiff repeatedly
how about swinging ata foe and repeatedly failing to connect until its reinforcements show up
how about actuallytrying to close a door behind you to try and control the battle fieldapparently doorscan only be closed by accidentoh 
how about trying to run through a room only to have thedamn door accidentaly shut in your face while foes catch up and throng around you
thathappened to me a few times but i wonder if thats actually an in game spell a foe uses im not interested in finding out
how about actually trying to use some of the objects in the dungeons for cover and your characternot only will not line up behind any protective object it will continually run around like agoddamn headless chicken
it will even run into clusters of foes that surround you and cutoff your retreatrepeatedly
i swear i cant tell if my paladin is mentallychallengeddisturbed or suicidal
its a joke
i achieved level  with a singular emphasis ondeveloping the shield battering skill
i was killed twice but both times it was a directresult of chronic controls failureall games of this nature experience the previous examples to a degree and its an acceptable reality easily offset by the fun  d does have enormous fun potential btw but its a potential squandered by clumsy controlsfor shameeven i in thereal world could preform better than my trained paladin and what i wrote about a gamesvalue being measured in fun and not graphics is spot on true
there is a game called dungeonodyssey thats created by malfador machinations
it is a budget title all malfadormachinations titles are thats clearly inspired by d but isnt exactly a graphics heavygame to put it mildly  
that game is far more fun than d and i can recommend itwithout hesitation to anyone who enjoys diablo style games
it is imho a superior product thandiablo  despite the fact d has all the ingredients for great and absorbing fun and though d ultimately wasnt worth the  bucks i spent on it even with its userguide dungeon odyssey is worth every cent and no user guide is needed
d is in the trash and dungeon odyssey is still on my hard drive i think im gonna boot it up and work on my paladins careermemory card gray  playstation   yes playstation  so   november peopel on  pps   getting ps   soon have no eye towards  this item a memory chip for ps 
its like so  yester yearthere were a few nail polish stains and the extension pakjumper pak lid was missing and the bottom was broken a bit but the console works fine so its all goodi bought this thing used for a  year olds christmas present and it still plays great
its a bit advanced for his gameing skills but he will outgrow it before it breaks down and stops workingwell its like it said used acceptable came with everything
i used my nes cleaning kit before using
the cord was braided to keep it in tact but wires where not damaged just leave it braided by the way
the reset button was stuck and wont work so i have to use the switch but thats not a prob
dog hair was down in the contacts which i had to blow dry out do not use hot air  sometimes when getting the game to load you have to play with the cartridge to make it get a good contact just like the old nes oneswhen nintendo  is compared to ps which is actually cheaper than this is there is one weakness that nintendo  has
and that is the lack of games
also n runs on cartridges and many of its games are costly
since the console is old you can get many of the items for this console and the console itself for a fairly low price
nintendo  was actually a big hit when it came out i remember so many of the kids going nuts over it
i actually never had one when i was young but i dont think i really missed out on much
if you are thinking of getting this gaming console as a gift to a little one then you should try to get it for a low price
my mom bought one fordollar amountfor my brother on christmas but i got one used for less
even though it is old there are many great games especially multiplayer games available on npros large selection of multiplayer games great rpgs such as zelda ocarina of time fairly cheap if you shop around pretty good graphicscons lack of games old so lack of new releases runs games on cartridges compared to small cdsthere are many games which younger children will love available on n so it makes a great gift for young onesin my opinion the crystal key is a good game
however it does have some problems
first of all when youre looking around the area the graphics dont blend easily
also the puzzles are very challenging actually i love challenging games
but i must say it has a very interesting plot
when you finish the game the villain dies and a screen comes up and says quotcongradulations
youve defeated ozgar and freed your peoplequot then it goes to the main screen
not much of a congrats
this is the plot somewhere out there among the stars lives another race of people
we know this because just weeks ago our radio telescopes accidentally intercepted one of their interplaetary communications
when we were able to decode it this is what we read quotdanger ozgar has been defeated but not destroyed
suralon is sinking
return to arkonia
abandon all colonies at oncequot who were the arkonians
and who or what is ozgar
only days later a gigantic alien spaceship deployed powerful satellites around the earth
all kinds of upheavals occured in the next two days devastating earthquakes critical weather shifts and drastic gravitational changes
ozgar is coming after us
you a hypership test pilot are relatively safe in the polar research station where the worlds first hypership is being constructed
after scientists successfully pinpoint the origin of the arkonian signal you are chosen as the last hope savior of the planet
your mission
find the arkonians and defeat the evil ozgar
i would recommend this game to people who are very experienced with strategy gamesthis game in the tradition of myst and riven has appealing environments reasonably challenging puzzles and a solid storyline and is ultimately fun to play
unlike myst and riven crystal key offers a d environment to  navigate via quicktime movies rather than clicking through twodimensional  snapshots
there are some disappointments however
graphics quality is  uneven and while i avoided serious difficulties the software does seem to  contain some bugs
the soundtrack has some pleasing snippets of music but  clearly the producers didnt bother putting together much of a musical  score
the interface while easy to use reveals some solutions through  its highlighting of quothot spotsquot on the screen
the end of the  game lacks the payoff sequence youd hope to see after spending all those  hours working through the puzzles and saving the world
ultimately one  has some sense that this is basically an unfinished product but at the  price offered its not a bad valuei actually really liked this game  or most of it
the scenery was beautifully rendered and the locations were interesting
the story line was not really very compelling however
it was more of a reason to put you in the game in the first place than a driving factor but that didnt bother me too much
i also liked the puzzles many of which involved lateral thinking and looking around the environments for hidden clueshowever
there were an awful lot of bugs in this game and it crashed frequently
and it seemed that just when things were starting to get interesting it was over
the ending was abrupt and dissatisfyingif youre jonesing for an adventure game go ahead and play it because there are many enjoyable moments
but you might want to borrow a friends copy rather than buy itrather like rainbow six rogue spear delta force  initially seems to be a slightlymassaged mission pack for the original delta force
the graphics have been improved slightly in that you now get to crawl through  grass and considerably more of the manmade scenery can be blown skyhigh  with a wider range of macho hardware the but the actual gameplay boils  down to longrange sniping followed by closerange sniping followed by  grenades and a dash to the rescue chopper
unfortunately for df it  isnt enough
crucially the voxelbased graphics engine whilst perfect  for longrange sniperfests is jerky and slow on anything less than a fast  piii
whilst not unattractive the graphics seem shoddily done with  buildings looking particularly nasty
its a shame really as voxels seem  to be the only way to display convincinglydetailed topography without  curtailing the viewing range
the gameplay itself is hardly changed from  the original and becomes quiet monotonous after a while  the variety  present in rogue spear is missing here
all the original ai faults are  back too  the bad guys have a habit of dashing straight past you when  they get up close or running into walls and sticking thereall in all  its much the same as the original and if you liked that youll like this   but only if you have a fast pc
its important to stress this
on my  mhz p the game juddered in x resolution making it very hard to  accurately aim fire and shift my aim to another targetdefinately not the best simulation game put out but still this offers some addictive gameplay until you reach quottowerquot status
there  are different levels and your job is to build a sucessful mall complex  with shops movie theatres rec halls condos business offices and more
with rare vip visits bomb threats and santa claus this game doesnt have  tooo many unexpected twists
you have to do a lot of waiting to get to new  levels and to earn more money
id say if you like sim games give this one  a shot if you find it at a cheap pricethe idea is clever build a supertower for people to play in shop in live in and attend cultural events in
you can build up or down for up to  floor but ive never managed to get enough elevators to really do that
and no matter how many cleaners you have and how many stairs you have everyone will start complaining about something fairly soon
it really needs more options in terms of transportation overallthis is the ultimate ant farm for those who cant afford one
you get an ant and you dig a nest
you bring green food to feed your queen
you avoid the spider
you repeat
you can while away hours and hours with this game  digging away happily but then you will suddenly realize that you were  digging for naught
why when you switch between yard quadrants all  you work is replaced with a randomlygenerated nest the quotwarp  spotquot is always in the same place the ants do just as well with  your control as they do without such the ultimate secret  tell to no  one you can win the game by setting it to max speed and just waiting
the  ants will oust the reds the humans the dog and the lawnmower completel  without your supervisionthis game gives you the illusion of being an  ant
it also gives you the feeling of how worthless a single ant is
try  this game
it grows onto youthis game is fun for the whole family with easy learning for the kids and  adults but this game could have been better at the start it is very hard to  get use to but in the end it is very fun but after about a  month period  it can get boring if you like simulated games go check out sim city   and the sims they are great games
popkornthis game would be so good if it wasnt so choppy
it takes about  seconds to run  feet
it was difficult to do anything much less get deep into this game
it truly looks like a ton of fun but a  mhz processor wont cut it
maybe a  or a  ghz
if you have a fast computer this is the rpg for you
if you have a pentium ii pass this one up play ultima online insteadokthis game has outdone what anyone could even imaginewelllitterally it did but you better have one of those quot years awayquot computers to run this at a fair framerate
if your computer can actually  handle this game and play it like it is supposed to be played then no  porblem buy it
for those people who can play it heres your review
graphic wise ultima  is the granddaddy of all graphics for a while but  wait till team fortress  and halo come out
every town and city are  magnificentley detailed
this game makes you quotdwarfedquot to objects  like ive never seen before
enemies look odd but if your a familiar  person to ultima then youll have no problem acually understanding them
in  every town you go into you get to interact with hundreds of people
you can  have conversations and everythingbottom line is that if your computer  can handle this game then buy it as fast as you can
if your computer  cant handle it then just sit back and dream of the day that you get that  brand new mhz  mbs ram voodoo  apg sounblaster live
 piece  speaker system computerthis game is really great despite one or two quotlittlequot problems
the plot the characters the vision of the future  one of the few movie sequeltype games that uses its name to the fullest
even if you havent seen the movie this games well worth the  for anyone who likes a  wellformed adventure story
this game claims to be real time but its  not really at least in the sense of the last express and other wellformed  real time adventure games
still its really fun and you usually do  things at your own pace
this makes this particular game more fun and  enjoyable than its real time counterpart could ever be
i think the only  major mistake this game has is that its too darn hard to get any of the  endings you havent already seen
after youve seen one youve probably  seen all of the ones you can reasonably access without changing your  playing habits way too much
and some of the prerolled aspects of the  game ie whos a replicant and whos not are completely random  obviously theyre prerolled and therefore you could get the same  ending over and over and over again without knowing why
and no this  is not an exaggeration
ive probably played the game five times and ive  only seen three of supposedly seven endings
one of these endings was so  revolting i couldnt bear to watch it not violence wise more plain old  disgusting wise youll know it when you see it
all three of these  endings were available through different paths the first time i played so  i just saved and saw them all the first stinking time
anyway i keep  playing it again and again to see the other endings and frankly it gets  oldto conclude its a good game and if you can bear playing it  about a billion times you can take advantage of all the annoyingly hard to  get endingswing commander prophecy is a pretty damned impressive game the ships are  cool the gameplay is great and the visuals are stunning
however it seems  to be missing something especially compared with probably the best game of  the series  wing commander iv the price of freedom
the cutscenes are  uninspired despite the return of favourites mark hamill and tom wilson as  blair and maniac the other actors seem to be either grappling with the  attimes cliched script or just not really doing a good job
the plot is  well it doesnt seem to be anything we havent seen before and the  mysterious aliens eventually turn into insectoid kilrathi with the usual  curses across the shiptoship radioi admit i was more into the wimg  commander series for the cutscenes although they were always supported by  decent gameplay space combat fans might get more out of this game than me
but i think people who got into wing commander for its blend of space  combat and story will be somewhat disappointedthis is a very pretty game
the graphics were top of the line when this title was released and it still looks very nice
however the strength of the first  wing commanders was the storyline
the filmed scenes in wciii  and wciv told interesting stories that brought you into the game
the  filmed scenes in this version serve little to move the story along and are  a waste i am sure they cost quite a bit to make
furthermore the missions  are fairly repetitious  you are either in a dogfight or on a bombing run
try independence war if you want a challenging space sim or xwing alliance  or freespace if you want a more traditional but fun space shooterwell first off i am not a big fan of simulators infact i hate them all except for this one its got awseome graphics and is very fun but difficult at timestachyon is one of those games that intrigues from the minimovie intro
the graphics and colour schemes are so dazzling that you will instantly get an adrenaline rush
this has to be one of the best rendered games i have come across
the gameplay is simple enough to grasp there is not much of a learning curve here
sounddespite the odd shrill female voiceover is very well done
so why do i rate a mere three stars
i have one rule to playing games
i play for fun and not to be aggravated
unfortunately tachyon has a few elements that are sure to tick some certainly me off
the game is played out on the job board where you will be hired to complete contracts ranging from deliveries to disabling capital ships
some of these quests require the player to repeat multiple times before figuring out how to find the proverbial chink in the armourtry disabling a battle cruiser that outguns you  good luck
that repetition gets boring real quick
each time one has to return to base rearm and take off again usually passing through multiple gates before reaching the target
that is a whole lot of lost gaming time
the thrill of the chase and intensity of combat assisted by the a graphics makes up for the lag
but my biggest complaint is that i have encountered difficulties with the docking controls
on a few occasions i have had to spend up to an hour just trying to dock despite the autodock feature because the ai wouldnt acknowledge that i was there
indeed i had to abandon one quest rescue the persephone because the auto dock didnt work
its not just a thing that makes you go huh
but is also very annoying
the quests simply lack the depth and sophistication lasting little more than  min
on average to overcome the deficiencies
dont get me wrong i still think this is a great game graphically speaking but the repetition and bugs really spoil the funfreespace  has a lot going for it
its a model space flight simulation
you spend almost all your time flying and fighting with great controls theres good ai both for enemies and your wing graphics and sound are very good also
additionally theres good multitiered story although part of it remains unresolved at the end
some of the briefings that advance the story introduce new weapons and review mission objectives can drag a little too longbut as i finish the single player campaign what sticks in my mind isnt the good above but the disappointments
most of the game takes place in a large nebula
multicolored gas and lens flare effects fill the screen the result feeling like playing with a large flashlight in your eyes
it doesnt improve the gameplay it just irritating
most missions are the straight kill everything type
other missions seem designed to frustrate you
for example one mission requires you to fly a series of waypoints that are basically in a straight line
the catch is you cant see the next way point from your current one so if you waver off course you become hopelessly lost and have to start over
finally a handful of missions are usually difficult pitting you solo against a large number of enemies or timed with unclear objectivesapart from a badlyscratched install disc i had no trouble running the game in windows  nothing i tried would get the game to install in windows overall i liked this game
good smooth graphics speaking since it doesnt require highend expensive graphics card
only thing i hated was i can click tricorder map and go directly to the spot i have to scroll slowly to the spot
there is no cheats to this game either unlike most games out there
you cant save games during missions only between them
i dont mind this but you might
i have amd k mhz computer and it hasnt crashed on me yet
it seems pretty stable to mein the past few years star trek games have been getting better
with the release of starfleet command the road to better games starts herestarfleet command starts out good with a training mission or two and then goes into actual missions
the addition of sulu training you is a big plus to this game
however after playing a few missions it gets very repetitive in action despite the changing plotsthe graphics are good but not great
a d card really doesnt improve thingswhile this is one of the better star trek games there isnt much variety to iti really wanted to like this game based on all of the praise it has received and the fact that i really dont have the time to play simply mediocre games
after having played the baldurs gate series and thoroughly enjoying it i thought that this would be more of the same immersive fantasybased gaming
on some levels this game is successful in creating an interesting world to explore with some fascinating people to meet and things to do
the story itself is quite intriguing and wellwritten
the problem is that the game is slowly paced for the first several hours and is tedious throughoutgameplay the controls are fairly simple and should be familiar to anyone who has played baldurs gate and similar rpg titles
your character is an immortal amnesiac who must find out who he is and how to resolve his curse of immortality
the character creation options seem flexible at first but they really arent
while you can change classes during the game you had best learn how to do one thing well or there will likely be problems later
also your alignment moral view may change based on your actions but many of the games quests including the main one are scripted for right answers that might force your character to play out of character
also there are some unreasonable limits placed on combat
in  hours of gameplay i didnt come across one projectile weapon which meant that all fights were melee skirmishes
moreover you cant tell how wounded your opponents are until they actually kill overplanescape torment is a very textheavy game which is both its strength and greatest weakness
whoever wrote the dialogue and story is a talented writer and this would have actually made a decent novel
however much of the dialogue gets in the way of the gameplay in ways that are truly annoying
youll find yourself running back and forth between people going through their entire dialogue trees looking for clues several times
sometimes those clues will not be found unless you know exactly who to talk to when and about what topic
even then you might not get what you are looking for
some of the quests are very imaginative but others are greatly hindered by this askeverybodyeverythingeverytime approachthe dialogue issue would not be such a problem if it did not plague the main quest but it does
i hate to consult walkthrough guides but you will probably have to in order to get pass a few of the several places where you simply wont know what to do next who to talk to or what item you need
there is an ingame journal that can be useful but even it wont point you in the right direction on some occasions and completed quests are not always taken out of the assigned quests categoryactually this is the first computer rpg that i have played that could not hold my interest until the end
this was largely due to the tedious nature of the gameplay
i knew that it was time to quit when i defeated the main boss just to get a message afterward that said that in effect i had not chosen the correct specific dialogue options before defeating this enemy
what
it was like finally meeting diablo at the end of diablo  or dagoth ur at the end of morrowind or jon irenicus at the end of baldurs gate  and winning the fight just to learn that you had not been nice enough in your dialogue responses before the fight started and thus would have to redo the  minutes of dialogue that preceded the encounter
very frustratinggraphics visual representation is decent even by todays standards
character models look good as do environments
the game does have a certain drabness about it which is part of the storyline
but overall the graphics are finesound decent but nothing memorable
the weather in the main city of sigil is always the same so there are no thunderstorms or other ambient noises
the voice acting is decent but quite sparse
more of it would have made the story even more immersive and less textdriven
the music was okay but again not memorablereplayabilityvalue i couldnt bear to get through one complete playing of the game so i cant recommend it for repeat plays
if you insist upon playing this game try to get it cheap  or less
the story and quests seem too linear to warrant doing them a second time especially since you are the same basic character during every game
there are a few interesting party members such as morte and annah but npc interaction here does not measure up to the high standard set by the baldurs gate gamesoverall i cannot recommend this game to anyone except very patient andor hardcore roleplaying gamers
for everyone else there are many computer rpgs available now that are clearly superior to the gameplay story line and graphics of planescape torment
if you want to play a truely excellent classic rpg check out morrowind the baldurs gate series gothic  or even the diablo series
though it has a good story my suspicion is that planescape torment largely appeals to a specific niche of the computer roleplaying market which does not mind its tedious dialogue system linear questing and bizarre storyoh well
in its time this game was a
its time has passed though
its still somewhat fun  but graphics and the like have advanced so far beyond this i dont feel right raving on to hard on it
if its a bargain priced game or a decent nd hand copy it is fun for a run through
the story and difficulty are quite good so that helps it hold up thats a plusi dont know i bought this game way back when thinking it was going to be like baldurs gate big mistake
while the graphics and interface where similar i just didnt comprehend it
maybe if they would have had a thing  where you could travel to other plains like dragonlance or the forgotten realms it would have been better but all in all the game seemed moderate at best
like i said maybe it is just me but where baldurs gate succeeded this game failedwhat would happen if there was a place where there existed a portal to anywhere you wanted to go both real and imaginary
you would find yourself in sigil the city of doors deep in the center of the multiverse known as planescape a place where the mere belief in something will cause its existence
you play the role of the nameless one an immortal being with a touch of amnesia in his search to find out about himselfgameplaytorment utilizes the infinity engine made popular by baldurs gate yet it seems to be geared more toward the new rpger rather than fans of bg
the interface is probably the only downside to this game
everything is accessed through a circular rightclick menu that is accessed during a paused game
everything from talking to your characters changing weapons casting a spell and using special abilities is run from this window
its a good idea in theory yet it tries to do too much with too little
the original quick buttons found in bg were a much more efficient setupthe game uses a slightly modified add second generation ruleset
as with the interface the rule set has been simplified in this game
you have no choice to your starting character
simply put you are the nameless  an immortal human male who starts as a fighter
during the game you have the option of changing between your starting class of a fighter and a thief or mage
theres no dualclassing switching to another class is like building a new character yet switching back you will find all your previously earned experience saved
your available party members are not only locked in whatever class you find them in but are for the most part locked in their weapon and armor choiceswhat makes this game one of the better rpgs on the market is the story
in your quest to discover yourself you learn about the story and concept of the planeworlds an interesting universe where belief is very fabric of being
though it introduces the player to the world the story is very linear and youll find yourself without much choice in the matter besides your decision to play good or evilgraphicsif youve played any of the black isle games on the infinity engine youll be very familiar with the sights and sounds of torment
its a bit more zoomed in than the others and that can lead to confusion when trying to cross long distances without the use of your minimap
but for being  years old and only x it is very artistically done
a lot of work was put into creating a town that looks and feels like it could be the center of the universe
besides the obvious the game has aged very wellsoundthe ambient music is excellently done as well as the voice acting
the biggest problem is in the games eax manipulation
if you have this turned on youll be hard pressed to hear the voiceacting in any outdoor or cavernous scenes as it just blends into whitenoise
besides that the only annoyance comes with the apparent necessity to have your characters have a voice prompt after they do anything
after youve heard one of your character announce they have stealthed for the umpteenth time youll be hoping to never hear it againoverallwhile its a fun game its not quite my cupoftea
your character is immortal you die and wake up somewhere with your inventory intact
for the most part you can go around with your level one thief and try to take out city guards with no side effect
the game is just too easy even at the hardest settings
add that to the severely linear gameplay and at times it becomes a little slow
its your typical quest driven rpg without much in the way of side quests
luckily you have a variable alignment which can change depending on your actions  and that adds a little to the mix but not enough
if the story wasnt as well written then this game would have been a flop so pick this up as a nice interactive novel but dont expect a second play through unless the best rpg youve played before this is fftoy commander is an addictive game that is very neat but the difficulty tight controls and lack of proper instructions really ruin it
i am told to cook breakfast by knocking eggs into a pot and then heating them up
with an airplane
how do i hit microscopic eggs if i can barley even fly over the counter
and then once i knock them all into the pot i need to heat it up
how
i still dont know to this very day
if you can stand the high level of challenge this game is great
if you cant dreamcast has plently more to offerthis game was good about  years ago at best but is really outdated now
hidden and dangerous  is the better choicei have had a hard time getting this game to play it run to vary slow
but i have an older computer
i dont know if it was do to my computer or the game
im working on it
i have a dell computer with window xp this game can be fun to play
making movies is fun and trying the various adventures can be amusing as well
however there really arent enough adventures to keep you interested if you arent interested in taking a three hourflight from new york to paris in a concorde of course
personally i grew tired of the game after i ran out of the adventures
i tried the lessons and its fun to try to land at an airport in a storm at nightbut after you beat those things theres really no reason to try to do them againyou can also try to earn the various liscences that realworld pilots can
for instance you can try to earn an atp airline transport pilot certificate by flying a  around performing various maneuvers
it is fairly fun and will keep your interest for a while
once you get the hang of flying the planes though the tests become easy and present little challenge
until you master them however they will keep you busythe game also gives you the gps coordinates for most of the famous landmarks so you dont have to fly around looking for them yourself
i used that tactic on several occasions just jumping to the area i wantedas with any flying game landing is a real challenge
in general it will take you a little while to master the art of landing but thats only day time approaches
night time landings are a whole different story
just finding the runway is often a challenge although radar helps a lot
still until you learn to use radar to the best of your ability youll pretty much rely on your sight to tell you where things arei think that what i was expecting from this game was something akin to a storytelling game in which you took the role of a young pilots live and completed various tests until you finally get the ok to fly then flying to various places as a realworld pilot would for money until you retired and bought more airplanes
of course that isnt the way the game is and it is one of the reasons why after you master the game you have no reason to replay it
you can pretty much fly anywhere you want at the beginning of the game and so theres no reason to even attempt some of the various license tests unless youre really desperate for something new to trytherefore the gameplay is very average
i think that if this game had more adventures andor had more things to do in multiplayer it would have recieved a five in this area
as it stands however it needs a lot more replay value before it is considered an excellent flight simmicrosoft flight simulator  pro is a very average game
its controls are very good its graphics are awesome but the price you pay for that is a lot of slowdown and the replay value is minimal
you can also play it on microsofts zone  but i didnt even try that simply because of the fact that if im having this much slowdown in the single player game the multiplayer game will probably not even work for me
not only that i really dont see how flying commercial aircraft would be really fun with other people
what would you do race someone from new york to paris
i think that the real hardcore flight simmers might like the the idea of racing your buddy like that but for me it really doesnt have that much potential
however the game played in single player is fairly fun
i enjoyed flying around new york city seeing the statue of liberty and the various other sites
as far as i know microsoft hasnt released a patch to delete the world trade towers from the game so theyre still therethe manual is very well designed and will tell you how to fly your plane with little fuss
lessons are included in the game as well
however i found it hard to find some of themas in you have to navigate through several of the ingame menus before you actually find anything
however you really need to read the manual before you go flying unless you turn the realism settings on lowthere are also several of what this game calls adventures
basically what they are are predeveloped flights with a certian objective
for instance in one adventure your prop plane runs out of fuel out in the middle of the ocean
you get permission to land on an aircraft carrier that just happens to be patrolling the area
you then have to land your plane with no engine power on the deck
very innovative
in another adventure you have to fly under the russians radar in red square to try to land your plane
supposedly if you dont fly under the radar they will target you and shoot you down
however i have never had that happen to me no matter where i flew my planeyou can also create your own movies
however i found this fairly confusing and really didnt get into it much
it has potential though
imagine flying over paris at night in a concordethen watching what your plane did
since you have a cockpit view you really cant see the outside of your planeso with a movie you would get to do that
movies also have the potential to be cool if you are interested in airplane aerobaticsin case it needs to be said i would highly recommend playing this game with a joystick
i cant remember if it actually says that a joystick is required on the back of the games box but regardless if you want this game you really should buy a joystick
i cant imagine playing this game with a keyboard and mouseoverall i would recommend this game to hardcore flight simmers who want to absolute most realistic thing they can get their hands on and dont mind some slowdown
to people that want to fly but want something to do while theyre up there i would steer them away from this game and insted direct them toward a combat flight simulationits a lot like the first game which was great but i would have preferred it if we had been given more technologies to research
all the discovery seems to be over a bit too quick before each game boils down to the standard smash the enemy to pieces part
in this respect it became quite repetitive especially when you consider how long it takes to get a good game going
the only alternative is to try out different civilizations and only then its just the architecture thats differenti do like this game a lot but i just wish for a bit more diversity and more surprises in the next one as inage of empires iii notage of mythology
ive not played the expansion pack yet but if it gives us more to work with then ill definitely check it outi never liked age of empiresi think ensemble never put much effort into itwell the video is terrible and it looks kind of glum everywhere even in daylightthe missions or campaighns were not highly interestingwell the only thing is that at times it males u thinkand that cheered up the glum atmosphereoverall this is just a shadow of what age of mythology isthis game was fun for awhile but i enjoy faster paced strategy games better
stronghold cc  the graphics were great for their time but show their age now
the sound is pretty good
the gameplay as mentioned above is not my style so i didnt like it much
overall a  out of dont get me wrong im one of the biggest fans of aoe  and rise of rome but i didnt like this sequel
first of all maybe i bought a beta version or something but why is it that when a monk moves abracadabra he  turns back into our wellknown priest from aoe 
is it that the  programmers were too lazy to reprogram the game fully
again it could just  be that my version had bugs in it but it is still suspicious and very  annoying this happens with other infantry units as well
also i dont  see all that much difference when compared to the original in fact  whenever they have changed something it is usually for the worse it now  costs loadsa times more to research new units i know they are trying to be  realistic but cmon anyone whos thinking of adding this to their  collection should go for the first two titles they are definately  betterthis is an excellent quotproductquot from a guy who admits he is just a quotcasualquot gamer
he actually admits this in an interview somewhere and i think hes more competent than most designers and much  older
so there you little whipper snappersmy main complaint with this  game has nothing to do with the game or developers except that they should  be more careful about who they allow to start fan sites
a certain very  popular site perhaps the best site with the best forum gave me a very bad  experience
in one of my first posts a regular there refered to me as  stupid and silly and wondered in public if i was senile
all this because i  questioned the diplomatic system in aok which any competent reviewer will  recognize as being a joke
when i complained to the moderators of this  site about this abusive behavior and a general abusive behavior towards  americans i was banned from the forum and my isp contacted for the crime  of contacting these people through e mail
and now on to more pertinent  informationi found the game easy to learn and fun to play
the  graphics were good but not great
pretty soon i found myself relying on one  strategy
wall out the invaders
get to castle age as quick as i can and  build lots of town centers to expand and defend
once you beat the initial  big invasion the idiotic ai tends to just send invaders in little trickles  that never stop but arent that hard to deal withits fun to use  the various seige weapons but i didnt really bother mastering the armor  and tremendous variety of knights and swordsmen
they all looked about the  same to me with the exception of the english longbowmen
you could play  this game for a very long time but there are lots of very good games to  playthis is deep strategy but not as deep as railroad  tycoon  and  rogue spear
its also all tiny people and buildings
theres no zooming in  and out or rotating
the fans are kind of ummmmwell you read what i  said abovei only played twice on the internet and the first guy  left as soon as i knocked down his whole wall with a massive seige attack
the game then ended leaving me without the ability to even finish off what  hed built
my second game i used the wrong culture and after a prolonged  build up i quicklly got slaughtered by the elite teutonic knights
my woad  raiders didnt have the ability to build cannons i found out too late
so  there you have multiplay in a nutshell
if you are winning people leave  and call you a hack
if you are losing they love you and possibly think  you suckthere was no third more experienced multiplay for me as i got  wrapped up in the incident up top and lost interest in the gameif you like historybuy itifyou dont dont buy iti really dont like this game but it is good for stragedy and education of historybuilding a empirethats it to mebuy it if you wanti dont reccomend itthis game is pretty fun when you start out as it doesnt have any of the usual monsters that most online rpgs do also you can customise your character to the utmost extream eyes face smile type color and type of  clothes ect to play the game you have to pay  a month
the  graphics are very good especially the enviroments and actually  contradictly to other people i thought the graphics on the characters were  pretty good
anyways this game has a lotta strong points over other online  rpgs for one you can actually buy armor and weapons from shops at a  reasonable price
something that eq everquest failed to do as it was  impossible to buy the  plat bracers or whatever it was and you ended  up having to buy everything from players
what i didnt like about asherons  call was that there was no music
the monsters wore thin and became  dislikable
alsolike on  uo ultima online you have to have certain  spell components to cast spells i really hate that
all in all the whole  reason i quit asherons call was not because it wasnt fun but because i  didnt wanna pay  a month for that little bit of funhaving never played a mmorpg before asherons call i was floored by the immensity of the world and the depth of things to do
i subscribed to the game in early  and other than a few months away from time to time finally official unsubscribed at the release of acs nd expansion pack throne of destiny this past monthi spent  years of my life spent playing asherons call investing  hours a week
i have tried many rpgs since but nothing has hooked me like ac didunfortunately my experience with ac was dysfunctional at best
the first year was amazing
i met many friends and had a blast exploring
after  months i realized that my level  swordsman without any magic could barely hold his own against even the weakest of mobs so i rerolled
i created a spearman on a whim and went to the packed mossie fort to level
it was there that i met corrozus my soon to be good friend and patron
every night for a year we played togetherlaughed together struggled together and leveled together
everything that dereth had to offer was explored by our everincreasing alliancei was a level  plinking away at granite golems in the dires with my spearman the day that turbine introduced the first wave of mobs that became the first chain on a link that lead to the ultimate death of the game
they were acid wielding shield carrying skeletons and my character couldnt touch them
in fact the mobs were so difficult that i heard rumors that players were now rerolling en masse to create characters with life magicas anyone who has played ac knows life magic was broken from the start and it took a while for the player base to learn this but once we did the game became a mere shell
soon uber characters abounded and friends we once played with daily went off to level up their new uber toons
it seemed almost overnight everyone was level  killing olthoi and lugies in xp leveling dungeons while friendships and allegiance began to crumbleit was at this point that the original devs left and the new team not only continued to allow life magic to remain unbalanced but they built virtually all content around it
it was at this time that i began to dislike the game i once loved
i had few friends that werent uberfocused
allegiances became quest oriented as opposed to exploration oriented
and the devs catered to the elite players and ignored the average game playerhousing came and went and i quit and resubscribed several times
my playing time decreased severely to the point were i might log on once a week to seem no one from our allegiance onasherons call it could be said died a premature death because it listened to the  gamers who lived online
ac kept feeding the game xp and loot to keep them happy and soon even a newbie couldnt step a few clicks outside of town without running into a level  mobthe throne of destiny expansion pack is more of the same
the game is all but dead and simply exists to pull in funds to support turbines up and coming releases dd online and middle earth
i wont be trying either
just like a bad relationship my time with turbine is over and i want my  years backsquare is at this point trying to milk the final fantasy name as much as they possibly can by rereleasing their games although ffv makes its american debut in this bundlesince i personally never thought ffiii vi in japan was a good game im going to stay away from talking about it and receiving the huge amounts of flame that will inevitably followffv boasts the following  dated graphics uninvolved plot a dubious battle system a cool job system later featured in ff tactics to an extent some ridiculous situations and an anime series based on itmore than anything else however what gets to me is the ridiculous amount of load time for both games
these games have  bit graphics no polygons and lowend sprites so how can square possibly explain the ridiculous amount of load time at each interval of the game
its quite frustrating when you realize that playing the games on snes would cut the load times by even soffv is part of the final fantasy series and deserves a playing by the hardcore fans
newer gamers whove never even heard of snes will find the addition of ffvi a nice touchfinal fantasy  is arguably the greatest ff game and rpg ever made and ff is another one of the greatest rpgs i have ever played so how come this game didnt get  stars
well the load times would be a great place to start
just like in ff chronicles one of the games has great load times and the other is plagued horribly
ff has the worst load times i have ever experienced even worse than all other ps games which have better graphics and contain just as much if not more information  remember wild arms
that game was huge and it had better graphics than ff but its load times were very very short almost unnoticcable so what the heck
every time you enter a battle you are greeted with   seconds of looking at a black screen sound fun to you
i didnt think so
every time you enter the menu you are greeted with another  seconds of load time
sure its only  seconds but once you experience it you will feel how long five seconds can feel especially when you are used to fastpaced games the load times are much slower than the ps ffsbut on to the games themselvesfinal fantasy  music  fun  story  gameplay  overall this game is a masterpiece the greatest rpg ever released on any system
however given the poor load times the fun value of this game is whiped out
seriously its a chore to play it
if you have a snes system id dish out  bucks for it if you can find it on amazon or somewhere else
the snes version has blazing fast load times the graphics are better and the whole experience is so much better
i think it is a terrible idea to release a masterpiece with flaws that whipe out any fun while playing the game
basically when you buy this you might as well save your time and throw the ff disk away or sell it towards a snes ff cartridgefinal fantasy  music  story  gameplay  fun  overall  now this is why this game is worth the price
ff is without a doubt a masterpiece and the version on ff anthology is great
the load times are pretty fast the sound is great and it has the job system very much like ff tactics
the job system is a phenomenal idea and ff executes it perfectly
some hate this game but i think  is easily just as good as  it isnt as good as    or  or heck even tactics but you have to realize that ff games are so good that even excellent isnt good enough and this one is a masterpiece like most the others
ff is much more difficult than any other ff game even much harder than  and you will have to battle quite often for long periods of time and sometime this can be discouraging if you arent into battling for a while but other than that it is a good game
it starts off pretty slow but as you progress it gets much better so dont lose interest right away just wait it out and see if it gets better for you
when i first got ff anthology i didnt care a whole lot about  but when i got around to progressing through it i found it was a great gameoverall this version of ff might as well not even have been issued but it is definitely worth it for ff and  bucks is extremely cheap for these two games just dont expect ff to be as fast as the ff you remember playing as a kid for super nintendo
still i dont get it
why does ff in chronicles have blazing fast load times but ff is plaguedso anyway i highly recommend buying this game mainly for ffi bought this to play ffvi so i never played ff v this remake just suckedfor one thing the sound effects were screwed up as well as some slowdown
another gripe is no extras except a couple cutscenes and a monster encyclopedia
i guess i was expecting more cutscenes  and a lot of other extrasskip this and just get an emulator and play the original snes versionwhen playing this game i received a lot of lag between just opening the menu and entering combat
whereas with the traditional snes or with a computer the loading times for these are instant
the loading lag i received was at least  seconds almost per opening the menu and going into combat
overall i would not recommend getting this to try and quench your oldskool rpg munchies
try an emulator insteadit was with joy and alacrity that i got this double disc set
i loved ff and spent countless hours exploring every corner of it
playing through this version was just to see what was changed and i was dismayed to see that very little was different
it certainly seemed harder and while some of the bugs in the programming particularly the sketch glitches were improved and corrected i did not find anything to further impress me
in fact the cg scenes at the beginning and end felt tacked on  like they didnt belong
they also failed to make sense to me
the little things  the galleries and stuff  seemed totally unnecessary and uselessas for ff i almost immediately disliked this one
the score is often uninspired and at times downright irritating  take the music of kerwin town for instance the plot weak the characters totally without a personality except faris the dialogue corny the twists not that shocking
whats more it doesnt look one bit better than ff
the random battles are at times too many and too challenging
the side quests are without purpose as are many of the villains and the plot doesnt seem to hang together well
the opening cg scene has nothing to do with the game and the ending one is a disappointment and more than a disappointment
taken altogether i was very much disappointed with the set
i feel like i paid for tickets to a great opera and all i got was tennessee ernie fordif youve never played either one you will likely have a good time playing these two
taken individually they are good games
i love ff  always have  but ff ticked me off
if youre not expecting anything spectacular you wont be disappointed
guess i was expecting itmedal of honor is one of the best first person shooter games available in that it is creative and original
history buffs will enjoy the realistic feel of the game as you explore the various mission zones
weapons are ample and realistic
controls are simple and easy to learn
missions are clearly explained and while challenging are not frustrating
there is a great deal of variety in each mission too
youll need to use a combination of firepower and stealth to successfully complete your goalthe only reason this game did not get higher marks is the unforgivable problem with the graphics
there is alot of camera issues and breakup which is a huge problem for games of this genre
also there is a problem with polygon drop out to the point where all of a sudden you can see through a wall or obstacle which can really throw you off
additionally the replay value of this game is extremely low as there is nothing new to aspire to
if you are really into historic games or first person shooters then give this game a try
although if you want more game for your money try medal gear solidas a mother of  and  year olds and an adventure game lover myself i only give this  stars because the game is less complex than putt putt saves the circus or putt putt enters the race
my  year old finished it in lt hours with a little assist
this is just right for my  year old who doesnt mind playing it over and over
the animal narratives are beyond them thoughmm  was a blast to play back in the day but the evolution of the pc rpg has made it almost unplayable today
mm focuses mostly on doing battles in a firstperson partybased setup
it uses classical fantasy elements and a few scifi ones to make a fun gameyou get to put points in skills and learn spells for your characters
youll use those skills and spells to buy gear kill baddies and venture through dungeons for more gear or to save a lost personits alright but theres tons better these daysif you want to get the game and have a blast from the past go ahead and buy iti played this as a youngster in the s and recently plugged this cartridge in a super gameboy for super nintendo consoleits better than its predecessor in terms of graphics but its still very dated
its fun but a child would not play this nowadays with all the better technologyfor super mario collectors this is a mustnostalgic fanboys might disagree but in my opinion super mario land is hardly a classic and hardly worth mentioning in the same breath as the first  nes super mario bros gamesthe graphics while terrible arent worth complaining about since i grew up in the nes days of the searly s and remember very fondly how terrible many graphics were
no i cant defend them
nobody can
its all about whether you grew up back then
if you did you can better understand and appreciate the way the game looksmy biggest grip is that the play control is pretty lousy
mario seems to float whenever you jump and the same can be said for many of the items such as the mushrooms that floats once removed from a coin box and the star as well
oh and the starman music is simply atrocious
ignore that completelythe challenge definitely depends on how well you can control marios movements because if these controls were topnotch like super mario bros guess what
super mario land would be incredibly easy
this is because a good portion of the game is basically the first mario game blended with elements of super mario bros   the only exception is the underwater fireballspitting machine stage which is a nice shooting adventure type experiment and the airplane stage which is basically the same thing but in the airthe enemy animations are laughable
the goombas look just like the mushrooms for crying out loud
they also resemble ugly skulls and the koopa troopas are really skinny and malnourished
the dry fish that pop out of the ground and go directly up are mediocre looking
some of the other enemies that are brand new are actually reasonable
oh and an enemy that goes by the name of bunbun lol
is really nice
i believe this enemy influenced the super mario bros  flying goombas but i could be wrong
actually im not sure im thinking of the right enemy after all
oh well at least i got to say the hilarious word bunbun
i just really hate how the first half of the game feels like a watered down super mario bros with the pipes and coins feeling like theyre lifted directly from smb
not directly of course but close enough that the developers should have put in more effort to make the coins and pipes stand apart from any connection to smbi hate the music
all of it
just really screechy and irritating bloops and bleeps that hardly resemble a melody except for the castle theme which is some kind of cliched egyptian music
theres also a fairly melodic asian theme later on that again is repetitive and cliched and the game ending music is really spectacular as well
thats it
at least on the nes an effort was actually made to make all the themes memorable and bearableon the plus side i like how mario shoots fireballs
the way they bounce and hit enemies on an angle is a nice surprise that takes a small amount of skill to master and the size of them is quite impressive as well
fighting a variety of bosses instead of bowser is definitely a plus in my book
oh and the challenge is actually pretty high in a few spots such as the bouncing boulders that you have to ride over spikes
this is pretty hardoh and daisy
shes a lot better than princess toadstool
by now youre probably well aware that the princess allows bowser to kidnap her because shes an attention seeker
daisy is not only more attractive but more sensible and respectable so you really want to put in the additional effort to rescue her
in a perfect world daisy would have been the one to face an enormous amount of success and princess toadstool would have been forgotten
you see princess toadstool is too much of a fake generic woman whos supposed to be attractive like vanna white
daisy is a real woman that you want to cuddle and comfort
theres a big difference between the twoinstead of reaching a flag at the end of each stage youre given a choice between two doors
the top door takes you to a bonus area where you can get powerups and ups
always go for the top door if you can
this is mainly how you acquire upsnah its not quite a classic but its a commendable effortmarios first portable adventure though fun while it lasts which isnt long is the weakest entry in the super mario franchise
the tone of the game while clearly modeled after the original super mario bros for the nes has a much different feel to it than any other mario time mario game
that is because shigeru miyamoto did not produce the game instead his mentor gunpei yokoi produced and directed the titleyokoi who was killed in a car accident in  in japan was miyamotos mentor
it was because of yokoi that miyamotos game donkey kong came before the leaders of nintendo at the time
yokoi came up with the game  watch series kid icarus and metroid for the nes and the gameboy
a metroid enemy even makes a cameo appearance in super mario landthe game features elements not seen before or since in the mario series including egyptian themed bosses although the egypt theme is common in mario the bosses from sml are never heard of again just like smb space aliens an apparent unending fascination with easter island and its moi heads and even two shooting levels
although miyamato revealed in an iwata asks interview that the original super mario bros was going to have shooting levels and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea along with mario having a gun this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of super mario landi grew up with mario like most other gamers
with only two exceptions i have played every mario title at launch or shortly thereafter from the original  super mario bros all the way down to new super mario bros  yes im old
obviously being american we didnt get lost levels until super mario allstars but i got the snes version when it was released back in  and have played through lost levels so many times over the years ive more than made up for not getting it back in anyway the two i missed
super mario land for the gameboy which i did play very briefly back when it first came out but i never had it we went with super mario land  instead when i did get a gameboy and super mario sunshine
the very few times that i did play the game on the original gameboy back in  or the very early s i do remember getting as far as the first boss which means i was a fourth of the way donebeing the mario fan that i am i did play through super mario land on emulator a couple of years back beating  the game over two decades after it was first released
before i really played the game i remember getting as far as the first boss which means i was a fourth of the way done
since then i purchased the title on the ds virtual console love those restore points
so my thoughts on the game
well of all the mario games this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper super mario games i am not including spinoffs and subseries
super mario land was a launch title for the gameboy and boy does it show
the majority of the sprites are small including mario himself
being monochrome it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is
the game is short  only twelve levels
each level has about a  second time limit so to do a full run through of the game even dragging your feet will not net you much gameplay in terms of timedue to miyamotos lack of involvement the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other mario titles
there are octupuses jumping flowers that shoot fire reminds of me of panser from super mario bros  gaos they resemble egyptian sphinxes robots 
 totais running easter island moai  heads pionpis jumping men who shoot at mari in the last world and yurarin boos who are firebreathing seahorses
the last two are the most interesting as they are heavily reminesnt of metroid
the pionpis reminds me of samus arans female sprite when the justin bailey code is entered and the yurarin boos are identical to the seahorses in terms of game play and species type though the sprites differ somewhat in metroid as wellthe game is set in sarasaland comprised of four kingdoms birabuto muda easton and chai
suddenly an evil space alien named tatanga appears kidnaps princess daisy who debuts in this game and it is up to mario to rescue the princess but its not princess peach at leastprobably my biggest complaint about the game besides the short length is the looseness in the controls
i dont know if this holds true for the original gameboy i suspect it does but playing on the ds i found mario often times going slightly further than i wanted or not far enough
ive never hard this problem with the other mario games
there is also some weird hit detection issues going on
i was playing  jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant and mario did not lose his power up
ive seen this happen multiple timesthe loose play control further exacerbates another issue no saving
if you run out of lives unless youre on  the very last world you have to start all over which can be frustrating
if you die on the last level you do get two continues
often times due to the loose play control i would slightly overshoot where i was jumping and mario would plummet to his death
now to be fair to expect such a short game all the way back in  to having saving is ridiculous but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over
nintendo could have at least provided continues a more realistic option for a game of this age
the game is clearly modelled on the original super mario bros although with some noticable differences
first the music itself is unlike anything else in the series and is one of the strongest assests the game offers
just like the first game you cant go back to the left the screen only scrolls right
marios sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the nes titlethe power ups are pretty weak
there are exactly three the super mushroom the super ball and an invincibility star
the super mushroom will make mario big
the super ball this games idiotic version of the fire flower allows mario to shoot projectiles
however the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the super ball the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface
so on levels that are pretty open you shoot the super ball it hits the ground right in front of mario and then shoots straight up into the sky never to be seen again rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you creating a bigger margin for error
if you are in a more enclosed space the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out
unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time so if you have one bouncing around and its not connecting with an enemy you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappearslike the other mario titles super mario land would prove to be a massive hit selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run
whats depressing to me is that super mario land actually outsold the far superior super mario bros 
note that does not count the rereleases and virtual console sales only the intial nes release vs the gameboy releasefor a game of its time the title is pretty fun
but of all the games in the core super mario series this is easily the least substantial title due to its brevity the loose play controls and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series
the games sequel super mario land  six golden coins is infinitely better with bigger sprites more engaging gameplay and a much longer gametime
the music though from sml is admittedly fantastic and is probably its strongest pointmarios first portable adventure though fun while it lasts which isnt long is the weakest entry in the super mario franchise

the games sequel super mario land  six golden coins is infinitely better with bigger sprites more engaging gameplay and a much longer gametime
the music though from sml is admittedly fantastic and is probably its strongest pointwhile there arent really any bad mario games they all very fun there are definitely some top tier mario games
mario is like the beatles  pretty much everything from the core series is top of the line and tremendously polished sells massive amounts of product and is loved the world over
even a substandard mario game is better than so many other games out there
that being said though pretty much any other mario game is better than this one
unless you have a nostalgic attachment to this game or you just want to play marios first portable adventure theres not a lot of reason to go back to this unless youve played the other mario games first
this one should be down pretty far on your listsuper mario land is unlike any other brand of mario that ive ever played
jumping right in to the first level nothing is characteristic of a typical mario alien spacecrafts exploding koopas and airplanes abound
when the game came out in  it was a testament of technology on the small screen
those sentiments dont hold up as much today
poor controls and awkward level design plague the game
the game is moderately difficult but not anything an experienced player should have any problem overcoming
the game can be beat in an hour or less and makes the perfect time waster if you want to play a game but your schedule doesnt allow you to do so for a prolonged period of time
because of the lack of playing time there is no save feature
the game does have some replayability as once you beat it the next playthrough will include different enemy placement and a little more of a challenge unless of course you shut it off or your batteries run outdoh
the background music while simple is one of the more memorable factors of the game
i recommend picking it up especially for the price on this site
however dont expect a timeless classic like other reviewers have praised it to bethis game had all of the action and side scrolling adventure as the first tmnt game for gameboy plus much better graphics detailed backgrounds and far better music
however the game was so needlessly repetitive and long that it got very boring
there are only five levels to this very long levels where you fight off against hundreds of foot soldiers annoying mousers that chomp through walls and pizza monsters that are tougher than any of the leaders
i do enjoy the fact that this game had krang with his body
no amount of graphics challenge or gameplay could keep this long of a game goingyears before michael bays wouldbe catastrophe came along turtles ruled the world
they ran all the industries that mattered comics tv movies and games like this onebased on the s cartoon show the objective of this game boy title is simple rescue april oneil from the foot clan using one of the four turtles
with  basic attacks at your disposal you fight your way through  level filled with ninjas robots and floating boxes of pizza to replenish your health
though enough grunts are thrown in to increase the challenge you can beat the end bosses wearing your ninja mask backwards
on the offchance you do use up our heroes the game endsbesides changing the limited control scheme to ones own taste the player also has the option to choose whichever stage he wants
so you can either play through the whole thing and get the full cowabunga experience or skip all the way to the end for nearinstant gratification
kinda defeats the purpose doesnt itlike any yearold i was obsessed with owning a copy while i could still go out and buy one
now that ive tried it after seeing the best that stcentury gaming has to offer moms cooking doesnt taste as good anymorethis game is unratedthis is a greatly watered down version of the arcade classic mortal kombat  there are fewer characters and only two levels in the entire game
the main feature to note is that is it far superior to the original gameboy version of the first mortal kombat
while that game was very slow and changed the button combos for each characters special moves this game keeps the speed at a high rate and uses more familiar button combos
id write this game of as only having the novelty of mortal kombat on the go
if you have an intense curiosity of every version of mk or if you want to complete your game boy collection then get this game
for the rest of you out there its probably not terribly worth itits such an obvious idea im surprised no one has thought of it before a game that plays like a comic book where you are in the panels and each page is a level
it has neat little features like how enemies are drawn into the page and you can choose different paths but where the game falls short is in the gameplay
all it consists of is punchpunchkick again and again it gets old and doesnt allow for strategy or skill
it also doesnt help that the story and music are weak not to mention that this game is atrociously difficultwhen you look at the painstakingly long list of comic licensed games that were released for the bit systems of years ago most were basically just walk from left to right while beating up countless generic villians in a game which lacks any kind of spirit or feel of the comic it is based from and is pretty much streets of rage with a comic license attached to it notably most of which were published by acclaim or one of their other publishing divisions
maximum carnage is based on the midnineties massive event that took place in the spiderman comics in which spidey had to team up with venom to take on carnage in a ravaged new york
in the game you can play as spidey or venom and you pretty much do all as i described above and thats about it
almost none of these games had any kind of save feature and maximum carnage is one of these games and it is a painstakingly long game to finish and does offer some high difficulty
maximum carnages few saving graces are the games music provided by green jelly although it sounds a bit generic at times considering the genesis didnt have the best soundchip imaginable and the fluid and colorful graphics
there are a few guest appearances from other heroes firestar captain america and youve got some tough villians in carnage shreik doppleganger and demogoblin but other than that maximum carnage is only a bit better than the heap of comic licensed bit beat em upsive looked at quite a few retro xmen games and aside from the arcade game this has been the only decent one ive found
this game lets you take control six of your favorite xmen
you got your classics like cyclops and wolverine but you also have the lessknown but very well done mutants like gambit beast nightcrawler or psylocke
magneto also becomes an unlockable character after you beat a certain stage in the game
the level design for this game is superb
there are lots of different environments that use very vibrant colors although some are better than others
plus you can team up with a friend and wipe out your enemies as a team
playing coop with a friend has always been one of the most nastalgic elements of my childhood so i always get excited when i can find games when i can team up with a friend
however this game is far from perfect
its main fatal flaw is that it is incredibly easy to walk right into the enemies because youre always on the rightend of the screen whenever youre moving forward
the only way i can play this game is when i just inch along from level to level really really slowly
this gets boring rather quickly
not to mention you only get a few continues before its game over and there is no way to save your progress
this is still a lot better than the other xmen games of its time but is still in some need of a few finishing touchesim gonna make this review short and simply say check out umk its really like an improved version of this gamethis game has good graphics good music and decent character selection
you can play as the  boss characters with some kinda cheat during the options menu thats a plus
but the game is just to weak by comparison
it lacks a lot of little things ultimate mortal kombat  has to offer
the gameplay isnt bad but with some better control options that could have really been improvedits not a horrible game but there are better ones like umk and also other games out there that would make more sense of your timethe main things to remember about mortal kombat iii for genesis are that its on genesis and not snes so the controls are terrible
you will have to mash multiple buttons together to get one response etc
i dont know if a snazzy button controller fixes this issue but i dont have one of those this is not ultimate mortal kombat iii which is waaayyyy better
you will find yourself wishing that it was mainly because of the much larger character rosterother than that its a pretty decent game that can offer a few minutes of fun here and there maybe more if you are with friends but i found that most of my friends can only get down on a game like this for a few minutes because the controls are so horridthe genesis version of mortal kombat  is not that badthe graphics are pretty goodas is the soundthe only bad thing about this game thoughis its very very hard to play with a three button controllerif you buy this gamei highly recommend that you buy a six button controller along with itif you dont already have onebecause its hell to play it with a three buttonoverallthis is a fun gamenot the best of the seriesbut still pretty goodfirst of all i do have to say that i did somewhat enjoy playing through shadowrun but in retrospect it wasnt very good
the experience was slightly better because the shadowrun was a classic segachannel game
i recently acquired and played through it out of nostalgiathe main problem is that shadowrun is incredibly repetitive and at times even downright boring
you spend almost the entire game delivering packages to get that next gun or point of computer skills
getting to cyberspace was a temporary thrill although soon enough that degraded into pressing one button over and over until the ice was defeated
in cyberspace you are either way too bad or way too good
either way there is no challengethe realtime combat and karma system were probably the best part of the game but were used way too sparingly
you do almost no fighting beyond random gang members who you can totally trash up soon into the gamethe plot and storyline were nice but extremely thin and bareboned
there is some good story at first but then it drains down into only doing pointless runs for about  hours interspersed with interesting little tidbits by the way the cutscenes were cool  until the very end where within half an hour youve gone from doing generic runs to having beaten the game
the end fight itself was anticlimacticall in all this was a fun game for a while and a good novelty item for rpg fans and genesis owners but after finishing it i was a little let downits fun to destroy stuff in this game
blowing up whole towns just doesnt get old
i dont know how successful this game was but it seems it was underrated
i rented it once and enjoyed it a lot
the only problem i had with it was it got pretty difficult after finishing some of the easier levels and i dont think there were all that many easy levelsi was really looking forward to trying this game so i was pretty disappointed when i played it
the controls on this game are terrible as is the camera angle
theres a very brief tutorial at the beginning of the game but i didnt find it very helpful
youre given a briefing on what youre supposed to do and what your goals are but i didnt find that helpful either
this is one game that i would not recommend to anyonesometimes youll hear people say that a game is good because it takes like  hours to beat or something
what those people left out is that the game theyre playing is fun which makes them want to play it for  hours
donkey kong  has its moments but i dont think its fun enough to really finish  or at all
i played and loved all three donkey kong country games back in the day and i was pretty surprised that there was an n donkey kong title of which id never heard
but this isnt a donkey kong platformer its a minigame marathon
its like mario party except not half as funlets start with the monkeys which are arguably the titles greatest fault
you never or at least i never really felt like youre in control of an agile primate
these kongs move far too slowly
you run in much the same manner that n link does rolling
but link moves way faster than these monkeys and and you might find yourself screaming oh would you just get to the warp point already
furthermore the jumping ability of kongs in d space seems to be less than polished
they wont get you killed as this game is ridiculously easy in terms of staying alive
however they will annoy you as big kremlins knock you off ledges because your monkeys cant move like monkeys
now imagine bad controls coupled knocking you off ledges with being forced to barrel roll back at  oot links rolling speedall too often rares solution to hiding  golden bananas throughout the game seems to be toss in a minigame
some of them are fun but these minigames bring the term wii play to mind and thats a phrase im sure cranky kong wouldnt want to be associated withthey want you to play with each character once in every level
this wouldnt be a bad idea if the platforming controls were better and there were a decent number of enemies to fight outside of those two or three bonus levels
but if you want to get everything you need to barrel roll through each level five times killing the one or two enemies that oppose you and exploring for the spots where rare wants to launch a minigame
two of the minigames were the original bit donkey kong and jetpac
theyre easily the best parts of this gamei got bored with it going through the water level with  or so bananas
its too long and its not really that fun but there is a lot of sort of ok content along the way
so three stars i guessi have poured hours and hours into this game as a kid but there is one fatal flaw that affects its overall greatness and that is the requirement of beating the nearimpossible  donkey kong arcade game two times with only one life each time
i played the original  arcade game at an arcade place recently and that is lenient compared to the hairtearing experience that the one in donkey kong  will offer you and the player is required to not only receive a nintendo coin from beating the arcade game twice but the game also requires the player to play and beat jetpac which is actually more lenient than the original donkey kong but it still can be a mess to beat
on a positive note the levels are very detailed and beautifully designed thanks to the expansion pak but the fact that the player is required to beat the original donkey kong twice with only one life per attempt killed the fun as i would put away the game because of that one impossible mini game to cool down i even had to buy a gameshark to beat the game the first time around it was near impossible
i can now beat it without the use of a gameshark but i still find it completely unnecessary to hold such a hefty requirement just to beat the game normally and if it gave the player a different ending i would understand but the game forces the player to beat those mini games and while it could add to the challenge factor it is still completely unnecessary to just merely complete the game normally
i would still recommend the game as it has some redeeming values such as advanced sound effects and detailed enemy and level designs but the player must have extreme patience and be fully willing to take a couple of brutal beatings from the original donkey kong and jetpac in order to beat the gameit arrived in great shape
we have played it already and the only problem has been putting it in the machine it doesnt want to start right awaygreat graphics not enough action
the whole game is basically collecting golden bananas to unlock worlds to collect more bananas
it is a good game however and is a steal at the price amazon is selling it for
it is identical to banjokazooietooie so if you played those games and hated them or are tired of them dont buy dk  personally  i found dk country more fun on snes but that is just melabel is faded and peeling like it was left in the sun
the cartridge doesnt always start up
it also didnt come with the n ram extension but luckily i already had one
barring these drawbacks the game is fineif this game was more like the donkey kong country series released on the snes then it would be a masterpiece
its true that it has several of the dkc basics including several monsters massive bosses the kong familydonkey diddy candy funky cranky and wrinkly as well as newly introduced members chunky kiddys brother tiny dixies sister and lanky dks second cousin
however the game is really more like banjokazooie which is unquestionably nintendo and rares trademark n series
rather than having various levels in multiple worlds to trek through in a platform adventure we get eight massive worlds for heavy exploration
it really just isnt quite the same
as true as it is that it is fun as hell to play it doesnt get as high an overall rating because it strays so far from the classics
however other than that it is highly enjoyablethe playstation version is not much better
this game just has terrible aiming and controls when it comes to turning on a dimethis game wasnt that bad at all
its more like a new rendition of the pld capcom side scroller game final fight
it plays similar to that
it uses the full scale d view and it has a lot more pick up items and the action is very good and its a great team gamethe only reason im not really crazy about this game is because it is really long
a friend and i played this game for entire weekend once and we still werent done with the game
its not as long as rampage universal tour but i assure you it was starting to feel like it after a while
at least the really cool weapons and other cool items that you could use during the game made up for itid have to say rent this one first just to be sure youre going to be feeling it later because like i said the game is kinda long
i still think its fun but for gamers that are just looking for a quick fighting buzz this might not be for youtheres this dude who must go through over  levelshe is basicly in a room with hundreds and hundreds of enemieswhen he kills them allhe moves oni got to level  once before my controler pak nuked my gameeven by level  having a cheat that will allow unlimited tries isnt a bad ideathere will be like  new enemies regenerating every secondits pretty roughthis game is very dark
turn up the brigness on your tv before you play it
never play if youre easily depressed ranges from very easy to very impossible
i dont even know if its worth buying unless youre a collector
you could probably find it for very little because its a players choice awarded gamewhen yoshis story was first released a lot of people immediately dismissed it as either an inferior version of yoshis island or simply a colossal disappointment
nowadays it seems people generally think the graphics are too cutesy and they are but yoshis island was guilty of the same thing as much as i love the game
however much to my surprise the actual platforming elements in yoshis story are better than i was expecting and the fact the game sticks to d side scroller instead of going d like super mario  was a decision i agree with
for a while i actually thought yoshis story was a d gamehowever graphics aside the game isnt always impressive
a few of the levels are mazelike and theyre pretty bland compared to the more straight forward levels
its because the platforms themselves are nothing particularly impressive just your average platforms youve probably experienced since the nes days
jump on top of them ride them jump to next one etc
not that im criticizing platforms i hope you understand or contradicting what i say in the opening paragraph the idea just feels a little generic or perhaps undeveloped here
furthermore these maze levels are lackluster compared to the more challenging ones from yoshis island
feels too much like some of the maze stages here and trying to copy the special level from world  in yoshis island with the water dripping inside what looks like a sewerperhaps the biggest problem is that instead of collecting  red coins  flowers and  stars which made yoshis island gameplay so addicting and fun now youre collecting fruit
grapes watermelon bananas etc
this is not only a rather childish objective but not nearly as entertaining either
also another big problem perhaps an even bigger one theres no flower ring at the end of each stage like in yoshis island
you can actually exit stages the moment you find enough fruit
really bad idea because it means going through levels in search of fruit and nothing else and when you find the amount you need for completion the level could possibly end right then
the sunburntlooking flower in the top left corner of the screen jerking his face left to right the entire game is pretty funny thoughthe boss fights are an absolute joke
similar to the one from mario is missing
alright the ones here arent quite that disappointing if youve ever played mario is missing though at least the nes version youd know what im referring to
but they are soooooo much easier than the yoshis island boss fights
significantly less strategic as welloh and yeah we cant end a review without mentioning this issue as well theres only  levels
how many levels were there in yoshis island
 plus  bonus levels plus  more if you factor in the gameboy advance version
 is too little
come on the nintendo  cartridges can handle more than that
i remember how disappointing my classmates were in  when this game came out and they played it
they expected more levels
i cant blame themanyway onto the positives
many of the yoshis islands enemies make a return and despite the levels being considerably less detailed as far as itemcollecting and variety is concerned most of the stages are at least loaded with plenty of enemies
even when the levels feel pretty basic and uninteresting in design you can look forward to remembering the good ol yoshis island days with the same enemies and now presented slightly bigger in size
plenty of new enemies too such as grim reaper shy guys extended ghosts of many varieties that serve as odd short term platforms and spiketossing lakitusperhaps one could complain that the returning enemies should be different in some way instead of simply copy and pasting them from yoshis island and i would agree dont get me wrong but its not a big problem
i like the giganticsized mario eating fish thats not quite the same one from super mario bros  but the idea is exactly the same he jumps out of the water and tries to eat mario
yes its hard just like it was in smb but tons of fun
hes like a huge red or orange cheep cheep and yeah he doesnt like mario too much hahathe music is actually much better than yoshis island too
yoshis island had one particularly annoying theme that some of the sky stages would present that i like to call broadway theater music ugh so inappropriate for a mario title but the ones in yoshis story are softer and more like lullabies or tropicalthemed but still totally tolerable
theres even a christmassounding theme used in the final levelsthis game is just not that bad
sure the platforming often times could have benefited by being less generic and obviously we expect more from nintendo in that regard and the maze levels are a needless and shameful way of making stages longer but these problems aside if you can find this game for cheap and most likely thats impossible unless you can download it to your wii or wii u then its worth a few dollars and a few hours of entertainment
overall its an easy game even the later levels and the appearance of the backgrounds may be rather babylike but remember yoshis island has similar graphics and everyone considers that game a classic including me it is a classic
check out yoshis storyi was so excited to play this game after i rented it from blockbuster video years ago
i played to death the awesome snes title yoshis island super mario world  and thought yoshis story would be like that game
as a matter of fact many gamers thought so as well but once we all played through it we realized that while it was good it is nothing like the snes classic
and along with a few other issues yoshis story is great for the kids to play but for everyone expecting a sequel to yoshis island it turned out to be badyoshis story was released in  and was considered to be the spiritual successor to yoshis island
baby bowser wrecks havoc in yoshis island so you must defeat him to make everything alright
you control  different colored versions of yoshi the lovable dinosaur where for each stage you must search out different kinds of fruit
find them all and you complete the stage and move on through the  stages that are available
the game ends when you die using all  colored yoshis and you must restart the stage again
after you are done with the story mode theres a trial mode see how much of a high score you can get and a practice mode its basically one level where you practice all of yoshis moves
the pros this game looked real good
the graphics are smooth sharp and bright
the music is very cheery and fits the overall mood in yoshis story while the sound effects are exactly what you expect to hear in this light hearted title
the controls are responsive so getting used to how yoshi moves will be very easy
its perfect for parents who have kids that are starting to discover and play video gamesthe cons those who are looking for the deep action platforming action and challenging game play that yoshis island brought to the snes will be deeply deeply saddened by what they find here
this game is brutally easy and just as you start to get into it its over
yoshis story has  stages compared to the  stages plus  bonus stages featured in the snes classic
the only thing you do in yoshis island is eat fruit
there is no rescuing baby mario no magical vehicle transformations no red coins to collect or any incentive to achieve the  complete rating at the end of each stage other than to move to the next stage
dont bother trying to unlock extra stages modes etc
because there is nothing there to begin withit took me  day to beat this game and after two more days it was time for me to return it
i was disappointed that it was such a short and easy game
if youre a fan of yoshis island dont buy this thinking its the sequel
get it cheap only because you have kids and want to keep them entertainedthis game is lacking a lot of things but it is still a good side scroller
its definitely reminiscent of yoshis island on snes
the story leaves much to be desired as do the characters but the overall action is fun
i reccomend it for younger audiences but definitely not for the  and up crowda great n game in its own right although its a little too easy its still a fun game especially for kids
the game features a story mode which gives you the option of which levels to play and depending on how well you do you can unlock more levels in the next chapter unlike traditional games where the level ends when you reach the goal the level only ends after youve eaten a certain amount of fruit
the game allows you to play as six colored yoshis as well as two special colored yoshis
unfortunately as good as it is it still got a few faults for instance the story mode is way too short with only six chapters and two boss battles though some of levels are super easy some of the latter levels are annoyingly difficult and the music can be incredibly annoying
while its nowhere as good as yoshis island yoshis story is still a pretty good n gamethis game wasnt the best game ive ever played
it was a change though since mario wasnt the star of this game marios story
oo  okay ill shut up
since yoshi was the main character i thought it would be adorable when i saw it   when i brought it home to play i sat there for hours playing it
i thought the little yoshi characters were just plain adorable
then my brother played it
he was around  or  at the time
he absolutely loved it
i wasnt too impressed by it
but i guess this is a great game for the younger generations
if you have a younger brothersistersondaughteretc get this game for them
theyll have a blasti played this so much when i was younger im only  now but i saw it on here and had to buy it
i basically went through the levels so fast and kind of got bored the game wasnt as interesting as i used to think it was
one thing is that i try going through it so fast that i end up falling in one place and get so frusterated i give up but over all great game for kids or people who are easily entertained
i still play on occasionsilicon graphics and the usual play control equal an easy to learn d fighting game
the thing that makes this game really unique are the killer combinations of moves and the fact that there are tons of special moves for each character but then when you start doing a combination of moves there are even more special moves
the fighting arenas are visually astounding especially spinals ship
there is even cool fighting music to keep up with the pace of the fight
speaking of the pace there are s of options including the speed of the fight disabling certain moves damage and anything you can imagine
another great part about this game is that there is an actual scale of challenge which makes it anywhere from easy for a beginner  to difficult for a master gamer
the only disappointing thing is that the original fighters are better than the four new onesmace is a weapon based fighting game
it seems pretty uninspired for the most part
i think it was trying to be something different than other fighters out on the market at the time however it was not any better than the others
as for weapons based combat soul caliber it is not
you just hack and slash slowly and ungracefully until one of you wins
i wouldnt recomend this game unless you really love fighting gamessame as the other one but with a few glaring differences like the graphics stink like a butt on this onetheres a lot of characters in this onetheres robotscopsmartial artistsgodsreally theres only  typesthe kind that get beat down by the computer almost every time and the kind you can win with all the time prettily easily through massive repitionthey are lou kangraiden and the coptheres some male ballerina looking dude with a lot of flaming ballserrr i mean fire ballshes pretty good except for the whole spandex thingits alright but  is way way betterim actualy suprised theyre even from the same system considering  looks like a sega master system gamefor all you bozos out there the sega master system came out after the intellivision and before the original nintendooh yeahi dont appreciate the guys who made this making shiva a chick when in fact shiva is a very powerful hindu god with enough destructive capacity in his rd eye to destroy existenceits a great game and i remembered playing it all the time when i was little with my brothers
my older brother got an n a year ago and he has been unable to find games for it
i ordered this and a few others from here but this one never came
the others arrived on time but sadly not this one
i dont like to make a big fuss over this kind of stuff so ill just order it again when i canas the playstation heated up the console wars sega and nintendo werent the only competitors this time around
so n owners were delighted to hear that mk trilogy would be released and in  it came out and was a moderate success
but with delight came confusion and disappointment as nintendos version wasnt identical to the playstation version in more ways that one
mk trilogy turned out to be a decent and dated mk fighting game even by standards back thenmk trilogy is a fighting game combining all the stages characters game play mechanics and fatalities gory special moves from all of the past mk games into one glorious version with extra modes and options to give fans of mortal kombat the complete experience
choose from one of  characters plus  secret characters that you have to unlock and you can either play one on one kombat  player vs kombat tournament mode or  player three on three kombat
the main goal is to beat every fighter you come across and make it to shao khan the games main villain
each character has its own background story ending moves and fatalities so the game will keep you busy as far as using different characters by yourself or taking on another player
there are numerous codes to enter with varying results so find a guide online and try them out yourselfthe pros everything about mortal kombat is all in one game the stages characters moves options music game play codes and secret characters make an appearance
mk fans will dive in head first and feel right at home
and the  player modes let you challenge another player for added replayability
plus no load times means every match starts immediatelythe cons while the playstation version had loading issues it turned out to be the better version overall
thanks to cartridge limitations the n version doesnt feature the extra characters found in the playstation version and takes a big hit in the graphics and music department
animation frames are missing which means the graphics are not as smooth as it should be
the music doesnt sound as good as it should be since its been compressed to save space
the controls are spot on but some will find the n controller a little cumbersome at first so it will take some getting used to before you forget about the initial inconveniencewhats disappointing is that had this come out a year later mk trilogy could have turned out better since other developers opted to ship their games in cartridges with more space and it would have helped out
because of key sacrifices this game will only be cherished by the fans and somewhat acknowledged by everyone else
this game would later reinforce the notion that cds were the better medium to make games on while cartridges had less space to work with and were more expensive to manufacture
you can pick this up cheap and i would recommend this game to the fans and those who never played the playstation versionmortal kombat trilogy is a pretty good game for n
but compared to the playstation version its just a small combination of the past three mk games and nothing more
the graphics are okay the animation is fair but the sounds  music are  poor
it would be better to put the volume on mute while playing it
plus the ns control doesnt quite do well with this sort of game
there are three really cool cheat menus on this game though
however for whatever reason there is no onebuttonfatalities cheat
you have to press a certain combination of buttons on your controller in order to do all the finishing moves
that really
plus every stage uses music from mk
that gets really annoying after a whilemy advice to mk fans buy this game for the playstation
youll get your moneys worth
on the playstation version of mkt you get all the characters from all of the mk games including their own set of moves and fatalities
plus there are more cheats secrets and even the popular onebuttonfatalities cheat is on here
all of the stages are here and the graphics sounds music animation and controls are excellent
buy this on your playstation and avoid the n versionokay so im six years too late in reviewing this game but what the hey i just recently picked it up really cheap just to see what it was like since im a huge mortal kombat fan
bottom line
its better than i expected but not by muchive bought around  nintendo  games and not once have i complained about the cartridge format until now
it served me well through goldeneye perfect dark banjokazooie battle for naboo and even through resident evil  yes the video sequences in that game were highly compressed but seeing as how squeezing them all in was a miracle by itself i have no complaints
its too bad williams didnt try any similiar compression techniques for mkt
the game feels woefully incomplete especially when compared to the psx version
a couple of characters were sacrificed including goro kintaro the unmasked subzero and classic costume changes for kano raiden jax and a few others
a lot of the classic backgrounds are also missing noticibly from the original game and mortal kombat  and then theres the sound or what tries to pass itself off as sound
while the n was capable of dolby  surround by the end of its life span here it can barely crank out decent mono
other reviews have said the sound seems canned muffled and my personal favourite like your speakers are set up behind a cement wall
its all true every bit of it
if williams had given the game better sound i might have been tempted to ease off on it a littlethe gameplay has been carried over from mk with a new aggressor meter at the bottom
thankfully for the characters that have made it all their finishing moves are intact and are still cool to watch
there are also various on on and tournament modes to mess around with
the game does get stale after awhile but it happens to all fighting games
mkt is good for a few rounds of mayhem whenever youre boredi dont regret purchasing mkt but i wish williams had taken more time and effort to polish the game such as reshooting the actors brawka in particular feels cut and pasted directly from mkii and finding a way to cram everything in
mk fans without a psx should definitely get this
its not completely satisfying but it gets the job donethis is a game for little children
i would play it for about forty minutes of my lifetime
one thumb upi must say for multiplayer this is another step in the right direction
the fact that you can completely customize the multiplayer options unlike the preset options in goldeneye is a very nice feature adding a lot of replay value which is my favorite thing
you can add up to  human players and  bots computercontrolled opponents to a multiplayer game for a whopping  people on the   i really liked the shooting range idea and although it took me a lot of tries i got gold medals on all of them
but there is always something bad now isnt there
one of the above mentioned disappointments is singleplayer mode
thank god for the bots because singleplayer mode is horrible
the plot is uninteresting the levels are quite long and monotonous and the mission objectives dont have that goldeneye quot spyquot kinda feel
i didnt even bother playing anything higher than agent after i beat the game on all the levels
keep in mind however on goldeneye i beat every level on  agent and got all but two cheats on my own
and to add to that i had fun while doing it
in perfect dark i dont even want to try and get the cheats because i know ill have to play singleplayer levels
the other huge drawback is the multiplayer quotlagquot  if a group of bots surrounds you  or more and everyone starts shooting automatics the framerate is drastically decreased slowing the game down to a crawl
the worst is when a botplayer starts using explosionsjust seeing an explosion will bog the game down
youll understand all of the lag when you play bot games like me
  face it
but perfect dark still manages to capture my creativity as i continue to come up with new multiplayer themes
my favorite is probably the quotmatrix remakequot on the grid level
try slow motion with weapons like pistols shotguns automatics etc etc the stuff used in the movie duh 
it really is fun and the grid looks a lot like that one lobby in the movie
anyways all in all id say this is one of the only  games to buy a  for
i just think those two drawbacks are so major that the rating deserves  stars
i still think everyone should buy this game though
have funthe one good thing about this game is the multiplayer which is why i gave it  stars
when i was having a sleepover we played the multiplayer mode all night
but there is always something bad though and that is the singleplayer mode
i beat the game on agent in a week which was too easy but trying it on special agent was too hard
and the guns are horrible
so if you are bored you can get your friends over and play a couple of rounds of multiplayer but otherwise the game isnt that great well this game is okay if youre an rpg beginner of have to do this weekend and drank too much caffeine on saturday night
very very short game
also very easy if youre somewhat experienced in rpgs
it was much easier than i expected
well anyway if youve got a couple extra bucks and nothing to do maybe youll wanna pick this updoom  aint all that bad but as for me i wouldnt buy it
i did rent it and i enjoyed it for the time i rented it
but i think this would be one of them games that get old in a week
doom  is a shooting game
but it does not have no multiplayer mode
the are a lot of levels in the game but one thing that i didnt like is they all looked the same pretty much just with a better name
the levels looked good and d but everyone and everything in them looked like it was paper glued on
the best thing to do is rent it for a weekend and see how you like itdoom has returned with an allnew game for the nintendo  as always you are the lone soldier in space sent to annihilate goat headed monsters imps zombie soldiers arch viles and spider masterminds
but new to the doom saga are very intelligent enemies and upgraded graphics which look smooth and not pixilated like the pc and other versions
also new are three new weapons to help you tear through dark creatures on your way through  levels
the good part is that they are action packed and challenging the bad part is that some of the levels take you an hour to get through them
which sets doom  apart from the quake games for n because in quake it is obvious what to do go straight and kill whatever gets in your way
with doom you use your mind to uncover things
however this is a stereotypical shooting game where you can only point your gun forward and you cannot jump
fortunately in this game you will not find yourself fighting monsters on staircases ramps or shooting at them from miles away like in the other versions of doom
all of that being said it is a good game but it will not keep your interest because of all of the extras that the pc versions had such as making your own levels this game does not havedoom  was a huge change from the pc  playstation versions but is still an ok game
this takes away a lot of elements from classic doom but it gives us a lot that made this a unique port things like the alien laser  also gave us a new demon the mother demon these were only on the  version
unfortunately they got rid of reverent   of my favorites heavy weapon dude
the  port has more puzzles than the pcps  other related versions its like its going on forever  really can make it boring the action was lacking but oh h yeah the last level really makes up for it
graphically  of the best ports but i prefer the pc version but controlls on the  version are good for the most part actually took advantage of the  capabilities
the enemies look good i say if you got an n you should pick this  up its an ok port of doomi really tried to enjoy quake a lot but unfortunately it gets too repetitive and boring and it tries to rip off doom and resident evil
the enemies feel really quite stupid and uninteresting unlike the enemies in doom and resident evil and they are just annoying and pesty
your weapons are kinda cool but they feel dull most of the time and not very satisfying when slaughtering hordes of enemies
the d graphics are just awful to look at and have no where near the finesse of the graphics of doom
some parts of the game manage to salvage some of the disappointments that linger in it
unfortunately this game is marred by boredom and repetition which really kill its chances of being a classicthis game was okay not what i really like but it was fun
if you like shooting games then this one is for youthis game is not for everyone some people get weary by the rd stage  i like this game it can get a little repetitive but thats ok
even if the graphics is better than on pc it never really got me going it has missi prefered doom however this game still has it challanges and lots of demons to kill the sound effects are creeepy this game is definitely worth a try laterzzzz gamersdo have no lifedo you enjoy wandering aimlessly through hundreds of tiny dark rooms looking for switches only all the rooms look exactly alikegot a lot of time on your handsthen this is the game for youthe weopons ruleof course unless you cheat theyre never there when you need themthe fighting and shooting up dinosaurs is cool but all the wandering and guessing sucksi had the most fun just cheating by putting in stuff to make all the weopons there and all of them infinitely loadedeven with total immunity to death youll still just search and search and still wont beat itunless youre infinitely patienti found this game for  at a used game store
i was just looking for some racing games since i just found my steering wheel for the n
its an alright game but its sometimes hard to control
overall its fun to play but dont pay more then  for itlike most others who mightve already discovered this nintendo   video game is pretty much for kids ages  to 
but that doesnt necessarily mean that many adults couldnt get a certain amount of enjoyment out of it
the players have a chance to race on several different tracks  like a dinosaur valley an ice track a volcano island etc
have to admit that the graphics to the kids game is really quite good  at least i thought so
can easily switch over to this game to kill  say maybe thirty minutesdiddy kong racing is an awesome concept an adventure game mixed with a racing game
throw in some cute characters cool bosses three different vehicles huge racing courses and some sweet secrets and youve got yourself an awesome game right
wellyes and noi loved this game when i was a kid
diddy kong racing was the first game i bought for the n in fact it was the reason i purchased an n
i played this nonstop then beating the entire game unlocking all the secrets then beating the whole game again
then i moved onto different games and dkr fell by the waysideso a few days ago i decided to pop it in for the nostalgia factor and also to see if it was still any fun
i started a new game and found the first track
so far i was having fun probably due to the nostalgia but so far so good
then i got into my first race
i was greeted by horrible controls it felt like my character was sliding along on ice
i managed to finish the race in first place soundly beating my cpu opponents even with the controls
i thought to myself quotthis isnt how i remember dkrmaybe ill play some morequot so i play for a few more hours beating the world and the level boss
the controls have gotten slightly better but are still very loose
the cheesy music is grating on my nerves as are the annoying supercutesy characters
i finally turn the game off deciding too let my fond memories of the game remain intactin  diddy kong racing was revolutionary
today it stands as a failed idea
still i hope that some developer can take the basic idea of dkr and craft a decent kart racer around it
i really like the adventure game aspects of dkr but the poor multiplayer and the loose controls are huge turnoffs
ultimately youd be better off buying mario kart  if you need a racing game for your n
i give dkr points for originality its just that the execution is way off the markthis isnt the best game i have ever played but it is fun enough
i just like to ride around in the desert all day
there is a bunch of different things you can do on here
also you can unlock the old original excitebike which is really cooltheres nothing really wrong with this game im just not a big racing game fan
this game is like wave race  really realistic controls that take a while to get the hang of  also this is the hardest racing game ive ever played so it may take you a long while to master
playing around the other modes by your self how ever is pretty funa somewhat entertaining video game to pull out of your cartridge stack to play and help kill thirty maybe fortyfive minutes with
out of the twenty nintendo  games that i own i play this one probably every other month or so
good graphics to say the least
also like the music thats played when i put this cartridge in for a race
sounds very much like that of the orb or possibly aphex twin
used price for the video game simply cannot be beati love fzero on the snes and i was anxiously trying to get my hands on a copy of this version
and finally when i did i am very disappointed
the graphics are crap the d polygons have no detail and the background is the same every time
why cant there be a car that has all a categories even if its next to impossible to unlock why couldnt they make the superior machinethe race hardly goes fast enough
the only  tracks i did like where the ones with a tube pipe thing you drive on like driving the outside of a tube not the inside
and another track that had quite a few leaps and jumps but over all i still would rather be playing the original and best on the snes
they should have included the snes version on the  cartridge as a side game or somethingoverallgraphics sound controls this game might be better on multiplayer but even a tho i have now unlocked every car and track up to the x round
i do have  days to return it if i dont want it and i think i will be returning it
its a rental game tho you may not be able to rent them from too many places anymore it makes me feel better that it will be out of my hair and i wont have it collecting dust rather then be going to someone else who might enjoy it more then i didi thought they would have learned from the snes version that the game needs a cheat for infinite turbo boosts that doesnt require a gamesharki got this racer for the n due to the lack of racing games at the timeand this one sure is bland
the graphics are plain and uninspired the tracks arent anything special and the sense of speed is patheticunless youre a diehard lamborghini fan there are better racing games availablei dunno i felt like i was sundaydriving around the tracksoh look a car to passyaythe music in the game is done well and the sounds are pretty goodbut not much can save this one from an everage score of  out of i remember playing this for awhile
one of my friends rented it for a few days and thats all it took to beat itlamborghini  is a generic racer that could have been better but isnt
even though it was released in  dont go in with high expectations as there are better racers availableyou pick a car and then you choose to go in one of several modes
to unlock additional cars you have to go through the story mode and beat the  tracks this game has to offer
once you do that they are available in the multiplayer mode where you and  other players can race against each other
thats pretty much itthe pros if youre into lamborghinis then you will have some fun with this game
the graphics and music are decent
the sound effects are pretty good
unlocking the additional cars doesnt take much time so you can use them for the multiplayer modethe cons well its pretty generic
nothing here really stands out
its just an okay game overall
the controls are pretty floaty so you will have to get used to them first
its a short game so after you finish it there is nothing left to doi was underwhelmed after i finished lamborghini  and you will feel the same way too
this game would be most enjoyed by those who are into lamborghinis as it does an okay job of capturing the feel of racing in one of these nice cars
but there are better racers available so unless you really want to get this game and for a real cheap price you are better off taking a pass on this gameas a kid growing up in the s this game was one of my favorites but now when i finally  played it again current day i realized how bad the graphics really werebesides the graphics everything else is pretty good and handling feels like cruisen ca also for the n system
if your looking for a nice racing game id skip thisone unless that is your a big fan of lamborghinis although the game in its self isnt that bad but there are far better games out there for your n system that have bettermechanics and story linesnba hangtime was originally an arcade game that continues on the nba jam franchise with updated roster graphics and the ability to create a player with its own attributes
it did pretty well and eventually it was ported to the snes nintendo  playstation and pc
while its a spot on arcade port its okay when you play it by yourself but best played with other peopleyou start off by choosing to create a player or just picking a squad of two guys from any nba team to go against the computer for  quarters each lasting  minutes
whoever has the most points wins the game
beat all  nba teams and you will be crowned the grand champion
the games option screen lets you choose to lower or higher the audio and sound effects increase or decrease the games difficulty and to slow down or speed up the game clock
as for creating a player you choose a name and pin number then choose a head for your player color of uniform how to distribute attribute points pick a nickname and then save it all so you can use it during the match ups
you can bring up to  other players to play  on  matches at any time
as an added bonus you can find online and enter various cheat codes to activate different effects get additional players courts and a different basketballthe pros midway gave us an exact arcade port of the hit arcade game
everything that was in the arcade game is in here so you wont miss anything
dont worry about the controls because it is easy to get used to
you can even customize the buttons to your liking
the create a player and cheat codes are welcome additions while the multiplayer portion proves that is where the real fun is at especially if you and your friends like to trash talk during the match upsthe cons nothing else was added to make this port stand out no extra modes or bonus content means that all is you do is play against the other teams
also no matter which difficulty level you put it at the ai
players will always catch up and make sure they can beat you at the last possible second
it can get frustrating when your shots are suddenly blocked with perfect precision get shoved to the ground with lightning accuracy and have the ai
players make perfect shots no matter where they are in the court
you will lose games every so often and to earn more attribute points for your created player you have to win  games in a row for  aps and thats the only way to earn them
at least when you play against other people you level the playing field enough for the game to be enjoyabletheres nothing special about nba hangtime
its a perfect arcade port so you wont miss anything if you didnt play it in the arcades
its a game best played with other people as the ai
players make sure you dont win by a landslide and do whatever it takes to rob you of a win right down to the last second in the fourth quarter
and theres no special ending if you do beat all the teams so this is really for the fans of the nba jam series and no one else
get this cheap and make sure you have friends to play this with
otherwise pass this one upbeing a followup version of nba jam it should have kept some of the same options previous versions had
particuly the dunks from anywhere and unlimited fire codes
because its more fun to play with those codes sometimes then it is to play this difficult game
the stratagy compared to jam is a lot harder and makes it less fun imo you cant just turn up the juice and kick your opponents a in this one because the computer will always make a comeback instantly every single time even if you get  points ahead all of a sudden you cant sink a bucket your instantly blocked by the comp or it will steal from nowhere and there  pointers never miss even with players who in real life cant shoot for it is very hard to block or grab rebounds against the computer shots dont go in nicely like in nba jam  and its difficult enough to get on fire let alone stay on fire with the cheating computer instantly making come backs to make it a hard to win matchup everytime eventualy you do work out the stratagy and it becomes a challenge to win instead of being fun to playthere are some cool new options tho the graphics are better then the old snes jams and there is new cool dunks and ally oops double dunks and team fire where if you can make  ally oops in a row both of your teamates become on fire with a blue colored flame
the create a wrestler is a cool idea but you cant do much then just choose heads and attributes and a nickname tho i dunno what more you could create for a basketball game
maybe a whole new team or something and a cheat to get max points you have to win  games in a row to  new atributes ok if you have a memory card but it sucks if you dont and all data is lost when the machine is turned
why does it use a memory card
the snes versions never needed to use them and it takes up little space on the memory card enough to have been in a battery backup optionoverall id much rather be playing the much funner versions on the snes then this one i dont like that there is no unlimitd on fire or unlimited team fire cheat
the code  does enable a cool outdoor street style court to play on which is a lot easier on your eyes then the red and orange of the usualy looking indoor courts codes hold left block block lt but unless you are playing this game with  people then its no fun
probably a lot of fun with a game shark but not on its own and when you get through the  teams there is no cool ending like on the snes one where it showed video things of real dunks this one just rolls credits and says thanks for letting us waste your timeat the time when racing games came out for nintendo  san francisco rush was a game that was unlike anything that hit the street
the game showcased unlike anything imaginable with its high energy and exterme driving
nevertheless any game worth driving always needs a second opinion
it is important to see it to know if you like itwhen san francisco rush came out in  it was a little more crazy unlike anything ive ever raced
the graphics were just amazing but unfortunately the controls were just a little bit awkward and hard to steer through the streets of san francisco
the game anyway features six tracks to choose from three not released in the arcades and a extra special hidden track
before it was a choice in rush  it was featured here alcatraz
the amazing course did have some cuts but it wasnt that extreme until nearly a year later
the game also features a couple of hidden cars to seek while driving
there are hidden keys located on the street unlocking  cars to choose from once there accessed a hidden taxi cab and a devilish prowleralthough there were two different versions of rush that came out during the time one for playstation the other for nintendo  they both seemed a little bit flawed but enjoyable
nevertheless if you had a choice i would suggest picking up rush  extreme racing usa for nintendo  but unfortunately for playstation buffs that was the last rush there was
if you like this game pick it up
if not depending if you own a nintendo  get another racing gameokay
so back in  the nintendo already had super mario  the addition of the critically acclaimed wave race  made the nintendo  even more promising over the thensomewhatstruggling playstation
although it may be largely forgotten now after the relative failure of wave race blue storm wave race  opened to critical raves and is still a cornerstone of nintendo  nostalgia for gamersbut you know what
i think wave race  isnt really that fun
is it a good game
sure its a wonderful game when you talk about the technology relative to the time period
i mean the graphics are phenomenal for  the water is very nice and so are the effects
the music is great
it has that soft jazz feel that appeals to people that dont work in ign
the sound effects are pretty good such as the blub sound when you hit a buoy
heh
blub
blub
blub
the announcer is just as annoying as the guy in pokemon stadium but having that many voice samples in a game is something not even super mario  achieved
the guy just needs to tone down his enthusiasm
it sounds terribly hokey
and yeah
the games physics are good what with the waves and the water and stuffbut you know
aesop was right
if you are unable to succeed in something then you are more likely to pass it off as irrelevant or not worth it
the same thing applies for video games and it is something i had discussed in many earlier takes
games in which an individual sucks at are more likely to be labeled not fun by that individual
well guess what
i suck at wave race  i have never been able to get used to the wave physics and i never remember specific controls
i do well enough in normal mode but every other mode pwns me
i was never into jetskiing games anyways so i am more apt to become discouraged and i say that the game is not fun
its a vicious cycle and apparently the game is the victim
oh well
i have other things to complain about
i cant do stunts so i dont like stunt mode
gee
what a surprise
and this game would have been perfect if it had player modewave race  one of nintendos first game
updated from v
wow
amazing
this game is fun
ok
game overwave race  is a great game
you get  courses  players create your custom jet ski go into a championship play againts your best friend and its over
wave race is nothing special
i cant kill it too hard because it was one of the first games but its just too short
you can only have  players max
only  player championship which is  easy tracks
the custom made boards arnt really custom you just choose between  factors and you can do  tricks
which during racing give you no bonus except if you dont complete the trick making you fall in the water and get behind this game gets old within  hour
it is not worth the price i can guarrantee youloved this when i was a kid but seemed fun to play only a couple times and then i got tired of it
should play with a friend to make it more interesting but still gets old quicknot that often video games can really be very strong at the sea
most of the time there often misplaced or even forgotten
just like most racing games they all seem to be exactly the same like yesterdays newspaper
in the case of wave race it is a little bit different than meets the eye
since the late s jet skis became a popular kind of sport at sea
nevertheless it continues to inspire some of the most interesting games everwave race  was the very first racing game made for the nintendo  in  the game remains a classic featuring over  different race courses by sea
the courses range from a simple pond to a frozen course called glacier bay
as you win each cup the races get increasingly difficult
although the game lacks some value with only four racers to choose from it still remains a staple for any n gamerwhile many people stopped buying nintendo  games for quite a long time due to the gamecube and playstation  it does run up a faster time than most video game that require cdrom technology
get this one and start wave running awayokaynow im not a fan of mega man and i have only played this mega man which i recieved as a christmas present  years ago
i recently put this up on a rummage sale for  after playing it about  times
in two years
well i just took it off because i figured out they are paying mad prices for it on  so im gonna sell mine there for about 
anyways i played this  timesout of the two years ive had it and my th time was the day before the rummage which was two days agomy advice is that if you like cartoons then this is for you
nothing but cartoon humor cartoon mischief cartoon talking cartoon bubblesthe whole game is a cartoon
i guess if you have liked mm for awhile mm would be good for you but not for the average gamer
if i had to rate this at an age scale i would say it is from ages  my lil step bro likes it and he begged me to play it and he did even though he totally  as iti watched him play it and it was a cartoon
the only cool part was the tvlike anime at the beginning
i have the collectors edition and there are only  ever pressed
i collect things but this i must say even though there is a limited number and they are no longer making this i have to sell it
i wont ever play it and i wouldnt ever spend the money to put this in a plaque cuz it just isnt worth the moneyso to wrap it upif youve liked mega man or youre intrested in the mega man legacyor for that matter if you like cartoons then this is for youand yes agreeing with one person that said this earliermega man sounds like his little sisterthis game is really fun and all especially for those who love all of the old mega man games  such as myself but i was kinda dissapointed
i expected it to have more bosses and levels
just like all the old ones you chose your opponent and then fight him and get his ability then chose another untill you beat them all
it has been like this sense the first one came out
however it is funin this game you can actually upgrade your wepons and stuff but the graphics arnt that much better then the netendo versions  although there is a cartoon in the begining
if youre looking for long gameplay hours this is not the game to buy
if youre lookng for quotanother mega manquot then i would recamend ittheres this dude in one of those you cant see youself games going around and shooting at monstersthats really about itits pretty straught forward for a whileits not very obvious what youre supposed to be doing and that always sucksi like knowing what im up againstits pretty goodbelieve me this is nowhere near the worst game of all time
it is strictly an average game
it breaks no new ground offers very little in the way of new and fresh adventures and its explicit blood and guts get tiresome after a while
but where it excells is in the horror aspect with well animated and truely frightning monsters lurking in the back alleys there is much to fearset in victorian london circa  you assume the role of either a preist or a young student apprentice
the former excells with strength while the other excells at agility
both offers skills essential to survival
your task is to defeat all the monsters that an evil scientist has unleashed
cliched as the story is the action is fun for any fan of resident evil or tomb raider with the action in the third person similar to the other survival horror gamesthe graphics are nice but dark and moody
this makes the gaming experience unpleasant over the long run
the music is nicely done and reminds me of the moods set in silent hill
the action is nice and will please gamers who crave action and painting walls with your enemies
but in the way of deep story or character development you may want to look elsewherenot very bad but not very good eithernothing with the quality or seller i just didnt like the game all that much
i never thought id see a game with worse controls than the old tomb raiders but there it isi dont see games like this anymore where the characters speak as they do
this is one of those classic games that appeal to collectorsthe xfiles game is a great adventuremystery game
i couldnt stop playing once i started
great story cool missions
one problem i beat it in one day
and it has no replay value
once you beat it once then thats it
its no fun to play again because you know whats going to happen
i suggest you rent it instead of buying it because it only takes about hrs to beat
but still its deffinately worth checking outyawn another fighting game
yeah pretty muchim not a big fan of fighting games but i was willing to give this aged title a shot
i was really disappointed
it gets reptitive real fast
the bonus is you get a lot of interesting moves and combos which is coolthe problem is fighting games get so tired after awhileanother one of square softs rpg but certainly not one of there best
on the other hand it is quite challenging and most certainly longyou have your choice of  differnt characters with  differnt stories
red blue asellus riki tzg lute and emelia
varying from mage to robot and even a couple of just plain fighters
each one has its own storyline and missions with its own endingpros graphics and music go together nicely challenging and interesting storylines
one of its strongest points is the combos your characters can do
as you select which tactic of battle you want each member of your party to do it can create combos that can inflict serious amounts of damage
saving anyplace is one of the best things about this gamecons with over  hours of game play it gets very repeditive
granted each character has differnt story lines most end up taking the same quests
a bit on the dull side after you have beat a few of the herosin a nutshell this is a good game
certainly one that i recomend you beat one character or even two then put it away for a while so you dont become sick of itwell this is a very old game that was released for the psone system
it was rereleased on another console
as one of the first games in the series it did a good job
it is nearly impossible to find in any store now
used or newgameplay this game is a lot like tales of phantasia
its a linear battle system with small sprites running around attacking with swords or magic
there is not just one mage or sword wielder in this game
the style is that of all the other games just earlier
if that makes any sensegraphics not bad for an old ps game it was awesome in its time
now though it would not go very far as it has pixels and not aweinspiring graphicscharacters the characters were cute
not as good as later tales game characters
these characters could not talk but they had talking swords which was pretty coolstoryline basically like all rpg and all tales series games
save the world scenario
which for some odd enough reason never seems to grow old
the characters each have their own story and backgrounds so it is cool to look into them
if you want to purchase this game i would suggest to buy the remake if at all possiblei just got done playing duke nukem land of the babes and noticed a few reviewers where saying that game was nowhere near as good as time to kill or the other title
so after enjoying land of the babes i couldnt wait to get into this one and see what made it so much better
but to my disappointment what the heck makes it any different or better
this one here i say is pretty much the same game as land of the babes apart from different stages and a few enemies only a small amount of guns are different from the other title but none the less they could easily have both been part of the exact same gamenow im not bagging this game dont get me wrong but i think its just as equal to land of the babes
maybe this one stands out a little more because some stages resemble that of zero hour on the nintendo  but lets be honest zero hour is a far superior game on every level
literallymaybe time to kill requires a bit more searching around to get through levels that part may be a little bit harder but in the end i felt like i had played the same game twice and was a little bored by the end of it
by the time i blew away the final boss i expected the ending to be disappointing and low and behold possibly the most disappointing ending in duke nukem historyof coarse maybe had i been playing this  years ago or around the time this game came out maybe it might have seemed a lot better at the time but no wait zero hour was made too and that game rocked my world but this one here euhhh i can see why some might like it better than land of the babes but its only by a small fractionoverall if you play another dn title on the ps before this you may think either ummm this is the same game or oh goodie
more levelstail of the sun is a unique gaming experience
not much to look at graphically but a huge world to explore
while this huge world is inviting there is little point to exploration other than to find the  or so different animals to kill
evolving your tribe is little more than killing an animal
no contact with the other tribe members unless you die and need to pick a new one or they do that funny little dance when you have village upgrade
the only changes during the game is your fist becomes a stick then a axe then a spear wow
you do find alienswhich you can kill a giant nose a huge bone a few ruins and caves
but the camera angles are soo terrible you get trapped in a cave and cant find your way out
your person will fall asleep at a moments notice which is funny but stupid tooa intersting foray for a few hours it took about  hours to beat on the medium setting
which may seem short but if it lasted longer it would be too long to take
anyways enjoy if you like deep exploration with curious but useless resultsnintendo made a slew of video games based off movies back in the s and aladdin was one of them
this game does not follow the movie to the letter but gameplay is fairly smooth and entertaining
its an average game nothing too spectacular about it but the graphics were pretty niceteam up with billy and jimmy from the double dragon game series and wartz rash and zitz from the battle toads game series for another action packed fighting game
there is a huge contrast of fighting styles because double dragon was a slow thrashing game and battle toads was a cartoonish simplistic game
they combine the two to make a show moving and difficult game with really poor game play
the game is very slow and tedious but at least action is diverse from brawling to riding hover bikes and everything in between
another downfall is that the graphics are not up to snes standards more like nestheres nothing technically wrong with dkcdksdt
i mean its a great platformer but it has a tendancy to seem more like a chore than actual fun
dixie kong returns frontandcenter from her costarring role in diddys kong quest and nothings changed about her
thats good news because she can still whack enemies with her hair and glide like a helicopter
thats bad news because she cant takeout some bigger enemies so she needs the help of her overweight brat kiddy kongthis game has alot of different weapons but it is a short game play with the unlimited continues that you can use witch makes it very easy takes about  hours to beat to find all of the eggs once you get the hang of the gameas the first game in my snes game collection i had high hopes for it as i loved the movie it was based on
it uses a top down perspective while walking around the island and uses a d look a la doom when exploring the various buildings and caves while offering you multiple weapons to use
it uses the likenesses of the dinosaurs and some of the main characters that appeared in the movie
the graphics sounds and music are spot on and help you get into the game
it controls very easily and you get used to quickly
so why do i give this game  starsfirst off this is a very long exploratory and adventure game
the island is huge and you have to explore caves and buildings which in its own eats up a lot of time
aside from figuring out which weapons to use against which dinosaurs your memory skills will be tested as the game offers no hints as to which direction you should do or how to complete tasks
no map system is available while underground or in buildings so youll get lost plenty of times
you start out with  lives and have infinite continues but no password or save system is available
if you intend to beat this game youll have to do it in one shot
after you finished all the objectives you head back to the helipad
there you get treated to the games ending the intro presentation of landing on the helipad when you first start playingin reverseand thats it
it took me almost  hours to beat it and after seeing the games ending i was so disgusted that i went to my local game shop and sold it for some 
bottom line its not worth it for the time and effort you spend on playing or beating this gamejurassic park is pretty chalaging i kid you not
it is also fun to
if you want to beat this game in one day or several hours get the cheat codes from a place called gamewinnerscom
this is a pretty cool gameif you liked this game then check out all of the jp gamesim sick to death of mario
the ultimate best mario game is new super mario on dsvery good for the first  stages but after stage  you will be in sigmas fortress to defeat vile and believe me this is the most frustrating stage i have ever played on any game
if you thought the first  stages were hard you are in big trouble because after you defeat vile you have to go through hell just to make it to boomer kwanger and after kwanger you have to defeat the most frustrating boss of the stage the bobspider
unless you love frustration i would not reccommend this game as it gets much harder to the point that you completely put the game downthis is definetly the start of something good
the two later super star wars games were a lot more forgiving than this title simply because the inside the sandcrawler stage is extremely difficult due to difficult enemies and more difficult jumps  it wouldnt surprise me if lukes double jump in the later games came after negative feedback here
if you manage to get past the sandcrawler stage youre in for a very fun game particularly when youre allowed to choose characters luke han or chewie
perversely that sandcrawler stage is the hardest in the game and its the th level
i recommend this game for the patient skilled gameri used to play this game quite often when i was a kid
but i was never really good at it
though i used to like it i dont really care for it anymorethis game is one of the few games to really push the sness power
this and donkey kong country are probably the best looking games ever on the system
that being said this is no wear near the arcade game
i mean no where nearthe game retains the characters and moves but the players smaller and moves are choppy
the back grounds are still pretty good looking but the port lost a few stages
and none where d like the arcade
so smaller characters and choppier animation makes the game not seem whole
this being said they really did everything they could with the system
the arcade ki i would give a star but i cant do that for this port because i liked the arcade version so much
but the arcade version was over four times larger
if you get to an arcade with one give it a go
i think youll agree that that was one of the best fighters of the s
this is only a port of that but style a good gamemortal kombat back in  dominated the arcade scene and gave street fighter ii a run for its money
so when news broke that it was coming out for the snes and genesis consoles everyone rejoiced and the bragging rights for best version of this game was up for grabs
when the dust cleared it was obvious each version had its pros and consfor the snes this was for the most part a faithful port of the arcade game
it had all the stages and the test your might minigames the original music the original characters plus the secret character and the end boss shang tsung
the graphics were crisp and clear while the music sounded just like in the arcade game controls were easy to get used like in the arcade game
however the game came heavily censored the blood was changed to look like sweat
some of the fatalities were toned down considerably and replaced with non violent finishing moves kano sub zero johnny cage and raiden
they even went as far as to make sure you could not send anyone through the spikes at one stage that takes place on top of a bridge when you wanted to fulfill the requirement to fight the secret character reptile
the controls while easy to get used to were slightly changed from the arcade game and some of the basic moves were taken out entirelyso it was a major gamble for nintendo that didnt pay off the genesis version while regarded as inferior to the snes version because of its fuzzy graphics and featured different music for the stages had the gore and fatalities available as long as you entered a secret code
sales wise it beat out the snes version as punishment for the backlash against nintendos family friendly policypick this one up only for nostalgic reasons as mortal kombat ii is the sequel and better game and it came out fully uncensoredi must admit i have never been a huge mortal kombat fan i obtained this game from my brother not working when he was moving
i got it working and played it at bit to my surprise no blood
i personally could care less about this because honestly i never cared about the gore factor anyway
aside from that and i know for some this is a major buzz kill the game looks great and moves are easy to pull off just like another reviewer said
however two major down flaws your characters walks and jumps arent very fluent
also it seems kind of slow i remember this game being a bit faster the game looks wise is amazing however given the time context and the original arcade version
to be honest tho i remember this game in the arcades and not being a fan really i say this one is the best
i have  and  on an arcade classic pack for gamecube and the controls are pretty bad as well and the matches end fast
so all and all if you have the patients for this game and you dont mind the no blood and some what shoty movements you will want this game
as for me i mark it as just your average fighting game for its time
i would suggest over this game street fighter turbosnes games usually are good or just awesome
there are a lot of fighting games on the snes mortal kombat being one of them
i do own this game on an snes cartridge
this game has some flaws that dont make it good it just makes it plain awful
it has bad control input lag its pretty slow for a fighting game and since this is the first mortal kombat game this maybe isnt a big deal but not many characters
your maybe gonna button mash the punch button since its very difficult to do a subzero freeze ray or a scorpion spearif you want a good fighting game gets street fighter  turbothis features a totally different button configuration that people were used to with street fighter  games
it also offers some very intense fighting with blood bone breaking moves and a single fatality for each of the seven kombatants
you play as liu kang sub zero scorpion sonya blade kano rayden and johnny cage and fight your way up through a ladder tournament
eventually fighting in a handicapped match against two people one after the other and working your way to the boss shang tsung who can take the form of anyone
however infront of tsung awaits the four armed  foot tall bodyguard known as goro who is the biggest challenge of the game
good luck
a huge downfall of the game for the snes and sega is that there are no fatalities instead you need a special code to enable themmortal kombat was released in arcades in  the game feautured digitized actors as the fighters realistic fighting bloody moves and outrageous finishing moves
unfortunately when nintendo allowed acclaim to release a snes version of the game they forced the release of a quotsofterquot version of the game
the blood was removed and the fatalities were downgraded
as a result nintendo suffered big losses in game sales compared to the genesis version which included everything from the arcade
whatever the case along with street fighter ii and virtua fighter mortal kombat is considered a landmark in the history of fighting gamesgraphics and soundwise the snes version is the best home conversion available
it manages to duplicate almost every animation and background detail from the arcade
the fighters look big and very realistic and have fluid animation
the sound effects are good and the music sounds like something out of an old kung fu movie which is nice
it creates a true oriental atmospherecontrols are a bit harder to stomach
although the special moves are a breeze to perform the simple actions such as walking and jumping dont respond like you would want them too
it makes the fighters feel a bit awkward and downtoearth literally
if you get rayden crouching in a corner just go near him and start punching low
he wont be able to get out of that situation
thats not good for the game balancewisethere are seven fighters who are johnny cage kano rayden liu kang scorpion subzero and sonya blade
a few of them look quite different from their newer incarnations
the hidden fighter is reptile and the bosses are goro and shang tsung
a very old shang tsung i might add
you see this was before shao kahn restored his youth each kombatant has one fatality which is a tamer version of its arcade counterpart
for example johnny cages decapitating uppercut is replaced with a weird quotspear kickquot
the blood has become dust
yes i said dustwhile this game is not as exciting as mk and mk mainly due to the limited number of moves it can still hold its own as a solid realistic snes fighting game
snes owners looking for a worthwhile game to play for their nowdead system should buy this especially if you are a mk fan
if not id suggest you spend the money on street fighter ii or sf turbothis version of mortal kombat was a complete letdown to most fansbecause of its lack of blood and gorethats not the only bad thing that this port had going for itthe gameplay was just awful
the character movements were very slow and could be very choppythe genesis version had so much better gameplay compared to thismost of the fatalities were changed to less graphic finishing bonusesalot of the die hard mk fans were really pissed off about that tooalthough i did think that subzeros and raidens finishing bonuses were pretty coolthe two best things that this game has to offer are great graphics and really good soundmusicall the animations are here tooeverything from the floating clouds in the backgrounds skyto shang tsung clapping his handsafter a round is overall the sounds are also includedthat the genesis version did not haveoverallthis is an okay versionif you can ignore the lack of blood n gorethe censored fatalities and the bad gameplayif notthen stay with genesisprobably the best thing about this game is the laughs and hilarity of owning something titled shaqfu which just sounds like it came out of an inside joke
you know all about the chuck norris jokes that still go around today
do you think there were a lot of shaq jokes that led to the creation of this game
well im sure the creation of this game certainly led to a lot of shaq jokes as just the concept alone is a laughing stock
this game is not an essential piece to any collectors library so i wouldnt recommend it to anyone but oddly enough it still isnt as bad as its made out to becontrol is a bit of a joke
most reviewers make it out to be unresponsive when in fact it actually is quite responsive
its just rather slow and sluggish
even if you change the speed of the gameplay it can be frustrating to move your character around as now hes moving too fast and doesnt quite go to where you need him to go
sometimes if your opponent is all the way at the other side of the screen and you need to jump over to him hell jump much too short of a distance
sometimes hell jump much too far and miss if you have the perfect opportunity to catch your opponent with a jumpkick
the special moves are a chore to pull off but not in the least bit necessary to win a match
that can be disappointing as many fighters rely heavily on special moves and combos for their individuality
this game is nothing more than a simple brawler
if the developers didnt sacrifice control for fluid animation then i would at least be able to say well the concept and title is a joke but at least it controls pretty good
unfortunately it controls just a hair below averagecamera its an early snes fighter so the camera angle is always fixed at a d wideshot but seems a touch too far away that your characters look rather smaller compared to most games such as street fighter and killer instinctgraphics the graphics dont take advantage on the snes mode  which is commonly spoken of by stoneage gamers
the pixels appear to be amateur handdrawings but some of the backgrounds are creative and done well
remember that i did say some of the backgrounds as others look lazy as if the developers didnt have enough ideassound whether its on the genesis or the snes the sound is nothing special
the only grateful thing about the sound is that it isnt too horrendous either
it just doesnt compare to the standard set by killer instinct in  and other less known and more obscure fighting games have much more superior sound effects
the only fighter that has worse sound effects and music than shaq fu is ballz d but fortunately music would have to be pretty painful for me to make it a total deal breakergameplay the most challenging aspect of the game is trying to get used to it as youll waste precious time just trying to figure out how to do a special move
it isnt worth it as all your opponents can be fallen by the basic punch and kick
it will just take longer and another aspect that draws out each match is the autoheal mechanic
only the well done fighting games should have an autoheal mechanic so be sure to have a time limit set so the matches are not too drawn out
just be sure you have more health than your opponent before the timer does run out but that should be common senseoverall its still a tolerable game but not the fighter you want to go for to actually have fun
look for samurai showdown brutal fists of fury any street fighter  title or mortal kombat game for a fun fighter
clayfighter and primal rage is by far more fun than this game but in spite of all the games bad press it is still an average fighter
if combos were added in and the specials were easier to pull off then it would really help the game stand out more in a positive light despite the concept
in fact had the controls been improved prior to mass production it would have launched this game into a cult phenomenon but it was electronic arts at the time and the only thing on their mind was marketing and money
this is still a superior game however to rise of the robotsthis game is very old school and is much like the original sim city that came out on the pc
compared to sim city  and upwards this game is very simplistic its graphics so and so
theres only a few things you can build besides the standard resident commercial and industrial zones such as sports stadiums policefire stations and seaports
even at the fastest speed in the game the process is actually fairly slow compared to the fast option in future simcity games
if youre a fan of the newer simcity games and want to go old school you might enjoy this but i definitely enjoyed simcity  betterthis game is gimmacky
all large percent of the boxers have weird names and are weird themselfs like bear huggermad clownbald bull and get thisbob charlie which is a spoof of bob marley
some of their finishing moves are weird too like mad clown using balls to hit you withdragon chan using kicks to beat you even though thats illegal in boxing and so is using a cane in which hoy quarlow does but the weirdest move is the hair whip used by heike kagero
that makes no sense
you cant hurt anybody just by whipping your hair
the upside is that this game is challenging and gets challenging with each circuit and you get to see your name on the scoreboard if you score high enough to
i give this game a  out of i consider the original punchout for the nes to be one of the single greatest video games of alltime
so perhaps it was inevitable that this game never really sucked me in quite as muchsuper punchout is a pretty fun game in its own right
as little mac you get to battle against some new and some familiar foes
they each get harder to beat and have some of the odd characteristics that fans of the series are used to seeingwhat is telling for me though is that i have never actually beaten this game
it isnt because of extreme difficulty it would take some practice but i know i could do it if i put in the effort but rather that it doesnt really inspire me to finish
whereas i spent hours honing my skills at the original ive never felt that this super version was worth the effortmaybe im being a bit unfair considering my undying love for the original but super punchout has never risen above mediocrity for me
 stars would be a more exact rating
it is fun the first couple of times i play it but when it gets to the point of really having to put the work in i always find myself moving on to other gameswow heres a game i havnt played in like a decade or so
think this game came out in  or something i got some free poster with it much like the nes game of wrestle challenge that had more glitches than anything ive ever played
this game wasnt bad except that finishing moves were non existant
what got me more was at the same time wrestlemania for sega genesis came out and they all had finishing moves yet the graphics and sound were lousy compared to the snes plus had some different guys in it
as i said this one wasnt bad but could of been better
oh for the person who put nasty boys in here i thought it was legion of doom that ws in here not nasty boys
i know they were in the sega cd of steel cage challenge yet if i remember right that had no tag team option in that one programers with such limited resources to work with
actually the only reason games are good nowadays is because the wrestlers have more interaction in how the game is and how its set up with them specifically minus the legends like andre and others that are either deceased or trademarked by wwe so they do whatever with them
im kinda shocked that this game is sold for so much since i see it occasionally in game stores for like less than  but if you see it there for that cheap get it for the heck of it its hard to say cause most of the guys on there i think are on legends of wrestling games nowadays
like i said ok at the time by todays standards a forgetable mistakethis game is not good by any means but it is a stepping stone to building a better game
there are twelve wrestlers hulk hogan jake the snake ted dibiase randy savage sid the undertaker the nasty boys and the natural disasters
each of these wrestlers has the exact same moves
there are no special  finnishing manuvers either
the game is nothing like the present wrestling games such as the fact that there is only one arena and present games have seven or more arenas
there is however several types of matches such as single tag team and survivor series matchesthis game was always pretty cool to me when it first came onto the scene
but it has no tornaments or many match options
every charactor has the exact same moves
id recomend you have a control pad with turbo buttons because it was very button masher friendly
i recomend its sequel tho royal rumblethe bad news is that bam bam bigalow and yokozuna have been removed from the actual arcade version leaving the number of wrestlers the same as the first wrestlemania video game for the nintendo entertainment system
bam bam would have been the only character in both games
other than that and the fact that everyones favorite sexually ambiguous prowrestler luna vachon what
you thought i was gonna say chyna
 is not included in any version of this game everythings cool
well id rather the blood was red instead of blue but otherwise its cool
the good news is that you get corny yet pillowmuffled commentary from vince mcmahon and jerry lawler and action that is faster paced than wwf raw not the xbox version
each wrestler has his own set of gag moves razor ramon attacks with hands that turn into blades doink beats clowny stuff out of his opponents and bret hart okay so not everyone has gag moves
the undertaker and shawn michals have nothing special but lex luger attacks with metal arms
i dont know if this happened before or after mortal kombat  but this does resemble jax and the two of them both have rude pompous allamerican attitudes
anyway thats my review and im not sticking to itas for the phrase in my review title yes it was taken from the commercial and no i dont know the rest of the words or where to find the commercialfrist thing is the figures in this game are cool and realbut where is the real wrestlemania musicbret harts music is only  sconds hell eveybody music in this game is  scondsand at the end of this game
the music doesnt sound like the real thing
but it is fun to playi was surprised to hear about dark reign   the original while one of my personal favorite games did quite poorly in stores and was a flop compared to direct competition such as starcraft and total annhinilation
keeping these qualms in mind i was pleased to notice that activision was funding another game in the series and that it would have a full d engine
i bought the game the day it came out  rushed it home and installed it
i was very impressed for the first few hours
the d engine was most impressive the gameplay good and the missions fun
however i noticed that the team had taken out some options from fark reign  where was the settings for your units tenacity their agressiveness
this is where things started taking a turn for the worsei also realised that the missions started to become rather repetitive
although some are the survive with a limited number of units type most are the kill everything variety perhaps with some objective put in for good measurehowever the only way to get to these objectives is to kill everybody in between you and them
the graphics are good but not as amazing as ground control also i noticed some flagrant false advertising on the back of the boxlook closely and you will see each explosion pictured there is fully d and has particles flying out in every direction
in the game the explosions are lores sprites
i do like the music however and it runs well at x full details on my p with geforce if you liked dark reign try the demo
if you like that consider buying the game
there was so much more they couldve done with thisthis game is one of the good thrillers ive ever come across
its a cooooool game with a good storyline but once the story ends the games over
i didnt feel like playing it more than onceabout the  problem people are having with the save game feature all they have to do is press the quotescquot button on their keyboard and a box will appear asking them whether they wanna save their game or quit
so whenever u wanna save your game during game play at given time hit quotescquot on the keyboard and save your game as soon as u do that u can continue with your game immediately
i didnt need to download any patches for the save game featurethis game is a good buy
for those who havent try itokay there is one thing indisputably spectacular about this game the graphics
theres no arguing this fact theyre absolutely awesome with incredible cutscenes and very smooth performanceno jerking movements or  dialogue skipping
transitions are seamless and the whole effect  compliments the game fantastically well nihilistic did not turn this into  a graphics symposium and you wont lose the plot in their  splendorunfortunately thats about the only really wonderful point  about the whole game
dont get me wrong i didnt find anything tragically  flawed about the experience this is a very fun game especially after  having played the penandpaper version for so long
there is a solid plot  behind the entire thing and interesting dialogue though it gets a bit  pathetic at times and i bordered on wanting to slay christof myself as he  bemoaned his fate and forbidden love
but is the plot particularly  inspired
no
is the roleplay that engrossing
nothough to be fair ive  yet to find a game that really lives up to the what roleplaying ought to  be
is the combat exhilerating
not in the slightestmost of my  complaints revolve around the mechanics of the game
if youre looking  solely for an actionoriented game skip it
though it might bear some  resemblence to diablo in the way combat is visually represented  disciplines read quotspellsquot to those unversed in the white wolf  lexicon are cumbersome and trying to use them in the middle of combat is  almost more dangerous than it is helpful
the player is faced with  exceptionally little creative opportunity in combat situations just keep  clicking on the bad guy and try to stay out of the way of your team so  they can join in too
i never felt my heart jump into my throat or my  stomach shrivel to the size of an orange when faced with combat in this  game like i have in othersits just not that excitingthe soundtrack  is good but repetitive
after about ten minutes in a new area i was  pretty much over itso what the heck am i saying
this really is a  fun game but it doesnt live up to the hype which may be making me overly  critical but i dont think so
go ahead buy it play it youll have a  great time but dont expect to stay up all night into the wee hours of the  morn slaying evil ghouls and denizens of the nightthis is  of those rare games that is funbut at the same time it isnt goodi myself do not have this game but a friend of mine does and he plays it i cant realy find anything i like in it accept finding downloads off websitesthen playing with the new downloads for about  miniutsthen turning the game offhowever mutiplayer is a blast and is probly the coolest part of the game player is okyou start out as a crusaider type dude in medevil agesget bitten by a vampirethen all the sudden your in modern times
which is kinda cool cause u can have midevil weapons and modern weapons another cool part in this game is all the different weapons you can getswordsaxesmacesbaseball batsshotgunsmachine gunschaninsaws and just about any other weapon you can think of over all this game will keep you busy for about  weeks be it starts collecting dust next to age of empires and the simsthis game is old ill give it that but its still no where near as entertaining as its followup game bloodlines which is actually very fun and has a decent replay factor
this game engine along with dynamics and over all suckage makes for a waste of money
even for a walking down video game memory laneif this were a review purely about content then redemption would get a well deserved  stars
unfortunately the technical problems drag the entire game downthe badhorrible pathing
your party members block you all t he time and walls trap you sometimes
in neverwinter nights party members would just scoot out of the way when you needed to get by them
in redemption you need to move around your party
i can deal with that except youre constantly put in scenarios where your  party group is traveling through a tight corridor and needing to go backwards is a nightmare
i finally gave up and switched control to the lagging member and used that character to move backin most other games ive played you could just shove characters other characters out of your way
thats the best way about it because when youre midfight the last thing you want to do is reposition a stubborn party member who just wont get out of your way
absolutely abismal pathing in this gametheres not much pizazz to the weapons and armor available either
guns and ranged weapons are pretty useless in the game and ive found sticking with the good old shield and sword works better
again i blame the developersthere is little to none available as far as support and ive only found one patch so farthe goodthis game contains the most engaging engrossing and interesting plotlines ive seen in a game
the story content is unparalleled
you follow cristof romuald a crusader knight of the dark ages who fights in the crusades
he is wounded and nursed back to health in medeival prague by the beautiful nun anezka
you begin the game playing cristof as a human and you follow the character through his embrace and change into vampiric statethe game is based on white wolfs vampire the masquerade and vampire the dark ages tabletop rpg books
the designers of redemption did a good job of bringing wws material into the game and do so in a way that is pleasing to a vtm fan yet still easy for a beginner to digest
as the plot continues in the game christofs sire and friends explain to him about the vampire clans vampire origins etc
etc
i had my doubts about getting this game because i doubted a game could do justice to wws publications but after playing it you really cant help but enjoy the storybasically you play christof through the ages and travel through prague vienna london and modern day new york
hes basically on a path to redemption thus the name of the game is redemption and depending on how humanely you act throughout the game you may or may not receive redemption
a humanity score is kept
with the gaining of experience points you can buy skill points and with enough skill points strength dexterity intelligence charisma etc
 you can buy discipline points
thats where the real fun is at the disciplines vampire powersmultiplayer is ok  i heard redemptions multiplayer capabilities referred to as neverwinter nights lite
theres not much by way of videogaming you can do on multiplayer but you can hold campaigns and assign a storyteller
the storyteller holds gm powers and can access each players advancement menu to grant exp control players speak through players spawn items and kill or revive players
so if youd like an alternative to tabletop and currently play vtm you can definitely check this outthis game is definitely roleplay heavy and they speak in ye olde english at least christof and anezka do
its not to say its corny though
they may say thee thou thy and hath but the dialogue and voice acting is fantasticdespite the inexcusable technical problems redemption offers the richest content and voice acting ive seen in a gamei truly hope that game developers will pick up vtm to base another game on and hopefully theyll do justice to all the fabulous content they put in it by making it sufficiently playableits really worth picking up if youre like me and are more an rpg fan than a hack and slash powergamer
if you want a game with a rich story this one wont disappoint in that aspect
but be warned of the pathing lack of support and other gameplay issuesive never played vampire in tabletop roleplay so im not quite sure how  true the game was to its predescessor
but it was still a very good  introduction to the system for me
i learned about magic and lore and the  differences between a ghoul and a vampire and a humanthe main  character christof was very interesting to play
my first nervous twinge  about playing a vampire themes games was quotew so im going to play a  bloodthirsty commandoquot but as i progressed through the chapters i  found that i was in control of my own destiny
i could try to be kind and  just or i could be as  cruel a jerk as i wantedthere were some  annoyances like the lack of saves and the utter confusion of combat and  lack of tactics you pretty much just mobbed a monster with everything you  had and hoped it was enough but ive heard that this will change soon with  a patchthe game progresses from the days of the crusades to modern  times
i didnt care much for the time jump it would have been much  cooler to slowly progress through time to modern ages but that might have  made the game ten times longer that it was so thats just a small  gripethe characters of christof the holy knight turned vampire and  his love anezka whom he searches for out of guilt and out of love are  wonderfuly done and made the story more real
the dialogue was well  written and made up for the messily done hack and slash fests one must take  to progress through each levelanother really great feature is the  multiplayer capabilities
one of the things that makes it so great is that  a person has the option to be a game master in an adventure and control  just about everything
its really great to be able to craft your own  games and so far this has been the first one ive ever seen with this  option instead of running quakelike through a maze and killing everybody  in sightoverall there were some innovative options in this game and it  was well put together just the combat was a little confusing at times and  the lack of saving points made it difficult
still i think that the good  points outweigh the badawful ai save and load problems game interface is sometimes useless
i had expected much better from a masquerade adaptation
the only positives are graphics and sounds but not enough to save a boring game
keep playing the pen and paper and unless you are a world of darkness fanatic spend your money for a better gamethis game has a lot of good things going for itthe graphics were really great for its time and even now still look goodat least on the main characters
the story while not great is still far above the average for a videogame
the same can be said about the voice actingand probably most importantly the game is fun
or at least it starts out that way
by the time you get a  character party the games horrible ai and pathfinding are irritatingly obviousfor starters you have the choice between your allies sitting there doing nothing while youre in a fight or them running off on their own through half the level in search of something to fight and biting off more than they can chew and dying
babysitting them is extremely tedious especially when you switch to control one from running off on his own only to have another one do the exact same thingpathfinding is awful
going around a corner and through a door and getting your entire party to go along is more difficult than any boss in the game and some of them are fairly difficult
on top of it your allies will buff themselves with every spell they have consuming bloodone of the resources you have to maintain at a decent level or suffer bad consequencesdeath at the sight of so much as a rat
there is an option to make it so they only autocast from a short list of spells that you choose but apparently the option is bugged and doesnt workin the end i found it easier to go through a level with just one character
i left the rest behind only using them to store equipment and for boss encounters
thats how bad it isits a shame because the character advancement system is very customizeable and i would have liked to play the game multiple times to try things different each time
however the annoying ai has sapped any replayability the game might have heldthe good it was designed by ravensoft who have a lot of id people on their team and its running off of the q engine
graphically its gosh darn purty
the lighting is superb and the architecture creature designs and weapon designs are all topnotch as one would expect from ravensoft
the only graphics niggle i have is that the mouths arent made of polygons but are synced bitmaps of course to date halflife is the only game to get that right
the missions are overall interesting with a nice mix between puzzle and action
a lot of the missions include team members who are more than just grunts many of the scripts work trigger individual members for individual tasks
the puzzle missions are for the most part well designed and more interesting that the standard keyfind quests that are typical to the genre
the sound is very nice too although i wish they had included explicit eax support
the one quotstealthquot mission in particular made good use of that
most of the weapons are quite interesting with all of them featuring a secondary fire mode  the default phasers in particular are very fun to use i love beam weapons
i especially liked the rationalization for the traditional fps bad o weapons a portable replicator that you carry with you
and finally the borg have that cool lasereye thingie thats just ohsocool
the bad well it is voyager
for the most part that didnt bother me although the long and uninterruptible cinematics involving the real live tm voices of various actors got on my nerves
theres also a certain cloying pcness to the game that annoyed me especially given that it is after all an fps
the games attempts to sanitize a massive killfest left me a bit woozy at times
the plot is also less than impressive although frankly it was more interesting than most of the voyager tv episodes ive seen and it was more than adequate for a genre that is often allergic to the whole notion of plot
there were certain points where the game suffered from quotwhat do i do nowquot syndrome although nothing too bad when it doubt look for a tunnel to crawl into
likewise on voyager the doors are unlabeled so one is often required to blunder around in the between mission phases
on that note some of the architecture is a bit quotcrowdedquot
this is especially true on voyager where there are loads of fake doors that you cant enter and i just hate that in a game
the game length is a bit short but ive been spoiled by halflife so take that with a grain of salt
finally the great big bugaboo of most fpss  the ai it sucked
all too often the game resorts to simply swarming you with enemies
there were few cases where you couldnt even discern that there was any ai although there were a couple of great skirmish sequences where the enemy actively sought refuge behind crates
in terms of combat much of the game resembles doomoverall i enjoyed it
id recommend it if like me youre feeling a bit starved for a decent fps
just dont blow any significant amount of money on itstar trek voyager elite force is an fps with a great story driven single player gameplay and built on the fantastic quake iii arena engine
it has a good storyline with perfect voice acting and a pretty good ai
i played it on the default opengl video mode and the game runs very smoothly
the graphics are fantastic the xen like alien levels look very georgeous sound recording is good
charecter animation are great crew members look very life like
the level load times are good and save games do not eat up disk space
the length of ellite force is just right and it has a great multiplayer and single player tournament gameplay
the gameplay is good but mostly you are playing with the ai team members and it is quite bad
the level design is good and there are lots of great puzzles to be solved action gameplay is slightly dissapointing as some of the levels are very linear and some of them are very difficult
i did not like the selection of weapons in ellite force they are very badly done their effects are very disspointing almost all weapons just shoot a straight line of colored light
star trek voyoger ellite force is the best star wars based game ever made but i wish it was a little better as it is devoloped by raven softwarethis review is written in light of owning a copy of armada  so i will begin by saying that if you can find a copy of armada  theyve become somewhat rare then i reccomend that title over this one but failing that this is also decentarmada has several flaws that keep it from being a truly great game but several nice touches as wellarmada fails in its strategic edge for gameplay and further in the simplification of both borg graphics and the function of various ships
in this game the ships you produce behave much like footmen in warcraft  the only difference being that your ships can be seen dogfighting and shooting each other with phasers and from time to time being assimilatedthe function of ships also carries a few flaws and the races are diverse enough to offer a few different options to battle but for the most part the same strategy works for any race blockade an enemy base and use built or captured artillery vessels to pummel its defenses until you can safely attack with your battlefleetthe games economy is also overly simplified starbases produce officers a unit cap each starbase you control adds to your crew pool  a resource you will never find yourself running short of and dilithium moons provide the only demand resource
gameplay therefor has the same frustrating tendancy seen in starcraft victory is a function of who can gather the most dilithium the fastest and not a question of who can outwit thier opponentsthe scaling on the ships is also terribly off
a soveriegn is a fine powerful ship but it should not be able to singlehandedly eliminate three borg cubes and although i understand this was a balance issue i feel that it ultimately detracts from the games potentialthe next borg related quam i have here is the borg art
they have chosen to use a meshlike mass to represent the borg utilitarian look all wires and pipes and stuff showing on the surface but it rather just ends up looking like a big green or try pink as your player color thats really funny blob that is only reminiscent of a borg cubewhere this game shines and it does a little is in its singleplayer campaigns which have a decent set of storylines and some good voice talent
the federation campaign has the benefit of patrick stewart and micheal dorn stewart reprising locutus for the borg campaign and as a special surprise to those who were her fans denise crosby returns as the wily admiral sela to champion the romulan cause in a souped up dderidexoverall its not a bad game but given that armada  exists it pales and loses a lot of its appealmost star trek games turn out to be pretty useless they do release a multitude every year but armada is pretty good as a real time strategy gamethe graphics are really beautiful especially the cut scenes
you  can imagine what a quotfreescape quot version of star trek would be  like
however the game plays in d only unlike homeworld which is a bit  disappointing
the graphics can sometimes jerk quite easilythe control  mechanism is quite easy to get used to and makes it enjoyable to play
as  for the reported bugs ive downloaded the patch from activision and the  game is running without any problemsas a star trek game it also does  the business of creating the trek universe really well
theres speach from  picard and worf and others during the cut scenes between missions and all  the ships are painstakingly recreated in great detailif youre a star  trek fan and like rts then go ahead but there are better games out there in  this genre especially homeworldive spent the past couple of weeks playing this game and havemade it all the way to the romulan campaign
right now im fightinglike crazy to defeat the borg and every time i come close the game crashes on me
of course i could skip to the borg campaign but that would spoil everything wouldnt itgood game but only if it didnt bomb out on me
endits a good startrek d strategy game but i allways had a problem with it crashingthe game can be alot of fun to play if you have a decent machine lots of memory
i liked the graphics and the user interface but i wanted more control over my shipsfriends who own this game are always telling me about the bugs the game crashes at startup or when a cutscene is about to be shownstar trek games are for some reason notoriously awful
im not sure if  developers are intimidated by the fame of the series or if there simply  arent very many programmers who can handle the wing commander level many  of us gamers expect from a good space game
while armada is better than  most it still could be so much moreyes you can be one of four groups   the federation the klingons the romulans or the borg
each has its own  ships and bases and special abilities
the graphics are homeworldesque   very lovely with details on ships and other stellar objectsi grew up  loving star trek and it is neat to be able to manipulate the ships
however playing is like sliding miniatures around on a glass tabletop
where is the space aspect of this
scales are not always proper as they  slide from point a to point b you do traditional starcraft types of  operations  mine your dilithium build your base kick out fighting units  take out the enemy
instead of choosing an attack stance you choose the  redyellowgreen alertgetting into the game is extremely difficult for  new players
the manual itself is not very helpful and the commands are  not always intuitive
one of our test machines was a p which they  list as supported but the machine only ran at the lowest graphic setting  available choking constantly
even on faster systems the crash rate is  rather impressivei really really wanted to enjoy this as a strategy  game
my love of trek tried to get me to overlook some of the flaws
however no matter how gorgeous the ships themselves and the generated  midgame cinematics the ai is simply lacking and the gameplay itself is  nothing special when compared to other strategy games out thereif  youre a trek lover grab a copy to play with the ships
if youre a true  strategy player wait and hope that the next one that comes out resolves  some of these key issuesthis is a game that the star trek subgenre couldve used about two years ago but as it is now its too little too late
yes its more ahem engaging than your average star trek game but it does nothing to improve  upon the strategy genre as a whole
as such like most star trek games it  can only really be recommended for star trek fanshaving said that if  youre unfamiliar with the strategy genre you will find this to be an  enjoyable enough starting point
the graphics are great the sounds lush  the cinematics impressive and the vocal talent appropriately starfilled
for the novice to intermediate strategist the games ai and missions are  enough to occupy the senses as you get the idea of the genrebut as has  been remarked before if you have played strategy games before it feels  like youre merely playing a buggy version of age of empires in spacedespite having installed the first update patch the game still quits  unexpectedly
it also doesnt work very well at all with multiplemonitor  systems failing to stop mouse movement at the edge of the playing screen
in fact the whole mouse movement is awkward
after fiddling endlessly  with the mouse control option it seems to me that there is just some kind  of small programming flaw it doesnt scroll particularly smoothly  regardless of setting
its not that the flaw is enough to make the game  unplayable its just that its difficult sometimes to move with precision
which brings up another point  perspective
theres something about the  angle at which units and objects are placed that makes it difficult to see  as much of the playing field as you want at one time
theres so much  empty space in the game by definition that in order to see everything  you really need to be pulled back more than the game allowsstill  theres hope that much of this will be solved by additional patches
clearly theres enthusiasm for the product amongst the star trek community  and activision has already serviced this community with one patch
more  will undoubtedly be forthcoming and the game might well work itself into  stabilityof course the larger point is that starcraft and age of  empires ii among others are already stable challenging and popular  among multiplayer communities
many people will therefore think that it  might well be worth skipping this satisfactory game for one that truly  excelsif you can find a copy of this game going cheap by all means get it as its a great little shocker  but be prepared for some seriously lame graphics
and i do mean primitive
this was one of the earliest ps games and it shows which is a shame because the actual idea and concept are great
a crazed killer is on the loose with giant scissors and its up to you to unravel the mystery and find out who he is and what hes up tothere are plenty of good points to this game
one of them being that is really does present you with a mystery and if you dont follow the clues provided your investigation goes straight to a dead end and all your hard work ends up in a game over scene complete with credits that tells you that you have failed to solve the case
quite brutal in a way and daring even to treat the player so harshly
it happened to me and i had no choice but to begin again and this time try and make some more well informed choices when given the chance
once you get it right the game takes you on the full journey to the climax of the story which is well worth the effortso how is this story brought to lifewell with the dreaded words point and click
yes its sad but true the action in clock tower is completely mouse click operated which means that you will be moving a cursor arrow around on screen with your d pad and clicking the x button when its on hotspots to start action and make choices
for the whole game
be warned that if this sounds like something you have moved on from you might want to think twice
however then think a third time becausehey whaddya know it works
the exploration the combat in fact all character movements and interactions are  done by clicking somewhere on the screen and once you get the hang of it youre awayso lets get onto the gameplay
this is a game of fear and surprises
the villain of the piece scissorman can leap out at you at random points in the game and pursue you relentlessly until you either hide run far enough away or find something to stop him with
or get killed
combat such as you may be used to does not exist in clock tower but it really doesnt matter
if you make it through to the last level set in a sprawling castle youll have the gameplay mechanics well and truly in hand
its by no means easy though and towards the end youll still be in danger of blowing it all and getting one of the several endings other than the one good one if youre not super observant and quick wittedbut castles shock tactics and gruesome deaths alone do not make a game and as i mentioned youre going to have to work with truly dated graphics to play this baby
im not complaining after all were talking about the earliest days of the playstation here but i really must make it clear how primitive it looks  especially now that we have moved up to the sophistication of its ps third incarnation which allows full directional movement and  dimensional areas to run about inbut hey clock tower is the father of them all and it deserves its dues
checkout screen shots on the internet first if you can still find any so you know what youre in for and then brace yourself for an exciting dip into retro territory
and yes it will still make you jumpthere are a few dead ends in this game
thats funny if youve played it
what i mean is that you find yourself cornered by the madman scissorman and killed
however the point of the game is to evade the killer while picking up clues that will reveal his identity
is he just a sick human being
or is scissorman some supernatural evilsometimes the game will have you begging for a save point where you must successfully run from scissorman several times before you can escape or find helpoverall the game will probably satisfy people who enjoy thrillers and games like resident evil or fatal frame
it is a race to find the critical clues
however it is a cursormoving game
you do not have free threed movement as i thought you would
rather you use a cursor for movementits not that bad a gamethats pretty much the best way  describe it
this game isnt horrible but its playable
the levels are short the bosses are faily easy but the graphics are good for a bit and the sounds and music is good  though if you want a really good xmen game try xmen  clone wars for sega genesis
the graphics are good the music is amazing
and the gameplay is very good
this game is good but just not the best in the xmen universei bought this game  days before it was released back in the day for a whopping 
now you can get it used for  centsoh my
thats why im skipping this new generation of consoles entirelyi still get great joy from the xbox  and i do have a psp which is great for the nostalgic games that i loved growing up as a kid on the gothe quotresident evilquot gamesand perhaps all games in the quotsurvival horrorquot genreare about atmosphere
and in that regard quotresident evil quot delivers
the graphics wont wow a hardcore pc gamer nor will the sound although the music is effectively eerie
this game offers a some good shocks and goodifstilted cutscenes intermixed with some soso actionthe minuses are serious but not showstoppers
the graphics and sound effects show the limitations of the consoles they were designed forno quake iii here nor even blood  for that matter
resident evil  actually goes a good bit farther compensating for this by offering much higher resolutions
saving a game can only be done at a typewriter and only using a ribbon of which there are a limited number
i guess that means that if you havent played through the game by the time you used that last ribbon youre going to have a really long last session
save game limitations drive pc players nuts and is compounded herethe camera angles while usually quite effective in the atmosphere also make it em challenging to see what youre doing about a third of the time when youre zombie slayingthe only other major minus is the dubious pseudoadventure game puzzles
find this key find that key hook that wheel to that valve etc
its not as big a minus as it might seem because sometimes these slow periods lull you into a false sense of security and set you up for the next good shock
other times theyre just teidousoverall this game has won me over with its spooky atmosphere and ocassional shocks but i couldnt call it a classic unfortunately at least not this versionthis is not a bad review for max payne because max payne is not a bad game
it is however incredibly short and it leaves you feeling disappointed
i was excited to get this game because i had been playing grand theft auto  so i was definitely going through my shootemup phase
however it didnt take me long to become bored with it
in the end it maybe took me a week to complete and i didnt spend hours at a time playing it
when this happens you dont feel as though you got your moneys worth
sure max has some great features like the very matrixy bullettime feature that slows down time and allows you to dodge bullets
though very coollooking i found this feature very difficult to use and found myself dodging few if any bullets while in this mode
the graphics are great and the storyline is respectable enough in the beginning his wife and baby are murdered  who cant sympathize with that
but by the time i finished the game i didnt have that usual feeling of satisfaction
i wasnt sad that it was over
in fact i was a little relieved
im sorry to say it but i cant say i got my moneys worth
i will probably never play it again it will just sit on my shelf collection dust
but im giving it  stars because it is a fairly clever game it did present me with a few challenges and it was considered pc game of the year by numerous gaming magazines
i guess i can see why most people like it i was just expecting morethis game is a regular shooter with one great twist
the bullettime innovation is a great addition to the thirdpersonshooter genre
it allows your character to overcome odds that are stacked against you without body armor or superhuman powers
you take out bad guys in slow motion with your uzis or twin berettas watching bullets whiz past you while your shots find their home
the shots that miss hit the wall producing splinters or they hit bottles or mirrors shattering them to pieces
bullet time is the highlight of the game
it never gets oldbut thats where the greatness ends
the storyline is mediocre
you just mow down the bosses lackeys moving progressively on up the food chain until you kill the big boss at the end
the game has good action but it has nothing besides that
there is only one way to solve every problem and most rooms have only one exit
go to room a clear out the bad guys
go to room b clear out the bad guys etc etc etc
there is no stealth whatsoever in this game
the enemy ai has one setting  always awareworst of all this is one of the shortest games that i have ever played   hours tops
replayability is almost nonexistent
each time that you replay the game every item and enemy is in the same place
too bad that this game is making all of the game of the year lists
that means that all you have to do from now on is churn out hour games with nice graphics and you have a blockbuster on your handsmy recommendation
wait until this one comes out in a jewel casei had fun with this game and if thats all that matters then i would have given it a  star
unfortunately the game got old really fast for me
the locations are really contrived
i got bored with the places i went to and the enemies are so uninteresting
however i really enjoyed the bullet time feature and the way the game handled lighting
still everyone should check out the demo at leastmax payne is the title of the new third person shooter from remedy entertainment it is also the title of the lead character in this  hour epic of john woo proportions
i like many others have been following this games development ever since the incredible screenshots first started appearing on the web a few years ago
am i disappointed in the results
well lets review this bad boy and find outgraphicsremedy has been touting this game as  realism to the max
is this a true statement
yes and no
the graphics in some instances are light years ahead of previous titles while in others they seem to be on par or a little behind the competition
lets take an indepth look at the graphics in max payne to see just where it stands
one note i ran the game with all effects set to the maximum and i had acceptable frame ratesparticle system remedy has done a great job on the particle system
the fire and the snow are two standouts here
i know many games have implemented weather effects in the past but remedy seems to be the first to realize snow rarely falls in a straight path
the snow in max payne just like the real world falls in a angular descent
i know this doesnt sound like much but it definitely adds to the realism of the snow bound city you will be playing in for part of the game
next is the fire
the fire in this game is game is likewise very realistic
the fire definitely has a sense of volume to it i cant think of any other game that does this convincingly  and it generally behaves in the way you think it should
some of the other particle effects such as the water spray when you splash through sewers are not quite as impressive however
the particle system in some instances seems to be tied to a pretty robust physics engine which we will cover later in the review
for now particle system realism to the max
yesreflections and shadowsin a game that touts photorealism reflections and shadows seem to be conspicuously absent in the game
max payne like other games in the genre seems to have its fair share of bathrooms in the game
and just like its real world counterparts mirrors make up part of their interiors
however the mirrors in max payne reflect nothing zilch zero nada
the shadows in the game are of the blob type similar to tomb raider and its ilk
no projected shadows here
many other games have incorporated projected shadows of late and ill be honest i was kind of disappointed they werent included in this game
reflections and shadows realism to the max
notexturesreportedly remedy used a digital camera to capture all the textures in the game
does it show
yes my friend it does
the texture work in this game is the biggest leap the genre has taken in approaching photorealism by far
the title character seem to benefit the most from this technique but the levels and weapons seem to agree with this treatment as well
are you going to mistake the game characters and settings for the real thing 
no but it does do an incredible job of immersing you in the game
the shaders on the guns also have a nice chrome effect but they are kind of tiny and it really isnt that noticeable
textures realism to the max
yesphysicsi included the physics engine in the graphics portion of the review because it effects the aesthetics of the game more than the game play itself
like i noted previously in the review the particles system is tied to the physics engine
how does this impact the realism in the game you ask
well maybe you didnt ask but ill tell you anyway first when you fire a weapon shell casings realistically eject fall and bounce around just like you would expect
just dont stick around to watch them disappear as this kinda ruins the moment
take that same gun and fire a couple of rounds into any object in the game and the object will likewise be destroyed in an equally convincing manner
for instance glass shatters wine barrels  or grape juice barrels if you prefer start sporting a leak tiles shatter ala the matrix money flies around dry wall will now show a hole with plaster pouring out you get the picture
it was so cool to watch the physics in the game i would run around shooting anything and everything just to see what would happen next
physics realism to the max
yesanimation and modelslets tackle the animation first
the walk and run cycles seem to be a little unnatural
the knees and lower legs of the enemies seem to bend at odd angles and they look a little stiff to boot
another sore spot in the animation is maxs standard jump pitiful is a word that comes to mind
there is no anticipation of the jump or follow through in the jump cycle
its a straight up and down jump and very unnatural
facial animation is rather nonexistent in the game max seems to sport that same squinty eyed clint eastwood expression throughout the whole game
i do give remedy a hand they dont show the faces of the characters very often as they talk
this kind of hides the fact that their lips arent moving
on the other end of the spectrum the slowmotion dive and roll is definitely a winner
its very well done and convincingthe modeling of the characters is pretty well done
they arent exactly the most detailed models in the world but the texture work seems to put the details in anyway
the rest of the modeling seems to be adequate as well though the vehicles are rather blocky and unconvincing
animation and models realism to the max
some parts yes but as whole noarchitecture and level designthe team at remedy earned their paycheck in this department
the levels sport a very realistic look to them in every sense of the word
the office building in particular had me feeling like i was viewing an architectural walkthrough
the city streets are populated with shops and homes that looks like they were ripped straight out of a nyc tourism pamphlet
and the interiors of these buildings are packed full of attention to detail on a scale ive yet to see in a video game bar none
this is another area where the texture work paid big dividends
architecture and level design realism to the max
yeslightingremedy ads also say this game is the first to have real time radiosity lighting
what is radiosity
radiosity is basically very basic mind you a physically accurate method of calculating light whereby objects pick up some of the color from surrounding objects 
sounds pretty radical huh
well the results arent that radical
the only time i really noticed it is around the barrels of fire on the city street they cast a noticeable orange glow on the bricks of the building
i suppose the whole goal of radiosity lighting is so you dont notice it though
there are no garish weird color lights like unreal  purple
there is also a rather well done glow around neon lights
and as a whole the lighting is rather well done
the whole thing kind of screams subtlety screams subtlety
one other thing the lights do not seem to cast any shadows that move as you move
so uncheck realtime shadows
lighting realism to the max
a subtle yes with a shadowy nographics conclusionas a gamer i was pretty pleased at the graphics in this game
they do a convincing job of portraying a real world nyc
as someone who was expecting the new paradigm in d graphics i was a little disappointed in the lack of convincing shadows and reflections but impressed by the physics based particle system and photorealistic textures
if i was to give them a letter grade i would give them an agameplaybasicsok so now we know this is a purty game but how does it play
well think john woo meets the matrix meets charles bronson and you wont be far off
the game is played from a third person perspective like tomb raider rather than the first person perspective of your typical shooter eg
quake unreal etc
the camera and targeting problems normally associated with the third person perspective seem to be nonexistent
the game also has a pretty liberal save game feature allowing you to save the game at any time
the load times for each level are pretty average for a typical shooter   seconds or so but the subsequent reload from a quick save is instantaneous
storythe games starts off with your character  max payne at the top of a skyscraper surrounded by the nyc police department
he then goes on to explain how he ended up in this rather precarious predicament
so you flash back to a few years earlier when you as a nyc detective come home to find your family brutally murdered by some drug crazed maniacs
you then flash forward to a few days ago where you are working undercover in the dea to infiltrate the mob family behind the hit on your family
what follows is a series of double crosses and shootouts until the end of the game where you end up right where the whole thing started
each part of the story progresses through a series of comic book style cut scenes
the story and some of the dialogue are chock full of clicheacutes
but as a whole the story is rather wi added a review when i first got this game and as a previous gamer mentioned and i think he was right i gave this game  stars but i was still in my  hour honeymoon with the game
its a great game dont get me wrong just once you finish it it doesnt have that much replayability to it
you will probably end up putting it aside once you finish it  which only takes several hours
i suggest you should wait till it hits the bargain bin  like the previous gamer mentioned in his review and get a good online game they are the best
i recommend  operation flashpoint if you like stategic warefare games ww online will be a great game as soon as they get the bugs all out i would wait on that one for at least  months cause they charge ya  bucks now to play
fighter ace  at the gaming zone is a great fighter pilot game with a big online community as well for also  bucks a month but worth the 
i would keep an eye out for return to wolfienstien and alien vs 
predator  and medal of honor   allied assault
game on max payne is like an exaggerated version of a typical nobrains action movie
on one hand the heightened action the thrilling quotbullettimequot innovation and arsenal of weapons get your adrenalin pumping on the other incredibly bad stylistic choices prevented me from enjoying this game to the maxfirst the plusses
i am a big fan of john woos action movies and max paynes action gameplay evokes them very well
i had been suspicious of the quotbullettimequot technique before playing the game but it turned out to be pretty easy to use and yes it does look dead gorgeous
control of the character is pretty fluid and your control over your jumps feels quite snug
just the look of the surroundings and the characters ingame is great with beautiful lighting effects explosions and good detailand now on to the problemsfor a game that champions its stylistic conceits so vocally max payne fails disastrously in the area of aesthetics
true the explosions and gunfights look good though pretty damned violent but why oh why did they not bother to cast proper actors to play the characters
when the characters are just drawn in computer they look fine
but whenever they use photo captures such as during the dropdead boring quotgraphic novelquot sequences all the characters look like they are either played by people in the development team and their friends or they had found actors so bad so thoroughly incapable of dramatic expression that they look like people in a game development team
either way max payne features the worst acting ive ever seen even in video games and their image is equally atrocious  quotmonaquot looks like a twentysomething neighbour rather than a mob hitwoman and max himself looks so much the dolt that its a real drag playing as him
not to mention the fact that he cant shut up
the comicbook aspect of the games style is easily the worst idea they had
by translating comicbookstyle writing into direct voiceover max payne shows just how bad comicbook writing is as a whole
this stuff was never meant to be said out loud
of course the writers if you could call them that were so enamoured with every syllable they had written they used everything  serving to bog down the one element of this game that works which is the action
and the graphic novel parts look just ridiculous but take up about  of your gametime if you let them play out
comic books are very hard to take seriously and when you try to mix this style with the melodramatic deadserious style of the john woo movies this game emulates you have an absolute stylistic disaster
this was why when max encounters his dead baby and wife i actually burst out laughing
the terrible acting and writing served up in hong kong melodrama style entirely sabotaged any engagement i might have had in maxs situationthe two quotdrug sequencesquot were actually a pretty neat idea but they screwed it up by designing mazes and long arduous quotpuzzlesquot that would make your eyes glue up so unengaging and drawn out are they
this game is very weak on the puzzle front
where games like syphon filter and medal of honor keep you interested by making sure you always know what your objectives are at any given point in max payne its usually a matter of walking through the level and trying to useshoot everything in sight in a trialanderror attempt to find what the game developers want you to do next
sometimes you can find the right door but you have to wait for the pesky enemies to open it for you
and in terms of level design you end up having to go back to old places so often that its dropdead tiresomei enjoyed the action portions of this game immensely
but it seems to me this development team only succeeded in creating half a good game
if max payne were as quotgrittyquot as some reviewers called it and if they had bothered to hire real actors rather than cast everyone they know and if they had good writers who were dramatists rather than comicbook doodlers they probably wouldve had an absolute classic on their hands
as it is max payne is a technical breakthrough but its aesthetics are so twisted around that its impossible not to deride its shortcomings stars is pretty good for me as i have yet to give a game  stars and i would say max payne is maybe  and a half
i wont really go into the plot much of this game as its always the easiest info to come across
ill just give you my positives and my complaints that lead to my scorepositivea good storyi find video games woefully deficient in this regard normally and when people talk about good stories at best i think it is relative
i am still waiting for a great story but found mp to be one of the few reasonably solid ones
as a fan of cutscenes i thought i would miss them more than i did the story is told through quite good graphic novel panels
the ending in particular is notably satisfying with the gameplay integrating well and interestingly with the action itself to produce an actual mostly reasonable closed ending conclusion shockingly rare in computer games
you can save the game anytimelooks pretty nice for a dated game not beautiful but can be stylishgood gameplay balance and feel i liked the voice acting and characters film noir theme worked quite well i enjoyed the lack of monsters
interesting progression of improved weapons gameplay mechanics sound self adjusting difficulty levels a little bit of an odd concept but actually worked pretty well the game adjusts the difficulty level according to how youre doing i like my games a bit on the easier side of things and the level of challenge here was really pretty good for me
i had really only a couple notably frustrating times one a run through a burning building but ive had  worse
also i liked the length of this game
it is a common complaint that it was too short but i find very few games are actually anywhere good or interesting enough to hold my interest all the way through as they all end up as more of the same after awhile
 to  hours a guess i dont exactly recall is a very good length for a shooter and seemed just right for max payneyou might also enjoy that this game should work on even a pretty dated system today i found the game very stable with its patch and that you should be able to get it for dirt cheapnegativesthe extremely interesting bullet time feature while cool actually gives no advantage that i can tell
if anything it was a disadvantage mostly and youre better off just barging through or in they fix this in max payne  but do worse on other accountsthere are alot of locked doors as in hmm this door is locked ill try that one oh i tried that already
the gameplay is not notably diverse shooting navigating a bit of light puzzle solving
the gritty urban world is okay but not all that interesting to explore or anythingconclusion this is a very good meat and potatoes action adventure shooter
it will not blow you away but is pretty fun and as good as pretty much anything else in its genre taking into account its age which probably means less than most of us newest thing addicts are inclined to admit
i recommend itif u want a good shooter game get red faction
i have a good pc so i wanted to save  bucks buying this game for pc instead of ps
i thought it would be a good game
nope
since u cant use a controller for this stupid game i have to use the mouse and keyboard
when some attacks u from behind in ps u turn aronund and aim with the right analog which is extrememly easy and it always hits the spot
in this version u turn around with the arrows which are far away from the action buttons and u have to aim with the mouse which is extrememly sensitive
i beat the first  levels before realizing that i cant do this without a controller
rockstar could have done better like they did with gta which is the best gamed realms is one of my favorite companies because of duke nukem and shadow warrior so when i saw that they made max payne i immediatly drove to the store and picked up a copywhen i started max payne truth be told i was amazed at how slow the thing ran
i used to think that my pentium  was a good computer now in order to get the most out of max payne i need a gigahertz computer
sheesh
anyways after turning down some details i got the game running pretty smoothlythe details on the game are very polished and the locales in new york city are represented very realistically from the rundown slums to mob boss mansions
the storyline which is about a renegade cop whose entire family was murdered is represented by what looks like watercolored comic strip panels and it adds a nice touch to the game
the storyline is also one of the best ive seen in a shooter game next to halflife
the quotdreamquot levels which occur when max payne is knocked unconscious by whatever are also quite disturbing
the innovative feature that will probably be the best in the game though is something called quotbullet timequot  in bullet time everything is slowed down but you can aim the gun in realtime very much like the popular movie quotthe matrixquot  this is a very cool feature
sometimes when you blast away the last person in the room it will zoom to him and show him falling slowly to the ground
and of course when you use the sniper rifle it zooms to the bullets point of view
very coolunfortunately now we get to the negative parts of the game
first of all as i said before you need a machine with some serious horsepower to get the most out of max payne
dont even bother with this game unless you have at least a pentium  processor with a mb video card and mb ram
the second thing that considerably dampened my experience was sound issues
i have a sblive
value sound card and for some reason the sound was very faint unless i turned my back to the source of the sound then the sounds came in clear
wierd and very annoying when the shotgun goes piff
the third and most annoying thing about max payne was the difficulty level
the game sports a features that makes it so the difficulty changes according to your skill
for instance when you first start the game it takes a few hits from the handgun to kill anything and if they hit you you take a little bit of damage
thats okay but max paynes idea of changing difficulty is making it so the enemies take more hits to kill and you take less hits to kill so by the time you reach the end of the first act it takes two maybe even three direct shotgun blasts to kill anything and all they need is to get two maybe even one good shot off of you to kill you and headshots dont count by the way
it still took me two shotgun blasts to do the job
didnt this crap go out with goldeneye for the n
it is flatout rediculous in crowded enclosed rooms especially  one at the end of act one with enemies continually pouring out of alcoves in the wall
and the end boss of the act took about five shotgun blasts and he still managed to kill me
bullettime became useless because the enemies still hit me even in the middle of a sideways leap
even after all of the dying on act one the game did not let up on the difficulty
i got so frustrated at the game i nearly threw it out the window
the only other software that did that was messiah and guess what
they also had an innovative feature just like max payne did
and if you beat the game it opens up even harder features
my godoverall i found max payne to be graphically superior to many other games and the bullettime feature is excellent along with the storyline
but unfortunately the overwhelming difficulty level and the really high system requirements only earns it three stars in my bookoriginally i felt reluctant to compare max payne to deus ex as the latter is such a superlative game as to make the comparison somewhat unfair
 i offer this observation max payne suffers greatly in comparison to deus ex which is very much the better gamein fact im surprised at the predominance of very positive reviews for max payne
i offer here a brief list of the games primary shortcommingsfirst of all the interactivity of the game is virtually nonexistant
whereas the environments in deus ex were absorbing and interesting environments to examine and explore the environments in max payne are just backgrounds offering little more than wrapping for a simple fixed game path
see those boxes over there
that desk
forget about them
theres nothing in them
keep moving along and stop wasting time
actually sometimes a certain type of wooden crate will have an item in it
yay
where are the choices in max payne
the answer is that there simply are none
deus ex gives one so many choices that one gets lost playing with the game seeing what is possible
exploring the game becomes more important than the game itself
in max payne there might as well be a bright yellow line on the floor because thats where youre going like it or noteven within the limited scope of the game play becomes quickly repetitive
one quickly catches on to how things will go down around this corner and the next and the next and so onthe ai
sucks even more fun out of the game
the characters go from completely clueless to completely omniscient the moment you cross the boundary into their space
one second they are oblivious to your presence but as soon as that hand grenade leaves your grasp its hey its max payne
get him
the software itself is fairly flakey which gave a bad impression almost immediately
installation became entirely about what i had to do to get the game to run correctly
i dont like jumping through hoops to get a  game to run
even after i satisfied all the requirements stopping the game from crashing on exit still requires a workaround involving turning of the voice modemill stop beating the dead horse and mention some positives now
there are several interesting things about the game among which is the bullet time feature you have no doubt heard of
its a great idea
back to negatives it never feels like youre able to fully integrate it into your game play
there are also some very interesting levels involving dream sequences hullucinations and the like
the graphic novel aspect was also interesting
finally the graphics were very nice and the slomo cut sequences at the end of the battles were pretty cool as well
although they added to the predictability of the game
overall the game did not live up to my expectations but it was good enough to keep me punching in to see what the ending was like
it was like the beginning and the middle
in hindsight i should have played deus ex a third time instead of buying max payneit has a bold look to it but i thought the characters where not very interesting and had to force myself to finish the gameif you are a pc gamer that does not enjoy linear games i would not recommend this title
in other words this is a game that involves little decision making and depends on a storyline to keep you hooked from chapter to chapter
the storyline is a comic book tale about a cop become a vigilante to combat the evil drug dealers
the inbetween segments are even displayed as comic book panels and the main character max payne has a load of corny metaphors to go with every chaptersome of the creative features put into this game stand out at first
perhaps the most impressive feature is the bullet time option that allows you to slow down time and gun down your enemies in a dramatic fashion
if youve seen quotthe matrixquot bullet time is the exact same thing in that movie
its new and interesting at first but not entertaining enough to keep you captivated throughout the gameno problem solving is required in this game
the chapters are shoot em up segments from one to the next
even extra ammunition and health capsules are easy to find as you only need to open up a cabinet shelf etc
to find them
the game allows you to interact with your environment by turning on faucets blowing up television screens and other aspects that are entertaining at first but really have no point other than to quotoooh and awequot youif you shy away from violence or have kids to watch out for this game is not recommended
the beginning sequence of the game shows max payne examining his murdered infant which i have to say was one of the few moments i thought a pc game overdid the violence in a game
some of the subbosses are slowed down and zoomed into as they are killed and falling to the ground
i think critics of media violence often miss the point and are hypocritical but i have to say that this is one game that i could see justifiable reaction to the violence portrayedan added bonus to this game is an online community that has created mods skins and other programs to enhance your gaming experience with max payne
mods are alterations to the game that add extra levels villains etc
ive seen standalone games with much more to offer in the mod department but the game does support it
there is an online demo available that allows you to play the first part of the game
keep in mind that most of the game follows the same format as the demo which will allow you to decide if youd like to purchase the game
in my opinion its a game that is fun for younger players but is boring for the older pc gaming audience
there are some unique gameplay aspects in max payne but not enough to make it worthwhile until the price dropsmax payne has been dubbed as revolutionary and innovative by video game critics and fans alike but guess what
its neither
when i first played this game i was drawn in by the graphics which is one of the few things i like about this game
the story is pretty confusing and uninteresting and was illustrated in a hardontheeyes comicbook style where it was layed out in frames and word bubbles and drawn in an unusual fashion
the main drawback of this game is how repetitive it gets
this is the general flow of this gamego into a room
do some bullet time
kill some guys
repeatmaybe a cutsceneboring
yep
repetitive
yep
revolutionary
nope
i barely got halfway through the game before getting tired of the grind of max payne but i heard jumping off the twin towers and trying to hit parked cars is fun but i never got that far into the game
if you like firstperson shooters stick with halflife or battlefield  or even halo
this game is overrated as hell and bored me to tears
go home max paynedoom is a killer gameunfortunatly after the coming of games like  duke nukem d quake and unreal doom seems a little uhhh old
not to  say it isnt fun
this game is hours of entertainment its just that after  being able to jump have more debris carnage and voices in newer games  it leaves quotdoomquot in the dust
if youve never played this game  ie
youve been in a coma its probably one of the best youll ever  come across doom is addictive its just that the standard for this type  of game has been so very much improvedi like this game overall but as you can see by the other reviews it does have its flaws
what i liked about the game is just the mere fact that it is rather time consuming
you dont just put it in and win
you have to think and manage your planets carefully
the quotnormalquot skill level is just way to hard to be quotnormalquot
i havent even wanted to try to play it under quothardquot
why bother when i cant even beat it under normali myself havent had any problems with memory
but i cant see a lot of the text when the starfield is on
this makes it hard to use the quick research function
the text is there just cant read it
and its not that i have a slow system its a brand new i also think this game is very much like master of orion just not as good
well maybe they will come out with another version of master of orion for usthis is potentially the greatest space opera game to come along in years
it is depressing that this potential is lost
first expect to find sound conflicts with the game
the game will lock up your pc or dump out of the  game during periods that you acess the games personal communications  device
no no option to avoid going there so expet to get dumped about  every  minutes of game play
but this glich is based on your systems  hardware so maybe you wont have that problem
next you will find a  game that bases interaction on diplomacy and spying without adequate  instructions on how they play against one another
worse yet expect  diplomacy not to work at all
the diplomacy function is extremely  frustrating as you seem incapable of generating anything from the other  races except a declaration of war which they do as soon as they have more  ships than you
you will also be frustrated in your inablitiy to  manufacture ships while the computer players just build them out the  whazoo
you will also be frustrated in the need to micromanage all tanks  during any invasions
you have  tanks
so what
 unless you give   indivdiual orders they blunder around the map and get shot up piece meal
forget about giving group orders
with all the negative said this game has  a great concept great music fantastic cutscenes fun space battles and  a flawless intergration of real timeturn based concepts
this is a buyer  beware item
if you love moo you will find this game acceptable if you  dont know what moo is stay away frustration aheadthis game is really creative
but there is no ingame saveand if you diewell you have to start from the begining of the level
and theres no check points eitherthe graphics are really good
almost any platform is compattable and yes it does work on vista dthe music is kinda corny but it suites the gamethe story is really creative you get to play three different characters each with a different storythe gameplay is rather hard i mean its kinda hard to get used to the controls and when you kinda get the hang of it you switch characters and that character has completely different controlsthe replay value is goodas far as i can tell i mean i must have replayed every level like  timesbecause there is no
ingame save
by the way very annoyingif you like actionscifi gamesyou will love this game but bewareyou might hate it because it has a few bugs but just minor oneswell except this one that makes the game crash no matter what you do and to fix it you have to start from the very beginning againanyway its a good gamebut it can get boringi thought the game was ok but it could have been alot better there should have more variety in weapons infinite credits  the graphics could have been more realisticthis game has some things that i liked about it the snes version is more closely related to the arcade version than the sega genesis  the color is alot sharpen  its more difficult to finish than the genesis version the sega genesis version is much easier to finish  alos you can pick up an extra coin which gives you an extra continue the snes doesnt do that  when you play the level with the red truck its much harder to finish for the snesin the tradition of warcraft and age of empires comes force commander
you get the chance to control a fleet to do ground battle against mainly the rebels
while this all sounds exciting the controls and interface are not easy to master right away
the d graphics make the game harder to view rather than being an enhancement
if it were easy to control and view this would be one of the best rts games
stick with age of empirerisk has always been a great classic game and thought its been quite some time since i sat down to play the board game and being that i just picked up the lord of the rings edition of the risk board game i needed practice and i figured i would give risk ii a tryrisk ii is definitely fun
you can play alone using computer ai to fill in where the other players would be making for some great practice for when you play with your friends
there are many different ai opponents to choose from and presumably these different opponents use different strategies when you play against themthere is a simultaneous battle mode that has you coordinating attacks at the same time that your opponents are
it is easier to play with computer ai since with human opponents it tends to take a while or the game ends up ending in  minutes
however it is a very interesting way to play risk and i enjoy it
there are multiple options to choose from such as setting the number of batallions you receive for controlling continents how many territories are openfor example hawaii and some outlying islands are often closed but may be set as territories and how territories are distributed at the start of the gamebattles are animated which is a nice touch and the graphics while nothing impressive are nice enough to look at for a while
i give the game only  stars however because of the ai issues
sometimes the ai opponents can be just absolutely stupid barely putting up any challenge whatsoever
but being that you are playing against a computer it seems that the computer is prone to cheatingor at least having just a wee bit too much luck with the roll of the dice
to this day i will never know how my invasion force of  batallions lost to a defender force of only  defending batallions
its things like that which kind of diminish the fun in the game because for any player ai or not to have that much luck when theyre the last territory in the game is for lack of a better word completely unprecedentedregardless the game is fun to play and is of course always more fun when you have more than one person playing it
the computer ai serves as great practice and if youre just looking to waste time and overall the game is a fine single player experience even if the ai just happens to have unrealistic amounts of luck
i recommend this game to any risk fan as it should keep you entertained for hours on end
im already hooked though when it comes to competing with other people i prefer the board game
the ai just fluctuates too much between being stupid and skillful often going to extremes in both casespacman was a very different odd game but a very enjoyable pacman game and this game he has legs and arms and must go around and sloving peoples promblems if you have an open mine why not buy this gamethe following refers to the downloadable version of tetris available for the dsds systementertaining players young and old for more than  years tetris can be found on virtually any platform
and yet this iteration holds a special place in the hearts and minds of many and remains a personal favorite of creator alexey pajitnov
released with game boy in  tetris challenged public perceptions of gaming by challenging everyone to arrange falling blocks into horizontal lines that disappear
one could say that this was our first casual video gamebut for the all the history surrounding tetris along with its estimated effects on the human brain nostalgia has its limits
to its credit the  singleplayer modes still provide an infuriating challenge and even reward the player with a cute space shuttle launch and as with most virtual console titles you have the option to alter the image to resemble game boys green tinted screen
but without a friend with hisher own copy of tetris handy it literally doesnt get any better than that
such is especially true since the multiplayer mode is absent on the vc version
still nothing beats racking up a new high score while in line on the bus in the elevator or even in the bathroomthis game is unratedyou play as wario and this is a typical platform game
jump on platform jump on enemies some of themto make things interesting you collect coins and treasure there is hidden treasure in this game and you need to complete certain areas then go back and find the treasureyou need  coins to open the last door on every course the rest of the money you can spend on  different minigamesthe first one is simply luck you pick a bucket that you think contains a bag of cash
if you get right you double coins if you pick the wrong bucket you loose half the coinsthe other minigame you need at least  coins you throw bombs at enemies time their speed of movement with how hard you throw the bombdepending how many you hit and how much you paid to play there are three levels you get different pricesthe rest of the money goes into warios treasure vault rather screenthe graphic and the music are really good for gameboythere are powerup hats for wario to weara viking hat that enable you to butt the ground so enemies fall over and crush blocksdragonhat that breaths firea jethat that enables you to fly forward a certain distanceand just the regular hat so you can become regular wario instead of miniwario which you become if hit by a monsterthe game automatically saves itself so you just turn the game off when you feel like itmy biggest issue with this game is how bad wario moves at timesin the beginning he feels a little slow and clumsynear the end especially when fighting bosses you get irritatedwario mostly died in the game because he jumped to short or he moved to slowi mean the guy walks snailspeedand most of the bosses are very quick so even if you jump wario is so slow he dosent get halfway up in the air gets hit and diesand other time he lands so slow after jumping he lands in the faces of the monster and diestalk about annoyingthe last boss just feels helpless trying to have wario save the day you are supposed to climb up on clouds and hit the boss head but wario is so slow the clouds fly away before he can jump up on themhe also dogdes the boss attacks badly like mentioned previously if he manages to get away from one attack he usually end up landing badly on a monster and dies anywaya few months ago i picked up a copy of donkey kong land iii at a local game store and had a pretty enjoyable time making my way through the game
because the titles that make up the gameboy land trilogy are so inexpensive these days  and given that im much more taken with retro games than current ones  i wanted to make an effort to try out the other games in the series
long story short this is another solid game to add to any gameboy collection but unlike land iii the original game isnt quite as smooth in what it offersone of donkey kong lands greatest strengths is while it contains the same gameplay as the super nintendo games the level design is not directly ripped from those titles
this might seem like an odd thing to champion and you really need to play the rather disappointing donkey kong land  as a point of comparison to know why im stating this but this makes the proceedings feel fresher than they would otherwise be
the importance of this comes into play late in the game when the player enters the final world the city levels which is unlike anything in the snes trilogy
ironically this is where the game almost falls apart
these levels are home to a rather significant difficulty spike and while its kind of welcome since the donkey kong country on the super nintendo is ridiculously easy it puts an obvious strain on the experience
additionally the controls and character physics in donkey kong land take some time to get use to
donkey kong and diddy dont handle exactly like they do on the super nintendo
jumps are much more floaty in this version and the kongs move through the water with much less resistance
this will definitely throw players off at first but thankfully they will adjust and be able to compensate very quicklyhowever beyond that there really isnt anything else that holds donkey kong land back
the game is an inexpensive and is easy to come by since the land series games were produced in a pretty robust quantity and become part of nintendos player choice lineup
the only thing that really hurts donkey kong land and its sequels is the fact the original snes games were ported the gameboy advance a few years later which most players will probably opt for over these
still i think the land trilogy is worth picking up despite the issues that hold it backdonkey kong land is a fairly fun game with lots of unique levels to it
unlike the others in the donkey kong land series the levels in the game are not related to the original
they range from sky levels to city levels
feels much more different than traditional donkey kong gamesthe controls is my biggest gripe with this game
in every donkey kong game if you press the attack button they character attacks and if you hold it you begin to run fast
it gives you a running start basically
well not in this game
if you press the attack button to get a fast start to jump over something you will actually slow down almost to a stop after the attack before you can begin to run
if you jump after an attack you will only go a few inches and fall
to jump far you need to already have had the run button held so you wont attack firstthat isnt the only problem though because whenever you jump if feels as if some invisible weights are tied to your character
your character gets pulled down when they jump instead of falling
the jumping in this game is horrible and makes any jump a challenge but the worst is in the sky levelthe secrets in this game are easy to find for the most part
all you have to do is find the bonuses and kong letters
i only ever got stuck on two levels looking for the secrets
everything being in one color doesnt help finding them any easieroverall the game is a little fun but the controls are frustrating
it goes against everything youve learned from the donkey kong series and makes the game difficult in some levels
the game is short and only took me about  hours to complete  but for what it is it isnt too bad but i would not recommend ittheres something in particular about donkey kong land  that really bugs me
it honestly bugs me to the point that i have to take off  whole stars from the overall ratingdespite the fact that the gameplay is extremely fun it doesnt change the fact that despite some really small changes here and there dkl is basically the same exact game as donkey kong country  for the super nes
its truefor those of you who are quite experienced with dkc just look at the map when the game begins and explore some of the levels
youre actually playing the same game as dkc
youll realize this very quicklythis is a problem to me
oh sure if you love donkey kong country  and would like to play the same game while traveling somewhere with your game boy this game will do the job just finehey this is still a really fun platform game in every single aspect
no one can deny that
its just that you absolutely do not need this game if you own and enjoy donkey kong country   its not necessary at all to own this gamethis is the biggest difference of all compared to the first donkey kong land game
when that game was being made the developers took the successful formula of donkey kong country and actually took the time to develop completely different levels for the game boy incarnation so the whole game felt like you were playing a bunch of additional levels that could have very well fit into the first donkey kong country game
 of the levels felt completely different from anything in dkcdkl however is clearly ripping off the same exact levels as the ones from donkey kong country  so while its not a horrible game by any means its just a completely pointless one unless of course like i said above you are going on a long car ride somewhere and really feel the need to play the same game in handheld formoh and on a side note theres also another problem with dkl
lack of detail
no im not talking about the background environments
those are just fine
im talking about an overall lack of detail concerning the variety of bananas coins and enemies that you collect in each and every level
too much pointless running forward with not enough enemy pouncing or item collecting makes a good portion of this game a chore to go throughstill i dont hate this game or anything
its just a pointless game to me
pick up the first donkey kong land insteadits not often that one comes across a game like donkey kong land  a game where the inefficiencies within are so obviously apparent that it simply boggles the mind
of course before i get into whats really wrong with donkey kong land  i should probably admit that i played through the gameboy trilogy in a rather strange order iii original and then  but in hindsight i cant help but think this is part of the reason i was able to see through donkey kong land s false facade and see it for the flawed creation that it isso whats wrong with donkey kong land 
well it actually quite simple
unlike the original donkey kong land which featured new original levels land  tries to emulate the snes original as closely as possible
the levels arent deadon recreations but they are close so close that this game doesnt really have an identity
now i know some people will find such a statement ironic given that the gameplay makes the experience here far from original but with land  trying its hardest to emulate donkey kong country  you cant help but reflect on that game when playing this one and well you have to admit that diddys kong quest is  a great game and  vastly superior to this game when it comes to its nonsuperficial aspects
thats pretty damning on its own but once you throw in the slightly squirrely controls and the lackluster sound programming seriously the fact that certain pieces of music fail to play in the appropriate levels is strangely offputting the experience just starts to cave in on itselfof course this doesnt mean you cant enjoy donkey kong land  but as a game it left a lot less of an impact on me than land iii or the original
it is a real shame that such a low point falls in the middle of the trilogy and not at the beginning or end as most people will probably agree its easier to justify a weak start or finish
however i guess i cant criticize the game too much as i can think of a small handful of great trilogies that were somewhat tainted by an underperforming game
ninja gaiden iii on the nintendo xenosaga ii on the playstation  the list goes on
still when it comes to the donkey kong land series i dont have a doubt that donkey kong land  is the odd man outcapcom was one of the ness biggest supporters and at the time they had a lot of success with their mega man franchise
after releasing three games for the nes they decided to release mega man games on the game boy
their first one mega man dr wilys revenge was released in  to critical acclaim and success
finally the blue bomber made his debut on nintendos portable system and while it blended elements from the nes games it had its share of flaws that kept it from being as good as it could have beenmega man dr wilys revenge takes elements from mega man and mega man  while adding new music alternate stage layouts a new enemy robot and featuring dr wily
once again mega man must stop dr wily from taking over the world
you choose any one from the four stages available and each one has a robot master at the end waiting to take you out from the nes mega man game
shoot all the enemies avoid the traps and defeat each robot master to acquire their special weapons
once you complete all four stages you must complete two more one of them features a new robot master to defeat while the other had you face off against four more robot masters from the nes mega man  game
only after beating all of these robots that you must defeat dr wily
the game offers a password after you beat the four stages in the beginning so you can continue from where you left off later onthe pros the game plays like the nes versions so anyone who is familiar with those games will feel right at home here
the graphics were good for its time controls are good and the music were different versions that you heard from the nes mega man game
the game featured robots from mega man and mega man  but had different attack patterns so you had to adjust your shooting skills accordingly
this game was also very hard so it will challenge anyone looking to play the gamethe cons the game was hard but not only because the difficulty level was set high
the stage layouts didnt offer a lot of room for mistakes and they demanded precise jumping and accurate shooting
avoiding enemies and bullets was next to near impossible so it was a matter of in depth memorization and some luck if you made it through
i died a lot of times and most other players had done the same
its also very short as the entire game had  stages compared to  stages for mega man and  stages for mega man future game boy renditions fared out better than mega man dr wilys revenge but as the first game boy title it did a decent job
it provided a portable mega man game featured elements from the nes versions while offering different stage layouts alternate music tracks and a new robot master exclusive to the game boy game
it was terribly hard not because it was really difficult but because you had to have perfect platform and shooting skills
if youre looking to play this game be warned of the flaws and if you can get past them then you might just enjoy it
it was just recently released on the nintendo eshop for the ds as a virtual console title so thats the best way to experience this game immediatelylove it or hate it mega man games grow like leaves on trees
given the vast amount of success mega man enjoyed during the early years of the nes it was only natural that some version of the game would end up on nintendos portable gray brick
mega man drwilys revenge known as rockman world in japan would mark the beginning of yet another series of titles for the blue bomber one of the first capcom would outsource rather than develop internallygiven that this title is often referred to as mega man given the lack of subtitle on the title screen the first thing most people do is compare this to the  original
this makes since the game borrows from that game presenting four of its six robot masters
while cut man elec man ice man and fire man reappear in all their glory everything else is new or rather a mix of things from mega man and mega man ii
for example while elec mans level will remind one of the area they played through on the nes its crossed with elements that were used air mans level in mega man ii
its an interesting hybrid to be sure but the allure can be cut short facing your first robot master without the aid of the correct weaponannoying as that is things get back on track pretty quickly
the damage incurred from robot master weapons and enemies is much more balanced in this rendition so you wont get blown away as quickly
unfortunately trouble again rears its ugly head during the games concluding levels
while the first wily level can be tough with its five concluding battles nothing compares to the last
i love a challenge as much as the next guy but the final level is too big for it britches and throws everything it can at the player
as one can imagine this puts quite the damper on the proceedings but there are other areas of the game that help make up for it like the excellent soundtrack
seriously i cant be the only one who blares cut man and fire mans theme from the back of my car can iregardless of my weakness for delectable bit chiptunes mega man drwilys revenge stands as a solid portable take of the mega man we all know and love
i wish the concluding levels of the game were a little more forgiving than they currently are but i can think of games that are guilty of far more
still take the above a grain of salt because the game is definitely capable of making one grind their teeth no matter how one sugarcoats itkiller instinct is a  on  arcade style fighting game made by one of the best game companies at the time rare
i always loved the arcade game but never really got into the super nintendo version
it has all the characters from the arcade version fulgore black orchid tj combo cinder glacius sabrewolf chief thunder spinal and spinal
each of the characters have their own special moves and fighting styles
the game features combos that test your skills
the combos really feek like a scoring system and not just a way to damage your opponent
there are fatalities or finishers and humiliations that you can pull off at the end of a fight
the game looks good with the digitized d graphics but it feels sub par compared to the arcadethe music was always a standout for this game for getting you pumped to play or fight
it is so good that i even have the soundtrack to ittheres nothing wrong with the game but it feels sub par compared to mortal kombat games at the time
of course this was the first in a franchise while mortal kombat was already  games in
killer instinct just feels like its missing something that street fighter  and mortal kombat had
its got the great music and great combos
maybe it just came out too little too lateeverone knows that nintendo is not quite known for creating fighting games
the company is known for its signature super mario donkey kong zelda and metroid games
however nintendo teamed up with rare to create a fighting game which used a technology similar to their hit  game donkey kong country
the result was the arcade fighter killer instinct
the snes version was releasd in the story behind the game as with most fighting games is quite lame
an organisation called quotultratechquot is pitting various fighters against each other for its own ulterior motives
there are ten fighters which are thunder cinder glacius fulgore jago orchid riptor sabrewulf spinal and tj combo
the characters themselves show a fair amount of variation from the ninjaish jago to the robotic fulgore to the dinosaur riptor to the red indian chief thunder
the boss is eyedol
the game offers a vast amount of moves for each character including special moves secret quotcombobreakersquot ultra combos finishing moves humiliations a bit like mortal kombats quotfriendshipsquot stage fatalities and more
what killer instinct is really known for are the combos
depending on the number of hits they range from quottriplequot to quotblasterquot to quotmonsterquot to quotultraquot despite all this variation i only enjoyed a few characters like jago combo cinder and thunderjust as in the donkey kong country games the graphics are amazing
the backgrounds range from medieval castles to rooftops to factories to canyons
the fighters have fluid animation flashy moves and various coloured outfits to choose from
the sound effects are not bad but some characters make weird noises for example cinder glacius and riptor
the music is extremely well done
each background has music which matches its atmosphere
i loved jagos stage back then a bit like ryus from street fighter ii
the game controls quite well but some attacks are unavoidable and quite often youll get beaten up by some cheap move despite how strategic you get
the game balance is also a bit off
if you want to win choose combo jago or fulgore
if you want to lose pick sabrewulf riptor or spinal
ironically the computer controlled spinal provides a good challenge
eyedol is also a worthy opposition but like i said above if you make a single wrong move somewhere you may end up getting beaten up continuously until you dieoverall however for a company thats been making sidescrolling action games and adventure games killer instinct is a surprisingly good effort in the fighting game department
if you want a really solid game for your snes with great graphics and music that will provide hours of fun and amusement killer instinct is for youi bought this for nostalgia i also really wanted to play it but i found it to difficult
maybe im too old for video games or im just really bad at themfzero was the original mode racing game for the super nintendo
scrolling background layers give the illusion of a d track and you pilot one of four vehicles across multiple coursesthe games lost quite a bit of shine mostly because super mario kart took everything nintendo learned from this experience and improved on it including adding a twoplayer mode
pop this cartridge in and its easy to see how this game was revolutionary back in the day but now the backgrounds are bland and flat and the races seem rather slow
the trademark fzero music is still intact howevera decent game for collection purposes but the gba versions feel superior not to mention the d nintendo  and gamecube sequelsf zero appears to have had one purpose to demonstrate the mode  graphical capabilities of the super nes
great nintendo mission accomplished
i can definitely tell that is a game of the snes based on the outdated  graphics
now what else does the game offer to a collector like me
soundtrack
it is pretty good
controls
they are a total tragedy
content
you get to choose from  cars and like  tracks
not very much dont you think
what about the level of classic it is
i believe the super nes had three launch titles pilotwings mario world and then this
mario world obviously stole the show pilotwings was a hit and f zero i believe it got little attention outside of the graphics
seriously buy it if you like but you should save your money and get one of the other launch titleswell well this was the first fzero game ever
unfortunately i didnt like this one very much so i didnt play the other ones fzero gx fzero x
why didnt i like this game
well its a pretty simple gamegraphics arent good the background is terrible
the race itself its not funny so its not fun like in super mario kart
the game i believe was a very fast racing game when it was released
but now with the release of its sequel fzero gx for gcn it doesnt look like youre riding a fast veichle but looks like youre riding a turtle because it gets really slow
there are some cars to choose some racing circuits the soundtrack is cool but i prefer super mario karts too
since it has no multiplayer mode sooner or later youll get sad of this game
buy super mario kart instead if you want a good racing game for your snesi mean what nintendo gamefreak doesnt
ive grown up with his games and continue to support nintendo however i will start to write this reviewbeware i will be brutally honest about this game
super mario kart as you should know is marios debut in a racing game
he along with peach luigi yoshi dk jr bowser koopa and toad will race to the finish linethis game is very fun if you are playing with another player say for instance in battle
i honestly found that to be the most fun part of the game
however being me note i dont have the game ive played it several times though i usually am stuck playing a game by myself because my little bro doesnt play with me and my older bro usually doesnt have any taste whatsoever in gaming like i do
it is too bad but thats life
sorry about giving you a little too much backround but i indeed had a point
that point is playing alone is fun too but the cpu ai is quite unbelievable and may leave you trying over and over to beat the star cup if you can even get there or wanting to break the damn gameoverall its an approachable game but i warn you now if you are looking for a easier racing game dont bother with this oneboy was super mario kart a popular game back in the day
mario is now racing
along with all his friends
was the thing people were saying to each other in my middle school
of course the sega fans werent saying that they could care less about the game or anything to do with nintendo and all of nintendos fanslets move forward to the year   is it still a good game
yes but in my opinion only on player mode
i think the player battle mode where you defeat your opponent by hitting them with turtle shells is quite fun and the main reason to own the gamethe thing is i dont see any of my high school friends anymore
im all alone now so none of those friends come over anymore to play the battle mode with me
im forced to play the game by myself and as a player game super mario kart just isnt very good
too many awesome racing games have come along since super mario kart including the newer super mario kart on the gamecube which i havent played but i can only assume is much better on player mode
what im trying to say is that the player options dont really have anything interesting about themhowever super mario kart was pretty fun when i was younger
and you know it probably remains a total blast to play on player
but if you have no one to play the game with you better not get itsuper mario kart is a good game the first to use iconic characters
the issue is that the controls and dated d make the game kind of hard to operate
it was hard to turn corners with a dpad so i used a joystick on the wiis classic controller
it was just as hard
the camera stayed right behind the kart and never shifted making it even harder
the good news is that if you have mario kart ds wii or  they have updated some of the snes tracksi realize this game was released in  which happens to be the year i was most interested in video games and specifically super nes games
i was addicted to the super nes and probably played the darn thing every single day for the entire year
i knew at the time that games like zelda link to the past were considered classics and most people had that game and enjoyed it though i can remember a few people who said they hated it which is their opinion and theyre entitled to it
back then i also knew that zelda was not only an improvement over the original legend of zelda on the nes but also an influence on many many rpgs that the super nes would soon have plenty of and eventually be looked upon as the ultimate video game system when it came to rpgsunfortunately i never gave much notice to many of the rpgs back then and instead i focused on mario metroid and the donkey kong country series
for the most part you can say i was more interested in platform games
back then i figured i have zelda i dont need anymore similar type games
well i admit i was wrong when i thought zelda was the only good rpg on the super nes but in some cases such as with illusion of gaia i see that some games were clearly inferior to zelda despite the fact that popular gaming magazines back in  praised illusion of gaia for being just as good as zelda
now ive only just experienced illusion of gaia for the first time a week ago which would be in the middle of january   i missed out on this game in   it was probably best to leave it that wayright off the bat im bothered by the life bar for your main character
you have a series of blue dots that serve as your life and these dots are basically the same thing as your heart life bar from the zelda series and your main character goes around smacking enemies with his sword just like link
okay its not a sword its a flute
same thing really
but the game as a whole does leave you wondering if the game company enix was trying to fool gamers into thinking this was something new and refreshing
years later you can tell illusion of gaia is not so fresh and in fact it has a strong dated feeling attached to it i think
people knew zelda was the better game back then and they still do to this day
you cant fool gamers
some of the animation in illusion of gaia isnt quite up to the standard of other games at the time
for instance the way your main character will runs around flapping his arms and the way he slides into enemies
it looks clunky and uninspiring
the graphics in illusion of gaia while colorful detailed and big doesnt really have that extra something that makes zelda link to the past look so appealing
it doesnt have that certain spark or polished graphics
enix probably thought they created something special with this game but it hasnt really held up over the years except with a few hardcore gamersto switch gears and say something positive about the game i think people are crazy to say the music in this game is bad
sure its not music you can instantly sing and dance to but its music that will grow on you the more you hear it
its really good music
just because you cant sing along to music doesnt mean its not good
this game is a great example of that
the music is great in every area
to compare the music in this game to that in actraiser
id say the tunes in illusion of gaia overall cannot touch the high points in actraiser but they sure beat the low points easily
i remember one level theme in actraiser had me pulling my hair out
nothing like that in illusion of gaiamaybe theres something wrong with my copy but ive been having strange things happen
for example i reached the end of the game with  blue dots let me mention again that these blue dots represent your life bar
okay i shut the game off go to sleep for  hours wake up play the game and now i have  blue dots
how did that happen
imagine if you were playing zelda and you didnt collect all your heart containers and then you wake up to find all the heart pieces right there on your file the next day
thats what its like in illusion of gaia
also sometimes save points suddenly appear out of nowhere and you clearly remember the last time you ran by that area a save point wasnt there
so save points can appear and disappear
weird
i also got stuck in one area of the game because an item that was supposed to be given to me by one of the characters wasnt given to me leaving me to forever wander around doing nothing
i had no choice but to start over completely
i have no idea whats going on here
ive never experienced anything like this in any video game and ive played my share of games
i can only assume either my copy has a defect or enix is just a cheap game company and actraiser is pretty good so it must be the formeri have to take a point off for the constant frustration found in most of the dungeons
you know how in a zelda game when you walk into a dungeon and each of the rooms are filled with interesting and creative ideas making it really fun to play the game over and over and equally as important making each room distinct so you know where you are
its not quite like that here
the design of the dungeons in illusion of gaia is for the most part bland and confusing
you just run around slashing enemies and theres not much in the way of interesting strategies to make it enjoyable for you to progress to the next room
this is where you really have to admire the people who work on zelda games
they know how to make dungeon mazes interesting
zelda link to the past featured ice desert and water dungeons
the people who did this game just made it sort of fun but nothing truly memorable
and the strategies to progress to the next room in illusion of gaia usually require something small and uninteresting and sometimes obvious making it feel more like a chore to do it
and why does the very last dungeon maze in the game have only a few enemies
were talking about a big area to walk through encountering the same couple enemies over and over
those laser eyeballs are everywhere and theyre so out of place for a final level in a game and theyre so easy to destroy
zelda link to the past features way more enemies
compare the final level in this game to world  in link to the past
zelda destroys iti hate how sometimes in the game you have to backtrack to clear a dungeon which means going to the end of the dungeon to grab an important item and then go back to the very beginning to complete it
many times this is easier said than done
take that superirritating vine level for example
the entire world is covered in vines that serve as a path you walk on and each vine looks exactly the same so its possible you can wander around for hours just trying to find your way out of there
i cant tell you how many times i pressed pause to reach for my magic mirror only to come to the realization that this isnt zelda and so i have nothing to bring me back immediately to the entrance of the dungeon
but running around slashing skeleton heads bats and other strangelooking creatures is usually a lot of fun despite the strange animation from will but is all this worth the frustration you most likely will encounter from the dungeon mazes
only when in the right mood
at the end of other dungeons you fight huge bosses
theres a total of six of them and i think this is the games very best feature because these bosses are really fun and you have to try and discover the best way to defeat them
i dont think theyre difficult to defeat except for the very last boss
that one is hardanother bad thing about the game is the incredible amount of text you have to skim through
the storyline is okay but sometimes you dont feel like reading it which means you have to sit through a ton of text before the enemyslashing section of the game comes in
to start off the game you have to sit through even if you skim over it as quickly as possible  minutes of text
 minutes of your characters talking to each other and its not even very interesting
they say things to each other that typical children would say
eventually you will come across a love story between the children
but hey im no expert on rpgs so you may very well find the dialogue to be the games strong point
given a choice between this and zelda make the right choice and go with zelda
its slightly more expensive to buy but definitely more worth it
however illusion of gaia is a pretty nice game on its own
i know it sounds like im bashing the game but i dont mean to
just dont go in expecting a classicillusion of gaia made the list of top  games in nintendo powers volume  and understandably so
definitely a decent game illusion of gaia has much to offer including some very nice environments with crisp graphics better than the likes of legend of zelda a link to the past
it can be very fun to play and it is even somewhat educational since many of its dungeons are based on real places
to speak more about the graphics the monster design is nearly flawless
every dungeon has different monsters with different looks and attacks and even the residents of each town look completely distinct from those of the previous town or the next town something that not even the snes final fantasy games managed to do
these details all add up to a visually pleasing game
the necessity to kill all the enemies in each area in order to upgrade is also a positive element of the game because it gives a sense of accomplishment in each room
though in spite of these positive elements illusion of gaia should not be called a zelda killer
it is also very different from zelda in certain ways and therefore can not be compared in all aspects to zeldaalthough there is a myriad of items in illusion of gaia their usage demonstrates one of the principle differences between zelda and illusion of gaia
most of the items in illusion of gaia are keys puzzle pieces or other objects that get used once in a specific location and then leave your inventory
it is not difficult to find where to use acquired items but a few of them can be difficult to find since they are not all found in treasure chests
players should not expect all the different weapons and devices such as those seen in zelda a link to the past
will the games protagonist uses a flute for a weapon
zelda purists may mock this but wills flute is by no means the only weapon in the game
will learns interesting techniques and also has the ability to morph into different entities during the quest who also acquire their own techniques
illusion of gaia may not have quite as many puzzles as a link to the past but it certainly has its decent fill and the whole style of the puzzles is different
perhaps the puzzles at the end of the angel village come to mind as the most different from anything seen in zelda
nonetheless the mainstream of the game remains arguably more in fighting than thinking
some of the dungeons could have used more puzzles and items but most are not so lacking that they create any feelings that something is missingthe main problem with illusion of gaia is that it rapidly starts to fall apart in the middle both in terms of story and game progression
i pinpoint this turn of events around the great wall of china but by no means say that the story is perfect up to then because it is not
the difference is that earlier in the game enough goes on to overshadow inconsistencies and holes
later in the game in addition to the story deteriorating the blandness of the world layout becomes much more noticeable as well making the travel less interesting
aside from the tower of babels circular island in the center of the world illusion of gaias world map consists mainly of three continents
two of them basically fill the southeast and southwest corners of the world and one long continent north of the tower of babel island stretches horizontally across the whole map
the game starts on one of the bottom continents and gradually progresses to the long northern continent where the great wall of china comes early
travel at this point just becomes a bland pattern of the group arriving at a town will leaving to go to a dungeon alone will returning to the town and then the group going on to the next town
it is more varied earlier in the game during which there is usually another thing to do or a person to visit between a town and big dungeon and these events add flow to the story
later in the game some of the groups members start to leave and there is nothing to break up the dull pattern
some of the reasons for going to the later dungeons are also extremely vague and not well supported in the overall story
example why exactly does will go to mt
temple and angkor wat
there is no dialogue or story saying that anything specifically needs to be done in these places
in the other dungeons the story makes it clear if you have to go to a specific dungeon and why but with later dungeons like mt
temple and angkor wat all that happens is that someone will point out or draw a picture of something on wills map
what is even more puzzling about these two dungeons is why the game makes you walk all the way back out of them after getting the item at the end
there was absolutely no reason for this to have happened
it did not happen with any of the other dungeons and it should not have happened with these two
the least they could have done was at the end of angkor wat transport you back to the entrance after the white light faded
it would have made perfect sense and i can even picture the text box when the light was gone i found myself at the temple entrance  whatever but another thing to rip regarding these dungeons and this general point in the game is that given the time it supposedly takes for will to travel to some of these later dungeons none of the companions ever ask will where he went or why he left them in the town without saying anything
example as soon as will arrives at angkor wat a text box says that it took him three days to get there from the natives village
after will returns to the natives village neither kara nor erik asks him where hes been for the last week which is how long we can assume it took for him to get to the temple explore it and return or why he left them in the natives village
this is either a rushed part of the game or lack of thinking on the part of the writers
yes the earlier stages of the story have similar issues that are not quite addressed but again earlier in the game enough happens to make the players forget or pardon these instances
since not much interesting occurs later in the game the holes in the plot really wear onthe vagueness surrounding later dungeons is far from the only weakness in the story specific story spoilers ahead until last paragraph only warning
many fundamental questions are never answered or explained
will had lost his father a year prior to the current events and starts the game living with his grandparents
he his father and apparently many others had gone on an expedition to the tower of babel and somehow only will made it back of course not remembering what happened or how he made it back
at no point is it ever explained what exactly happened or how will made it back to south cape
wills father at the end tells him about a strange room in the tower where time passes so quickly that people evolve quickly
is this supposed to mean that wills father went into this room aged so fast and died instantly
how exactly did will get his telekinetic power
wills father tells him that he and kara are evolved humans
what exactly is that supposed to mean
how and why are they evolved
are they evolved and no one else
is it because will is a descendent of dark knights
how exactly are they different from other humans if they are evolved
wills mother also appears in a dream and as a ghost but it is never explained how she died
was she also on the expedition to the tower of babel
it remains a mystery
if these fundamental questions had been satisfactorily explained some of the other problems might have been more pardonable
if the writers had any idea how to make a decent story they would have answered these questions and devoted more of the story to the ancients as wellif i were to ever reward a game for worst ending ever illusion of gaia is undoubtedly the recipient
i absolutely hate the ending to this game
what started with seemingly endless potential finished going virtually nowhere
basically you beat the comet and oh all of the sudden the world changes to present day earth
what
and it finishes in a school
with will and friends wearing sweatshirts and school backpacks
are you kidding me
this ending makes no sense whatsoever and is totally pathetic
heres a small list of all the things the ending did not answer or settle did time just fast forward or something
it takes a long time for continents to shift and for buildings to get built
they dont just appear during an ending of a super nintendo game
 do any of the characters remember the journey
are they reincarnated
are they the same people as they were before did nonhumans go extinct
what happened to the angel village people
i also didnt see lilly in the school shot
did itory village people just die out kara never made up with her parents
for all we know the teapot on mt
temple might have shown them to be spirits too did lances parents ever get reunited did the labor trade ever get stopped
how did neil do as company president just what exact age was the time during the game supposed to be
the new world with gray buildings and presumably technology is deemed by will to be strange in the premonition but neil can build an airplane during the game
 what ended up happening to bill and lola
did they die
did they just forget about will does will keep his telekinetic powersi cringe when i think of what illusion of gaia could have been and wish i could tell the writers what morons they were when they wrote the story to this game
it is still a solid game but if the world design and story had been better the game would have reached unimaginable heights
you dont just leave things unsettled change the world and think everyones going to be happy
for a game of this genre that is not zelda and is not plagued with illusion of gaias problems play crystaliswhats sad is that this game seemed like a huge achievement back in 
maybe i was too young to realize it back then
maybe it was lack of experience
i thought this game rocked when it first came out and unfortunately im no longer sure whyto me it seems this is a fairly average platformer wrapped up in a beautiful package
the graphics were novel and unique at the time but i guess now i just think theyre awkward and weird looking
my main beef with the game is the control and the frustrating level design
the mine cart stages and the ones where you have to fire yourself from barrel to barrelsomehow i beat this when i was  i cant fathom how i did that nowanother minor problem is that the bosses are all pretty easy
four hits usually does the tricki dont recommend replaying this oldie
unlike sonic and mario world this one may be better left as a childhood memorywhen reading the box and manual they keep pushing the idea of a d game
the characters are more or less in  dimensions as well as items in the game
the background moves at a different speed than the pathways adding to the illusionthe game is fun challenging and entertaining
though there is a lack of points to be earned killing all the enemies gain you nothing but the pleasure of the bong sound
extra lives are in the form of balloons and collecting  bananas
the ability to switch between donkyheavy attacks and diddyhigh jumps on the fly adds to level complexity
if you can find them you can ride an ostrich rhino or a swordfish that help with their special abilitiesnot a huge fan of this game
too hard for the children to enjoy and i got bored quickly
if you get hit baby mario gets knocked off your back and you have limited time to recover him or you dieit was definitely a strange mario game
it is the prelude to all mario games where mario is a baby and you play yoshi
you dont really die normally but you lose a life if baby mario falls off your back if you get hit by an enemy and the timer gets down to zero
it was ok but weird
still nice to have in my collectioni think the repetitive level design and the fact that it can be frustratingly difficult at times definitely take away from this unneeded sequel that doesnt even feature the title character
still its not that bad of a game overall it just lacks some much needed originalitythe storyline in the game is great
the graphics amount of challenge and gameplay is also great
whats not great is the music
the fact that the same theme has to keep popping up whenever the screen switches to the turnbased battle screen is annoying to me
i hate that theme song
you cant avoid it either unless you turn the volume on the television downi also hate the game because of bad memories connected to it
the game was released during a time i truly didnt care about life
that memory is still connected to the game unfortunately
dont let my negativity stop you from buying this supposed classic though
it has a friendly bowser and no luigi
odd but truewhen i was young i was more into mega man games and typical mario side scrollers this made me get into rpgs
after this awesome expirence i played all kids of rpgs i highly recomend itsonic is so classic so i had to get this game when i realized that it wasnt in my sega collection
the problem with that mentality is that i beat the game on my gameboy advance so it wasnt really exciting for mei am giving this item  stars rather than one bc it is still a sega genesis and it is a great system
i should have read wikipedia before i bought this
this item worked fine but the rd generation genesis dont work with the game genie
you should know this if you are a huge game genie fan as i always have been
and still am
this is a very important reivew to read
the original model still exists so just buy that one
if you are cramped for space andor dont care about the game genie working on your genesis then buy all means buy this one but it isnt any cheaper i believe about the same price actuallyi cant believe genesis fans used to think golden axe was so great
i had a friend who thought the game was one of the best the system had to offer
everyone who owned a genesis seemed to agree with him
its nothing special then again most of the games on the genesis were nothing specialits really not much different from the super nes game king of dragons
king of dragons is better because it has prettier graphics and colors more exciting gameplay and just an overall better game
golden axe feels old and empty in comparisonthis is one of the best remembered genesis games
tho its absolutely nothing special
its almost totally like streets of rage with magic spells instead of special kungfu moves and set in the dark agesyou can choose the big conan lookalike ax battler who uses earth magic
tyris flare the shera type amazon woman who uses fire magic or gilius thunderhead the viking dwarf uses lightning magic and the character who actually uses the golden axe or team up in a twoplayer the best way to play the gamethe story is a load of cobblers
some dude called death adder and his son death adder jnr are up to some amount of evil and youve got to stop himso on you go on your journey of hacking and slashing goblins skeletons and various other guys in armor
its fun but not greatthe sound effects are pathetic and do not show off what the genesis was capable of
david whittakers music while being slightly tuneful and medieval was pretty bad and wasnt as memorable as yuzo koshiros effort on the streets of rage gamesa fun game to play right to the end once in a two player but not as memorable as its following what suggestthe rampage edition had a number of extra things that the original jurassic park game for genesis did not
but it also took out some features that some may miss including the cheat menu for level skipping
a good game overall but becomes very repetitivefirst of all this is more fun than finding flickiesthe game is slow but its still cool to find keys its more like mario than sonic
i think they should rerelease all of game gears sonic games onto a single disc and call it sonic mega collection sonic geari praise the game gear at attempting d graphics
its more like isometric but whatever  it wasnt all for naught
this game is rather challenging
the bosses in this game are rather dull your only tactic  spin dash
you cant even jump
but the levels themselves are okay
im suprised that this game has some stereo music in a game gear
go to the sound test with headphones and youll know what im talking about
this game has some lasting appeal with its time attack feature
but this game despite it being a spinoff doesnt measure up to its earlier entriesbut on the plus side its not like the worst game ever like ive seen on other sites
its okay
mainly bought this game to add to my sonic game gear collectionarrivedin timely manner wrapped and packaged very well
the game was complete came with everything
the game works just fine except im unable to load a saved gameto find a successor to final fantasy  must have been no easy task and its difficulties have no doubt been increased by the circumstance that the resumption of joint work by the team who made the company what it is has been of only too short duration
ff tactics is a sorry mixup of a story that is too long in the telling
from the outset of it one can see nothing but extreme misfortune for the characters from beginning to endthe animation is rather sloppy at times and the music always reminding me of something else
the most unforgiveable part of the game is the lack of proofreading in the text
in many of the scenes things are misspelled or ungrammatical
in several descriptions of things there is gibberish where a description ought to beas for the story the plot is rather twisted
something about a war without a clear goal and nonsense about zodiac stones characters that come and go without a will yer leave or by your leave and a myriad of battles in a welldesigned battlefield
by the end there are no characters to really admire except ramza whose fate isnt entirely clear either
most of the other characters are dead by the end anyway so its not like it mattersthe final product looks really rushed to get to the stores and its a shame that square wasnt more careful with what video game spot called a masterpiecewild arms is an old game
obviously since the last review for it was written in  this was the second rpg ive ever played and as such it holds a place in my heart
i have recently replayed it so i thought id write a review since amazon decided it would be a good recomendation for meobviously the game looks outdated and thats because it is
the d overworld retains its charm for me as ive always enjoyed the artwork that goes into making games as opposed the the final d renderings especially in this era of d graphics
ill just out and say it the combat scenes which are done in d are terrible by todays standards
i mean awful
lol
the combat is pretty standard rpg fare so if youve played final fantasy or any other turnbased rpg youll feel right at home here
you start the game with three characters and dont gain any new party members through your quest
while thats kind of lame i liked the decision
i didnt have to hem and haw over which characters i wanted in my party just because i liked one more than another
this also allowed them to delve deeper into the character personalities and pasts another part that i enjoyed of the game
i rooted for jack and his quest for power i saw the sadness in cecelia when she realized that people only treated her nice because they knew she was a princess i felt for rudy when people shunned him just because he knew how to use ancient technology that people deemed evil even when he used it to save their lives
the story is the high point of this game perhaps even more so today what with all the green living thats emphasized today
since it deals with the death of the planet the loss of natural rescources and such it has a very ecoconscious view
the music is very nice and has a very western feel to it
in fact it was this meld of western and sword and sorcery that originally attracted me to the gameultimately play this game for the story
the graphics are old and outdated though the d segments remain charming and the gameplay is typical rpg fare
if you have a psp or a ps i reccomend that you download it from the playstation store for  if not then buy the disc you wont be dissapointedthis game was really fun to play and the story line was decent but overall it was far from the best ive ever played
at the time this game came out it was pretty good because there wasnt much of a selection for playstation rpgs
but by now there are much better games out therethe story line is based on the usual quotyoung boy goes off on an advneture to save the worldquot most of it has been done before
the magic is pretty good
most of the spells are fairly original and the graphics that go along with them arent too bad considering the cartoon appearence of the rest of the gamei remember being a little annoyed by the excessive random encounters in some of the dungeons but its nothing i havent dealt with before
one dungeon that stands out in my mind however comes near the end of the game and it was by far the most nervewrackingly annoying dungeon i have ever encountered in any rpg and ive played them all
there are invisible pit traps all throughout the already long dungeon which drop you down to the previous floor somewhere which also has pits combined with the high random encounter rate this place is an absolute pain to completemost of the game is straightforward with only a few elements of surprise
this is the kind of game id recommend only to a firsttime rpg player
all of us rpg veterans should look elsewherethis game has had some negative reviews from critics and players alike but to be totally honest it really isnt that badjust really really averagethe games graphic is one of its least impressive efforts as even the end life titles on the snes have better graphics
story is generic with some interesting twists  i do like the fact that there are several secret characters that arent too hard to get if youre the type to do click on everything as opposed to some that you can only realistically get if you read a walkthrough
sound is easily the best part as it really have some nifty tunesgameplay wise there isnt anything new  it has an interesting concept of hit point and life points  you will faint if you lose all hitpoint but will automatically revive with some lifepoints and only die when you run out of the latter
the most annoying thing as anyone will tell you is the amount of random battles  you literally can fight battle after battle just by walking  steps in any directionthe characters progress nicely in their roles you kind of feel for them at the end
i just wish the story wasnt as predictable as it was
the game ends on a rather ambiguous note  it seems they were hoping to make a sequel but never didoverall i played this game in the background while marathoning the sitcom  rock and it passed by pretty quick  the game only lasts for  hours and i finished it in about  days
on the other hand ive been playing final fantasy  now for  months and ive only logged  hours into it ugh that game just isnt addicting
in lieu of that i can honestly say that beyond the beyond really isnt all that bad for a quick rpg fixi remember in middle school when this game came out my friends would talk about it all the time and often compare it to illusion of gaia
i couldnt contribute to the discussion since back then i wasnt familiar with either game but now since im familiar with both i think illusion of gaia is a superior game if only slightly
i believe comparisons to secret of mana would have been more appropriate thoughwhile i admire an actionoriented rpg approach instead of the turn based style that i never understood the appeal of by the way why am i forced to take damage if i dont want to
secret of evermore surely feels more appropriate for the turn based audience despite the action
perhaps this is due to the way the game feels it feels strongly like it wants to be chrono trigger since squares design in gaming while fantastic is a pretty predictable formula
i mean chrono trigger is turn based and secret of evermore doesnt feel significantly different than that game despite using two different combat styles
while playing secret of evermore you realize that squares specialty is turn based rpgs and they should leave any weaponswinging action to nintendo due to the tacky and unnatural way you swing your weapon as well as the oddlooking animations afterwards when an enemy has been defeated
it makes me think square was probably one step away from making secret of evermore a tun based rpg
of course the characters forest and castle backgrounds and overall setup of both chrono trigger and secret of evermore resemble each other as well but i dont really mind thatanyway secret of evermore is about a boy and his dog who go an adventure retrieving diamonds stopping the world from falling into a deep freeze or whatever else the townspeople ask or discuss from our brave hero
probably the most interesting feature of the game is that your dog can actually attack enemies by biting them and sometimes he packs a mean bite and is quite the helpful little companion
the storyline is relatively simple
at least in comparison to the elabrate chrono trigger storyline
this is due to such a small number of characters overall and the small number of actual dilemmas occurring throughout the quest
chrono triggers land was so diverse and populated that it was enough to make me confused on several occasions so i welcome the changeoverall the world feels alarmingly small and you often have to walk through the same areas youve just completed to retrieve purchase or progress somewhere else
you also have to defeat several enemies in order to level up and advance
not a bad concept though occasionally repetitive
some of the weapons are horrible
the bone weapon in the beginning with its limited range is quite pathetic though i guess understandable since its your very first weapon after all but the spear that you will soon get is a major improvement
you can also create attacks depending on your level and the one where a giant fist comes down and pounds enemies is a nifty way of damaging and eliminating any danger standing in your way
in fact the fist pound is highly reliable in boss fights and makes short work of them
casting powerful attack spells is another trademark of turn based rpgs so its a bit weird having them in a game like this but its a pretty cool concept regardless
some of the areas are fairly boring
actually when you arrive to the desert thats when the game gets sort of boring
you have to swirl around through quicksand for a few minutes to obtain hidden items on one occasion talk to townspeople purchase or trade items and take a hilarious tour boat ride on another
this stuff takes a long time with little excitement in betweenspeaking of the boss fights theyre alright though the one snake fight from the swamp area is entirely too long
others are sometimes annoying due to shaking the floors and stunning our hero or darting off screen and coming back with a cheap attack but otherwise theyre fine
filling your health whenever its low is similar to chrono trigger which is weird in a more actionlike game but thats how it is
enemies can be a bit repetitive at times
how many times did i have to battle those miniature frog creatures
or the boney snakes that resemble the ones from super castlevania iv
or those flopping slime balls
too many times
the music is quite the surprise though
quite often its extraordinary and always fits the mood perfectly but more importantly the notes themselves are memorable and enhance the fairy tale vibes of the fictional story quite oftenoverall well its a pretty good game
my star rating is probably due to the fact ive played several super nes games that entertained me more
it is a classic video game system after all
still secret of evermore is a nice change when i desire to take a break from the classicsim also a hardcore squaresoft fanever since kings knight and rad racer
this is a very different squaresoft game which is why some people didnt like it
instead of nobuo uematsu music you get ambient sounds instead
i didnt care for the ambient sounds
the graphics are better than average for snes but not as good as chrono trigger or seiken densetsu secret of mana 
the battle system is a mixed bag
on the one hand the battles are not turnbased
but on the other hand you have to level up weapons by fighting lots of enemies and getting lots of alchemy ingredients
the alchemy aspect reminds me of drawing spells from ff
the storyline is okay but nothing really fantastic
humor
well thats a different story
there are some really funny parts in this gamesoe got recognition in nintendo power for it
the market place about midway through the game is interesting but frustrating at times
there are many different worlds youll be going to in this game the most interesting of which are gothica and one or two others adjacent to it
i played all the way to the ending bossand stopped
in my final analysis i give this game  stars
if you insist on playing it get it on emulator firsti know
you are probably thinking a sequel to secret of mana
well this game doesnt hold a candle to the secret of mana
dont get me wrong it doesnt suck that bad
it just really isnt that great of a gamefirst off this trilogy of the nes ninja gaiden games truly deserves  stars because they are all great games and to have them in one cartridge gives people a chance to collect them all
to get the games individually is hard enough as it is so i commend tecmo for making it available for the snes
so why did i give this trilogy set  stars
because of the promises tecmo made and broke when ninja gaiden trilogy was released on the snes back in after the huge success nintendo had with super mario all stars in  tecmo announced that they planned on releasing the original three nes ninja gaiden games in one cartridge with enhanced graphics and sounds for the super nes
fans rejoiced and waited patiently for it
when it was released something was wrong
changes were made but not the ones that tecmo promisedyou start out with either choosing to play a new game or continue a previous game
choosing a new game brought you to a screen where you choose which ninja gaiden title you want to play
choosing to continue a game took you to a password screen
the only new thing that was added was a password save system
you were given a password every time you died so you could either continue the game or write down the password and then enter it later on to start where you left off
its a cool feature to include so you didnt feel like you had to beat any one of the games in one shotas for what tecmo promised they failed to deliver immensely
first of all the graphics are not exactly like they were in the nes days
tecmo retouched the graphics for all of the games and as a result there is slowdown in some areas of the games that never happened compared to the original nes versions
second the sound effects sound muffled now compared to what you heard before
then there is the issue with the music
tecmo actually remixed every track you heard from every stage from each nes title and most of them sound worse than the original tracks
on top of that they removed a few tracks that you heard from the nes versions and replaced them with additional sound effects ie
ninja gaiden iii
and to keep with nintendos family friendly policy during the snes days parts of the game were censored blood religious symbols
its really confusing as to why tecmo released the trilogy set for the snes with all of these changes without realizing that they failed to deliver on the promises they made they should have double checked what the bullet points on the back of the box said
dont get me wrong the original three nes ninja gaiden games are the best of the best when it came to what the nes had to offer
its the way tecmo went about to package all three of them and then say they were going to enhance them for the snes crowd and then to drop the ball completely
the only saving grace they have is that this has become a collectors item so unless you get lucky and buy it used prepare to pay a hefty price for itthis was far better than the genisis mess version but the controls are still too complicated and the gameplay sucksprimal rage for what it was worth wasnt that bad of a game
but in the same respect it wasnt as good either
the graphics were excellent
not sloppy very clean it looked similar to the arcade hit and all out they did a good job with how the game looked
if you are a person that needs the visuals of a game to come out this was for younow for those who didnt enjoy this game on the home version this might be why although stunning in graphics it lacked the originality in the gameplay
this game followed or should i say held on by the coat tails of the success of mortal kombat
now theres nothing wrong with trying to achieve the success that mortal kombat had
heck at the time when this game came out mortal kombat was one of the platforms for great fighting gameshowever this game could not cut it on the home system
whyone the controls
the controls were already confusing in the arcade
what made it worse for the home system was that to unleash certain combos you either had to be quicker than billy the kid or you had to hold the controller like a geek left hand the correct way and the right hand off pressing the buttons with your thumb index and middle fingers
 and the fact that if you were holding any of the buttons trying to do a special move you couldnt do anything but stand still and get hitnow whats fun about getting beat down
nothingthe other thing that bothered me about this game was that all of the fights were way too predictable
for instance primate blizzard his standard set of offense as the computer on any level mind you was freeze preferrably in the air unleash    hit combo and repeat
very boring and once you statred to realize that the games replay value went from fair to low
not goodthis is another classic game that you could leave off your list to collect but at the same time its not that bad to have around once you get good at itthis is a really fun game and is one of the better fighting games for the snes
you play as one of  beasty dinosaursprehistoric beasts and battle each one  the death on a different continent when you win you take that land and when its all complete you gotta work on those tail jabs and kicks chow down on some half naked worshipers and sharpen does teeth for the final battle
and face all of your enemies in one final mega round  become ruler of the new earth
i will say its a good game but it has a lot of cons but some pros when compared to other portsfor one thing this port has some of the worsed animation i have seen the genesis version has superior game speed and higher frame rate for the animation so it looks way better and plays better as well
some of the backgrounds also look pourly desighned when compared too other ports as well
the music is also kind of weak as well
the one stand out area though for the snes version of this game is the sound
some of the sounds of the dinos roars to the sound of pounding kicks flesh ripping bites and explosions sound like the arcadehowever i would have too recommend the genesis version of this game or the playstationsaturn versions also
but this version is ok its still a pretty fun game overallbeavis and butthead was fair
not even ok
because the game itself was way too easy and i thought that it was going to be funny and it really wasnt
sure i laughed a few times but when it all came down to it the  dumbest teens in the world were about as funny as a rockthat and this game was way too easy
there was no true challenge with the exception of the hospital board but other than that very simple game and for a lot of the more advanced gamers this wasnt even a walk in the park
it was more like taking a nap on a sunday afternoonthe last thing that bothered me about this game is that the ending was better if you lost on the last board the gwar concert because if you lost it was more like the real beavis and butthead
you know a couple of morons who lost their objectivethis is a renter first
its entertaining while it lasts but unfortunately the feeling doesnt last very longim a collector of snes games and had to own this one
its a fun game
i think some parts are hard for kids like the second level when you have to roar at the monkees and grab on the hippos tail and swing
the hardest part of the game is the jump and double jump in the middle and the end of the second level
the game is fun and you get bigger and your roar builds as well
you need patience with this game
i totally recommend itwelcome to one of the most depressing video games ever published
not in the sense of tragedy  many terrific games have strong tragic elements
the final fantasies come to mind immediately so do the later metroid games
and many great games have dark elements to themthe problem i had with alundra didnt have to do with the gameplay
i think its actually a bit more like the game boy color zeldas not so much focused on fighting or resource management as on solving tough timingbased or logistical puzzles
gameplay good
not spectacular but goodunfortunately a game that sells itself as an rpg has to have a good story
by the third or fourth dungeon in alundra its kind of a spoiler to say what they really are so ill say dungeon the game has gone from pathos to bathos
while still remaining firmly in the cute medieval fantasy genre this game is dark and depressing and the horrible events that the main character utterly fails to prevent begin to feel more like a morbid jokewhich is a longwinded way of saying that as good as the gameplay is the story is godawful and from this adults perspective comes very close to ruining the game
they shoot for tragic inevitability and they miss that target but score a bullseye on mawkishly sillyi dont think anything i say about this game would be helpful for anyone
to be honest i always thought that this was quite boring
i never really cared for this game myself
though my mother and my aunt love thissof is a bloody gory and occasionally disturbing fps to even people who like movies such as fist of the north star
sof is realistic which means its hard
everyone i know is using the cheat codes
slow systems havent a prayer on running this game
i would reccomend aiming higher than the system requirements
the game is overall fun but gets repetitive
no real puzzles except for turning on generators or shooting crates to reveal passageways
arsenal is well chosen
pretty fun but dont expect anything too challenging aside from people shooting at you
this game is for fans of testosterony action movies
one chief indicator is that at the end of each level the main characters always seem to end up blowing something up in a huge explosion that they dramatically run away fromwhen a phenomenon as big as pokemon was youll always find the companies trying to cash in as quick as they can and get the most money
so many pokemonrelated stuff coming out cereal plush toys bandaids and games of course
here we have a different approach to the catchemall tagline you take their picture
its fun neat and shortstory you dont play pokemon games for their story but essentially pokemon professor and researcher oak wants pictures taken of the pokemon so you hop in his vehicle and travel different areas to do it
pretty simple nographics this is in the n days so its not incredibly detailed but it does its job well although you might find like the simpsons pokemon look odd in dsoundmusic unlike the gameboy games the characters actually say their name for once which is a good plus
music was ok but nothing hummable like most pokemon musicgameplay the pictures you take are ranked in basic areas how close they are to camera and not extreme closeup or faraway either whether theyre in the middle of the frame if theyre doing a special pose and if theres more of them in frame
to get the poses you have  basic moves using your pokeflute which could make them dance or maybe fall asleep bait to get them closer to camera or a ball which basically gets them mad
some also can net you a great photo such as one level if you knock pikachu off a balloon and you do something else you can get pikachu to ride articuno for extra bonusone complaint is the fact that youll often retry levels cause your machine is just too damn fast
trying to take a picture of a creature when you need so much prep time isnt the best thing
youd have to have incredibly good aim for many things too
another complaint is that theres only around  pokemonout of 
this is pre goldsilver games
some of my favorites from the games are not even in here like i dont think i saw one eevee or its evolutions in the gamehaving an interest in photography i can appreciate a game like this but photography in a lot of cases is about patience
waiting for that perfect moment before you click and riding that machine just quite frankly sucks but if youre into pokemon try it outif you can find it stillhavent played this in  years and i kicked it up and turned it on
heard the music and the first thing that came out of my mouth was memory lane is callingit was entertaining but oldermore experienced audiences should note that it wont take more then  or  hours to complete the game for those with good reflexes
received yesterday  and already finished itperfect game for younger children thoughnot that im real into pokemon or anything
but i bought this game along time a go when it first came out
and i just recently played it and it is pretty coolpokemon snap is a game intended mostly for younger kids
the object of the game is to take pictures of the pokemon you see
you acumulate points depending on how good youre picture isthere are about  levels in the game each with different challenges
sometimes you have to go back a level to get new pokemon that you can only see with flutes or when you throw an appleif you have not played this game you might think it sounds easy but it actually is not
sometimes you need to lure a pokemon to get a picute of it
with others you have to use a poke flute you have to be quick or else you will miss the desired pokemon and yol have to try again
little things like that add to the replay value of the gameover all this is a unique game with beutiful graphics
no multiplayer means it wont be every bodys favorite
but if you are a diehard pokemon fan pick this one upmy kids are huge pokemon fans
this was the first nintendo game i ever bought them when i got the system
of the several they have they play this the least at this timethe game is interesting and challenging  but not as much fun as it could be
the pokemon are sometimes hard to get  in focus and the frustration level can get high for younger children
on  the other hand older kids seem to breeze through it and then are done  with it
it does not lend itself to lots of repeated playi wish that  more than one player could save their data on the cartridge that is a  drawback
and it would have been nice to have more diverse kinds of  pokemon
however the graphics are great the premise is good i really like  the lack of violence and the different environments are fun to explore
bottom line buy this game if your kids are pokemaniacs but dont expect  them to spend hundreds of hours playing itconsidering this game is used and cheap now for a retired system id recommend a purchase just to see a type of gameplay that nintendo never tried again
you are a photographer and have been hired by professor oak to document pokemon living in the wild
you ride through levels on a fixed track snapping photos
you have a few items at your disposal to help spur the pokemon into different actions which racks up better photos and more points
the graphics are somewhat average but the pokemon animate well
controls are easy to masterso yeah its very different and very fun but in the end much too short
you have six levels and a bonus seventh level that really isnt much of a level but you see less than half of the original  pokemon
getting better photos gives the game some replay value but you can basically see everything in a weekend
but like i mentioned above its cheap now and the novelty makes it worth a buy for fans and nonfans alikepokemon snap lets you take photos of wild pokemon
the pokemon are cute and it can be a fun challenge to get them to do something entertaining but after a while the game gets kind of boring
i went through the river course  times and still have not unlocked anything
the game is set up like one of those arcade rides
you ride in a car on a preset path through the pokemons world
i was a little upset that the ride went so slow but i guess it was like that so that it would be easier to take photos
the pokemon did interesting things
i fed one too many apples and it exploded it was an electric pokemon
i shot an apple that hit a lizard pokemon on the head and caused him to fall in the lava
after the ride professor oak judges the photos
he is kind of annoying and has an awful voice
almost every one of my pokemon photos were rejected by him because they were not big enough and in the middle of the frame
after half an hour i wanted to throw my controller at him and tell him to shut up
overall this is game is not half bad
taking and saving photos of cute pokemon is somewhat addicting even with some minor flawsgraphics c this is the nintendo  the pokemon are accurate enough but a game over a decade old is not going to look very goodsound d the sound is rather dorky but again this is the nintendo replay value b i come back to courses to get a good photo
photos are savable and sharable on the wii so i like sending them to friendsfor the games cheap price the game is worth buying
the game was not too bad when it lasted but i beat the game really fast
but still i recommend this game because its so cheapsingle player is fine but for me multiplayer is the purpose for a n and this is not the game you wantwhen this game got a  in nintendo power i thought it was definitely worth a look
after playing it i honestly do not see it as a game that is  good
the graphics are okay the sound is okay and the three characters you can eventually play as all play okay
thats this games problem its just okay
not great not above average and definitely not worth the  out of  it got in some placesits okaythe only thing not okay is the camera not only can you not control it at all it is very slow
and when you need it to focus behind you so you can blast some bugs it decides not tonote edited for clarity some detail notes and updated references jul i have owned this game for several years and played it many many times
its based on a cool concept and if you arent picky about the small stuff and can overlook some details you can have many hours of fun
but and this is what made me stop playing it completely when you get good at the game and start working hard on larger cities it has some nasty bugs that pop up and when they do they normally completely ruin the event you are on even though youve spent a few hours it will suddenly do something wrong a storage quits being recognized a graphical bug will effectively lock a certain area of the city etc this is extremely frustrating after all that time on it and the only recovery is to start over there is no fix that will correct the problem
i couldnt take that anymore and as far as i can tell its random as well you just dont know when or under what circumstance it will happen but it will happen
i cannot speak to the mac versioncaesar iii macas i have no experience with itthese problems have been known by the company for years but since they had already made their initial money on it they simply dragged it out forever finally even quit suggesting they would patch it as far as i know the game is completely unsupported now and has been for many years the only option is to buy something close
see note on newer version belowi also have pharoahpharaoh gold  pharaohcleopatra cdsgold edition has the addon cleopatra as it is very similar and it is pretty much bugfree  it has its frustrations but the game doesnt just breaki still rate ceasar iii as a  since you can enjoy it and it is fairly clever and i like the british accents    but i cant really recommend it
it is quite an old game but if you can find it for a few bucks including shipping you might consider itit is worth noting that there is now a new version of thiscaesar iv
i have no experience with it so cant comment
i was not impressed with this companys reputation to properly follow up on their games and their responsibility to their buyers
the game is still under the aegis of sierra gamesi love studying the romans and when i heard of this game i bought it
when i played it it was great
but then it got boring and way to repetitive
all the game is is making houses build farms honor caesar that is about it
if you love simulation games get this game
if you dont like simulation games dont get itfor those of you looking for a great realistic and hard game here it is
you are selected by rome to run a series of cities each one with problems and needs different than the last
you will have to develop farms dig clay pits fill warehouses design road systems supply people with food and goods build houses set up markets workhouses and make sure everybody has clean water
than you also have to deal with trade enemy armies the gods and caesars own demands for supplies and legions
people will want doctors on call schools for their kids and theaters for their free time
businesses will need labor living near them easy to access docks roads warehouses and dont forget lots of enginers to keep things in repairoh and dont forget the walls towers and gatehousesand lots of roads gardens roads plazas and more roadsdont worry there is a easy setting
and you can turn off the gods too
try to take it slow and easyi played this game for a couple of months earlier this year and enjoyed it very much
it was very exciting when you got to the point where you were generating money pleasing caesar and increasing the population
there are two big problems thoughthe first is that the instruction  booklet which comes with the game is not complete
in order to get to  the nitty gritty which should come with the game you must buy the  companion strategy guide
this is bull
for the money you have to plop down in the first place you should be able  to get complete instructionsthe second problem and the more serious  one is that the game is almost impossible to win
now i expect it to be  difficult and i dont mind playing a scenario three or four times before i  get it right but at some point i would like to be rewarded with a  victoryin caesar the goals are usually to reach a certain population  level and to reach a certain rating in four categories  peace  prosperity culture and favor
you can see where you are at any given  time
so you click on prosperity and you are at  and to reach the  goal you must have   you click on it and it says for example to  build more theatres
so you do
a year goes buy or about ten minutes  and the favor improves to   great you think i will win next yearbut  the next year rolls around and it stays at 
why
you click on it  again and it says the favor rating is improving
so you wait another  year
now it goes down
so you click again
again it says the rating is  imrproving
and the following year it does
but now its been forty  minutes youve accomplished everything else and youd like to go on to  the next scenario especially since youve played this one five times  alreadyi finally quit in exasperation and havent picked it up  since
it is unfortunate because all the other ingredients were therewell after a couple of months i have finally beaten grandia
all in all the action of the game was good the growth system fantastic although the combatladen progression of the story got tedious at times
in general i would have beaten such a game in a couple of weeks and it would have received  maybe  and a half starshoweverthis game took me a couple of months because i could not stand the glitches
ever so often the game would freeze up on me which caused me endless frustration
were it not for the fact that i could save so often which in general makes a game very easy i would have returned the game long ago
however i stayed the course and the game itself was pretty good
i have to drop a star off of its rating howeverim having great trouble recommending grandia because of its tendency to become extremely boring
this happens for several reasons first off the game offers nil challenge  and i do mean none whatsoever
secondly the quotrealquot story hardly unfolds until the latter part of the second disk
meanwhile the player is occupied with the various and sundry sidequests like saving villages and defeating evil monsters  things that dont have any bearing at all to the central storythe story itself involving a lad named justin who hopes to become a famous adventurer relies heavily on the backstory which in turn is very vague and muddled
the tale of the ancient empire of angelou and its eventual fall due to the corruption of its people is hardly inspired
what keeps grandia together however is the excellent characterization the people of grandia are convincingly human if a bit mellow though the awful voice acting spoils the effect of some of the key scenesgameplaywise grandia has some interesting ideas but it executes them so they contribute to the tedium
for example magic and special moves arent gained when the character levels up instead each character can increase his proficiency with the various elements fire water wind and earth and weapon types swords daggers whips projectiles etc
 thus gaining attribute boosts and special moves
however this interesting arrangement ultimately makes even the most routine battles longer since the characters are forced to cast magic as often as possible to increase their abilitiesthe ability to see enemies in the dungeons like in chrono cross is also welcome though enemies move extremely quickly and there is a whole lot of them so you can expect to fight just as often as in any other rpghowever the actual battle system is very nicely done and becomes very intuitive with practice
in addition to the usual variables the player must also take into account his distance to the target and its quotopennessquot since the characters actually move around the battle field
also grandia has a visual aid to help you figure out whose turn is next  the quotip gaugequot being able to stun enemies and knock them back on this gauge  and get knocked back yourself  adds an element of strategy to every battle which would be very nice if the game offered any challenge
as things are the battle system goes to wastegraphically grandia is clean and bright with colorful sprites on fully polygonal backgrounds
unfortunately some of the enemy sprites are less than pretty and some magic spells are downright embarassing
there are some short bits of fmv but the single anime sequence is repeated far too oftengrandia might possibly be suited for young players who could appreciate the low challenge whacky voiceovers and charming story
older gamers who are looking for a more purposeful adventure should look elsewherepraised by manyunfortunately theres nothing grand about this gameits a ok rpg the battle system is the best aspectthe positive fun battle system colorful and detailed graphics lighthearted aspect long dungeons good characters long storythe negative very very very very easy game
its almost impossible get killed too linear citiydungeondungeoncity scheme childish very cliched storyline character leave your party suddenly almost no sidequests bad translation soundtrack is boring no replay valuegraphics soundtrack story character development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  quite long game  hoursdifficulty  pathetically easy even the bossreplay value  what
no replay value here  theres no reason aside the pure fun of play the game twicethe game wasnt as good as the first one
plus it didnt have the same feel and architecture that the first one did which made the second installment in the spyro trilogy a little nonspyro
its as if the designers were trying to get away from the first one instead of creating a different game but going for the original roots which i hoped they would do yet they didnt
plus some of the minigames can be annoying and some parts are a lot more frustrating than the first one
the first one was great a little challenging yet easy to beat and plus it was highly addictive
id say that the only good things about the second one is the graphics which are excellent and plus certain mini games certain certain not all
anyways the game is worth the money but its still not as good as the firstyoull find fun at every corner
all kinds of worlds interesting charecters and fun challenges
get itwell the game was pretty decent
the gameplay itself was outstanding but theres a reason i gave this game only  stars
the graphics stunk and plus there were some major glitches in the system that you couldnt ignore
for example  one of the cars that i had chose to do combat with had literally gone through a wall
it wasnt supposed to be part of the gameplay of course but it was a major glitch
and let me say that your car isnt gonna go flying through walls just once its also gonna ruin the gameplay for you because it could screw up your tactics
the game was ok but like i said the graphics were awful
playstation can do better with graphics
these graphics look like a glitchy japanese anime wanna be which was created on super nintendo and for a playstation game thats just sadalso no storyline
it was just a senseless blow em and shoot em up
not that i dont like that but i want a reason for all that
even if the plot was shallow i still wouldve accepted it because atleast it wouldve had a story and a plot
anyways i dont think this game is really worth the money
also the camera angles are unpredictable and they arent very good since you can get blown to smitherenes within three secondsthis game is below  average and a discrace to the twisted metal genre
i mean people who are die hard fans might get a kick out of this but for you other people might want to rent it firstwith the clunky controls and clunky combat system and new cars that make you crash into the wall every single time you use every single car
the soundtrack is good but this game is a huge dissapointment
if you want to try this game rent it at blockbusteri am surprised that people who have played all the tms from  still find enough interesting to play this gamei realized finally after playing tm and tmblack on psx recently why carmageddon was so much better
basically the excitement from these games come from being able to drive way too fast and barely undercontrol while inflicting cool damage at the same time
in fact in carmageddon you can drive so fast that you literally launch airborne which really gives you that rollercoasterlike oh sht feeling
furthermore carmageddon gives you a throughthecockit view so it really feels like you are in a car thats just launched off a building and is about to ram into the side of anotheryou cannot do that with a game like tm because it takes too much precision to hit a target with a missile
to get precision you have to slow downin carmageddon there are no weapons except your car itself
amazing the game is fun even without all the superduper missile firing weapons
in carmageddon you inflict damage solely by collision
the faster you go the harder you hit your opponent so automatically the game forces you drive fast and fast is what generates that adrenaline rush
read the reviews for road rash jailbreak and youll see what i mean
the reviewers reported the lack of the high speed rush
the most disappointing and fatal thing about tm is the physics
carmageddon had wonderful car deformations and physics
ie very close to the way you expect cars to fly through the air like in the movies
in tm you can drive to the edge of a vertical cliff and then your car crawls down the side
what is with that
then if you apply gas backwards you can crawl back up the cliff
i cant believe the implementers of this game didnt simply turn on friction when the vehicle is traversing a surface whose angle is too steeplooks like carmageddon  is on sale cheap on    so snag it before its gone
i wish carmageddon  were still available for psxthe twisted metal series first arrived a few months after the playstations us debut
it was in the forefront of games that really showed off the difference between bit cdbased systems and the bit cart platforms that came before
while driving and shooting games had previously existed twisted metal was responsible in part for defining the carcombat genre by putting overthetop characters into vehicles with arsenals of weapons and special moves and letting them battle it out until only one remained
the second game in the line twisted metal ii world tour was a longer improved version of the original and it is generally thought of as one of the best games ever released for the playstation
but by the time the third title came along the series developer singletrac studios had been sold to gt interactive and publisher  studios opted to bring the line inhouse
while the game had new weapons contestants and multiplayer options its levels lacked the originality of the earlier titles and its new physics engine was more of a frustration than an improvement
though it sold very well twisted metal iii was a huge disappointment making the question of how twisted metal  has turned out all the more important for its fans
rest assured its much much better than its predecessor
to begin with the level design in twisted metal  is a big improvement over twisted metal iiis
there are more hidden areas than in the previous games and youll likely play a level more than a dozen times before finding everything
standout levels include amazonia  bc which has quite a few different tiers to sneak off to and the oil rig which has lots of satisfying places to set traps
each stage also has a secret weapon that you can use on your enemies until someone comes and knocks you off the weapons controls
for instance in the first level you use a large magnet which sucks your opponents high up into the sky preparing them for a big drop
the levels arent quite as epic as those in twisted metal ii world tour but they get the job done well
the only one thats kind of dull is the first  a construction yard with a lot of topographically flat spaces
the control and physics are also better than in tmiii but they remain a little too touchy and unforgiving
its still a little too easy to flip over or miss a ramp or go skidding off and get momentarily stuck on a ledge but it doesnt happen nearly as often as in the previous game
though prettier than those in tmiii the graphics in tm arent nearly as sharp as the graphics in its current main competitor  activisions vigilante  second offense  and while the game music fits well enough it doesnt really draw you in
each level has its own extended looped version of songs by bands like cypress hill cirrus and skold the best among them being remixes of the rob zombie tracks that appeared in twisted metal iiiseveral new weapons in the series will become quick favorites such as the mirv the freeze remote a remote bomb that freezes everyone in the area and the proximity mines which work well when you leave them in teleport areas or drop them as youre being chased
other welcome additions to the line are the new tournament contestants which include the exterminator truckdriving goggle eyes and rob zombie whose dragula possesses a special weapon that grabs any vehicle in the area and holds it for a moment while he shoots at it until it explodes
the new createacar option offers you three choices for size style and paint four choices of special weapons spoilers and more than a dozen taunts
while this is a decent start and better than nothing doubling the numbers would have really given you the ability to customize a ride just the way you like it
as it stands youll likely just use one of the vehicles already provided for youanother change is that instead of just having a midboss and an end boss twisted metal  features bosses at the end of every level who are made up of one or two super versions of missing contestants such as axel and thumper
it may sound like a good idea but it ultimately ends up taking away from the feeling of dread you used to feel when a boss emerged in the past
remember when the words prepare for minion appeared in twisted metal and twisted metal ii world tour
at least thats the case for all the subbosses
when sweet tooth finally comes out in the end youll run like hell
the twoplayer multiplayer modes  coop and deathmatch  still let you configure the split screen by horizontal or vertical cut as well as variations on a fourway split where the other two boxes are filled with radar speedometer and weapons info
the fourway split modes are the best since you view the world through a smaller version of the full screen
the problem is that the frame rate in the multiplayer modes isnt nearly as fast as in the singleplayer levels
if you play as one of the larger slower vehicles youll end up using the turbo quite a bit out of frustration
luckily the framerates not noticeably lower in fourplayer thanit is in twoplayer
even with this working against it the multiplayer mode offers tons of replay value whether in a deathmatch or a coop tournament with a friend
and adding to the singleplayer side is the option to use a cpu ally to help you in the fight
while all these options were also present in twisted metal iii theyre better realized here because tm is a game youd actually want to play
in the end twisted metal  is as huge a leap ahead of twisted metal iii as the second was to the original
while the series hasnt quite reclaimed its former glory it at least seems to be on the right tracki like this game alot its just it gets a little boring after awhile
you get lots of new cars and car manufactures
you get new tracks including dirt tracks
you get some good music and some cool endurance races where you rac for  laps
i like this game its just it gets boring after a few months because youll own alot of cars and race with em over and over and over but i like the way the game is realistic because of the upgrades for the cars like brakes and wheels and they give you a very long paragraph on how it works
its a nice game but may get boringthis game has a few interesting features such as the dual scenario specially that mysterious bald man haunting you and the two secret mini gamesbut the fatal mistake this game commits is the most ignored by most people and unfortunately re follows the same path
i cant comment over code veronica for i havent played it the linear plotline follows the following structure guy arrives to some place and discovers myriads of creatures guy locks himself somewhere guy discovers there is traitor among the survivorsirons guy discovers a secret lab under or within the main structure in this case the rpd guy makes it through and discovers unthinkable truths guy fights big monster while the clock is ticking guy needs to run and save his life before the whole place goes bang
 it drives me sickim sorry re fans but its the truth
or my opinion whatever that you wish flashy graphics and awesome features do not sum up a great game
play it for the funofthefirstplay factor alone and move over to something better because this game has nothing of scarywell the storyline is somewhat mediocre the controls are well unforgiveble another is leon is such a an idiot he does not have what it takes to be a cop claire is just well a ditzher voice when she talks is just well annoyingbut the graphics are what carries this game through they are well ahead of its time the zombies look real and so do the umbrellacorporation mutations thank god they took out the hunters in this game i got sick of them after awhilethe weapons are pretty koolthe magnum is devestating as usualbut as for replay value i will not play this againlike the first megaman game this one features a mix of robot masters
this time you get the  robot masters from megaman  that were not featured in the first gb megaman game as well as four from megaman  and mix them together here
all in all i say stick with the nes series because the gameboy series was nothing really impressive and followed the same formula for the first four gamesthe early s were very prolific for capcom and their flagship mascot mega man as up to this point he graced the nes and other various thirdparty systems in multiple titles in only so few years
and after mega man dove into the game boy with dr wilys revenge a few years prior it didnt come to any lick of surprise that he would appear again in the nowobligatory sequel once it came to light
and like its predecessor mega man ii recycles older nes elements including enemies bosses now from mm  and  and even this time around most of the level constructions making this an original title in name only
however this is much more playable than the hardashell wilys revenge where mega mans movement scheme is improved items are much more plentiful especially extra lives and the familiarity of the stage structures will enable all players to fly through this in almost record times
far easier than the first mega man game boy title and that in and of itself will probably warrant further replays
enjoyable even in its for completists only appealas an avid castlevania collector and consummate fan i purchased this game in april and finally beat it last night
that is to say even for an experienced castlevaniac used to a challenge this one was exceptionally difficult
probably within the top two most difficult vanias ive played and the only thing keeping me from saying its the most difficult is the fact that there are only four medium sized levels in the gamethe game is set a century before the original nes version and features christopher belmont as its whip slinging candle smashing protagonist
apparently the resurrection of dracula was extremely poorly timed for poor christopher as he seems to be still recovering from knee replacements in both legs
his movement speed is so slow simon seems like a long distance sprinter in comparisonone annoying thing about this gameboy castlevania is that the developers often came very close but ultimately refused to give in to a lot of classic castlevania elements that make other entries in the series so familiar and comforting
there are no subweapons hidden in the games candles instead only whip powerups chrystals giving you  lousy points a piece hearts which recover health rather than supplement subweapons and occasionally extra lives placed only in secret or hard to reach areas
the enemies are similar in their lack of familiarity the game has zombies but they appear to be made out of mud or slime and are nothing like traditional ones bats are present but behave much different then in traditional castlevanias bone pillars have been replaced by stationary monster heads who shoot fireballs that bounce around the screen and axe knights have been substituted by lightly armored freaks that throw actual boomerangs rather than axes that move like boomerangs
the bosses are equally generic and unfamiliardespite the horrendously slow pace this game is a showpiece title for early game boy games in terms of graphics
the monsters all possess multiple frames of animation and the backgrounds are detailed and distinguishable with nice shading
dracula actually looks a bit cooler than he does in the nes castlevania
the game is a difficult but fundamentally sound platformer
timing on jumps takes a bit of practice but the only real complaint is the lack of depth as far as weapons
the first three bosses are all absurdly easy with dracula absurdly difficult although very beatable once a good technique is developed
getting enough shots at him in order to develop such a technique is the most tedious partallinall even in  adventure could have been a lot more compelling but it is still an absolute must for collectors of the series such as myself
just dont plan on beating it overnightthis is the original pack in game that came when you bought a genesis before sonic existed
it originated in the arcades and gained a huge following of gamers
however the game is extremely short and not quite varied anough to really keep your interest
i believe that casual gamer will find it boring and shallow
however collectors obviously must have this game duie to the history alonecasual gamer pass on this onecollectors get it just to havei purchased this game and was ready to relive my childhood since that was the only time i played this game
its a fun game but ill admit its hard
one of the things i didnt like was how slow batman moved while everyone else gained the advantage on me with higher speed
its a hassle to come up with a strategy to defeat enemies because they manage to damage you no matter how hard you try and dodge their attacks
you must pick up items that lay around the levels to help you for boss battles and other foes
overall its fun but i feel the snes version to this game was way betterbatman returns for the sega genesis is a pretty good gameits got really good graphicsdecent gameplayand i really love the musici think the music is one of the best things that this game has to offeri know its not like the music from the filmbut its very originaland i think it fits in perfectly with the dark gloomy look that this game hasbatman returns is alot better than the disaster that was batman foreveror as i call it fatman foreverread my review for that genesis game and you will see why i give it that titleonly problem with returns is its very hardthere are a ton of cheap hits that you will take in this gamegetting to the next act is quite a choreyoull die aloti promise you thatwhat makes it even harderis there is no way to change the difficulty level in the options menuon the positive sideyou do get some cool gadgetsand a check point to start fromwhere you left off after you were killedthank god for small favorsanywaypick this uponly if you like a good challengecastlevania is a series that has stood the test of time all the way back from the original in the nes days
castlevania bloodlines proves another great castlevania game
this game has probably the best plot of the series and has cool location such as romelondon and more
also just like castlevania  draculas curse you choose two different characters with different movesstrengthsabilities which also means mutiple endings
secondly these castlevania is the only uncut and unedited version to come to the usand we can thank sega and konami for this releaseoverall great rare oop sega genesis game and great for any castlevania fanalso check out super castlevaniasnesand castlevania sotnplaystation but skip the bad dracula x for snesits the only castlevania i couldnt stand and the n castlevanias toographics  vibrant colors and detailplus blood and effects dont hurtsome of the decent graphics and some really bland at times sound excellent castlevania theme musicgreat clear effects utilizing the genesis sound capilbilitescontrols fans will feel right at home with bloodlines controls its similiar to super castlevania and sotn
funreplay golden axe one was a classic and this game just fell short
the enemies are repetitive and i think the graphics are in some ways improved and in some ways worseits very similar to the first one there is a new dark emperor in town and you gotta do the dirty job
run around fight barbarians evil ghost skeletons with swords with lots of dragons magic and sword slashing to keep you entertained for a whileshadow dancer is the story of joe mushashi and his faithful dog yamoto
together they go out and beat up the ruthless thugs of the neo zeed corporation and its boss the union lizard
its a load of confusing nonsense and in the journey from arcade to genesis the plot seems to have been erased and events taking place in the game just seem like gobbledegook
all you really do in this game is jump around taking strangelooking villains out with surikensto be honest the arcade version of shadow dancer was much better
the graphics were far superior the levels were cooler levels such as the airport and junkyard are missing in this version and the bad guys less weirdplus its very very short with only  levels all over in a few minutes
as it was such a cool arcade game its shocking that a game so easy and tepid could end up on the genesis
it was capable of much more than this and shadow dancer is really only a game for shinobi completistsshadow dancer is a sequel to the revenge of shinobi so i guess sega couldnt wait for an offical sequel to come along so they decided to port shadow dancer from the arcades to the genesis shadow dancer arcade is a sequel to shinobi arcade
shadow dancer plays more like shinobi in the arcades  abandons the revenge of shinobi gameplay
story for the game is a few years after the defeat of the neo zeed a new  more dangerous group called union lizard has taken over the nyc the game is set in a post apocalyptic nyc in  ok what was it with  being the year of death in the day you know escape from new york t this game im reviewing
any way you  a dog named yamto set off to destroy the union lizard
shadow dancer is a good sequel but the music doesnt touch the yuzo kashiros that he composed for revenge of shinobi because you got something special if yuzo kashiro composes for a video gameas you probably know already this review is for one of the many installments of the shinobi series called shadow dancer
the story for this game is straightforward enough
some evil guy has taken control of the city and claimed a bunch of hostages
shinobi and his faithful dog have to come in and save the day
what could go wrong
well plenty can go wrong when they turn shinobi into the worst example of a ninja ever
you would think he would stick to the shadows or something since they made him into such a pushover
when you play this game everything seems to be going fine and its enjoyable enoughuntil you realize you get hit once and youre dead
you just get to walk around and fight all these armed guards and other ninjas while you cant take a single hit
its stories like these that just come across as being totally unbelievable
what about ryu from ninja gaiden
he was a great ninja
you know why
because he could actually take quite a few hits before he went down
ryu was tough and he had the health bar to prove it
but not ryu hes just some pansy with ninja stars and a sword but if he takes a single hit from anything he dies
ive heard of games being hardcore but this is just stupid
shinobi is supposed to be a legendary ninja who defends the world from the powers of darkness
apparently this is the only game they made where you dont get a health bar and good riddance
it was a terrible idea and makes the game much harder than it needs to beand not much in the way of playability
i liked the feature of taking pictures and selling them the daily bugle but theres not much else going on
there are only  levels and some of them like the power station are really short
i liked this game when i was younger but i was used to more simpler games then
but it doesnt really even push the limited then wonderful capabilities of the genesis
the graphics are very basic and spiderman doesnt get much of a workout other than some unspectacular swinging around
theres also a very pointless go home for a while feature that has no use whatsoeverdont get me wrong its miles better than that awful spidermanxmen game but still not too amazing
pick it up cheap finish it then trade ithint you must play the game on nightmare mode to finish it otherwise youll only get a couple of levelshonestly i got this game because  i am a fan of spidey  i loved this game as a child
many kids today might not like it because of its outdated graphics
i will say that this is still a fun game and very challengingi remember playing this extemely difficult game in the s and it was great for its time i borrowed it from a friend
i like the games concept and objective as well as the superior graphics and nice color scheme a dramatic opposite from previous spiderman titles
spiderman needs to disarm a nuclear bomb that the kingpin has not only framed spiderman for stealing but plans to detonate within twentyfour hours
with the games objective and short amount of time to complete it the player is under extreme pressure of warding off several foes that stand in his way like sandman the lizard hobgoblin dr octopus and a obscure creatures like a freaking escaped gorilla taking random photos to earn money to buy webfluid and defeating venom at the end of each round before reaching the main boss adding on to the ultrahard challenge
this game doesnt mess around so you have to be focused at all times
i advise first timers to use the practice level before playing the actual game
once i get a new sega genesis my old one stopped working this will be one of the first games ill pick up and practice at it until my fingers bleed unfortunatley i never got to beat this extremely difficult game
its not the best spiderman game but its still a fun game to play so why not pick it up for myselfdoes it mean its a bad game no cause you can dash attack and dash attack with weapons but to make it short and sweet sega of america messed up with the english translation and and tweaked the plot and toned everything down for kids thats what hurt the snes version of final fight among other things
sor is known for killer soundtracks but s  only got a decent soundtrack
story i aint making this about the jap version which is way more superior
blaze learns of a new syndicate that there plan is to replace seattle government officals with robots a scientist cyborg then informs blaze that mr x is alive and that hes in control of the new syndicate now called triple x she notifies axel and skate returns all four go after the syndicate
 levels  play on easy only  if you fail to rescue the chief  you take an alternate path dont beat xs robot in time on level  you get the bad ending if you beat in time you get the good ending
shouldve stuck with bk  story this couldve had a die hard  vibe to iti dont know why im rating this since the person who was suppose to send this to me sent me the nintendo version of this instead of the sega genesis version that i wanted
so yeahhhhhhpretty sure you have to use a light gun for this gameinstead of a regular controller since its basically like the arcade game
wordok gameafter years of nintendo making very crappy marvel comic licensed titles sega genesis does not
it finally makes a good marvel comics game spider man for sega genesis which i find ok and its xmen
although it wasnt the best sega tried its best to fit the best graphics and gameplay possible for a bit system it was a good game for its time
in this game there are only four characters to choose from which are cyclops wolverine nightcrawler and gambit and you fight your way through six intense levels of which strategy is required
nightcrawler simply is the best and sometimes the only useful character to choose because of his extensive yet deadly teleportation and superior speed
the scene where you fight apocalypse is where nightcrawler is mandatory so save his strength for that level
its a great game to add to your collection but allow me to highlight the hits and misses this game has to offer
dont let a few misses prevent you from getting the game because a difficult game doesnt always make it less fungame hitsgraphics were impressive for its time using the same almost life like animation as the spider man game for sega plus the same sound effects
the controls were reponsive and attackjump buttons were at the right place
like the first ninja turtles game for nes you get to switch characters during the game
you also get to choose several xmen for assistance such as archangel storm and rouge offense helpers when things get really rough plus iceman and jean grey when you need to get to out of reach areas
enemy selection from the comics were decent sabretooth death bird juggernaut zaladane sentinals apocalypse ahab mojo and magneto and there were a variety of weaker enemiesgame missesits bad enough that your mutant powers are limited to a mutant powerbar but i find it ridiculous that releasing wolverines deadly claws are part of his powers and depletes much of his energy bar even when he is standing still
when the power bar goes down hell either retract his claws or hell start uncontrollably slash allover the place while your life bar depletes
after fighting mojo you have to press the reset button right to stop the speading computer virus and move on to astroid m  if you press it wrong you start all over now thats retarted
its a very big deal because you work hard to pass through these first  intense levels
for that reason alone do not get the game for the wii console because i hear that the reset button on that console makes it impossible to get it right
the characters you control  move much too slow except for nightcrawler and their regular attacks are a bit delayed
at least most of the enemies attack at the same speed so thats a little fair but for a sidescrolling game thats a disappointmentwell for starters this game isnt the awesome game from the arcade
while that xmen game was based off of the failed xmen pilot pryde of the xmen and featured wolverine cyclops storm colossus dazzler and nightcrawler this game features wolverine cyclops gambit and nightcrawler with the ability to call on help from storm rogue archangel and icemanyou know how half the episodes of star trek the next generation feature the holodeck going haywire and trying to take over the ship and kill the crew
well xmen face a similar plot when the danger room malfunctions and you are forced to survive dangerous simulation after dangerous simulation
ill be blunt as far as which characters are good all of them except gambit
nightcrawler is clearly the best because of his jump kick and teleport ability cyclops has a good projectible mutant power as well as a high jump wolverine heals at the snails pace of just a fraction of his health every  minutes or so and his claws augment his attacks but gambits mutant power throwing a charged playing card isnt useful
the flight pattern is a wavy back and forth plus it doesnt appear to do much damage
on top of that if you duck to avoid getting shot you will still get hit
in short gambit sucks in this gameanother big disappointment is the sound
while the music to the second level the space station is incredible especially considering the sega genesis standards the rest of the music in the game is lousy
the savage land doesnt even really have music at all mojos level is obnoxious sounding and the lighthouse level sounds terrible as well
were they only capable of producing one good level of musicanother lowpoint in the game is the bosses
xandra lady deathstrike ahab really
ahab
cmon a dumbeddown version of apocolypse and big fat mojo topped off with classic magneto
it would have been cooler to see villains like the blob pyro omega red or mr sinister
i dont even know who xandra isthey also screwed up with midstage bosses
at least they actually had juggernaut and sabretooth in the game but ive always seen those two personified as being much larger than the xmen
in the game they are the same size as everyone elsethe game is more of an action platformer than a side scroller beat em up and is overall very lacking in gameplay
i liked it enough as a kid but considering that genesis supported something as fantastic as a port of the arcade game the punisher and did it well i fail to see why this xmen game is just so paltry and barebonesmy favorite complaint about this game is the conclusion of mojos level
after defeating mojo you continue on until you get to the point where you destroy a computer
you are then instructed by professor x to reset the computer
well unless you knew the solution ahead of time this could be problematic and baffling
it turns out professor x wants you to actually reset your sega genesis
doing so continues the game and takes you to the final level asteroid m a friend had to tell me that when i was a kid not sure if i ever would have figured that one out on my ownmy last complaint is the ending
after defeating magneto you are treatedpunished with a really dull debate in text between professor x and magneto where they argue about the xmen being water and sunlight and evaporation and bringing life and flowersim totally serious its ridiculous
magneto even says to professor x kill me during the conversation
but of course professor x lets magneto go as usual and nothing is actually resolved
what a boring wastegraphics are decent but the gameplay is just too mediocre
to be fair though the mistakes from this game were not repeated in the sequel
boringthis is an awesome game from a great series
phantasy star was kinda like the quotfinal fantasyquot of sega with some profound differences in style and settingthe graphics on this game though they are bit are actually quite good drawn in stylish anime
the music is great easily reflecting the technological setting of the seriesthe gameplay is pretty good although newer rpg gamers might be discouraged from playing this its most definitely quotold schoolquot which means typical turnbased random battles and dungeons that are long mazelike and very complicated to get through
ive been playing rpgs since dragon warrior and even i cant really stand to go through these dungeons
being quotold schoolquot also means that youll have to spend some time just going out and fighting monsters in order to level up for the next coming areasnow this game is quite good but unfortunately the tedium of levelbuilding and the excessively long dungeons take a little bit away from the rating
overall though this game is pretty good if you can still find itcontact is an interesting ds game
interesting interestingi dont read many gaming magazines because unless i found an online offer for a free years subscription i dont think i would ever pay for one
i generally dont read online previews to games either so i have very little idea about games that are about to be releasedcompared to many other ds games contact did have slightly more exposure than other games that were being released around the same time
october of  was a hectic month with touch detective an all these other interesting looking game covers splattered all over gamecrazys gamestops eb games etc
all overso i bought contact the day it came out and i passed up on point blank ds a game i picked up later anyway
contact lends itself to be an interesting rpg like none other i had played before
of course be not being a console gamer i have no idea if theres other games like this one but im sure there arecontact is very nitpicky on the gameplay
you have to wear certain outfits to perform certain tasks
this can get tedious as you need to go all the way back to your base some floating ship or ufo i forget to equip a chefs outfit to cook a fishermans outfit to fly just kidding etc
your inventory slots also have an allotted amount of spaces which allows the player to know exactly how many items can be obtained in the course of the game much unlike the final fantasy series which you need a guide to figure out the master itemweapon listthe story is thick unique
once again you have to associate ds  atlus  unique
its a very interesting somewhat unsuccessful in my opinion implementation of the user you in the gamei wont be a spoiler so lets get to the point
contact is tedious and can get very very redundant
but lets be honest here  arent rpgs supposed to be redundant
arent you supposed to fight monsters to gain exp and money to buy things and buff your characte up so you can go on to do much more of the same throughout the later stages of the gameso it is with contact
it is an active fighting rpg so theres no magic moves or special abilities save a few much like zelda
i think most users will agree that thats what makes the game eventually boringits a ds users cant complain about not getting the full rpg experience as was readily available in pslike rpgs
ds rpgs will stick to the redundant nature of the snes rpg that we all once loved so much a long time ago
gamers have been spoiled by newer flashier rpgs and expect too much from the ds
even final fantasy iii fell short of my expectations but i quickly came to realize it would be this way with ds rpgs for a while
etrian odyssey is a nice fresh rpg thats actually fun
thanks atlusstill its not the greatest game in the world but a decent pickup as are most ds titles
contact was  retail when first released and i dont think its strayed too far from the original price although used it can be picked up for a good price
contact is a very time consuming game and if the value of the game is determined by the length of it then you got yourself a gold mine herecontact for the ds is a weird little rpg that had some hype surrounding it but disregard anything good you might have heard
looking like a bastard offspring of earthbound for the super nintendo contact offers some nice dungeon type areas quirky characters and nice side quests but the rest of it feels as if weve seen all this before and seen it done better to boot
what really hurts contact is the incredibly boring and repetitive combat in which each side trades hits until one goes down
the combat alone makes contact suffer not to mention the bland graphics tacked on touch screen controls and features and a surprisingly short main quest for an rpg
theres some wifi capabilities as well allowing you to obtain some special items via trades with other players and thats about all that contact has to offer
the game has a unique charm to it and its not necessarily a hard game to get into but theres nothing here that brings it to the level of say final fantasy iii
all in all contact isnt a bad game one bit but its far from being anything spectacularthe game is fun and has many fun concepts and some variety to it but i have played better games
there is a real lack of direction and after about  hours of play my interest has somewhat wanedi bought the sega because i still have a ton of games for it and my original system had died years agoideally i would give  stars for the product i received but  for the system in generali was very dissapointed to find upon arrival that the machine i received was absolutely filthy like some slob had been eating over it and scratching it while playing it for quite some time
i understand it is used but seriously they couldnt even wipe it offthe second thing i noticed was that it did not come with  or even one controller even though they are pictured for the itemlastly i purchased this  because it said it had the composite yellow red  white cables instead of a coaxial hookup this was also falsei realize these problems are all the fault of the seller and not of the system but make sure you look into the seller first mine was up video gamesi think this system is pretty solid system
there were some good games for it and a lot of them
for me i didnt play this system very much growing up so there is not as much of a nostalgic feeling for me
the particular system i purchased was in a little rough shape as the power button sticks and sometimes does not work
besides that though its worth owning then again i own about every system
im biasediwas looking for the power cable  av cable game controllers but there was nonethe only thing shipped was sega genesis console that was very dirtyiwas looking for a sega genesis box but it was shipped with nothing this is the best version of mortal kombat  this version has good graphics as well as some nice fatalities and nice looking stages but the some of the fun and some of my favorites from the first  games arent on this one
it wouldve been better if the masked ninja subzero was put on here
this unmasked version aint as fun
and the babality is very stupid and pointless
but the pit fatality is the most gruesome pit fatality of them all
you enter in the code for the fatality and your character uppercuts his opponent but instead of your opponent just falling to the bridge he falls off the bridge and into the pit and his body gets cut up by a group of rolling spikes
an ok game to play if youre into fighting games
but for a better experience play ultimate mortal kombat  on the sega saturnmortal kombat  for psx was and still is pretty goodthe graphics in this game were very good at the timealmost everything about this game was true to the arcadeexcept for the loading times of coursethe psx version of mk was the version to have back in butnow i would saythat if you want the true arcade versionjust pick up midway arcade treasures  for ps which includes the arcade mk game on thereif you dont own a psand just an old psxget mortal kombat trilogywhich is a whole lot better than by the waymk trilogy will work in the psonly get this version of mk if you want it for your video gameand or mk collectionthis is volume  of the five volume set of namco arcade classics
it includes super pac man xeviuos mappy gaplus grobda and dragon buster
super pacman is the best of these for those that remember it
xevious was a great space based shootemup that can be very addictive
however grobda was the worst of this lot just another dungeon crawl with unappealing graphics
if you can find a copy it might be worth a play or two to relive the classics especially super pacman
however it is very hard to get and considered collectibleive played alot of rpgs
rpgs are actually a preference of mine
ive practically played all of the genres on nintendo playstation and some on cpu and sega
this is by far the hardest ive come across though
everythings playable till you get to dowaine a town across the mountains using the submarine
once you get there theres all these enemies that cause status effects on you and raise themselves
besides the fact that youll miss hitting the enemies here and there the game gets freaking impossible from here
whoever designed this game is an idiot
they should at least make it playable
i have an emulator on my computer where i can save wherever i want and even then its impossible
morons oi agree that this game requires strategy but what isnt said is that the game seriously lacks a sense of balance
it isnt too hard to go through the tower but the you get to the earth cave and bang you take three or so hits from a zombie and its all over
actually get to the scion at the end of the cave and youll be gone in less that that
i like the fact that in other rpgs you can actually level up to get stronger than a boss but in this game the bosses get harder so you have to use quotstrategyquot aka luck to beat certain bosses
it could have been so good if it were balanced like final fantasy games which in the old days actually did require strategyyeah the first thing i think when someone mentions this game is all the reviews ive seen online that mention the extreme challenge
ive heard many many times that the difficulty is the biggest reason this game is inferior to the first installment
yeah that might be true ok i wont deny it its completely true
but there are some nice things about itone its all about the action
the action levels in the previous actraiser were fantastic and the ones in this game are nearly as good probably
but then you quickly find out the difficulty has been turned up a few notches and you wanna run away
i honestly havent played this game that much
my dads exgirlfriend bought a super nes one time so me and her could go back and forth exchanging games but the relationship between her and my dad was always kind of rocky so not much exchanging occurred after allanyway she bought actraiser ii as her first purchase unaware that the challenge of the game was set on extremely hard even on easy and it would stay that way throughout the game making you want to go crazy giving you a feeling of not feeling good at all about yourself after completing a level because youd know the next level would be just as hard or even harder
people who are able to go through this game without cheating and defeat the final boss youre the best
actually maybe if you practice one level over and over and finally beat it you would feel good about it
but then the next level comes along and smack back down to getting your butt kicked againhey  i wasnt aware of the challenge either until i got the internet
hard game here folks
hard
definitely not a good game to recommend to someone just learning to play video games
also not a good game for someone who gives up easily like me
i remember a certain theme song in this game that was incredibly warped the way it had a delicate and dark quiet melody
i think it was the main map screen if there even is one i cant remember the game very well
that was some damn intense music there now
i also remember the backgrounds of the levels had a very pretty appearance and the detail was wonderful which is what weve come to expect from a system as fantastic as the super nesas for the decision on the part of the game makers to remove the simulation part of the game i dont have a problem with it
its not that big of a deal if you ask me
what drags the game down for me lies straight in the difficulty and nothing else
a good challenge is a nice way to start the day but darn not this kind of challengewell the final verdict if you want this game go ahead and get it
i wont stop you
but remember those reviewers on the internet speak the truth this game is oh so oh so challengingthe review before this one really pumps this game up like its yoshis island or something
yeah its cool and worth your while but lets think about some  stars games for snes like yoshis island zelda a link to the past secret of mana donkey kong country  amp  super mario world amp super castlevavia
is this game really on a  star level
no
i dont mean to downgrade a decent game
but some reviewers give away  star ratings like candy
when in fact its just a run of the mill d side scroller
nothing special like the other titles i listed above
in fact joe amp mac for snes is simular but much better
come on people be atleast a little picky
i take your reviews to advisementa basic bit d adventure button masher
the only real way to advance through the stages is to tap one of the two attack buttons
graphics arent impressive and cut scene story lines are like most snes games are as stale as frozen bagels
rather mediocre compared to other games of same categorythe music in this game is real goodthere is a lot of aliens in this game biglittle and eggs tooas a kid i remember this being one of my favorite gamesi dont know if it wasnt that great if it simply didnt hold up over the years or what but when i replayed it i didnt get the same enjoyment as i do from the other games ive reboughtgood game except medium mode is kind of hard lol an its not as good as tmt but at least you can shoot thingscastlevania fans must appreciate a solid challenge because to me super castlevania iv is a really hard game
theres nothing like dying a million times to make myself feel really dumb only to come online to see many people actually think the game is simple
i cant believe people think this game is easyi cant even beat the game with a game genie infinite life cheat code
i can only assume people who think this game is easy are comparing the difficulty to the more challenging castlevania games on the nes or something
if thats the case youre right
those old nes castlevania games truly test your patience
at least in super castlevania iv i can manage to survive halfway throughcomparing super castlevania iv to other games on the super nes like zelda link to the past or mega man x its a really tough game
despite that its a pretty fun game and has a really good soundtrack
youll be humming along to the theme in the opening level just you wait
just beware of the severe difficulty in the later levelsi remember reading about the ameiga version of this game back in  in the questbusters magazine
im old and proud of it
i couldnt buy it because my apple iigs wouldnt play it but i did get my hands on the snes version
i must say that even in  when i bought the snes version i didnt like it and had to return it to the store
it was hollow and monotonous and very tedious at times
however their was one thing that i did like the castles
they were rendered very well for the times and set the mood perfectly
the castle music especially prince haaggkkhens castle was very appropriate for the mood of a dark and mysterious castle
princesse naaktkhas castle music was sinister as wellthe reason i can spell thier names is because i just solved drakkhenkh pronounced by opening your throat this morning
i had rebought a used copy of the gamethe outdoor music is sometimes depressing but the quality is there
if you are looking for an s rpg look elsewhere theyre are a lot of good ones in the auctions and ebay as well as second hand stores
i solved it once and it is farily entertaining at times but i will not play it again
its too tediousa casual playing of the game reveals a very interestnig and intriguing story of a line of drakkhen half humanhalf dragon families in feud and cross country trekking of a small group of four mousey wanting and happless humans
the   regions of iceair swampwater forestearth and desertfire are on a rectangualr island each region ruled by  drakkhens always one is evil one is not and in love with a foriner from another region of some sorts
i like the story and the  royalty line lovehate senario
prince naatakkhanyour main drako dude at near end game his evil sis princess naatakkhaair hordkenthe mixed emotioned questgiver who wants to ask you a few favors and kill you at the same time
 his sis princess hordkha the captured oneearth haagkhaanthe zombie lover and who captured hordkhens sisprincess haagkhabenevoent queen sends you out for the tears and gives you a nice sword or three the desert princess haazuluka and her evil bro haazulakaan who wants her dead
sounds like bad drakonic theater to me
however i seriously do have mixed feelings about the gameplay
the castles are very gothic and well done very good artwork and atmospherefor the time however the outofdoors despite some reveiws on game encyclopidia are dull monotonous and of no interest except for the occasional random event or monster
exploring the outdoors for the sake of it as one revewer said is completely and utterly pointless as all the treespinescactor ice burg letus are the same
the music is awsome for a primitive barely out of nes snes game
a sort of funky digital slap bass or stun gitar cant tell which coupled with the moog s discosoul with a few medolic yet sadsometime depressing in the swamp but very good quality music that is emakulate considering limitations of the time the castles are more errie and gothic the emplemented music as a great additon to the already gothic atmospheric artword
now snes also adding outofdoors music not included in the pc version
the tracks are done by hiroyuki masuno and lsvd programmer  they quite probably also did dungeon masters snes version and a apple iigs game i once played called ancient land of ys because the style and sound is the samethough the out of doors is a time consuming trek of blank nothing and pointless houses of generic elves commenting about the weather or a late meeting and rarely useful the scout can utilies her teleport spellthough mines intel seems a bit low and can never get to a decent level for mana you will and cover much ground in minutes utilzeing teleportation spells
land travel is quite literally an hour hoofn it topbottom leftright and is completely pointless and a waste of valuble time
it is in a d setting and is quite nice for the limitations of a snes as a vista of daynight cycles in all habitats and strange and brighterthanmost constellations that turn into monsters to a point the lands view is nice but then it is tedious and boring
the high point is the musicmuzak and the rp character developement though  trys and your out if you have  superior characters and  stinks like a  then it is pointless and the prior  must be dumped if you want a decent   youd think after data east made that mistake nintendo would let you reverse the last one
this is the kemcoseika versionnow just seika for super nintendo
originaly it was ported to the amiga by a french co then americanised with enhanced playablity by i think de in   read questbusters then attracted to it and got the  snes versionit took me quite some time to get used to all the different control icons
the only way i got ahead a few levels was by letting my characters be invisible
what i dont like is that you can aquire all kinds of equipment but you dont have enough space to keep it all
also im having a hard time finding my way around on the world map
i continuously seem to wander around in circles
so this is not one of my favorite gamesfinal fantasy mystic quest is in my opinion the best possible way to gain access to the unholy glory of ffmystic quest
mystic quest allows you but a glimpse of the history and magic which dwells within the sacred world of final fantasy but it is a glimpse that will leave you salivating for more
mystic quest is the best way to begin your training in the art of ff combat
you will by no means be able to obtain the godly mastery of cloud with just this game but it will open up your eyes to a whole new world of mystery and wonderi suggest that you purchase ffmystic quest at the same time that you buy this because after your done with mystic quest if you dont immedietly have some more final fantasy to play you will probably become possessed with a murderous rage and you will not be sane enough to make it to the store to buy ff
in fact you should probably leave ff in a powered up playstation at all times because that is the only way to prevent yourself from commiting a murdersuicide during the load screen
even me the greatest ff fan in the world has had some problems with thatbuy mystic quest the prequel to the greatest game of all time ffmystic quest and be prepared to enter upon a majestic adventure from which you will never returnthat should be the real titlei played this game about  years agoi liked it then but i havent played it since i finished it  years ago
there is no real story the charachters are lifeless and boring and the graphics were not too hot
i dont remember muich about the plot though so i cant really talk about iti just know its basicly a dummied down ff gameskip this one and get the astonishingly great game final fantasy this was super nintendos cross between a final fantasy rpg game and a zelda type rpg game
to start with the graphics are very basic it looks more like it could be a nintendo game not snes and the plotline is simplistic going to different areas to defeat a big boss and get an item that lets you go to the next area
simple isnt it
but then the real worthwhile part about this game is its originality you can jump in the game you can cut down trees with your axe blow up walls with your bombs and climb walls with your claws
another interesting part is that you can see the enemies as characters on the overhead map
so you can run into them and fight them but then rather than fighting them like zelda it takes you to a battle screen like a true rpg
something else is that rather than a real overhead map of the world where you explore you start at an area which gives you four choices of where to go up down left and right
you select the path and the hero will take that path automatically no monsters or anything
the monsters are all inside of the areas towns caves and cavernstwo ways that are comparable in principle to this game and ff
both are easy games to complete and feature nice lengthy quests well this is decent for its time   hours but its the maturity level that makes them differentbeing a college film student who isnt one trying to get into film to make more dude wheres my car
type movies im one for the cinematic and dramatic flairs
ff is a great game to introduce people into the world of rpgs with but like the esrb knew it isnt a game to play when young
its heartbreaking and full of killing both good and bad
this game here is more of the innocent story with very simplistic locations interface story and dialoguehowever if youre a seasoned rpg veteran whos used to ffx and such dont expect much from this game
itll just be a shallow set of battles and treasure chests where youll gain little more than just saying that you beat another rpg in the world
the graphics were no better than ff in most respects the battle system and interfaces as simplistic as one can comprehend apart from the jumping which helps you with some really complex mazes and there is vurtiously no character developmenthowever keeping with the final fantasy tradition until ffix or maybe viii the music is phenomenal in almost every way which is something that to me alone adds tons of replay
play  hours of monsterkilling with a cool soundtrack every year or two sounds cool huh
also if youre interested in every buying rpg maker or one of those professional rpg makers this is a good style of game to make as a first entrythis game has charm as its more simplistic than even the most imaginative person can imagine
weak entry to the series
youd better believe it
however my rating more reflects when this was one of the only games i had to play and with it being so i came to appreciate it
 besides it has a plot at all unlike some of squares slightly more recent titles like legend of mana and chrono cross just dont expect anything remotely that of kingdom hearts front mission  or the more professionally made final fantasysive never been able to enjoy the final fantasy series as much as most people
the storyline is quite big and the turn based action is decent but it just leaves me underwhelmed when the game is finally over
in final fantasy ii the graphics arent that great
even when the game was popular the graphics never looked that great in my opinion
i dont know everyone loves final fantasy and i guess i have no choice but to recommend it to any fan of rpgs
just remember that better graphics have come along since the early s and featuring betterlooking graphics is the best direction an rpg game can takelets get something strate first  this game is really final fantasy iv
the only reason its called final fantasy ii is because final fantasy ii amp iii for nintendo never came to the us
so nintendo decided to just skip those numbers so no one would feel like their missing out on something
with that said final fantasy ii way a good addition to the snes library
although there was some cencoring done to the language and even though some questionable sceans were cut it was one of super nintendos best games
but if you have a playstation too just get final fantasy chronicles and get the uncencored vertionthe levels take place in a different country you have to play it on expert level to get the whole ending   there are a couple new character to pick from besides haggar from the original final fightin final fight  newly elected mayor mike hagger took on the streets of metro city
now hes out to take on the world
metro citys favorite wrestlerturnedmayor is back to save guys fiance and future fahterinlaw with the help of guys future sisterinlaw maki and carlos an excon whom hagger somehow helped out
oddly enough guy makes no appearence except for a powerup figurine and a picture in the intronow there is a twoplayer mode and two new characters on the scene
the graphics are slightly better in some ways than sness first final fight the music is a bit of a letdown and maki looks dropdead gorgeous
thats about the gist of itfinally let me just go on record in case you have been wondering if anything was taken out of the us version of final fight  the answer is yes
like final fight and final fight guy for the super famicom the japanese version final fight  included at least two female thugsi like the game
the only problem is that it does have a glitch
one of the level monsters is not visible
other than that so far the game is goodi got super ghosts and ghouls at the recommendation of a friend and was initially very impressed with this game
the music is nearperfect the level design is very colorful and welldone and the enemies look really good
so why give this game a star rating
what could have gone wrong
two big things
first of all once your character jumps you have completely lost control of him until he lands
if you make a wrong jump tough luck you have to see it through
in a game that involves lots of jumping and jumping over level hazards this was just a bad idea
secondly if you get hit once you lose your armor and are in your underwear
you get hit again and youre dead
there are no checkpoints in the levels and its near impossible to get your armor back
these levels just have death written all over them
to top it all off youre supposed to be arthur
you know the arthur from myth and legend
the one who assembled the knights of the round table
the holder of excaliber
why on earth is this guy such a wimp
on the bright side you can get lots of cool powerups for both your weapons and armor but even with upgrades if you get hit twice youre dead
why does this game even have deathtraps and lethal stage hazards
its like deathinsurance
did they think there wasnt enough stuff in the levels to kill you as it is
dont get me wrong this game does have some redeeming qualities but bottom line this is one of the most ridiculously hard games ive ever played
it causes me more frustration than anything else
if you want to try this game out go right ahead but it would probably be easier to fight real ghouls and ghosts than try and play through this gamei was no fan at all of space side view shooter games but this one caught my interest
you start the game by selecting all of your weapons then you are sent out on your mission to fly through scores of enemy space fleets destroying them to collect powerups and at the end of each level destroy bad bosses
the bad part about the game is that when you die you lose all of your powerups and start from scratch making it very difficult to get more powerups later in the game because of the difficulty
another huge downfall is that the sixth level is virtually impossible without having super sharp reflexes
its a classic that might not be for everyonekeep in mind i said coolest not best
and although it gets  stars be sure that is a very high pilotwings is a simple sort of flight simulator for the snes
it has surprisingly good flight physics for its age mediocre graphics and some wonderfully laughable music read bad
the music is great because it tries to have different parts and a melody and bassline using terrible quality beep musicyou fly the lightplane rocketbelt and hanglider as well as sky dive through rings arches and bars and then attempt to land accurately
fairly simple game play but infuriatingly difficult at times especially in expert mode which you get after the first four levels and the top secret helicopter rescue mission which is awesome
learning to land in sky diving is crazy hard but i got it down eventually
on the other hand rocketbelt is easy enough to get  points and the bonus level so it balances outthere are two secret bonus levels which are weird
they deserve little further commentpilotwings was pretty fun in the end and is cool as an old snes game
if there were more helicopter levels encompassing some sort of actual story it would have been incredible
sadly it has little actual substance but a lot of replay value because you can jump right in and the whole point of the game is practicingpilotwings isnt really worth buying unless youre feeling like more after the n version and are willing to sacrifice graphics
or if you are crazy and bored
if you already own it but have never gotten into or played it which is understandable at least go play the helicopter level password probably
it is funpilotwings was one of the first releases for the super nes so you cant expect much from the dish graphicsbut this game is so much fun
it takes alot of skill to land vehicles and i think the hardest levels is the skydiving oneoccaisionally youll mess up and its entertaining
if you do not open your parachute on cue in the skydiving levels you crash through the ground
or if you dont set the guy with the jetpack down slowly an explosion occurs
land on the white bumps and you go boingi agree the music is so funny to listen to especially on the jetpack level where you here the famous horrible singerit took me forever to make it to the first helicopter level because on the th series of levels well its almost impossible to beatlanding the airplane is also hard mess one thing up you end up crashingim going to keep this game because its sooooooooooooooooo funnysecret of mana is one of the most popular rpgs ever sold for the snes
its popularity is wellearned
it has an intriguing plot enjoyable characters and dialogues and fun boss battles
so why give this game a  star rating
ill tell you why
you collect elementals as you go through the game and the only way to level up their powers from  to  is to continuously use their powers over and over again
sometimes you have to use a spell  times before it goes up in level
and youre putting yourself at a big disadvantage if you dont level up your elementals as you go through the game
this takes hours away from moving through the stages and storyline and has been a huge source of aggravation for me
but maybe i shouldnt be so hard the bosses are fun to fight
except at the beginning when they heal all the damage you dealt to them every  minutes
dont get me wrong this game is a lot of fun
it just has some rough edges that need to be smoothed out
the game is pretty long and your attacks get pretty powerful and the magic attacks are a lot of fun to watch
i just look back and think about how this could have been one of the best rpgs ever but because of a few critical mistakes this game just falls short of greatness
it just ends up being average insteada classic no doubt but the figuring out who to talk to and what to do is hardly worth it
well it is if you use the internet to figure it out also the game you find yourself constantly shooting the same enemies over and over again to get levels and money for weapons
i would give this game a  stars since it can really get you into the game and the environment is strange to say the least
odds are if you arent using a walkthrough you will most likely give up before you beat itthis is the first star fox game and its not like the others
it was fun back then but now its bad
the graphics r horrible even for the snes the sound is messed up it does not have a good story its very hard and the controls r hard to use
yes its the one of the first game on the snes but its not very good
its still kind of fun to play when u have nothing else to doi got this game thinking it would be the coolest and it turned out to be alright but not suberb
the game itself is fun graphicswhich i make a big deal out of were like the beginning of d since it does have polygon graphics the ground is not detailed just green with wierd dots on it
in space though you have the choice to be in your cocpit or viewing the backside of the ship
your buddies toad falcon and rabbit say the same things over and over againoverall this game is pretty exciting but you may wanna think it overstarfox is an mediocre space shooter
it is not bad or anything but it has become rather dated
the graphics were a revolution for the super nes as starfox was one of the first d games and the first to use the super fx chip which boosted the processor of the super nes and somehow upgraded the graphics to what looks like although i am not certain bit
but in the middle of  with the brand new hd wiiu launching and jawdropping playstation games coming out the graphics are pretty poor
not that i expected a game from  to look good i am just pointing that out
the actual gameplay is to pilot the arwing around and shoot everything in your path
it is by far epic but that is about all there is to the game
the plot is shallow and the game is rather short
so overall even with epic music and shooting starfox did not live up to what i thought it would be
it is a rather interesting piece to my super nes collection because of the fx chip and d visuals but the actual game is kind of weakshort game
ugly graphics too but for some reason i found it oddly fun
i donno maybe its just mesuper street fighter ii the new challengers released for the snes in  is the sequel to sf ii turbo hyper fighting
after the success of the previous sf games capcom wasnt about to release street fighter iii yet
instead it tweaked the cast of the previous games a bit gave them a variety of new coloured outfits and introduced four new fighters cammy a british intelligence officer t hawk a massive red indian fei long a bruce lee look and actalike probably the answer to mortal kombats liu kang and dee jay a crazy jamaican fullcontact fighter
considering all this the game has to be even better than sf turbo right
thats not quite the case thoughi understand that the arcade game changed the way it sounds from its predecessors by using new quotq soundquot technology
probably due to this the sound effects and music quality in the snes conversion is quite poor
i never realised that audio actually plays an important part in fighting games till i played thisespecially since i played sf turbo before
the energetic deep voice of the announcer of turbo is gone
it is replaced by a boring and clumsysounding voice
it is great that the characters sound different from each other this time around but some character voices are pretty lame especially the ko
sounds made by mbison vega in japan and guile
and dont even get me started on the quotsonic boomquot voice of guile or the quottiger uppercutquot voice of sagat or the quothadokenquot voice of ken
very lame indeed
the background music is okay but lacks the quality of turbo by a wide marginthen to the graphics
again must be the fact that the quotryu introquot took up too much memory
the visuals are dull and are almost sega genesis quality
however the new backgrounds are pretty decent to look at
moving onto the gameplay
the ability to play in turbo speed is gone
its back to threestar speed again
playing it in anything less than that is a horrible experience
the original cast have their moves either improved or weakened or new moves gained
for example ken has gained a flaming dragon punch whereas ryus hurricane kick is severely weakened
guile has lost the ability to connect twice with his flash kick as has sagat with his closeup fierce kick
among the new characters fei long and cammy are interesting dee jay is awkward but powerful and t hawk is a clumsy zangiefish wrestler with some style
to freshen things up there are various modes in the game including super battle versus battle group battle tournament and time challenge plus new endings for some of the original castoverall it seems super sf is quite a solid game which will satisfy street fighter fans without a doubt and is more enjoyable than many of the other snes fighting games but lacks the longlasting appeal of its predecessors due to the average visual and audio qualitynice but irrelevant nowadaysget street fighter  and  and the remix on xbox livethose are the bestits too bad konami never released an arcadeperfect version of the first teenage mutant ninja turtles arcade game on the snes
actually this one isnt a perfect translation either as its missing some digitized voices
a playable april wouldnt have hurt either but at least she doesnt get kidnappedanywho although the title may be sic teenage mutant ninja turtles iv turtles in time thats only because there were three tmnt games previously released on the original nintendo entertainment system not counting tournament fighters
this is actually the second game released in the arcadesnow for the actual review
the game takes you through uh i dunno orso levels of repetitive nonstop action double entendre
you decide
as usual you get to choose between leonardo michelangelo donatello and raphael sorry venus you werent here yet
the subtitle turtles in time comes into play when you almost defeat shredder and then are hurled back through time to orso bc then forward to 
 
 
 
 then back to  where you fight shredder for supposedly the last time
thats my story and im sticking to itthe snes port of wolfenstein d isnt really that good and the censorship gets in the way of what made the original so great but at the end of the day its still wolfenstein
if youre a wolfenstein fan and a snes fan add this to your collection
the levels are slightly different from the original which makes it a somewhat different run through from the original which will still keep you entertained despite censorship and low quality graphics compared to pci have to agree with everyone here on the censorship issue
i was extremely  because it was  
use whatever cuss words you find necessary
i guess they were worried about getting in trouble like getting a bad name racist issues or whatever
you know how some people are they would start something and i guess thats what theyre thinking
anyways the original wolfenstein d is classic just like doom
the snes version is in no comparison but its still worth playing
this game is pretty rare now
if you beat return to castle wolfenstein tides of war you will be able to play the originalconsidering the high price of the game and having never played a final fantasy game i decided to download this on wii
up until the issue started i loved the beautiful game
the storyline was plain beautiful
it was all about magic and technology colliding rebels trying to squash the evil empire and a helpless girl who was enslaved
the graphics while appearing to be basic became quite advanced after a while
the music was triumphant and bold fitting the game perfectly
however nintendo or square altered the vc port
the save feature was completely removed and i could not save at all
what was their excuse
it was you can now use the software suspension feature which basically means you can exit the game and it will pause until you come back
however if for some reason the game is cut off without suspending either by upset brothers or power surges you get to start the rpg all over
on the final boss when the power goes out
back to being enslaved in the beginning
also the game is difficult
i dont mind the difficulty level at all but if i get a single game over it goes right back to the opening credits
how does nintendo expect me to beat a long challenging and very complicated rpg without dying
now i have three options i will have to buy the original copy for  to  dollars most likely i will have to play the updated d port on ds somewhat likely i will have to download the same d remake now overpriced and on a touchscreen tablet
unlikelyi dont mean to bring the ratings down at all i just want to warn about the vc ripoffall the mortal kombat games are awesome save  which sucks and it the cheapest of the bunch
the ai in these games is nothing but cheap stupid and pointless
no matter how good you are at these games the ai is magically better
you can beat them to danger then they magically dont die and can trow you in your mid sweep or uppercut wtf
the player cannot do that
when you jump they knock you down if you jump ten times they knock you down ten times and they punch you over and over till you die they are nothing but cheap predictable losers just like midway if you played the mkvsdc trashafter wily is imprisoned wily has brand new robotmasters that are reactivated and break the bad doctor out of jail
mega man speeds to the rescue of his city and meets a new robot named bass whose origin and objective are unclear initally but through a major plot twist wilys plan comes full circle
heres the lowdown on mega mans first adventure on the snesthe goodthe level designs are pretty good by standard
we get some interesting new bosses including shade man and turbo man shade mans music rocks and his stage reminded me of castlevania
the rush adaptors from mm are mashed into one rush adaptor here that allows temporary flying and a unique quotbusterquot in which mega man throws his fist at the enemy
there is also a new rush function called quotrush searchquot in which rush can find hidden items including the exit option
i also loved how this game connected with mmthe badthe sprites in this game particularly mega mans is funky
the music is mostly subpar with only a handful of tunes that are memorable and the sound effects sound like they came off of a game boy
while the level designs were alright mega mans sprite is just too damn big for the levels and this goes against manuvering
proto man also doesnt do much but give advice here and i wished he was given more game time that doesnt come til mm
like mm this game seems like it was rushed and it is the rarest mega man game known to manoverallwhile this game holds onto many qualities that the series has it has many factors going against it
if capcom had spent more time on the game before its release it wouldve probably been a great mega man game
alas it didnt come out too well
my suggestion only get it if you are a mega man fan and get it for a reasonable price
its not a gamers heaven unfortunatelythis is same type of av cable that came bundled with the snes n and nintendo gamecube
the build quality is of course the best youll probably find if its an official nintendo product however i would highly recommend buying the svideo version of this cable
even if you can only find rd party cables you wont regret purchasing one as the video signal will drastically increase compared to composite
two leads on the svideo cable carry analog color and contrast information to your display while composite video does this on one lead
the result is a much sharper image just look on youtube for comparisons
svideo has very little pixel bleeding while composite video blends the colors together producing a very poor imagei also buy this for cousin  he had to replace gamecube  av cable used it  everyday an enjoyed uesd iti specifically ordered this item from this seller because the listing title gave the impression it was a nintendo brand original cable it was not
does the cable work
yes
is this cable poor quality
no but its not as good as the original
then what are you complaining about
the principle
if i wanted an off brand av cable i could have bought one from ebay for a dollar
the listing should be properly titled
i want what i ordered and at the three dollars i paid for this its not even worth my time returningits a cheap knock off of the nintendo brand but it does what you want it too picture is not what it is scamthe cord is a genius idea now someone just needs to improve the technology
the only flaw i saw was my snes graphics went down considerably which was a true bummercareful
even though it shows the official nd generation controller from nintendo what you get can be closely described as a cheap knockoff
not even good for replacement parts what you get is a controller with thin plastic hinges on the shoulder buttons a feel of thin and light plastic and a casing that is quite obviously cast from the original
the main body if you have access to a websafe color picker is a color close to the color dcbd
the decal around the bayx buttons is cddb
all the buttons are plastic instead of the start and select buttons being rubber like the original
the cord is short
too short
about  feet  cm
buttons feel clicky but solid
taking apart the controller you are presented with a generic and obviously unpolished pcb
wires from the cord are directly soldered to the board instead of plugged in by way of a microconnector like in the original
plastic tags the things that are usually the result of poor plastic casting are everywhere on seamsbut for only a pittance i dont offer my criticism with any weight
you get what you pay for and in this case its not very much
it works for what its intended to do but i wouldnt be surprised if theres a significant amount of defective productsmy advice would be to keep searching the second hand shops and horde and preserve the working controllers
i have a couple that need new r buttons as years of use have broken the sturdy plastic hinges
hinges that have metal pegs in the originals
the nintendo logo is wrong a good sign its not an original
however if this is your only recourse you could do worse
this is basically a replica
and a good one at that
update ive been informed that what i got quite possibly is an original controller with just a replacement yxba decal
even though i think the seller said up front it was a replicait serves its purpose
you just cant play any video games on your snes console unless you have this controllerplain and simple
this controller is not made by nintendo
it was merely approved by nintendo considering the seal is on the boxthese controllers were made in china
the buttons are the wrong size the cord is  the length its supposed to be the sticker around the buttons are tan instead of gray the front logo is wrong and the buttons dont feel right
all traditional super nintendo controllers are made nintendo in japan not chinai will say just stick with getting an interact controller with the multicolored buttons similar to a super famicom controller
if you have played donkey kong country  and go into the banana bird caves look at the crystal colors
that is what the multicolored controller should look like
i only had to replace my controller because up was giving me some problems by having most games zig zag instead of going straightunfortunately since nintendo no longer makes super nintendo controllers you are stuck with these crappy ones
but at least these are somewhat usable unlike some that i have triedwhen i got it it would not stay on bought a new ac adapter works better now lines in the games but i think its my big tv
it was very fast shippingthis game is really nothing special though it does provide a decent challenge
you have to explore the adams family estate grounds which has some creative environments
gameplay is basic platformingif chrono trigger is widely considered the best turn based rpg ever i guess theres no argument to say otherwise
certainly no argument from me given the limited amount of experience i have with these type of games but keep in mind i hate turn based rpgs
i avoided them like the plague during my super nes obsession  years ago
i think the combat stinks because you have to take hits to actually deliver hits during combat hence the turn based part of the genre and the storyline is usually overlong elaborate and exceptionally grand and elegant in a phonyuninteresting kind of way
the presentation is the same unbearably pretentious way
if this were a movie id get completely lost or uninterested in a matter of minutes and would shut it off but for the sake of a video game with a reputation as being the best ever and a cant miss title i decided to keep goingchrono triggers storyline is enticing and lures me in during the first half but then other characters get thrown into the story such as schala melchior janus and prophet and it turns extremely confusing in a hurry
the game should have continued the pace it had in the first half with the robot really incredible that i actually feel sympathy for a robot in a video game of all places but the game manages to make me feel bad for him and even though i hate that a frog is part of the characters since it just seems totally silly to take an amphibian seriously hes at least sometimes memorable
aylas indiscernible english is a chore to read for the player added worse by her frequent appearances throughout the quest ugh
marle is confusing in the beginning which probably should have been taken as an indication that this game was going to be difficult to follow from a storyline perspective
i guess shes a princess
and shes several other people too
who really knowsmagus is supposed to be the bad guy but then a character named lavos comes out of nowhere and i get lost
right when glenn and cyrus appear thats when the confusion escalates and loses me to the point that i was never able to recover
the truth is a video game storyline needs to be kept short and simple for me to understand
chrono trigger is the exact opposite of that
its cool if you guys like it though
i wont knock the game and give it a low rating just because i have trouble understanding sophisticated storylines in video games
this is a fault of mine not the game
but perhaps the worst aspect is all the time travelling
now im totally lost
i cant keep track of all the past present and future events that take place
knowing exactly what to do with a mess of timeline portals has to result in me using a faq to figure outdo they still create turn based rpgs these days
i cant bother to keep up with video games like i did when i was a kid
i like the magic spells with the lightning fireballs icecube attacks etc
these are fun to watch and were really impressive back in the mid s
anyway a star rating is fair
this has to be the best turn based rpg ive ever played given its only the second one ive ever played super mario rpg being the other
take that for what its worthmega man x is an how can i say it
an ok game
its fun but the part with the chip that you can only put in one of mega mans armor parts is really annoying
why cant you upgrade all of mega mans stuff
kind of boring but its mega man so its not all that badi much prefer the original mega man series to this but the mmx games themselves have been fun with enough similar game elements as the original series
basically youre megaman x hunting and bringing down maverick robots but in this game you can also play as zeroi liked this game because it resembles a mario game to be honest
you walk around eating things spitting things out and flying
this game is really fun
i like the fact that when you eat certain things and press the down button you will turn into something else that will help you along your gameplay
it can get slow in some areas but it picks up
i cant think of any cons for this game
like i stated earlier its a fun game and its kind of like a mario gamei would like to start by saying this was a great beginning to a wonderful franchise sorta after early s i feel harvest moon has gone way downhill but anywhoo
you get a farm and decide to try to revive it and in two years the town decides if you get to stay or not
the game flows but is a little glitchy
not enough to affect playthe short days will keep you on your seat convincing yourself you are gonna stop just after one more day
the pros are as followed addicting simplistic game play smooth controls this is definitely one of the flashier snes titles kept me seated till the end your horse can be used to put items in shipping binif you enjoyed other harvest moons or if even the sound of this game catches your attention it probably will be a positive experience
this one starts out hard thoughthe days dont seem long enough at first but once you get better tools it gets much easier
however i have a few gripes which areno item rucksackcarrying  item at a time is extremely time consuming and annoyingeven though the short days work for the game at times its annoying that its impossible to talk to everyone give gifts to everyone  ie no rucksack  and take care of crops all in one daynot only can you not grow and plant crops in winter  like most hm games but not in fall either to my knowledge the game actually ends after the two years are upall in all a great game however not worth a  price tag
you could by a  and hm  with that yeah that would be tight or back to nature
also with a wii its available for download on wii channel for  dollars
if you are a fanatic though i guess the cartridge would make on heck of a collectors item to  starsi bought a super nintendo especially just for this game when it came out back in around  it was the coolest game at the arcades at the time and just about every young boy to teenagers wanted a home port of this game
street fighter ii and mortal kombat changed video game fighting games forever introducing standards for special moves combinations graphics and even the way it sounds overall
in its day this game and mortal kombat  where the  games on any boys xmas listit did soon change as street fighter ii champion edition hyper edition came to the arcades
so sega consoles got champion edition and it revved up the whole nintendo vs sega debates but then snes got turbo edition which was both champion edition and hyper edition in one
no one really played champion edition they stuck to hyper especially with a cheat to enter the capcom code and play it at  star speeds
pretty much like what happened to this game it was good in its day but fell victim to upgrades
if its not for collectors purposes i cant see what anyone would buy this original version over its later updates unless its to see just a couple of moves that where not transported over the next versions which is mostly just a few light moves on some chars that you never used and a couple of zangiefs holds that you never even noticed where taken out of champion edition and so forthi really got out of the whole street fighter thing around the time of super sfii turbo
i have had very little interest in the anime styles its gone towards since in alpha versions
plus i cant keep up with them there must be a million different versions of sf games by now
but this is where it all started
and this is the true sf game that is responsible for all those clones of this game
but nothing compares to ssfii
it has since breathed new life again on the gameboy advance
i cant remember what its called but its pretty much the same with some new extras included and akuma
but super sfii was a remake and redesign of this game so if you want original looking graphics or to see what it was like when it all began then check this game outit was the snes versions that dominated the market in sfii sales for home consoles
pretty much all due to segas crappy controller layoutsi have not played it yet but there is a game on ps called hyper street fighter ii anniversary edition or something like that
apparently you can choose between original champion and super street fighter ii games a couple of reviews say the coding isnt quite right but i hope to bring you a review about that game soonthe magical quest starring mickey mouse is one of the many games that capcom made that had disney characters during the nintendo vs sega era
in this game you play as mickey who is on a quest to rescue pluto from big bad peteas you progress through the game you get outfits that give mickey a wide range of new abilities
when mickey gets the magicians outfit he can attack enemies with magic
the firefighters outfit lets him spray water using a fire hose to do various things like moving blocks
the mountaineers outfit gives mickey access to using a grappling hook to swing off of certain objectsat certain points in the game mickey can purchase items such as a larger capacity of magic and water or more healththis game however is really short
and like most games made around this time if you skip something you cannot go back
there is a great plus in this game for people who want a challenge the hardest difficulty mode is very hard
i could never get through the second levelthis game does work great on both xp and windows  i beaten the game and love it thanks again but at first i did have to fix it because it my pcm could not read it thankthe first time i heard about this game was from a demo and i thought just from the two missions the demo gives that this was an excellent game so i bought it
i didnt know the star trek plot but you dont really need to know the plot in this game
star trek away team had the most beautiful interface ive seen the buttons and menus seemed to have had a lot of work to look great
unfortunately what the game has in graphics it lacks in time youd play it
the missions themselves are challenging and unique but after a few hours the games starts to get boring
also the game needs more movies to add there are only two the opening and closing
if i could i would rate this game  stars
i wouldnt recommend this game to strategy game lovers
this is a strategyaction game and that means you can go through the entire game and not play it again because once you beat it youll feel no reason to try it again
get this game if youre not a bigtime computer game player like methis game is not as interesting and fun as i thought it would be
for those players who are familiar with commandos  this game is very similar
the character development is terrible
characters are driven in the game to only what piece of equipment sniper rifles tricorders or vulcan mind melds they are carrying
you cannot chose your favorite character for every mission
missions are based upon what character has what piece of equipment
the graphics and sound are decentgameplay  graphics  sound  value  these games are classics
many of the game sounds sadly are not from the arcade games of yesteryear they are in general more annoying
the nintendo  controllers perform fairly poorly with most of the games in this collection
if you are the nostalgic type want to reminisce about all those times you bummed quarters off your best friend or your parents at the local pizza joint dont mind consistently low scores and can get this game on the cheap go for it
as for me nostalgia only goes so fari understand why most people gave this game a good review it deserves it but perhaps the wrong words were used to make this game sound great
i think you should buy it if you own an n knowing this firstfirst off where way beyond that generation of video games so no graphic delightssecondly althought the gameplay and optional strategy take makes for many ways to complete each level the game is short
 missions in  days depending on how much you play thats on level hardthirdly there are alot of other games that you should consider first like turok  or golden eye which rainbow six does rank lower thanfourthly the replay value is not as bad as others would say but its nothing youll find yourself wanting to redo over and over again
turok  is one of those gamesbut dont be shy of this game one hit kills for you that is makes this a realistic game in most parts
if you have an n and dont want to spend  dollars on the new and hot games try this one out it is worth the shotmy title says everthig  this is a poor attempt by sony to copy the legend of zelda  same style  same dsign of characters  except musashi  the princess  and everyone else of this gsme is so stupid  and childish arrrgggthis rpg is ok  and nothing moreit came perfectly in the condition it worked in the beginning
it doesnt play on my ps im pretty sure it would work on a ps or ps thoughbushido blade  is fun with a realistic fighting system and easy control functions but at this stage in the world of video games it just doesnt measure upthere is very little storywise which is a shame because with one it could have been a great game
the character dialouge is possibly the worst ever writtenand not even some very good and fairly well known voice over actors can salvage it
so what you get are sections between fights with main characters where there are short cg movies with really poor dialouge and almost as bad animationreplay value is just barely there
even with a fairly large character selection once youve sliced and diced your way through the game a few times your ready to put it downon top of all this is the fact that the game has become rare and pricey the game is fun but not worth the pricethis game was for its time very enjoyable
presently it was alright its story mode in my opinion is so boring i could only put in mins in it before going to the fighting mode
the fighting mode will give you hrs max of enjoyment for most of the characters are very similar except for a couple moves
get this game but dont expect to muchi remember this game being much more fun when i played it thirteen years ago on the playstation
the beginning is still sort of fun but the graphics are extremely terrible compared to the extremely amazing graphics of today so she more or less looks like a white blob with a black smudge on it although the lighting was so terrible that she always appeared to be in the dark and it was a wonder that i could see her at all
still a great buy for reminisce sakebefore you fanatics about this game send me hate mail like you might for all those who give this game lower than three stars hear me outi found many downers in this game but to soften the blow i will elaborate on the plusses firstokay you want the ultimate drawing board idea for a battle sequence
well here you go the whole blueprint for the interface is brilliant
also i will agree that all those that say the plot is either lacking or just plain awful are wrong
i thought that the plot was exellent esspecailly considering the size of the game
i also liked the movie like music and the graphics esspecially the cinemas are superbhowever i think that the gameplay was butchered even worse than that of shadow madness
also the navigation is hard with the background camera angles the walking and running are slow and the bosses are too hard unless youve mastered the ability of the tool i have not
lastly i will also state that after liking the music i got the soundtrack and found it to be hightly lacking in overall originality in composistion
while highly movie like it had almost no purely listening only qualitieslets just finish off by saying that this game should have become one of the movies that square pictures is going to make after the ff movie but as a game on top of the extrordinatry cinematic aspects i found it missing somerpgsurvival horror  parasite eve this game has the most amazing concept i have ever heard of
its a shame that its flaws hold it back from being so much more than it is
first of all running if you can even call it that around this g game is a pain i swear to god you go so slow its ridiculous
i really hated the random encounters in the game at first they were fun then it just pissed me the hell off
the story is very engaging and very exciting
the music is agrevating as hell at the fast travel oh my god its so annoying
overall i would say its great for the price i got it dor on psn this could have been a great game
the hand drawn scenes are really unique and a pleasure after the polygon hash of many games
sadly the story is a bit bland as with many recent rpgs
the nonlinear story gets a little annoying after a bit and did not really get me to quotrole playquot and feel any great excitment or interest towards the characters
but relative too much of the trash in my favorite genre this isnt horrid
give it a try if youve played dragoon and chrono cross alreadyi was quite disappointed with the quality of this game expecting the square quality
i have played most of saga series known to be another generation of ff series  every saga series have been quite interesting because of its use of free scenario where players can choose which event to complete in any order
surely it was like that until the first saga frontierwith sf a player can choose which event to do next but in a way it lost that sense of freedom
the game is like reading a history book and the player has several options when playing the game
each time period has different main character and that character may appear in different time period either older or youngerin terms of the game play it is quite simply to learn but towards the end you would have played so many characters you tend to forget which character has what items
pocketstation can be used for go go digger and other game which i cannot remember but i did not find them very usefulif you are used to games such as ff then you may find this game quite different and at the same time quite hard to get used to the systemsimcity  was the nd game release in the sim series of games
my roommate had a version of the game when we were in college that he played endlessly
for students raised on the unbelievable graphics and intricate gameplay of video games that are now available simcity  will probably seem boring
however the game can be quite fun to play and can even be educational due to the problem solving nature of certain aspects of the gamein the game you can either choose to build and run a city from scratch or choose one of the preplanned cities based upon cities in the real world called scenarios and choose to run one of those
there really is no end to the game because you can keep building or destroying the cities as long as you want to
however if you build enough launch arcologies and enough time has passed an exodus will begin to occur and the launch arcologies will actually launch into outerspace taking all their citizens with them but leaving behind lots of money in the treasury
well at least thats what im told i built my city from scratch starting in  and had about  launch arcologies by the year  and i still didnt see one launchoverall simcity  might seem tame by many gamers raised on xbox s and playstation s
however if you enjoy have patience enjoy trying to creating a world from scratch but dont want to deal with too many minute details and dont mind an oldschool type video game you might enjoy creating a city and trying to make it succeed in simcity truthfully i really want to be able to recommend this game
its not as though theres not a lot here to recommendthe story is well written and though it doesnt stray too far from the wellbeaten rpg path it does break some new ground
the battle system while not revolutionary is at least workable
more than anything i got around forty hours of solid enjoyment out of this titlethe only problem is that it took me sixty hours to finish the game and its those other twenty that get in the way of my giving an unconditional recommendation
there are a lot of ways to screw up a game
you can poorly design the levels you can write a broken combat progression you can blow the endingthe list is pretty well endless
one way that i never thought id witness however is simply not finishing the thing
this game is not done
there is no other way to put itall the way up through the end of the first cd things cruised along nicely
then all of a sudden the world map disappeared
thats the only way i can think to put it
whereas before i had been able to control where my characters went and explore the environments now i was forced to sit through rather uninteresting sequences featuring one of the lead characters sitting in a wicker chair and telling me what i supposedly just did
the only interaction between the game and the player through that second cd consists of fighting the boss battles that it unceremoniously thrusts you intothat is a terrible criminal sin of game design
you are allowed to put the plot on a rail if you want but you do not get to take away any ability the player may have had to control the game or interact with the world
at that point your game ceases to be a game and becomes an experiment in button pushing
i dont mind exposition but i do expect to have some control over my own fate when the speech gets done
if you take that away from me i get angry and this game made me very angrythere are other problems here as well
by square standards the localization is dismal
while its not as incomprehensible as say okage there are still some pretty serious mistakes in the english script
is it just me or is it reasonable to expect that the people localizing my game for me know that the word is shouldvenot should of
mistakes like that are strewn throughout the game text and i must admit that it detracted a little bit from my ability to enjoy the experience
of course as the game progressed those errors got worse
around halfway through the second cd the script writers were dropping words by the twos and threes
now that didnt throw me so much since i normally read like that anyway but for people who you know like to have all the words this could be a problem particularly coming from squarea house made famous in part by its great localization effortsthe plot is a little bit more adult than youre likely to find with other games in the genre
indeedany parents out there who might be concerned with their children reading thinly veiled discussions of pedophile priests and cartoon buttocks would be well advised to avoid this title
its really pretty standard animemanga fare on the whole but strangely enough you dont see much of that in the video game industry so the game manages to be unique and interesting
of course the religious references could use some work
i know from dogma that metatron is the recording angel and thats pretty obscure but i find it difficult to believe that somebody who hasnt been through seminary is going to be able to appreciate all of the parallels that this plot has with the christian faithon the whole this game is almost incredible
had it stayed in production for another year it might have made it all the way there
unfortunately the product that were left with is unfinished with some incredibly serious problems near the end for example what is the point of letting me run around all over the world map and collect all these great pieces of character gear if the last dungeon is a gear dungeon
as it stands rpg faithful and anybody willing to overlook the games faults should find an interesting experience but i wouldnt recommend it to anybody whos not a member of one of those niche groups
we can only hope that xenosaga not a prequel as most would have you believe due out early next year in the us avoids the mistakes that hold this title backi could have fell in love with this game that is could have
this game has so many great features in it and as you read reviews you can read why
im sure im one of the few people who gave this game such a low rating and i might be the first one you have come across
well like i said this game had potential to be great the plot was awesome and there werent any loop holes
the battle system was great and the charaters were pretty good
the love story behind it wasnt so great two people on two sides of a war meet fight together and one day say oh im going to sleep with you now lay down byotch
anyways that isnt the reason why i didnt like this game
the thing is it involved too much reading
i wasnt reading a book
i was playing a game and i found myself waking up with a sore thumb from pressing the x button for hours and still not through all the dialog from one part
of course im exaggerating it didnt take hours but sometimes it was close to an hour
there are times when the game gets you prepared for battle
someone in the game stands up and says enough with us talking lets go kick some
but instead of you the socalled player of this game going and causing havoc you get to watch someone sit in a chair and descibe how the battle went disappointing and doesnt appeal to my addplease note that im writing this review two years after i finished playing this game and then lost my copygameplay the fighting engine is great
doing combos and fighting with your robots is cool
this game is much different than others in many good ways
it is very text heavy and you may end up losing interest
you could end up talking to npcs and getting from point a to point b of the city for about an hour and then have ten minutes fighting
i am not exaggeratingstory as i just said most of your time is spent reading
in about midgame many ideas are sent flying this way and that until you are completely confused
near the end of the game the text is being shown to you in long movie credit like form for very long ammounts of time
if you understood the story then i congratulate you
give yourself a pat on the backgraphics the character models are d but move smoothly in a d world
the robots are also d
the graphics arent all that great
of course im saying this two years after i last played this game now that ps xbox and the gc have came out so ill just add an extra point to the scoresound ill just leave it right at the middle
i dont remember any of the songs though so it couldnt have been to greatcontrol its an rpg so of course it has no problems
the combo system is easy to doreplay value i only played through it once and that was plenty for me
let me tell you that i barely played through it once
the reading took a toll on mexenogears is an odd game that manages to both excel and fail horribly at the same timegraphics  visualsfor the time it came out in the graphics are decent
when exploring sometimes becomes difficult to navigate when underground though becuase the lowres washed out rockearth textures all blur together making it difficult to tell if something is a wall or has something you can jump onto etc
also while the game allows you to move the camera its just a token gesture since you cant change the elevation or distance
oftentimes youll be completely unable to see the character as he goes between two tall buildings or things like thatthe game features some anime cutscenes which are unfortunuately mostly worthless
theyre well drawn but are often nothing more than something like  characters staring at eachother for  seconds with the exception of the ending almost no plot ever happens during themthe combat visuals however are great for its time
the characters do more than just move up and swing a sword
you can chain different moves together and learn deathblows which are powerful combinations that are usually visually appealing
for instance a character will run up punch jump in the air and do a sping kick sweep the enenmy as they land and then finish off with a headbuttgameplaywhile the combat graphics are nice for its era it also makes the battles take too long and boy are they frequent often  random encounter  seconds of movement
its like final fantasy summons all over again making each combat last minutes upon minuteseven when you fight the enemies from level  when youre level  it still takes foreverthere is a bit of load time anytime you change roomsgo into your character menu etc
very annoyingmy  biggest complaints arethe dialogue is waaaaaaay too slow
there is a lot of excessive dialogue a lot of repetition and it comes on the screen so slow youd think a year old child was typing it
sometimes you will have to go through an hour and a half worth of this only to get to a difficult part in the game die and have to go through all of that dialogue again without the chance to save in betweensecondly as many reviews here have pointed out the nd disc is drastically different
i thought people were exaggerating they were not
it happens suddenly
exactly at the point you put the second sic in most exploration is taken away from you
a character literally sits in a chair and tells you what happened
it becomes  hour of dialogue then fight
 hours of dialogue then fight etc
you get to explore again though right before the very last dungeoncharacters  story  plotthis is where the game is goodfor the most partin typical squaresoft fashion or is it just all japanese rpgs
the main character is fairly unlikable
hes whiny immature a jerk even though he means well and at times a bastion of selfsacrifice and purity in the name of good willing to risk everything for some small good and pulling it off through rediculous deus ex machinafortunately in typical squaresoft fashion the supporting cast is well done
theres a suprising depth to most of the characters above and beyond most games ive seen
most are mature and the game itself brushes with some mature topics of innosence when is war rightjustified the cost of it and what its worth to end onethe story is a bit overlarge
its good but needed an editor to trim it down a bit as it just gets too big for its britches by the end of the gameoverall i enjoyed the game
im glad to have played it but some of the gameplay problems means i have no desire to ever play it againthis game is all right but do not pay  dollars for it
i was really disappointed with the lookespecially when youre quotridingquot the rides
the game is hard to handle and manuever
but its a good ideai like building my own roller coasters
i just wish i could make them go upside down unless thats a feature i havent found yet
it was okay but i dont really think its worth a lot
if you can rent it that would be a good way to go
the worst part is the annoying guy who talks to you telling you that your drinks are good then telling you that people arent satisfied with your drinks
its annoying
but the game was okay aside from thatit being nothing like the pc version to me was the fun factor
the menus are confusion you got to go up to go down sort of deal
oddly theres rides and sideshows in this game that dont exist in the pc versionnot even the expansion
i dont know this version of sim theme park was just too different not fun
i didnt think it was funyou other buyers might find it fun
i think it was just the menus that spoiled it for me
first you hit if i remember right the triangle button itd bring up a long list of options
you click on one option to bring up another long list of suboptions
then hit it again to bring up  or  more options thatd have something to do with the object you want to edit or something like that
i bought this game a month ago so im a bit rusty on why i didnt care as much for it as the pc version
i think thats the basics of iti woud say very fun games are made by n but u need better graphics and it need newer games
gamecube has much better graphics anyway
i giving this three stars though for how fun it isas the n has finally gone the way of the dodo we are only left to think how better a system this could have been
i never really was a fan of the n when it was first released most of the games just seemed to childish i mean its nintendo for gods sake
from the start the system didnt have much third party support other than electronic arts and acclaim but as time went on the systems library grew thanks to some quality first party games and eventually the system got the third party support it needed to survive
however there are a lot of cons to this system
games for the system cost surprisingly expensive even the supposed players choice games were expensive
the graphics on every game suffer from a certain fog effect not to mention the graphics can be blurry as well
the sound quality isnt anything special compared to the cdquality sound systems of other cdbased video game systems for example in the n tony hawk  version songs are only played for a certain time where as in every other version they are played out in their entirity
however the system had some good qualities it was the first system to have four controler ports built into the system and with the cartridge based format there was no loading time
on the other hand there are only a handful of titles i would consider musthaves and they are super mario  mario kart  goldeneye perfect dark resident evil  the two zelda games shadows of the empire  snowboarding wwf no mercy and conkers bad fur day
other than those games everything else was just average
all in all the n wasnt a bad system at all it was just too little too latei personally dont know why every likes this i bought this system and  games at a garage sale
i played super mario  and beat it in a week
after that game i searched for more of the  games
i tried every single one and i hated all of them
its not nintendos fault its the people hired to make their gamesthe good bruce willis nice graphics fun mechanics lots of levelsthe bad bruce willis was wasted annoying camera annoying controls lame storyback in the old  bit era famous actors were just starting to feature in video games but many blew it off as childs play
bruce willis is one of the first actors to have a game built with him as the main protagonist that is not based on a movie
the game features a very detailed bruce for the time with some solid prerendered fmvs thrown in the mix as well
the game features a non coherent story that makes no sense but when bruce is involved its all about the action rightthe game has  an over the top view and you shoot all around you using the face buttons
you can jump but as the camera goes jumping can be a bitch and is probably the hardest part of the game
not being able to move the camera in his environment is very frustrating and almost ruins the game
you can pick up different limited weapons such as homing missiles plasma gun eletro bolt etc
nothing special
each level however is very well laid out and the enemies have nice designs
the game is hectic face paced and pretty immersiveat the end of every level is a boss fight and these can be easy or hard and they vary throughout the game
a problem i ran into is instead of using the second analog stick using the face buttons makes shooting diagonally hard which leads me to mention that the difficulty is very unbalanced
some levels are easy some are hard throughout the game and thats a bad thingbruce willis lends his voice and there are maybe  or so linesyeah thats it
cliche stuff such as ohhh you want some too
 kill em all its time to jam
 and various groans and grunts
in my mind that isnt using bruce willis to his fullest potential
this game could have been cooler and more than just a name tie in
i also feel a coop mode would have been good here as wellall in all apocalypse is a fun weekend shooter but nothing more
bruce willis talent was wasted but if you can get over the annoying camera controls and lack of an interesting story then apocalypse is just for youone of the best games when i was a child great to have it againarrived before expectedminimal damagenot complete like advertised though was missing front and manueltheres a bunch of cars and trucks chasing eachother all over creation and endlessly blasting the crap out of eachotherthats really about itusing the rapid fire cheat will make youre gameplay far more enjoyablethres really not much else to telli like the dune buggyhis special weopon is a gatling type gunit always points where the bad guy is so you dont have to chase the punks downthe graphics are terrible on newer tvs but is always a fun game to play
its like a prequel to twisted metali picked this game up cause when i was playing destruction derby i thought it needed guns so this game was recommendedoverall after the reviews here have said its so good i guess i got my expectations up too high and was let down when i started playingfirst off tho some reviewers said the graphics where no good
the graphics are great
what you need to do is have an expansion pack in the  and then during gameplay press start to enter your paused menu then turn the resolution to high and it will change from the almost dish graphics to proper d graphics or  even more recommended by me go to the password screen and enter maxresolution as the code
press ok and then follow the same steps as before but youll get an option after highres that says max and the graphics are suburb for a  game
i dont know why they would put that option in the start menu after a code input tho it should just be on the main screen options so many people have probably missed it
note i actually had to turn the graphics up higher for some reason when i played with the default graphics it would freeze on a black screen at the end of the the first race but it worked fine when they where turned up
so there are areasstages you drive through collecting different icons with guns rockets bombs etc however it is annoying that there are secret moves
for instance you press up up down z with one kind of powerup thing and you do a secret heatseeker missile or something i dunno why they made it like that becausea the booklet doesnt reveal the hidden moves or finishing esk moves
nor do they tell you how to do it during gameplay start menu optionb using the arrow pad to execute the moves means you have to stop steering with the analog stick to execute itc the moves button sequences like that are for fighting games capcom and acclaim make not for a game where its unnecessarylike i said i got too excited over it and it wasnt as good as i thought it would be
its probably better on  player but half the time i dont know what im collecting the thing should say what it is you pick up in writing to know which of the coded moves it ischeck into various websites for codes there is plenty of codes for invincibility and more tracks cars and even a space ship to fly but it doesnt fly up or down it guides itself you just choose left or right which is a bummer guess im too used to rouge squadrons controls the game needs a different style of course too i dunno what but open areas all the time gets pretty boringthe games ok but its not as good as some hype it up to be
its not better then any other car game its just different
it needed some turbo or nitro boosts in it
there is an after burner but its coded but it needed to be a one button press not a  button combination coded movethis game was sooo aggravating
its one of the most poorly designed wwii games i have ever played
during the real war most casualties were caused by artillery
however in this game your artillery is little more than a fireworks show for the enemy
your tanks and at guns spend more time spinning around while the germans always hit you right on the mark
what happened to the overwhelming superiority that the allies had during the later stages of the battle
in this game the allies rarely get even a  to  advantage in tanks
even when you do get an advantage your tanks get picked off with ease while your crewmen spend their time rotating the turrets
whats the point of the ambush
you can start a battle with your at guns poised  aimed ready to go and on the defensive
however the germans still manage to get off a first shot and knock out your gun even though they are attacking
what a load of crap
whats the deal with the german rocket artillery
they never miss and always seem to know where your main guns are no matter where you put them
make sure you put a time limit on each battle
otherwise you may be in for a battle that never ends
for some reason the germans will simply stop attacking and do nothing
i thought the battle of the bulge was supposed to be about a major german offensive in   sometimes they will just sit back and wait for you to come to them
this is when they are supposed to be that attackers
what a waste of a gamethis game has it all plus more compared to all the other but close combat ii
the combat system in cc is beyond all the others especially the intelligence of infantry tank killers
the addition of artillary and air  strikes is nice but it is more of an optional plus than a real helper  during gamepley
tanks could still use more brains and for some reason  individuality was so cool in cci and cc is almost gone completely
i  remember the days when i would try not only to win but also get one of my  guys a cmoh or silver star
but thats almost impossible now
another  thing is that snipers were so effective in cc but worthless in cc unless  used in an open area whereupon they get blasted after hitting their first  target
otherwise small complaints aside i cannot stop playing cc
that should say enoughas an avid fan of first two ccs i initially warmed to quotbattle of the  bulgequot
what better subject matter
the great battle pitting germanys  feared tiger tank against the flimsy us shermans first immortalised in the  hollywood movie of the same name and now brought to life by the best  wargame producers aroundtrue to the faith cc has wonderful sound  effects and battlefield concepts  for instance unexploded shells in  burning tanks periodically blow up keeping you on the edge of your seat  particularly if they go up while your men are creeping around nearbythe addition of rocket halftracks though perhaps not entirely  historically accurate adds a great wildcard
no matter how strong your  force the odds can be changed in an instant by a few wellplaced missiles  from the enemy
also great is the ability to bombard the enemy or call in a  mustang to drop something down the chimney of the panzer leaderthe  switch to a strategic map of the entire battlefield is also great fun
now  you can feel that youre driving the whole campaign not just directing a  few ants at a time
the option to choose time limits on individual battles  is also good as is the addition of a quotsneakquot movement for  individual squadsbut after a few plays i found my enjoyment  fading into frustrationcampaigns run for far too long
unless you  are hospitalised and have nothing else to do all day getting through a  grand campaign will take weeks and cost you most of the significant  relationships in your lifemonotony
the length of the campaigns  might not be so bad except that each mission somehow starts to seem very  similar to the last after a few battles
it may be the ubiquitous snowy  terrain and the lack of variation in the weaponsline of fire
this  is sometimes difficult to distinguish  youll be sitting in what you  think is a gully when next thing you know youre actually in clear sight of  a panzer
this is an unrealistic and occasionally annoying factor as line  of fire certainly would have been clear to those on the groundno  battlemaker
while you can create your own strategic map operations you  dont have the wonderful battlemaker of cc
you have to try to find the  battlegroups that are carrying your favourite weapons and then position  them on the map
it takes time trial and error and doesnt always workyou are are supreme  too supreme
the computer is generally too  weak an opponent whether on the defence or the attack
while that is better  than it being too strong it does become boringbugs
on the two  computers i played the game was fatally flawed with bugs
quotinternal  errorsquot would occasionally appear in the middle of the most gripping  games or the most important junctures in campaignsand last but  not least  no tigers
the movie version of the battle was famous for  the tiger tank
the cc manual also refers to these monsters
however they  never appear except as tank destroyers
that is a major disappointment half life works perfect
team fortress classic runs ok but how can i play online through a site that doesnt exist anymore opposing force runs but when i click boot campit failsfeeding off my love of ion storms last masterpiece deus ex i purchased the similarly sillytitled anachronox figuring it to be a game that would fill me with pc gaming goodness
well after sinking my teeth into it for awhile im left a little disappointed
dont get me wrong though
the archaic quake  engine is fine the cutscenes are good the voiceacting is superb but somewhere along the line the game lost me
the plot is dense somewhat confusing and if you leave the game for a week or so and come back to it you may forget just what in the heck youre supposed to be doing
thanks to fatima however  your dead assistant now resurrected as a hologram  youll soon be on your way to the next world universe or other wacko locationthe characters are memorable from the hero sly boots to the superhero el puno
the game has tons of laughoutloud moments and moves along at a nice pace
nothing is really too hard or too easy but again i was left with wanting more
minigames broke up the gameplay as did the numerous sidequests but alltoooften i found myself just walking to the next area and fighting weird monsters in a final fantasy setting
with only three playable characters at one time anachronox is a far cry from a true rpg
weapon effects and special battle moves are performed with some gusto but once you see these fights hundreds of times the cool factor diminished greatlyanachronox has a devoted legion of fans and deservedly so
its a fun game that will keep you entertained for  or so hours
if you can keep up with the meandering story then its even better
unfortunately somewhere along the line i stopped caring for boots stiletto pal grumpos and the rest and just wanted to finish the game which finished nicely nonethelessso if youre a pc gamer who likes final fantasystyle gameplay and combat pick up anachronox
itll be a nice rideif i wanted a console game i would have a console instead of a pc
this game based its interface on console style games and suffers for it
if youre coming from console gaming and are new to the pc game market this would be a good crossover game for you
if youre a pc gamer however this will provide an entertaining game that you will often get very frustrated withthis kind of game has been done to death
there is nothing original here the graphics arent that great the game play is sloppy and the cut scenes are less than impressive
words of wisdom save your moneythe good points to this game are the way the storyline is played out
it is a good game with solid gameplay and if you are a first person shooter fan i would say it is worth the money
the downsides are it uses the outdated quotunrealquot game engine and i would have to say the graphics are unimpressive with a noticeable slowdown in framerates when alot of textures are displayed or when you look over quotlongquot distances
the enemys seem to die easier hitting them with a crowbar than shooting them with a shotgun or rifle
i just run around half the time wacking away with my crowbar
many times it takes  clips of ammo to put someone down
all in all a good play with nothing great to offerthis game is just okay
i still enjoy it but its really dated now
it screams for some sort of real single player mode or a d campaign where you could actually walk around and do battles but for what it is its a lot of fun and is one of the last games to host the original  or so before they started adding morethere are also fun although limited mingames that you can play and you can also import your pokemon from one of the original pokemon red and blue gamesits a lot of fun although without playing it you may want to try pokemon stadium  as it has more pokemon in itthis games main plot is literally none existant
the funniest parts in my opinon was the minigames and i suppose fighting the elite four
the other modes i did not enjoy as much but if you prefer the pokemon games on the handhelds then this makes trading and locating pokemon that you missed if you are just that big of a pokemon collectori have loved pokemon before the quotpokemon hypequot began
i got information about the show on the internet and watched it when it first came out
i got pokemon cards for fun before people started collecting them and going nuts over them
this game is affordable if you get it used and fun especially for pokemon fans
i love the strategy of pokemon and i probably always will even though i have drifted from the show as i got olderthe strategy of pokemon is of the elements of earth
for example fire creatures have the advantage over water creatures due to the fact that when fire touches the grass it burns
also electric creatures have the advantage to water creatures because water conducts electricity
another example fire has the advantage over ice because when fire goes near ice the ice begins to melt because of the headpros great strategy great for children learning about the elements of earth fairly good graphics you can connect this with pokemon red  blue if you buy the transfer pakcons many pokemon do not appear in the rental section not many though only can connect with pokemon blue or red not any other versions of pokemon game boy gameswhy did square choose midi music to use with the pc version instead of mp
why do i have to draw magic from creatures instead of learning them
why cant i purchase any armor
why do big boss battles turn into  halfhour long summoned monster slugfests
why do my weapons do so little  damage so a guardian force must be used
and lastly why do the enemies  have so many hit points that guardian forces must be used
too many  questions too few answers
gfs are overemphisized waaaaay too much
in  the other ff games they are optional but in ff theyre mandatory to  winning
one must equip a gf on a character just to use the otherwise  basic options of magic item draw etc
also this is pretty much a  direct port from the playstation to the pc so other than improved  graphics theres not much to see and im willing to bet that the music is  much better on the playstation
the saving grace of this game is the  storyline and the movie scenes
youll want to keep playing to see what  happensits like a good novel really
hey thats a good idea
why  not make a novel out of the game so we dont have to play it
you dont  have to spend countless hours drawing magic from monsters you wouldnt  spend a lot of time playing the completely rediculous card game you  wouldnt have to spend a lot of time walking around and it would be a lot  cheaper
buy it if you want a longlasting game with a good story but  expect it to be  story watching and  walking around and drawing  magicthis game is good on the psx but it cant even compare on the pcreasons bad control setup and no mouse  ported fontsblurry and blocky  blurry backgrounds  blocky graphics requiring a high memory video card  terrible midi music  boring linear gameplay compared to other pc rpgsthe psx version has none of these flawswith that said though this game is still somewhat fun
worth a try but pc rpgs are so much better than this portff is perhaps the most romanticallyoriented game in the final fantasy series
many have bought this game for that reason alone setting aside the fact that all final fantasy fans will eventually buy any and all games in the series regardless of reviewsin general the storyline is excellent in terms of character development
the characters come alive much more than they did in previous ffs since each persons mannerisms are expressed in more detail through the way they stand think and talk
however the planners were a little ambitious and go overboard on a few leaps they take in the storyline  at several points in the game the complexity of the storyline increases by several orders of magnitude all at once with inadequate explanation the last boss for instance appears essentially out of nowhere although she technically affects the entire story you have absolutely no knowledge of her for most of the gamefrom a technical standpoint this game was already underpar when it was released and as everyone knows it only gets exponentially worse with time
this is not one of those classics like its predecessor ff or chrono trigger where gameplay is enough to make up for dated graphics and soundcharacter development has nothing to do with building levels
everything revolves around the notoriously aggravating junctioning system which involves hours of boredom spent drawing spells from enemies there is no mana or mp in this game
as you use spells you will need to draw them again
later in the game the only significant source of damage comes from the main characters limit break which can be used continuously because of a fundamental flaw in their limit break system which is based not on how much damage you take but your characters current hit points the lower your health the higher the chance your next attack will be a limit breakthe guardian forces summon monsters for this game have stunning animations even for ff games and i thought ff was impressive but they are all rather lengthy and there is no way to shorten them
also the damage rapidly becomes insignificant after the first few hours of playing
what this means is that youll hardly if ever summon them later in the gameif you are not already a final fantasy fan there is no reason to get this game
the graphics and sound are poor the gameplay is annoying for all the wrong reasons and since it is now rare it costs ten times what it is worthi played this game  years ago and i was really addicted to this game
i spent my whole weekend on my computer playing this gamethis game is a little bit different than other sims game available on the market
sims games usually simulates business on park gadget city etc
but here you will play a game that simlates your own lifestart this game by creating your chracters
it could be you yourself your own family or just anybody you like
choose hisher looks and personality
once you have created a family you can choose a lot available on the neighborhood and start building your own house
you may also buy a built house
the next step is furnishing your house with your preferred furnitures home appliances and gadgetsafter having your own house you can start playing your characters
you have full control over them
you can make them do whatever you like
you can get a job do house works make friends get a girlfriend then get married and have a babyas this is an old game this game is not that fun anymore this time
the newer version of this game is now available on the market with higher price and better gameplay and features
if you have a highend pc and want to try the latest game go get the newer version
i would recommend this game for those who like to play classic game or those smart budgetmindedmario party  was the last game i got for n or was it mario golf anyway i bought it at gamestop
i would have bought the rd  but they didnt have anymore
i wanna collect all the mario party games but ill feel real embarrased if i get the st and rd ones for n
im getting a platinum gamecube along with mario party  and mario kart double dash for christmas
dont feel embarassed if you still like this game because its still a hot gamemario party  incorporates the same concept as the first only with new minigames as well as badder versions of the quotfavouritesquot from the first
what ever happened to the light bulb one though i ask youthe thing with mario party  is it didnt do much to improve on the first
it detracted in fact
the games this time around arent half as great and thats when youre playing them
the board play is slower than ever with all the crapola theyve loaded on to them this time
im sorry themes and getups worn by characters dont count as innovative or newanother little thing
the different minigame thats played is decided based on the colour square you land on
more often than not my brother and i found ourselves stuck in a vs minigame which cooincidentally has the least amount of games in it
i cant tell you how many times ive played look awayhopefully nintendo will do something to improve on the game when theyre making mario party  if theyre going to go at it like they did  then theyd best not even botherrental only
if you feel the need to buy a party game get the first mario party goldeneye or conkers bfdthis product is only good is if you have either pokemon stadium or stadium  because those are the only two games i am aware of that uses the transfer pak
so unless you are very dedicated to the n and either pokemon stadium game and love pokemon still this is not a worthy buy
its overall preformance is good it rarely has a problemis good items you know for help play games for pokemon i think so i like play nintendo lot to so thanks you its for an old system we only picked it up to do a couple things with old games pokemon stadium actually
dont know what to say it still worked
welcome to the year this game is ok  i mean the concept is good like the first  but if your making a rd game on the same story they could have at least changed it to garys point of veiw to shift it up a bit i would have rated it  stars
but with the same point of veiw and only a few more rearanges i cant give this game a  star rate its fun just like the first  but you expect the story to change a bit you know
but the gameplay is great and you start out with pikachu so i guess its not all bad i would reccommend this game though not highlyspecial pikachu addition of pokemon that came out way before gameboy color hit the shelves
plays just as the original gameboy games however unlike other reviews there is is something missingremember that special pikachu surfing event
well you cant get that ingame
thats right meaning you would have to call nintendo and take it up to them for them to install the hardware into the game
what a moneymilker
very disappointing as a child as i have wanted to play that game specifically for that purpose and the ability to catch mew
this is as close to the series for the original  so if your into collecting these get the yellow version
interacting with pikachu is cute but be warned how his mood changes can affect battles if you use himand it seems that they have taken out the indingo pokemon or virus it seems
it was said catching this pokemon which was literally nothing more than a scrambled block with two eyes on it that make a polygon noise would erase the save data on the game
i dont recall running into this pokemon that can be found in the sea near the island
this game is old so dont pay more than a reasonable used pricezombie revenge got slaughtered in many reviews by games websites and magazines but i think its a game worth gettingalthough it is often very frustrating to play
basically you play as one of three characters and your job is to fight your way through various levels filled with zombies and monsters in what i think can be descibed as a d scrolling beat em up
each section is short but packed with enemies  theres no time to admire the scenery you must simply destroy everything onscreen with either your fists or with long range firepower and then move on to the next one before a timer runs out
this sounds repetitive but in reality its not as bad as it might sound
firstly as in most dreamcast games the graphics are amazing
all the characters look great and move realistically
every location is incredibly detailed and atmospheric and some of the bosses are the most bizarre monsters you have ever seencheck out the slime boss
secondly there are lots of moves for your characters to pull off and many different weapons lying around that can be used
ok so some fans of beat em up games will find the moves repertoire a little short but using the flamethrower or the giant drill on a zombie is a real showstopping effect  show your friendsthe game is also really difficultor is that just me
i found myself using up all my continues many times before reaching the end until practise and perseverance paid off
most of the difficulty comes from the rather poor implementation of the various moves most notably the fact that guard and dash are assigned to the same button which is a real pain when you need to make lightning fast decisions to escape from dangerous enemies
another example is that both the attack buttons also serve as the pick up an item off the floor buttons when you are standing near a dropped weapon which may be a one you dont want and i often found my poor character doing this when i actually intended them to fire their gun at a zombie who was right on top of them  this proved to be the death of me several playthroughs but its unavoidable and excruciatingly annoying
the response time of the characters reactions on screen to your button pounding is also far too slow but to be honest these drawbacks do not ruin the game completely rather they require that you play with more care and observe carefully what is happening onscreen at all times  so get a large television for this one and play cautiously rather than rashly
youll seldom find the onscreen timer a problem after a bit of experienceyou cant save your progress at any time you either make it through or die trying  but to be fair this would complertely remove the challenge
you can save after beating the game though and apart from the sheer relief its worth beating the game so that you can change the blood colour to red now watch that drill in action again  yeucchh
 and for frustrated battlers you can also select infinite time and level select in original mode
although all subsequent replays will be essentially the same game you will want to experiment with different characters and the effectivity of different combo moves or deciding which weapons to use and when
there are hidden rooms and secret items that you may not find on your first attempts
plus you can learn the way the enemies attack some of them wander about picking up weapons to use against you if you dont get there first
its these little touches that make this game so much fun to play
i rented it first and then bought it and am still playing it nowzombie revenge is a fully d brawler for  or  players
in a nutshell its resident evil meets fighting force
the graphics are identical to the arcade version but the controls leave something to be desired
the gun and weapon controls are responsive for the most part but when fighting hand to hand the controls are stiff and frustrating
thats a shame because it would have been fun to be able to effectively use both styles of attacks in conjuntion
the theme of the game is essentially a carry over from segas other zombie series the house of the dead
as with the house of the dead the voice acting is horrible and the story is shallow
the graphics are detailed and colorful and there is much to look at in the backrounds
while many of the enemy designs are original and creative you will also see alot of things that will make you groan and say quotuhhhive seen that beforequot
it may not be as good as it could have been but as far as multiplayer beatemups go zombie revenge is currently the best one for the dreamcasteh this game is alright
when i first bought it i liked it alot
but over time playing it it really aint that great
one thing that really really was horrible was that you couldnt save the game
so you had to get lives then play from the beggining each time to see how far that you could get
which in that case i never beat the game
i got to the house or so i dont remember that good but thats it
i never beat the game
even in  player mode
the game was alright graphics not bad
sound is alright
gameplay is cool at times
recommended
maybe but not worth that much money at all
its got its pros but also has a lot of cons in it
its frustrating at times alsothis game is pretty much the same thing as the arcade version yawnin fact there is nothing different about the dreamcast version or the arcade versionit was fun in the arcade but anybody who has played crazy taxi in the arcade will find the dreamcast version very boringfor people who have not played crazy taxi at the arcade i would strongly reccomend it but only in that situationthe game is fun but gets repetitive pretty fastd didnt wow the world when it came out
its long gone now but heres my review anyway
you play as laura parton survivor of a plane crash in the freezing wastelands of northern canada
there are a few other survivors but unfortunately some of them have mutated into green plant type monsters
you need to find help avoid monsters and work out what caused that plane to crashplaying d is like watching a very very slow movie
its really one long interactive cut scene with breaks when you need to do something to start the next one
all laura really does is move about in st person mode and press a button to interact with something in front of her
every interaction causes a little cut scene to play
this could be picking up a healing aid looking at somebody who is asleep and not going to answer you or opeing a door
it looks daft and after the first  minutes it gets quite tiresome
this is how the game plays out in nearly every inside environment
outside things change a bit
we leap into glorious rd person view and watch laura trudge around the snow
now the mountain landscapes you have to cross are actually pretty amazing
they do make you feel cold and the sound of snow underfoot is wonderfully realistic
unfortunately laura also has to fight monsters outside and this is a bit more clumsy
again we go back to st person for fighting and its very nay almost impossible to fight without getting hit because laura does not move when shes in a battle
luckily healing items are plentiful and seemingly infinitethere are bosses that are quite fun
and there are some gruesome sights to see some of which are very adult orientated
but sadly some of the cut scenes are extremely long with lots and lots of spoken dialogue
the lipsynching is diabolical so these can become quite a chore to sit through
whats really daft is that laura herself never speaks
she has all the other characters babbling straight at her and merely grunts sighs or makes little tuts or intakes of breath in response
if i had to talk to someone like while trapped in freezing cold cabins surrounded by monsters that i would be ready to slap them round the face after the first hourbut all in all i enjoyed it
laura does have a real mystery to unfold and some of the sights you will see are pretty unbelieveable  just wait until near the end where you have to destroy a super computer that talks to you with a female voiceyoull know what i mean
talk about sexual imagery
anyway its all very ponderous and mysterious
probably far too serious for its own good
but at the end i did feel like i had been asked to follow a very personal journey dreamed up by he game producers
they certainly had a unique take on gaming
d might be slow and cumbersome at times but it does have atmosphere and a heartto start one word weird
this game is just odd
a sort of virtual petfriend seaman at times can be enjoyable then can be boring or just  downright freaky
the concept is interesting and done pretty well
you  raise a small group of half fishman creatures from eggs to something  well lets just keep it at something
the voice recognition has to be the  best out there with no need to train it to your voice i rarely had to  repeat anything
for me it got boring after about  minutes of talking to  my fish he wouldnt want to talk about anything else until tomorrow so i  would have to wait until the next day to have anything new happen
and it  seemed like no matter how good i treated my seamen they all talked smack  to me putting me down and never once saying they liked me
it might be a  good game for some but only the die hard virtual pet lovers for others  this game is going to be boring
rent it before you buyitbut after youve beat it and played it a couple times it gets really old very quickly
but this game is  original
a very unique and cool concept
i just think more couldve been done to keep the replay value up a bitthe graphics  amazingthe sound  very goodconcept  out of this worldreplay value gets boring after you play it enoughso the only reason why im giving this  stars instead of  is because lets face it it can get old very quickly
plus you have to have a lot of free time to keep him alive
i used to have that time in high school but now starting my second semester at college welltime isnt as free any moreits a game that should be checked out though
just be warned you might get bored with it real quick
i thought it was the greatest game at first but then it seemed like nothing new happens
once you beat it thats it
replay value is the only major flaw with the gamei wouldnt really classify this game as a rts
place the buildings set some rewards and your troops just do their thing
its an entertaining game but not involved enough for my likingmajesty isnt a bad game the graphics are quite good for a strategy game and the game play allows you to catch on quickly
the tutorial is pretty good as well but the game can either be too easy or too toughsome of the scenarios are really easy and others seem very hard
there are a few i couldnt get after several tries
at least all the scenarios had decent stories to them which is better than some games out theremy only real complaint with the game was that it didnt hold my interest
i played it for about a month and then went on to another game
its not bad but it tends to get old after a while its the same types of things over and oversince many aspects of this game   i feel it missed itscalling
i purchased this game for  at a retail establishmentwith a free copy of mech commander gold which made this a good deal as a matter of fact it costs  everywhere but here
aside from the cost issue the game is a grave disaster the physics and flight model are not at all realistic the manual is limited in information there are errors showing that not much research was done for example the pilot in the ah as well as most tandem seat attack aircraft sits behind the gunner the manual shows the pilot in the front gunnercopilot station
symbology and tads functioning is not even close to that of janes or martin marietta specs
gunners station is practically non functional while the gunner and targeting is poor and not at all helpful
the lack of configuration options for controls and playability make this a canned sim
the graphics are good but but gameplay is tuned more towards the role of popup target rather than flight sim
it is challenging and has potential but in no way is prepared to compete with any other modern helicopter simulator exept that of team alligator which also should have been a vacuum cleaner
i will give them the benefit of the doubt i do like the looks of the game and will try desperately to work around all the shortcomings to enjoy what limited playability i have
i really like apache havocs functional weapons and flight system that i expected microprose to at least match if not improve upon
the apache is an advanced aircraft that is insulted by the trimmed down interface and lack of weapons system interaction
you have to like it though they tried
it might grow on you but without a demo to show their stuff microprose stands to receive negative blows
the game really needs a patch
the decision to purchase is up to you
hard core sim players will be disappointed
endi was somewhat dissapointed in the fact that campc  did not add to the rts genre even though it is my favorite game
however much like red alerts expansion packs this one adds too many units that are one man  armies that can level you or your opponent very quickly
this ruined the  playbalance
it makes for a blast in multiplayer though because you get  armies of the big dudes the single player expansion leaves lots to be  desiredfor the same price you can get tiberian sun along with this expansion pack
why pay this much just for this
get the combination pack called fire power for the same price and you will have an additional ts game to share with a friend
that package also provides you with a ts soundtrack cd which is pretty cool to listen to
as for the firestorm pack i would say it provides some nice additions
several additional units on each side and some minor changes to some units that westwood thought would help the competiveness
they do
for example gdi jump jet infantry have been given better range and the ability to see cloaked units and structures
they have added the juggernaut to the gdi which is similar to the nod artillery
another neat addition is the mobile war factory that is available for both the nod and the gdi
the nod is gifted with a multiple missile launcher
of course you get several new maps which are bigger and better than the ts ones
the firestorm map editor provides the opportunity to make some really neat maps
unfortunately none of these maps will work without the firestorm disc in case you have a friend who doesnt have it
also firestorm brings a slightly improved steamlined look for some units
not a big change but the firestorm graphics seem just a bit cleaner and sharperthat brings us to the main reason for buying any expansion pack
the missions
firestorm gives you  original missions for each side and they are all fun and well thought out
these missions assume you already know how to play the game and include some creative additions you have not seen before
the video included is actually pretty good and very entertaining
i highly recommend themas for multiplay there are also many exellent additions yet they lack popularity
while its still fairly easy to find a game at the ts site the number of firestorm players is somewhat limited
westwood came up with the neat idea of having a tour for world domination
a site where you can take the gdi or nod and fight against the other side for the purpose of defending territory for your side or taking territory from the other side
for this purpose westwood sets up games yet you will find very few people to play themin short tiberian sun is a game that is still a great deal of fun with graphics and game play that are still up to date today
firstorm is a worthy expansion pack but its simply not worth the price when you can get the fire power package for the same costokay  enough about the fabulous graphics and the great way it represents history  its all true
but what about the game
i waited months for the game to finally come out  i played and got frustrated with the demo and  then the game arrived two days go
well i have played two games in two  days so i think i can comment on the game at this point
its fun but not  the game of the year if it is i hope  gets here soon
i will  probably keep playing for a while but this will probably not have me up  late at night and then up again at the crack of dawn
first the game is  too simple on the economic level
second the quotinformationquot  booklet that comes with the game is not informative i have many more  questions than it could ever dream of answering which means shelling out  an additional  on the stratgey guide
third the game interface is  confusing and poorly explained by the inadequate instructions that come  with the game  i am learning by trial and error
on the military level you  do no get enough information to adequately control your troops
yes you  get thousands of them  so what
the tactical display is wonderful but  even if you have great strategies what good does it do if you cant get  your troops into formation
it also needs some sort of scouting element   i spent one day wondering around the battle field looking for the enemy   this may be historic but is it fun
and thats the point here graphics  and everything else aside
this game is three stars worth of fun maybe  four if your bored but this is not the game of the yeari think ea should stop trying to release a new version every year and really work on the nfs series to improve it
there really isnt a huge difference between nfs and this fifth installment
yes the graphics are a  bit better as well as gameplay but nothing compared to a lot of other  sequals out there
if you have never played any other nfs games then you  still will love this but for those of you who already own one of the older  ones you really arent missing a whole loti cheated because i got very bored
i hacked into the game and gave myself a million credits after an hour
the good thing about this game is that it plays just like quotelitequot one of my first and favorite games and that is one of the bad points as well
playing the original elite game took weeks time i just dont want to spend playing a game anymore
this game looks nicer than elite and the moneygathering schemes are more complex but you spend a lot of time doing nothing
too much timean odd newage spacetrading game in which very little happens  at all
having played it all the way through i can appreciate the feeling of place whilst deploring the fairly poor voice acting and lack of much to do
apart  from the business of trading which is made dull by the immense distances  you must cross the plot involves ferrying things backwards and forwards  from one of the galaxy to the other and quickly becomes boringstill  on the other hand its hugely atmospheric  whilst the plot is a big  cliche the feeling of flying through an alien universe is conveyed  effectively with absolutely gorgeous stateoftheart graphics and some  enjoyably epic jean michel jarreesque synth music
the vastness of  space sets it apart from the jumppoint riddled likes of the star wars  games
you really do have to fly manually from place to place and it takes  a long time
despite the hushed tones with which elite is still  mentioned x  beyond the frontier a transparent reference to the  elite sequel frontier is one of a handful of modern children
in  fact if you like this kind of game theres the old fun privateer   and the older less fun battlecruiser ad and thats about itthe  pace is refreshing too  for a few days the glacial slowness of the game  is a nice change from the hectic blasting of quake 
this kills it  though  after a short while you realise that there isnt really much more  to the game than just flying from x with cargo y and back again and if  youre into combat forget it  you cant even afford a gun until several  days of play and you wont be able to use it until much later
this would  be forgivable if the rest of the game was gripping but it isnt so its  not
nice try thoughmaybe
but the graphics are excellent
best rts ever
no way
while it has its moments it also has its problems
again graphics are terrific
some of the units are cool but some of the air units they have cant attack anything so why have them
the missions are a joke for the most part
i played this game for  days totaling about  hours and beat  missions
a little too easy if you ask me
the screen movement is alot like myth it  
its tough to find a good line of sight and you cant get a good look at the battles going on because if move in too close then you miss getting attacked somewhere else
plus they have a bunch of icons all over the screen that block your view
the music is also good
the cinematics were good as was the story
i expected a little more from a sierra product especially after halflife
overall i did enjoy the game
i would have liked it more if it was a little harder
kinda of stinks to spend that kind of money for such an easy gameground control is a good strategy game for you strat fans
great graphicsunits and interface make it very enjoyable to play
the only reasons i gave it  stars instead of  or  is the fact you cannot save the game between missions
if you are and hour or more into a missionwhich can happen and get whipped you have to start all over again
sure this is more quotrealquot but it does get annoying after a couple of times
the other reason for  stars is the pathfinding of the units is not great
they also will not respond to your commands readily under fire
the apcmain repaircommand vehicle is the most stupid of them all
it does not respond readily to repair commands when you need them most
just a couple of problems but overall well worth the moneyfallout is like any other role playing game of the time except made for adults
explictly for adults perhaps which is what makes it so fun
gone are the fantasy worlds with dungeons and dragons spellswords and the like
you dont roll dice in this world
a nuclear holocaust has happened and the survivors stagger about in the resultant hellscape robbing shooting and killing one another
so this rpg takes place in the future not the past which was in itself an original ideathe rest is an extension of this basic premise
put down your swords and magic staves and pick up a knife or a pistol
travel to cities reduced to ruin and interact with bloodthirsty thieves and killers
or have a drink and buy a prostitute
this is not a sanitized worldcombat is beyond fun the most entertaining ive experienced before or since
its still turnbased like the old dd games but now you have the ability to target specific places on your enemys body rather than just a general attack
for example you can shoot a raider in the eyes and blind him or cripple a leg so that he cant run away
you can shoot the weapon out of his hand or even hilarious shoot him in the groin to show your disdain
this will become standard fallout
it should be patented
and as the fight proceeds the object of your wrath usually becomes vocal either rejoicing in his success or cursing his injuries for example if you shoot a guy in the leg he may say something like ow
you sonofab my leg
or if you blind him and he will stagger about saying my eyes
my eyes
and try to run away
or he will just straight up call you a mother effer
hilariousness ensues in other words especially when theres a lot of characters on screenthe soundtrack is suitably creepy without being obtrusive
it definitely sounds like the end of the world has happened
the graphics are also surprisingly good for a game of its time
i think they still hold up todaythe ai system is completely reworked and amazing
no longer is there just one way you can go and failing that you have to reload
you make choices here accept quests or not agree to alliances or not be the good guy or the bad guy
and you can be a bad guy and still play the game that was also a new innovation
it makes it harder but you can do it
dialogue choices mean something  say the wrong thing and youve just ended a quest and forfeited whatever reward you might have earnedthe dialogue itself is finally adult oriented  frequently you can tell someone just how you feel in no uncertain terms
and if they dont like it
they can suck your gun
and you can tell them that toodrugs and alcohol are available just like in the real world and have realistic consequences if you choose to use themstill however this is just the prototype
it has a lot of problems  too many gliches
how many times do you get trapped in a room before you get too frustrated to play any longer
how many freezes and thus loss of experience points are you willing to accept
sometimes an entire town will turn against you so that you cannot advance the main plot and you will be unsure as to what happened
did you pick up the wrong item
say the wrong thing
kill someone in another town
 sometimes its just plain hard to find a fight
you travel around the map hoping to be attacked and so gain experience and maybe get a weapon or two but if you arent
well theres a few days wasted for no purpose
theres nowhere you can go in the game to just fight and get stronger
 theres a stupid time limit
right about the time you really start liking the game and become involved in the plot you realize that its pretty much over the world blows up or something
really unfun
 limits on how strong you can get how many perks you can have
by the time you get strong enough for the final missions guess what
the world blows up and the game is over
unfundidnt like the game in general
im sure this is a good game for others
but i didnt like itthe good creepy atmosphere great characters and storythe bad no journal crappy menus bad graphics cant explore overworld map confusing layout bad ai slowpaced combat useless mapthis game is what the more popular fallout  and new vegas is based off of
fallout shocked the game community in the late s and for a good reason
the game had a mature rpg theme that was rare in the day
the postapocalyptic theme had a creepy atmosphere haunting music and an interesting setting
you are a vault dweller who is coming out of vault  for the first time
you need to get a water chip because the one in your vault has failed
you only have enough for a few months so you have to get one before time runs out in gamewhen you jump in to create your character is almost exactly like the new games
pick your two perks distribute your points among your skills and go
you can choose anywhere from explosives survival first aid big guns small guns etc
the game is an isometric pointandclick with turn based combat
this had a lot of problems for me
any actions you use use action points which include opening the inventory moving using weapons and healing
when your points are used the next companion or enemy takes their turn
this is fine and all but i found issues where i was trying to snipe enemies from afar and companions would wonder offscreen and get into trouble with a pack of enemies and i couldnt manually end the combat
i also found this pace extremely slow and it took forever to move around the small areasif that doesnt annoy the menu will
to reload weapons you have to open your inventory and drag the right ammo over to the weapon
this uses action points but this also applies for healing items
you cant put a stack of stimpaks in the inventory but instead just on at a time
the inventory is just a column that you have to scroll through and you cant organize it
i also hate bartering because if you trade an item that has hundreds or thousands you have to click all which brings the number to  then repeat until all the items are over to your side
what crappy design choice is thatthere are plenty of weapons in the game that use various ammo types same as newer fallouts
you can buy them at random caravans you encounter in the world map or at stores
there are only about  locations you can visit but each is unique and has various side quests
keeping track of these is impossible because there is no journal to keep track of this
it makes figuring out where to go a pain because you forget some times
the useless map doesnt help because its just a bunch of dots with no labels
this makes swapping areas confusing because you have no idea where to gothe world map is also not explorable which would have been nice
you just float across an overworld map and run into random encounters
overall the game is worth playing for fans of the newer games and want to see the origins
the characters are interesting and atmosphere is creepy but the age really shows with terrible d graphics and bad cgi rendered movies
if you have the extreme patience to get through this with maybe a faq then go ahead
otherwise just dont worry about itthis is very fun but after you beat it there is not much more you can do except play your friends
i suggest buying it if you love fighting games and you are tired of the mortal kombat golds trilogys
all good games just remakes of each other
but id say if you want to buy thisdont
get dead or alive  for xbox but if you cant get an xbox or doa for it buy this if you are still hanging on to that dreamcasti cant argue with the jawdropping visuals awesome in every respect the control system is excellent even easier than tekken and i even like the lack of secrets i hate having to beat the game  times just to play as my favorite character but doa just has too much competitionwhat really matters in a fighting game is gameplay how deep can you go and how much of a difference will it make
doa takes the middle ground the jump between newbie and expert is pretty extreme simply get the countersparries down and the cpu is a piece of cake as are most humans but its pretty easy to become an expert anyway
soul calibur fans will feel right at home but if youre looking for something deeper youd be better off with virtua fighter tb or capcom vs snkfrankly doa plays a lot like vf with a bigger quotinstant gratificationquot factor its very nice especially against a friend but the graphics and quick learning curve dont translate to the depth of vf the flash of mvc or the fun factor of soul caliburthis is nothing compared to soul calibur or street fighter alpha  or marvel vs capcom  this game gets old fast
maybe worth a rent but not a buy
honest just because it looks pretty doesnt make it fun to play
bouncy breasts aside this game is dull
although it looks much better than its psx counterpart due to antialiasing
go  buy the other fighters i mentioned if your a hard core fightertrue the graphics are incredible and the story behind the game is quite interesting butthe game itself is dull
basically you fly around in a beautifully generated computer environment shooting at other ships
if the  graphics and musical score were a tenth of what they are the average user  would see it as the lowbrow arcade sim that it is
ps i still have not  found a game that even closely rivals red baron d
now thats a gameas a fan of the baldurs gate series i decided to give icewind dale iwd a try
unfortunately black isles did not strike gold twice
while icewind dale is a carbon copy of their excellent baldurs gate games in many ways it lacks the personality that make the bg series greatiwd actually has a number of things in its favor
the character creation system is very rich allowing you to customize your party of six in true dd fashion
also there is a long list of abilities spells and equipment that youll run across as well as visually appealing environments solid voice acting and compelling music
some of the dungeons can be genuinely creepy and theres a sense of accomplishment once you clear one outunfortunately the game is deeply flawed
iwd is a bit too hard even for a person who has some experience with rpg dungeoncrawling
even worse its an artificial toughness designed to lengthen the game by requiring you to repeatly reload saved games
your characters will die countless times and this simply cant be avoided
and since your cleric will not be able to resurrect dead party members until late in the game raise dead scrolls are expensive too you will not be able to continue the game with dead characters
its really a shame that the developer did not pace the game better since its going to turn off a lot of people from the very beginningif you can get beyond the tedium and frustration of having to save the game every  minutes and reload it almost as often the gaming experience is still rather uninspired
the story is lackluster and cliche
there is none of the banter between party members that made baldurs gate so fun
all of this together becomes mindnumbing after a while since the game profoundly lacks a sense of purpose or narrative power
its all really unfortunate since some effort obviously went into creating the gameultimately if you havent played baldurs gate by all means play it both bg  bg
if youve already tasted the glory of the baldurs gate series then iwd will probably be a disappointmentprosrich dd character creationgood voice acting and musicwide range of spells items etcconsunnecessarily tedious and difficultlackluster storybaldurs gate clone without the personalitywhat did i miss here
this is not a great game at all
it is above average and that is about it unless you think that good cosmetics like graphics and sound effects are all thats needed to make a great gamein case you werent aware this game uses a realtime action system where you issue orders to the characters and they perform them all simultaneously with your enemies in realtime
it adds a realistic element to combat that turnbased combat doesnt have
however the realtime combat system isnt all that its cranked up to be
lets just say that its a royal pain
its impossible to manage your characters without babysitting them and pausing the game every five seconds to issue a new order
so although it might be more realistic it isnt any more exciting
i had a lot more fun playing turnbased fallout than i did playing baldurs gate or icewind dale
if you dont know what the word micromanage means you will find out playing this gameanother drawback to this game is that it is almost a pure brute force game
slash and hack
dont get me wrong i love my fantasy violence as much as the next guy but it should be mixed in with some problemsolving too
icewind dale has almost none of that
if you like that stuff on the other hand then you might like this game even morethe worst part about this game though is that the fight die and reload routine is frustrating
you know that routine
you keep saving your game and playing an encounter over and over until you win
in icewind dale this routine consists of entering a room guarded by beasts too powerful for your party to defeatas an added twist for fun the game sometimes puts your magic user at the front of the marching order when you enter a new room getting slaughtered
loading your most recent saved game
repeating steps  preparing for battle a little different each time and hoping that your luck is different
eventually you win
immediately clicking save
i hope that you like saving your game often because you will find out how badly you really do need to do it
icewind dale has a lot of fight die and reloadthere are other little problems in this game as well
one of them is the automatic pathfinding function
you would think that in this day and age someone could make a game where if you click a point on the map the game can figure out the quickest way to get there
not so
you will find this especially annoying in combat when you want one of your priests to heal someone and you find him wandering around the room because of the lousy pathfinding functionbut like i said i am satisfied with this game
the visual and sound effects are truly stunning
i usually dont care about this stuff but it adds so much to the game especially spellcasting that it is worth mentioning
if you have ever wanted to know what a magical ice storm fireball or noxious stinking cloud looks like youll get to see it here
icewind dale is a game that is fun but it is not addictiveif you had asked mewhen i was about halfway through icewind dalewhether or not i recommended this game i would have given you a resounding quotnoquot i would have told you that the game was battle intensive to the point of being absurd
i would have told you that icewind dale was more frustrating than fun
i would have told you to save your bucks and buy another game instead or else reload your copy of baldurs gate on your pc
and although i dont think that icewind dale completely absolves itself of these concerns i do have to admit that the second half of the game was pretty darned funthe problem i initially found was that the early levels or chapters as theyre called in this game were a bit too difficult given the levels of your characters
dont misunderstand me
i dont want easy battles and cheap experience points
nevertheless i found the first three chapters a bit frustrating
i dont know how many times i experienced the monotonous quotencounter big battle die reload die reload die reloadquot this is fine occasionally when you encounter a quotbossquot at the end of a chapter but in icewind dale youll encounter very difficult battles with every step your party takes
many fine reviewers have mentioned how icewind dale was released to compete with diablo ii and i cannot help but agree
icewind daleunlike baldurs gate or planescape torment my personal faveis all about battle youll encounter hordes of baddies and basically kick their butts
the problem its difficult to balance adampd rules with a monster count the size of diablo
and if you are going to try and achieve this balance well then i think the battles your party encounters should be reasonable in regard to your partys experiencelet me give an example in order to make my point concrete
there are some possible spoilers here so if you havent played the game you may want to skim past this
in both chapters  and  youll encounter a plethora of enemies who can only be damaged with magic magical weapons or spells
the problem is this early in the game your party members have found only a few magical weapons and theyre not very powerful oooh a  dagger
likewise your spellcasters dont wield very powerful spells yet ooooh magic missile
yet icewind dale still hurls tons of such magicresistant creatures at you
super frustrating
although reviewers brag about how this game will last  hours or so about  of those hours are spent reloading saved gamesyet sometime around chapter three your party will finally become powerful enough that the game will run a bit more smoothly
the game still isnt a breeze though
youll encounter difficult battles where the quotdie reload die reloadquot factor comes into play
and yes this does ruin the roleplaying aspect of the game for instance my party probably quotrestedquot a lot more than it adventured because after every difficult battle id have to sleep and healeven if id just slept five minutes prior
this needless to say kind of ruins the spirit of the gamebut lest i be accused of being too negative about icewind dale let me comment briefly on what is working well  the voice acting and music are excellent helping to create some serious atmosphere  although the story is fairly simple and straightforward there are nevertheless some nice plot touches within the individual chapters  awesome number of magical items and spells i remember not even dealing with melee combat in bg because it simply wasnt worthy to do so but in icewind dale believe me those  swords hammers flails etc do some sweet damage  nice battle changes over bg now you can pause a battle and make changes in your inventory without that annoying quotthe game is no longer paused on this screen stuffquot  great locales elven stronghold dwarven smithy etc
  lastly once your characters become powerful enough this game becomes very addictivein short this game is very very close to being an excellent game
with a little more attention paid to balancing out the difficulty of battles i think this could be a perfect game for your information im now playing icewind dale again using my highlevel party that completed the game and im finding the adventure much more enjoyable
as it stands however i think its best for each person to decide whether or not icewind dale is for himher
perhaps it will be useful for prospective customers to look at the recent black isle games on a spectrum with planescape torment on one end plotintensive battle deemphasized icewind dale on the complete opposite end battleintensive basicplot and the original bg falling somewhere in between
my own preferences steer i admit towards planescape and bg but that doesnt mean that your preferencesdear readerneed mirror mine
if youre a fan of battles and wished that bg featured more intense skirmishes well youll love icewind dale
if however you appreciate plot and detail above fighting you may want to pass this title byor else wait until the price drops significantly
i hope this helps
good luck in your adventuringi was surprised by the quality of this game
i played this in december  and it was much better than i though
sure the graphics engine is getting a little old especially compared to games such as dongeon siege
however i was still surprised that a game of this age looked so goodwhat isnt great however is the lack of a manual
in fact i wondered whether the contents of my box were incomplete but apparently that is not the case
this severely limits the game
this simply isnt acceptible
if there was a manual i would have rated this game at least one star higher than i didthat would make  stars so why not 
well there are some issues that keep the game from receiving a top rating aside from the graphics
i do not like how the inventory is managed
it is very hard to see whether a weapon or armory is better than the one you currently havealso the path finding sometimes isnt great
all the members of your party go one way while one of them gets lost
heshe will catch up ultimately but it simply is annoying
also sometimes you try to get out the door but cant because the leading member of the party is blocked by other party members
the same happens when you try to talk to peopleaddition i now found the manual on the cd
this makes things a little better but i still think it is a farce that a game like this doesnt ship with a printed manualunfortunately the manual failed to explain some of the questions i had and some of the oddities i couldnt figure out work just like i thought but are just a bit cumbersome
for instance it is not a lot of fun to purchase a piece of armory for  gold pieces just to figure out it is actually worse than the one you had before forcing you to sell it again for  gold pieces
but i guess thats just how the old add rules werethis is a rpg
characters allocate points to different statistics which along with dice rolls determine how they fare in fighting monsterswhen i started the game i was very impressed
the graphics are pretty and create a great atmosphere
there are voice actors for the characters and they sound great
there are a plethora of neat weapons and magical items to help your characters
there are a great many rules about characters and battles which made the game have a serious edge
something i really loved was the turn undead ability for priests and paladins
there are only a few types of monsters that will be undead but its neat that certain classes have this kind of advantage in fighting evil
also something i liked was the ability to choose different alignments
making your character good or evil means that certain weapons may not be usableso i made it through the first chapter and i thought that it was a bit heavy on battles but it had been ok so far
the second chapter was even more battle intensive
i just was having no fun so i stopped playing
i guess it would be better if the battles were easier but like the other reviewer said these battles were hard
basically i felt i had to reload whenever someone died because one time i tried to bring them back with help from the town priest and it cost a tonne of moneyand those enemy magicians
they can paralyse your party members so you have to stop them but i cant deal with multiple magicians
that was another reason to stop
one big irritation was also trudging back to town to sell stuff when the characters inventories got full
it takes a long time to walk your characters across the large screens
there should have been a shortcut pleasesomething i really did enjoy were getting the new abilities for priests and mages at each level
also finding a cool weapon or magical item gave a fun feelingthankfully i didnt waste much money on it
my seller was alright and everything was there including the cool cloth map
however i had problems
for one thing it took me the longest time to level up even with all the sidequests
for another the enemies were too blasted difficult the magics tended to backfire in the worst way
i would face a wolf with a paladin a druid a cleric and a bard
you would think that the druid would be about as strong as a wolf but no my first druid got killed of by a couple of goblins
then i fired a burning hands at point blank range on these wolves and it killed my fullhp paladin while barely scratching the wolf
my paladin has  or  hp and the wolf had  hp on average which led me to believe that at least my paladin would make it against this critter
but three hours later when i got to the cave i had trouble beating orcs
i had to have my whole party gang up to beat one and there was a cave full
then when my thief finally levels up i never figured out how to increase hp or anything else for that matter
having a nd level bard with as much or not much more hp and no discernible increase in effectiveness he seemed less  able to fight orcs now was the final straw
i had wasted enough time on this game
it would have been one thing if i was given enemies like that in later battles but i had such enemies from the beginning
furthermore i had my biggest problem with the fact that point and click with the mouse was the only option half the time i killed my own partyi would recommend a multiplayer game if it was more like neverwinter nights hands on tutorial cursor keys enabled if i remember correctly totally customizable controls
if i wanted to set the format to call animals to arm and to use certain spells it was easy to do
level up increasing was easy as wellthere seem to be two options
one is to start building at least one colony from scratch in an archapelago
this would be good if youre willing to play for weeks or months at a time but its awfully slow going
or you can come in at one of a number of situations
in that case you are to varying degrees established but extremely difficult goals are set and huge fleets of pirates prowl the seas in most scenarioslara croft has made a crossover a now bit lara finds herself jumping swimming and flipping her way across your game boy color screensounds  good right
on paper
this game is just missing somethingyou dont  make meatballs without meat and that is what this game is missingmeat
the graphics are greatprobaly the best for game boy so far and it is  nice to see lara make her way over to nintendo but in crossing that street  lara has lost somethingthe charm that made her so popular
that great  puzzle element has been taken out and replaced with an endless maze of  platform jumping and back tracking
there is no longer that feeling of  accomplishmentnow only a feeling of sheer frustration
it become mindless  and almost sadistic
another real twisted idea is that no background  noise was included
in the playstation versions you have those great  quottombquot noises and the bells and whistles when you find something  fabuloushere you are left to your screams and curses
it is empty
i  need something or else ill  go crazy
another point to make is the  controls
the tomb raider series is notourious for its strange and  sometimes awkward controls and this is no exception
lara enjoys jumping  up when you want her to move forward not grabbing ledges and even  plunging to her deathso be warned
like the other games it takes time
now i will admit that for some strange reason the game is a bit funi am  not sure why
maybe it is because the playstation editions are so cool  that it spills over or maybe it is just because i can play a tomb raider  game just about anywhereor maybe it is because while the game lost its  charm a new brand of fun took its place
the game does have a lot of  good points
the graphics are really well done it is challenginga big  feat for nintendo and there are plenty of quotpowerupsquot laying  around just waiting to be swooped up
it is very inventive for the game  boy format it isnt just an ordinary jump n shoot game
the levels are  expansivea bad pointdepending on your point of view
i would call it a  quotgoodquot gamenot a great game
hardcore tomb raider fans  probaly will find this adventure a little tame although it is great for  younger players who may love laras adventures but find her other  expeditions on the tough sidethe side scrolling format might be a easier  for them
so the final verdictgive this game a whirl but build your  library on laras and soon bit adventuresfirst of all let me point out the fact that silent hill is alot of fun no matter how you shake it
now to my points lets first discuss how funny it is that people claim how scary this game is
in honest opinion this game is not as scary as the reviews would have you think
id say its more disturbing than scary and this points to my only true gripe about the game
this disturbing effect wares away after awhile it does and when it does out goes the horror that you are supposed to feelnow dont get mad at me silent hill fanboys
i did say the game was fun no matter how you shake it up and thats the truth
silent hill for its time was a game that stood under the huge shadow of resident evil
with respects it cast its own light for its fans but you cannot compare silent hill and resident evil as the same thing
neither is really better than the other it all depends on what you want to get your heart pounding and no silent hill is not for a more mature level of player ha ha both games are on the same level
so go for the game if you wish to play a classic or looking for a quick thrillnow to sum up the ending of my rantreview id have to say the reason this game received a  is because in truth the sound and graphics are subpar
the storyline is at best mediocre and it will have you shaking your head in the end i had to find a website dedicated to explaining the storyline for this game yeah that bad
i know i know its dated blah blah blah but seriously what scared you more
harrys funny running graphics or the silly looking demondogs
as ive said to friends its the initial shock of seeing something you had not seen beforeso thats it i hope you buy this title as it does deserve a play through
however if your looking for a scary and or horror game id suggest you either pick up silent hill  or resident evil  they are scary at times and without the hassle of the almost unplayable annoying and pointless puzzles alocated throughout silent hilloh and one more thing i saw today monday april th  that this game was selling used for 
ha ha i would never buy a psx  game for that price
dont be suckered into that rip offthis ones got plenty of bodyslammin wwf action
much like the ps smackdowns roster is starting to age a bit
the create a wrestler mode is decent though allowing you to add wrestlers who may not have come along until sd
voiceovers would certainly pick the game up
but for twenty bucksor less if used this one will give you that steel chair fix anytime you crave itnow i only had one game to go
so i decided to buy the first smackdown
game
i think i played it once and that was all
compared to the rest of the smackdown
game even smackdown
 this game is pretty bad
now at the time im sure it was good but just not nowthe graphics are pretty bad worse then smackdown
 but again this is a playstation game so theyre pretty good
there are only  superstars to choose from which isnt very many
there are a whole lot of matches in exhibition mode either
theres single tag team handicap battle royal royal rumble king of the ring hardcore anywhere fall cage survival special referee and i quit
but you can hold title defenses in exhibition which makes me happyseason mode is pretty boring
i think i played it once and only for a few minutes
im not gonna bother saying much about it thoughcreate mode is pretty bad though
theres create a payperview which is almost the same as in smackdown
 and then theres create a superstar
it sucks
you can only choose default heads upper bodies and lower bodies
you have barely any control over anything
it just plain sucks
its one of the reasons why i have barely ever played smackdown
 because create a superstar is one of my favorite thingstheres also ranking and belt holder modes again which are the same as in smackdown
all in all this is definitely the worst game in the smackdown
series
if you have a playstation just stick with smackdown
 even if you want to collect all of the games in the series im pretty sure that youll be wasting your money if you buy this gamethe game was okay for the sole reason of the seasoncareer mode
graphic wise it was stupendous the matches were tedious the moves were goodthis is a great game it finnaly brings the world of the wwf to the world of playstation
it has all the qualityies to be a awsome game but cant put it all together
first off the storylines are outdated
this game is slow and the graphics arent great
each time you try and do something it takes so long to load
but it does have lots of great events and a great season mode and good moves but the moves keep repeating themsevles over and over
you should buy this game and if you dont like the wwf just give it a tryi bought this  and thought it would be awesome with  games
but to my disappointment  of the games dont work on my pc
i was so unhappy
but my fave one works
my rundown simcity i loaded this and played it once
its classic and the graphics are awful
i also have simcity  and its much better
still at least it works
 simtower this is the best game
my fave
its addictive first time i played i had no idea but i borrowed the book from my friend and im superb now
 simisle this works but i have no idea how to play
my friend got this pack too and she doesnt know either
 simsafari this game doesnt work so i have no idea
 streets of simcity i played this at my friends house because it doesnt work on my pc
its ok you basically drive around simcity and blow yourself up
 simcopter this was fun the first time i played it but its a bit boring
ill play it again though
theres only  worthwhile games on here so its not worth the price but oh well
i had the money to spare and i want to get the kids one im partial to simtown and simpark hehe
buy it if youre crazy about sim gamesretro gamming is not for everyone
i like to play old games well because i just have a problem with nostalgia
if you your not worried about graphics and you want to explore the early years of the sims universe then it would not hurt to drop a couple of bucks for this pack of gamesbe warned i could not get all of the games to run on my system which is still  months away from not being modern anymore
but since the price was reasonable i still felt it was worth the three games i was able to runthe original sim city is just stupid fun
its so easy to build a quick city and its still easy to fail
this is a no frills time killing gamesim copter was by far my favorite
talk about a game that had so much potential but it still turned out to be fun to play
maxis should have gone out of house on this one like to microprose while they lasted
the people inhabiting the cities are like the original sims and funny to hear where i think the simesse language came from considering whats its evolved to todaysim tower was a dirty little pleasure
who thought that building and office tower with apartments restaurants movie theaters etc
could be soo much fun
sim island just throw it away when you open the boxlike i said the game only costs a few bucks so why not give it a try
worst case is you loose a few dollars from what you paid when you sell to the pawn shopsim safari and the streets of sim city didnt work on my computer much like iloveritchieforever i feel your painanyway the games that do work are coolsim city is the classic very first version of the now famous sim city
the graphics are terrible but the game itself is pretty cool
it has cool scenarios and i like playing around with the options on the menussim isle is alright i suppose
its pretty boring i dont know why some people think its brilliant
i played it but i didnt really understand itsim copter is cool
i love flying the helicopter around and crashing into things
i also love using the megaphone
ill play it againi have played streets of simcity
its pretty boring
you just drive around simcity and blow yourself upmy favourite game was sim tower
i love it
i love building the tower and renaming all the people and the shops
i like the events and the cool soundsthis gets  stars because of sim tower
if sim tower wasnt on it it would get only  stars
considering some of the games didnt work on my computer i probably have a right to be disappointedtheres food aplenty in the latest pj sam adventure
as with most of the humongous entertainment titles this is a rpg for kids
you have to visit all of the locations and interact with all of the characters in order to reach the climax which in this game is peace between all of the food groupsi liked how fruits amp vegetables were portrayed in this gamenone of that stereotypical quotveggies are the nd class citizens of the kid food worldquot nonsense pervades
all food groups are treated equally although i must admit that the socalled junk foods were portrayed as they typically are in the media in a rather negative light
i was surprised that the junk foods didnt speak with english accents and the veggies speak with american accentsmuch like the conflict between the slaves amp the romans in kubricks spartacusall in all it was a good diversion for my child
as with all humongous titles when the action gets stuck in a particular place its quite easy for grownups to access the help menu which provides for quick solutions
another good feature of the humongous titles is their replayability
there are always multiple gamepaths to the finishi was reluctantvery reluctant to buy this game after reading all of the bad reviews on amazoncom but my friend eventually pressured me enough to give it a tryafter all the store had a sevenday return policy
after  playing it for six days i both love and hate the gamelets first talk  about why i love the game
first off its addictivevery addictive
like a good novel it takes some willpower to wrest yourself away from  everquest and if you have friends online that own this as well even more  willpowerits fun to go exploring and hunting with your friends
the  graphics and sound arent that shabby either and when the sun sets or  rises in this game the sky looks gorgeous with its red hues and clouds
plus the world of everquest is huge and everchanging
i mean it takes  days to reach the other side of this world
also there is no  playerkilling unless you allow it
this is good because i cannot stand  people who run around killing newbies that are less than fifteen minutes  into the gamenow lets talk about why i hate this game
unfortunately since everquest is so addictive it can become a bad habit
i set limits upon myself i only play everquest for  hours whenever time  permits
some people have really fallen into everquest however and spend  practically every waking hour on it
also you need friends online because  they help you start out by giving you expensive items and armor to use
i  hate doing this because i believe in getting everything myself also the  reason why i never play diablo on battlenet but some areas of everquest  are very difficult for newbies and shops charge exorbitant fees for their  wares so to survive you have to take whatever is offered to you
lastly  and this is by far the biggest gripe about everquest is something i like  to call quotcorpserunningquot  when you die in everquest you lose  all of your equipment but never fear because if you can find your corpse  you can get all of your stuff back
nobody else can steal your stuff so  you dont have to worry about looters
now remember how i said that the  world is huge
well since your corpse disappears after a time or when  you log off you have to rush to get your stuff back
unfortunately this  sometimes means traveling crosscountry to get your corpse
just hope that  you dont have any errands to run in reallife during a  quotcorpserunquot  when you finally do manage to find your corpse  you have to equip everything again
while this may not seem that bad at  first as you get more armor and weapons youll find this very annoying  as there is equipment for practically every part of your body
ears neck  head shoulders chest legseven your face can have equipment on it
many hours are wasted by quotcorpserunningquotnotice how most of  the reason why i love the game are somehow related to the reasons why i  hate the game
i think that these quotclose tiesquot are why no matter  how much a player may lovehate it heshe will still keep playing  everquest
to wrap it up everquest is likea doubleedged blade
it  has many good things but these good things in the wrong circumstances can  turn into bad things
you may love it you may hate it but either way  you cant stop playing itthis game is a drug pure and simple
its horridly bad for you
itll make you skip school miss work and generally become an unbalanced person
when youre playing it all your problems are forgotten and you are oblivious to the outside world
when you stop playing it you suddenly realize its dark outside and youve gotten nothing done
it leads to excessive inactivity both physical and mental which can result in tiredness forgetfulness and irritability
the worse things become in your real life the more you come to depend upon it the more you need it to forget what youll have to face eventuallythen you have to pray that you have good friends and a loving family to pull you out of the whole mess
even after a year of abstinence from direct contact you still have a strong feeling of emptiness that did not exist before
everquestor evercrack as many of the players have come to call it is like the devil dont sign your name or youll lose your soul
dont make the mistake i made
at least i learned something from my experience and that is the danger of drugs in whatever forms they might takei liked the missions involved in this game and i liked the extension of the thief saga one of my all time favorite games to play
but the villain was pretty stupid
he turned out to be some paranoid schizo nut case who wanted to kill everyone which really made no sense
and he sealed himself away in a protected vault where you couldnt get to himhaving said that i liked the scope and scale of the missions and the fact that they were challenging but it did seem odd that on some of the larger maps some of the areas where it seemed like you could explore were sealed off or not rendered
example the warehouse map it seemed like you should have been able to get to the streets or swim around the rocks to get to the ship but none such was the case
there are other various examplesanother minor criticism is the low poly count on the characters
the skins help make up for the visuals but i think an update is much needed to keep this game fresh and alive
regrettably looking glass closed its doors so the probability of that every happening lies in the much vibrant editing communityin short i didnt get quite the same sense of wonder or danger as i did with the first thief game but i still had fun with it all the same
garret had his usual bag of tricks and the missions though somewhat unusual were still challengingbut like i say the villain
oh geeze what a crock
if he had some other master plan or perhaps needed to be more clever because i cant see the hammer order going along with his mad scheme then i might have bought into it
otherwise it was sort of like some of the middle books in the james bond series hohum another megalomaniacal villain
nextstill for all that its worth a purchase for the gameplay itself
the first person sneaker delivers on the goodsmostlyenjoynow i love tomb raider
of anything i love tomb raider  it was nice to see lara croft in  new levels bringing back two of her tr costumes nevada and london
but im a big disbeliever in these gold games
all of them have fallen flat but not so much as the lost artifactbefore you go off on wtf
youre reviewing the lost artifact not tr the lost artifact is a basic spinoff on tr
like tomb raider gold unfinished business
well this just happens to be tomb raider  gold the lost artifactnow ill begin
first the game is glitched
now the lost artifact is on the pc only which was their first mistake
honestly if you ask me they should have a cd for playstation with all of the gold levels from all of the gold games
that would make it a hellufalot easier
but you probably think that has nothing to do with the game being glitched and youre right about that with the second comment
but with the first one my cd has many things wrong with it
ive never had any trouble with tr games for the playstation but the computer ones always boggle me
the lost artifact for me would freeze on the load screen but when id press the drive open button the game would suddenly continue only the music would be stuck in a continuous loop playing the same noteandahalf over and over and over again
when id beat the level id have to put the disk back in and then take it out again at the next load screen button
talk about screwed upsecond it was too short too disappointing
the graphics were horrible as well
the levels were poorly constructed in my opinion
core could have sored with this game but their wings must be broken or something because this one fell flat on its rectumbut i am one of the biggest tomb raider fans on the planet so no matter how bad i thought this game was i still redidly enjoyed it
besides i beat the first level cheat codes for all the rest which means it was relatively easy
whoo rock on me
i was glad to see the return of sofia
she deserved to get burned twice
not only that but tomb raider  did fall rather flat
the lost artifact was able to pick it up from there but in order to really enjoy the game and not find it too short you have to think of it in that perspectiveso unless youre a hardcore tomb raider fan and strive to complete the collection i dont blame you i have all of them too dont get the lost artifact
if tomb raider  just wasnt doing it for you then by all means purchase the gold version
it just might not be worth the troublerun jump shoot run jump shoot run juzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
i actually fell asleep playing this game its so repetitive
i was looking for a really good blowemup time when i bought this game but the weapons are really lame and the same thing happens over and over again
it was fun for about an hour then things got real boring real fastkpc was ultimately a letdown after the hype it received during development
but what you do get is a straightforward fun action shooter in a dark carnivalgonebad world that throws hordes of enemies your way onscreen at oncethe last level is unimaginative and poor but the rest of the game is genuinely entertaining for the most part
many of the people who criticize the game havent even played it they just follow the im a pc gamer lemming mentality so prevalent on the internet and only play whatever is cool or most populareverything about this largely ignored game works despite infamously reusing the mm  and  graphics engine
ill cut to the chase by talking about a single aspect atmosphere
this one may be the most atmospheric mightmagic in the whole series no im not exaggerating
tinting and colored lighting seems to be a great help
the abandoned temple finally feels like an abandoned temple and not like papiermache cutout
alvar feels like a small town and not like a set of polygons
there are little touches here and there that were pretty much absent from previous parts like a tiny park in alvar with a pedestal in the middle that glows in the dark or the tomb near ravenshore with the eerie red glow on its top
also we are treated with got more varied landscape more detailed textures in general
as a result one feels sucked into this world instantly something that may not quite work with previous partstrue it is all less than original  variation on the ageold theme really questmaster  dungeon  monsters  questitem  questmaster  levelup
and there are still problems with npc interaction or lack of
villagers are still drones telling us the same lines over and over again
many players label this series pure rpg  and quite falsely
mm  is still closer to the action genre than to the allimmersive indepth roleplaying experience embodied by the gothic and elder scrolls seriesi for one enjoyed mm  more than mm  which despite being a lot more popular feels stale and spartan in comparison
the designers were in absolute control of their engine the third time around and felt free to experiment with it  to the benefit of the player
its okay to pass on mm but mm is an appropriate swansong to a highly esteemable  yearold seriesrune has a lot of good points the story the visuals and the hacking and slashing
however i must point out that the amount quotswitchhuntingquot and quotkey searchingquot in this game is a bit too muchanyway arent game developers getting tired of that old plot device
you spend a great deal of time in this game getting lost while hunting for a switch which made me very sleepy
why not move the story along using something else that is more fitting to the gamefor example put the key to the locked door on a chain around a monsters neck
if a switch must be used to raise a gate dont hide it so it takes all night to find it
put the darned thing in plain sight surrounded by a bunch of ogres or trolls or whatever monster is appropriate
see
now the game is more fun alreadyreally im not so sure about this game
i havent a clue what ever possessed me to buy this game
im a first person shooter fps kind of a guy not a third person chaser tpc
sure i like games like tomb raider and zelda  and such but that doesnt mean that those are going to be my favorite games
so when i saw this game i decided that i had to get it
the developers at god
must have a contract with aliens or some such to mess with my mindso is the game good
actually yes if i let the game kind of stand on its own
your character ragnar has a choice of three main types of weapons mind you i said quottypesquot of sword mace or axe
along with a single shield usually a wood viking shield however the weapons do get better as the game progresses
this changes the game style drastically
for snipers like myself who can pick off anything from a distance with any firing weapon of choice i can pick off unseen enemies with the bow or slingshot in zelda  this makes the game that much quottougherquot if you will
the player now has the choice of going head to head with the nasties or throwing his weapon and hope its a kill shot not likely
there are also other quotweaponsquot chopping a claw off of one of the larger beetles and you can use it to beat up other nasties
the same goes for the head of this oogabooga kind of creature as well as grabbing his weapons and shields
there are others as well but in the over all scheme of the game it makes little difference except for having disposable ammo
the sword make much better work of the enemies than anything else
one would figure that having the three different weapon types would have significant differences they dont
save for the maces ability to break rock the weapons have very subtle differences and i stress the subtle part
it really would have been better to simply have one weapon to worry about rather than three the differences are that minor
this weapon use is under utilized through out the game
especially considering the abilities of the games engine based on unrealit doesnt bother me that the developers decided to go with a tpc view rather than an fps a nice change of pace
the camera swings about very much like mdk under total control from the mouse
the camera also adjust itself quite well to accommodate space in tight areas
coupled with the ability to change the cameras relative position to your character with a twirl of the mouse wheel is a nice plus
i actually dont have a quotmousequot so this is useless to me so for users like myself adjusting the settings is important
one thing that does irk me quite a bit is that ragnars head always looks at anything dangerous helpful or interesting
the game suggests that if you are lost to pay attention to ragnars head as he usually looks at the next area or direction to go to
this is nice and all but occasionally there are so many enemies that no one could tell whats what
i wish that this type of thing could be further refined in the games settings
it may actually be i just havent figured out what all the advanced settings do
i suppose having ragnar look at the enemies would be usefulif the enemies actually had a brain
the ai is so weak its almost pathetic
take notice the enemies actually cant go up or down quotstepsquot only slopes
so to gain sanctuary one simply has to climb up to a different level plane
i wasnt sure if this was a limitation imposed by the developers or the games engine
so i went back to unreal and played through again
it actually appears to be a limitation to the unreal engine but the developers of unreal took great pains to insure that almost everything consisted of slopes
there are rare instances when enemies are moved from one plane to another via elevators and such but it is a limitation nevertheless
going back to the enemy ai its kind of sad
most enemies dont notice you until youre practically standing on their back
enemies often dont give chase especially when moving from one plane to the next
at least the more quotintelligentquot enemies run away when you remove an quotarmquot or two
the enemies sometimes quotbickerquot among themselves as well
although its a bit unclear who are enemies to whom
the creatures tend to get jammed in tight areas or get stuck quotoffquot of their plane levitating like a magician
its hard not to compare the ai of the creatures to a game like halflife
now considered an industry standard to scale games against
just try not to be too disappointed when those stupid creatures stand there like eggplants while you kill them off with a sword swipe or twoim not going to bother much with the story line
you ragnar have quotgraduatedquot to man hood and is honored to join your viking clan on a quest to 
to 
what
initially to fight conrack and his raiding party
conrack calls down a bit of lightning and kills everyone including you during the start of the battle
the god odin i think takes pity on you and revives you to go on a quest
the storyline is a bit 
vague or i simply dont have the attention span to keep focused
something about a conflict with the gods and mankind and a great battle is poised to unleash itself on the planet
or is loki a viking god tortured with a poisonous snake going to seek revenge for what has happened to him
whatever reading the manual the webpage and going through the game its lost on me
rune is unable to fully suspend your belief
there is no doubt in my mind that rune will certainly create a cult following
i do like the game
i really do
its a nice change of the pace from the fps killanythingthatmoves kind of thing
and its a little more suitable to my tastes since im sick of the tomb raider franchise
however im going to wait a few more patches and see how the game comes out then
maybe ill change my review if the game improves a bittigerpommethis is a fun clever puzzler game
its cheap its on dreamcastif you are lucky enough to find it
i would not advise spending more than  dollars for it
theres a fair amount of p puzzles to keep you busy they become more challenging i think there shouldve been more still
player is a nice brand of chaos it doubles as one of the top party games
thankfully you can turn down the speed to quite slow but you cannot remove 
mice for modechanging in a game you can only choose normal or many but you soon realize the question marked mice are the name of the game
youll have fun for awhile but the modes are awkward and unvarying
there are no good graphics and only one cinema scene which appears shortly when a game ends
there should have at least been a startup scene with mice scurrying into a rocket in d
strangely enough the back of the game gd shows the game in the most pathetic jpeg ever cant sega get a decent shot of their own game for the gd case
worth buying at least rent its not for everyone but its a lot like worms world party
there isnt a random level generator either
only the colors really change
if you like having to work frantically fast at something difficult this is for you but i dont care for the main attraction as much as i did the p puzzles
this was given away for free in other places and i think thats how it should have been distributed its good fun but comes off as just a glorified minigame they couldve fit it into sonic adv
 compared to mario party  which has  minigames chu chu is just one
its not quite chess or tetris but its worth picking uptenchu was without a doubt my favorite ps game
i played it too death and loved to reply it again and again
i was really looking forward to tenchu  but after playing it i just didnt think it was a worthy sequal
i still enjoyed playing it
some of the missions were very interesting while others were not so
the graphics were poor at times
but the pov was terrible
many times it ended in werid angles where i couldnt see the person attacking me
worse when it was a boss
it is still a good fun game
with codes readily available and easy to do
it gives it that bit extra if you just cant beat a certain boss
overall it just isnt as good as it should have been
i hope they do a tenchu  for the psthis may sound a bit silly but the fact that the first boss said what
whore you
just like the boss on the first game absolutely delighted me
you pick up a new character in this game which is pretty cool but unfortunately this game cant begin to keep up with the first tenchu
the only thing tenchu  really has thats better than tenchu is a less confusing map and bigger stages
oh and you its also easier to get different stealth kills
in the first tenchu you basically saw the same stealth kill over and over again even though you could initiate more tenchu  its easier to perform different ones
the bigger stages arent always a good thing though its easy to get lost and confused in this game
the all important and essential grappling hook is harder to use in this game and will leave the gamer frustrated many times
the game features less blood but the same dialogue still giving it the old king fu movie minus the kung fu feel
the creators also didnt bother to improve camera angles
aside from the actual game you get to create your own stage get to set the conditions for victory set traps and place enemies
this game is a tenchu fan only game i do not thing other gamers will enjoy this titlethe moment you start the game the moment you see the beginning moviewhich is very excellent you begin to think that tenchu  is going to be something special
but as soon as you start the game you instantly learn that the game suffers from horrible graphics weird controls and a camera that seems like its trying to piss you offthat means that it sucks
let me explain the graphics the textures are jumpy so jumpy that its hard to see
not only that but the textures themselves are kinda crappy
and now for the weird controls its not so much that they suck its that you turn really slow making it hard to fightthis is a problem during boss battles especially if the game had a d classic movementpressing left makes you move left instead of turning etc it would be much easier
also the camera doesnt make things any easier it can get stuck in wierd placesthis problem is biggest during boss battles
i also forgot to mention this they ai of the enemy is horrid the enemies you fight are as dumb as a chickenmaybe even dumber they can lose you so easilyclimbing to another surface ducking under water ect
heres an example i was fighting a boss and he fell down a fivefoot cliff he was looking for me and then he couldnt find me so he gave upjust like normal enemies and then i jumped down and stealthkilled him
it was really stupid
aside from all these issues there are some highlights like the stealth kill animations and variety you can stealth kill an enemy in so many ways
now before you go off to play tenchu  remember this rent it first before buying youll thank me lateri recently finished this game and i have to say that the singleplayer hasnt left me with a great aftertaste
unlike the wing commander series there isnt any plot inbetween missions hence no character development
were limited to getting to know our socalled wingmen through ingame  dialogue
despite the lack of a compelling story the gameplay is still  pretty challenging for the seasoned gamer and the missions offer a good  variety of objectivesi wont rehash some of the comments made by other reviewers here as they seem to be right on with the exception of the gushing fanboysthis is a fairly decent space combat sim that looks and feels like a retrostyled  wing commander  which is hardly surprising considering the source
no new  ground is really being broken here in the way that freespace  did with  its massive capital ship combat and nebula missionsthe graphics are  good and i got great framerates on my celeron  with tnt graphics card
however theres really heavy distance filtering applied to the textures on  the ships so if a ship isnt right in your face it looks like a  browngrey blob
this is particularly bad because the game relies heavily  on inengine cutscenes which come out looking awful this way
you also  cant skip the cutscenes which is completely annoyingthe fighter ship  design is very coolthey all look like vicious wwii fightersbut the  capship design isnt nearly as good with one or two exceptions
capship  combat and anticapship missions are a big letdown when compared to  fsas others have stated the ai is profoundly stupid and your options  for controlling them are very limited
youre basically alone out  therethe flight model is also weird
you lose turning maneuverability  when you slow down which is the opposite of most space sims
this makes  the game into a lot of highspeed passing and turning with a great deal of  gunfire as the ships dont mount many missiles and the missiles are both  easily evaded and usually ineffective and theres no standard rearming  inmissionwhat does make the game replayable is cooperative  multiplayer which you can play on the zoneyou can replay any of the  campaign missions with othersdeathmatch multiplayer is a different  story however
there are a lot of fun variants on deathmatch but the  actual playing of it is bad
theres a great deal of lag warping and other  weirdness in deathmatch even if you have a blazing connection to the net
youll explode without even knowing you were being shot at youll get  killed by the guy that you are drilling right in front of you because he  has actually come around behind you and shot you only you never saw that  updated on your screen
so deathmatch becomes far less skill than luck and  not very funconclusion you might have some fun with this if youre  bored and looking for a new space action fix but dont expect it to be the  next great thing as its pretty much more of the same
if youve never  played freespace  you owe it to yourself to check that out first before  committing to starlancerone final note the force feedback on this game  is absolutely the best ive ever experienced
it almost is reason alone to  try out the game
for the first time force feedback actually figures  prominently in the gameplay you hesitate to turn on certain weapons  because your stick will be shaking so hard you wont be able to hit the  target
it definitely adds a lot of fun factor to the flying
i wish other  games implementations of force feedback were as goodi think most of the reviews here have pretty much summed up the game
a basic hack n slash with integrated cut scenes
there is a lot of cut scenes present here
basically its a game within a movie
the game has little variety you basically are just hacking your way through the game
its fun for the first hour then it sort of becomes a chore
the graphics where top notch for the time
so is the story which almost makes up for the lack of game play depth
while the controls are decent i wouldnt say they are spot on
also theres a few pita moments where your in a corridor or other tight quarters and guts sword is almost rendered useless since its too big too properly wield
so basically you are just clanking against the walls
sometimes whacky camerawhich was a problem for a lot of these games back then and sometimes iffy collision problems
also there are sometimes where the games gets extremely hard and borderline frustrating
dont get me wrong its a good game and worth a play through
however its lack in game play depth long intense cutscenes just ok controls makes the game a  star eventi really liked this game for the first month or so that i bought it
nice graphics and easy controls but i dont see too much replay value in this game
yeah there are different paths to take but they just lead to the same thing large amounts of death but theres nothing wrong with that
if i had to recommend a game like sword of the berserk i would probably have to say draconus
its a little more in depth without losing the fun of slashing all kinds of enemiesthis game is indeed a side story of berserk and came to the us even before the anime
thats cool and berserk fans will love itit has awesome cutscenes fanservice and it is pretty fun
but the controls are clunky
the game is shortand rediculously easy
still its awesome that this game exists so only buy it if you are a berserk fan and you can get a good dealsimple game that could have been great with a few tweaks here and there
i love the dreamcast for their randomness and unpredictabilitywhat i said above pretty much sums up my feelings about this game
i have played practicaly every sonic game in excistance with only but a very few exceptions and am a huge sonic fan
of all the games i have had the least amount of fun with this one why
mainly because the difficulty curve went beserk and would make you think such a thing as a difficulty curve was just a figment of your imagination and never existed in the first place
i was unable to even get passed the first zone because of the dodgeball boss dodging has never been my strong suit in gaming
this boss however has gone done in history as what many people would call the hardest boss in sonic history
and guess what
i used a level select code which i would put here if i still remembered it to get myself to the last level the one you could only get to if you had all the chaos emeralds
and i beat the final boss hands down with little to no difficulty once so ever
losing too many times to count on the very first boss and not even losing one life to last boss
thats like mayjorly messed up
also tails my fav character wasnt playable instead you had to rescue him from robotnik thats pretty much the whole plot though with the way the chaos emeralds are hidden i dought that hardly any one who plays this will be able to acomplish this even if they beat metal sonic
id dont get it the genisis version is like sooooo much better
but if you have a game gear it might be worth a buy its dirt cheap ive seen it for sale for  penny before
 and is better than most other game gear titles though not as good as all the other sonic titles on the system such as tails adventures and sonic triple trouble
bottom line its not really that bad and is still fun if youre a hardcore sonic fan you probably should get it and if youre looking for more game gear games you probably should get it every one else get the genisis version insteadthis is a good game for fans of sonic who have a gamegear
if you like sonic games and want to play them on the go then this is a good one
also you will need a gamegear to play this gamenot a desirable game
i like kirby from smash bros and the gameboy
the n version is weird angles and had a lot to be desired
it is a fun game to have but will not be played oftenif cuteness was being rated kirby would definately be a  star game
unfortunately some of the other aspects of the game arent as great
its a typical kirby game  rediculously easy
im not trying to say that this game wasnt fun but the levels and mini games were so easy i beat the entire thing in  days
also the part that annoys me the most is that you dont use the joystick on your n paddle you use the arrow key padpersonally i give this game  stars
however the cute scenery and easy controls would be perfect for a beginning gamer
i also think that kirby might be a little more appealing to girls but again thats my opinion
i recommend it for ages   if youve played any of capcoms d fighter cpstoplaystation conversions lately then you already know what to expect from the playstation version of marvel vs capcom
while the arcade and subsequently the arcadeperfect dreamcast conversion supplied a fourfighter tagteam battle the playstations ram limitation limits the battle to two fighters
also many frames of animation have been chopped out particularly those for larger characters
marvel vs capcom is the latest incarnation of capcoms street fighter vs series
but here instead of limiting the characters to xmen or street fighters capcom has taken characters from all over the marvel and capcom universes
marvel is represented by new additions like venom and onslaught as well as fightinggame veterans like spiderman captain america and wolverine
capcoms lineup includes street fighters ryu chun li and zangief but also nonfighting characters like captain commando strider hiryu and mega man
the result is an ultimate albeit a bit condensed lineup of fighters from all over the place
this cross section of comicbook heroes and videogame characters gives the game a truly new and diverse feel even if the gameplay hasnt changed too much since the last capcom vs fighting game marvel super heroes vs street fightersome remnants of the tag battle remain
you still select a second character but that characters only influence on the battle is in the form of short special attacks
the arcade game actually had you select three fighters one of whom served as a helper character that you could call on at any time for a quick attack
now you select your main fighter and then choose if you want one of these helpers or a second normal fighter that will join up with you and perform team super combos should you issue the command to do so
to make up for the loss of the tag action the ability to link multiple super combos has been added
this lets you really rack up the multihit combos and do a lot of damage to your opponent to boot
graphically the game really doesnt look too bad taking into consideration the limitations of the hardware
the game is colorful and the backgrounds are nice
new to the playstation version is a quick zoom that occurs during throws
this is a little disorienting and the characters get pretty pixelated up close as well
the audio portion of the game is troublesome
everything sounds extremely tinny and the trebley sound and music will get on your nerves almost immediatelyif youre looking for the arcade version you really need to go to an arcade or pick up the dreamcast version
the playstation version may have the same moves as the original game but the shell surrounding those moves is completely different
rent this one firstfront mission   circa good a nice change of theme from the usual swords and sorcery that most strategy games use customizable mechsbad graphics might looked dated to today video game players gameplay can be difficult and slow story is overly complex but can be a little on the dry sideif it fits your taste a scifi strategy set in the pacific rim of a near future earth gameplay can be slow and difficult no voiceovers so lots of reading customizable mechsgame its most assocated too armored core final fantasy tacticsadditional notes this first  games where on super nintendonot quite as good as i remembered it to be ill have to be honest
used to play this all the time as a kidthis game is at best ok  i wouldnt reccomend it if you were looking for a game that you can play over and over and will last a long time
the controls on this are sticky and rarely work how you want them too
the controls seem relatively simple but believe me they are not
graphics are definitely an upside
very colorful environents help to compliment the detailed and easily visible xmen
there are  playable characters plus  hidden characters
if you own a playstation i would reccomend buying the psx version of this game but dont hesitate to buy this game if youre a big xfan it is fun its just not a classic epic game like the legend of zeldathis game is based on real walt disney world rides such as big thunder mountain railroad and blizzard beach
this game is okay but it is for the younger kids or it will be too easy
i win every time i play
this game is somewhat enjoying but it gets old quicklygameplay it isnt too fun but it would be for  year olds if they can playgraphics mushy and gross
i cant tell what the level is without lookingsound okayits just music that fits that place like on dinosaur
the music is prehistoriccontrol easy fast carts to speed all through haunted mansion
so easy a  year old could control this cart without tryingoverall that is a 
round up and this games got a 
this game could get betteri liked playing this game the graphics are great for the time it was made
however the playable character lineup was not very familiar only three characters were popular disney characters the rest were odd ball but kind of cute it thier own ways
the difficulty was annoying however it took me several tries to get through the dinosaur level
after that it just seemed to bee even harder so i gave up
this is a good addition to anyones disney collection if they enjoy video games but honestly like alot of video games out there the developers need to let up on the difficulty and give you the option to make it easier or not make it difficult at all especially if its a kids gamegreat game  but its an older game and the grafics are poor
i wish for an updated version and the gameplay and tracks are great
  stars out of  overall
tom dits a shooter you run around through a maze shooting
you find occasional powerups and you shoot
you go into different levels and worlds and shoot
not much skill involved
all you need is  thumbscontrollerhalf a brain and shoot
i guess shooters are just not my bag
graphics and gameplay are good
didnt play it long enough to actually find the plot  weeks or so surprised even that long shooters just isnt my favorite genre and my review may in someway be biased
if your into shooters then its your call but as for my personal opinion this game is ok maybe a little fun with multiplayers but replay value try to find it used or wait for the price to go down
this game gets  stars grade c gamer is out
game ona remake of the s arcade classic gauntlet legends lets many of us  relive our youth with the days we spent pouring our hard earned allowance  into a machine at the local arcade
gauntlet legends contains mostly  monotonous hack and slash game play
it consists of little more then  mashing the attack button and collecting gold
at first the graphics might  catch your eye and the chance to relive the days of old but soon after  you will tire of this game
it is a renter at best which is always better  played with a friend then sologauntlet legends is a great multi player game if you have the friends
it does get boring as a single player fast
the graphics are less than spectacular as with all midway dreamcast games but the sound is passable
the game has a disturbing story line which is kind of a turn off and if not for that it would be a great gameworth getting if you play it as a multi player if not then you can let it slip under the radarits good when it works
i have  more words i have to say before i can submit it and i dont know what eles i have to say about iti bought this game hoping to have some fun
i did and then again i didnt
using the keyboard is a painand the controls are terrible
the graphics are great and i enjoyed that immensely
when the game functioned properly i had a lot of fun
but the default controls mustve been designed for some idiot with four hands if you can figure it out its a lot of funhitman codename  is a third person action game with groundbreaking graphics and well desinged missions
hitman supports directd opengl dfxglide i have played it on both dd and ogl and they look really cool with no problems
the gameplay is orginal and it has a orginal story
you play tobais fleeper he is assinged missions to kill gangsters
who is he  where did he come from  play hitman and find out
hc has a very intresting gameplay all the  missions are very well desinged with loads of admosphere
the game has high replay value i played almost all the levels  times and i am still not bored there is never a dull moment
the graphics are fantastic the guys at io interactive have done a fantastic job
the sparks when bullets fly through with smoke comming out of the guns the graphics depth and detail of the rain forest mission quotfind the uwa tribequot is simply outstanding same goes to the atmosphere in the hotel mission quottraditions of the tradequot
hitman has the best graphics engine ever
hitmans physics is also superb they must be seen to be belived
the sound is also superb and the music is just right for a game like this
the charecters are well animate and look real and the voice acting is great
hitman does not have a save game option but that was not a problem to me besides the mission quotplutonium runs loosequot in which you need to complete the mission in a short period of time it was almost impossible
every other mission can be completed without saving in this game you are not a terrorist you are a hitman if you plan your moves carefully you will succeed in the gamehitman could be a ground breaking game if it wasnt for all its problems
the third person view is a bad choice for a game like this as the hitmans head and back block half of your view and it is not nice to see the bald head all the time
i dont know why people make action games in the third person view of all tps games i have played only heretic ii and tomb raider were good and and a nice choice for the rd person view
hcs keys are a big problem too you need to both the keyboard and mouse to play the game
there are no hot keys for weapons or the inventory the weapons and everything you pick up are kept on the inventory and to pick up a weapon you need to click on the inventory button use the scroll wheel and point to the weapon and press the action button to pick up
and besides this for just opening a door you need to right click on it and a small window would appear you need to use the scroll wheel to point on the quotopen doorquot option and click the action button to open it
when you kill someone you cannot carry the body like thief you need to drag the body that is very difficul as you have to bend and walk backwards and you cannot see clearly
the ai is not that very good when you are dressup in hitmans clothes everybody gives you a suspesious look when you have a weapon in your hand they are alert thats good
but when you have a fiber wire in your hand people far away would scream thats unbelivable
hitmans biggest problem is that there are lot of in game cutsences and all in the wrong place it causes a problem in the mission quotsay helloquot you are to kill pablo when i shot him there was a useless cutsence he said he is stronger by the time i managed to get my controls and aim he shot me twice is shot him again and another useless cutsence for every shot a cutsences
havent the guys at io interactive played action games before
cutsences takes the control away from the player and by the time you get the controls you will be killed
what idiot would have cutsence in a middle of a firefight
it is really sad that it has all these problems it could have been a very enjoyable game if it is in the first perso view with no in game cutsence and a better controls
still hitman is a great game and i would recommend it it is really worth a look
finally after the credit titles it is written quotdont call us we are on vacationquot whats that suppose to meanits  and i found this ps title going for a really cheap price so i figured what harm could it do to try it
i loved duke nukem d on pc and even found it surprisingly great on the n in duke nukem zero hour
so it puzzles me why its taken me this long to try another duke titleduke nukem returns to kick some arse and chew bubble gum and hes all out of gum
this game is simmilar in style to that of zero hour its taken away the first person perspective of duke nukem d however there is a code to unlock st person view for those interested
this time around duke has been called in to save a world full of babes from an alien invasion by some monkeys and pigs as well as a few other alines and what not
typical duke action as you battle your way through environments until you reach your save pointend of level marker
you blow away the bad guys spill some alien guts and listen to duke be a smartarse about it allweaponry this time introduces a few old classics and a few new ones as well as some revamped older ones
quite frankly i miss the original rpg and machine guns but it is fun now to use the new rpg which is more like duke is holding the scope from a submarine to launch them as well as flamethrowers lasers plasmas shrink rays and what notas usual for those who are wussies there are plenty of codes that can be unlocked for invincibility infinite ammo level select and much more
there is a few worlds to explore and the environment feel right for a duke nukem battle
however at times there feels like there is not enough enemies even on the hardest difficulties it just makes them harder to kill not more of them coming at you
i found the controls to be a bit wonky at times but not enough to effect gameplay itself
i guess it just takes a few minutes to adjust to but i would have much preffered using both analog sticks to roam around and look in whatever direction instead you have to get used to the uppermid directions of the one stick being how you look around or hold r to aim aroundoverall not as classic a game as duke nukem d of coarse none of them ever will be
i didnt quite enjoy it as much as zero hour that game will be hard to top
but its better than well i havent played time to kill or the other ps title yet so i guess i can just say its better than duke nukem and duke nukem  for now if you even knew those two side scroller games even existedstill none the less
a pretty good effort in the duke nukem series
definitely feels like its ps graphics so dont expect more anyway hail to the king babywhile this game is a rd person shooter similar to time to kill it is nothing like that horrible game
this one is actually playable
the controls have been vastly improved and the graphics are slightly better
it also has more of a duke feel despite not being a fps like duke dthe game follows duke as he is sucked into the future to save a bunch of babes
it has plenty of new dukeisms and while its certainly not the best psx game its playable and semienjoyable
just dont go into it expecting a true duke d experiencedont get me wrong
this game is good
but after you run through it for a few hours it kind of gets boring
you get to hear regis say the same things over and over and you start to lose interest
the good thing is  that the game is relativly inexpensivemillionaire nd edition is a quality game if youve got several people and have some free time
its not terribly thrilling especially if you are playing alone
if you have got a group of people playing it tends to move a bit faster
the graphics and sounds of regis are incredible and the game is definitely a challenge
youll probably use up all your lifelines by the time youve reached the  level
if you plan on playing with a group of people go for it but if youre looking for a fun game to pass the time look elsewherethis is the second installment of who whant to be a millionare
and it it is better in many ways
first of all i see the creators have found their mistake in the st edition so they added a ton of question so that it will probally wont repeat
they also have improved the graphics regis looks better
but this game still has its flaws
for one the questions are to hard i still havent won the million
regis still says the same thing over and over
they still didnt do anything to improve the lifelines
and you still cant get around that intro which takes for ever
also they didnt even try to do anything with the fastest finger
i still dont recommend this but you might want to give it a tryas the title says this game is stupid alone
however as a party game its awesome
i played it with  other people and it was really intense and fun
i bought it myself and returned it the next day it just wasnt worth itfirst of all ps is not the most powerful gamesystem on the planet
mb  of vram is holding this system back
the xbox demolishs the ps in terms  of pure speed
the xbox will have dvd ethernet hard drive and four  controller ports built in not two like sony
the only reason sony wins in  the long run is not games but because zombies believe their marketing and  buy sony
dont believe the hype
metal gear solid x is coming out for  xbox so dont brag ps owners
there is one game that looks great and  that is the bouncer i have to admit that game looks fantastic but that is  square not sony
wait for the xbox and save your money and time for  another system
if you want to wait for  months to get your system and  pay  dollars just to get your system and a couple of games be my  guest its just money down the drainthis appealing little game has wonderful graphics complete with bullfrogs trademark zoomingrotating camera a la dungeon keeper and an almost simcityage of empires feel
neither heavy on the military though  the object of the game is to wipe out your enemies nor on the building  the main gameplay consists of building enough huts to amass a big enough  army to wipe the enemy out
this is particularly easy on the first few  levelsthe only general twists are in the requirements that you discover  technology by worshipping totem poles and pyramids which again isnt  necessary at the lower levels despite what the scenario info may  suggestindividual scenarios are more like puzzles
an early one gives  you fifteen minutes to worship an quotangel of deathquot statue which  lies deep in the heart of enemy territory
once you figure out what needs  to be done executing the plan is relatively simple though somewhat  timeconsuming the game relies a lot on timeconsuming tasksthere  isnt really a lot of quotgamequot here outside of the puzzles  probably less so than in the original populous but its look and interface  give it an undeniable appeal a kind of quotwell thats coolquot  factoroh it is also somewhat unstable even with the latest patches  in my experience four different machines with different graphic cards  which is unfortunate and the main reason i gave this  stars instead of i liked the feel that it gives me because it feels more like the series than the other digimon games but its still not that good
i dont like the battling style that they use in this game it seems that you have to keep shouting the same order at your digimon just to get him to do something
i dont care for the digivolution style either
you have to go through the intraining level and you cant get to the mega level
you have to actually wait to digivolve and to make the time go by faster you have to train fight or sleep
its also hard to know how to get the digmon you want beacause of care mistakes
you make them when you scrue up with your digimon and the more mistakes the lousier the digimon you get
i do like that you get to be on file island and that you can start the game with either one of my favorite rookies agumon or gabumon
anything that has to do with digimon i like so i aprove of this game just because i love digimon
this may not be a great game for everyone so i give it a medioker scorei played this game for a bit and found it was ok it was very violent and futuristic but i guess thats what teenagers want these days
i found the campaigns very easy as i beat them in a week
the game isnt very strategic but it has its strategy points
this game should not be rated  stars
the graphics are mediocre the music is annoying and the gameplay is slightly boring after a while
as you go through the world as either the russians or the english you face many campaigns that you must beat
it was clever of them to put them together but they are very easy
you can go along several paths another plus but the paths all end the same way if you winthis game is also not very strategic
you are either allied or soviet and each team has completely different units
that maybe strategic but there are only  points of views to master
in age of empires or age of kings there are many different civilizations each with bonuses and special units
also the terrain has no affect on how damage is dealt
it will just deal the same amount every time
no matter to what kind of unit
in aok each unit has a different amount of armor some have attack bonuses against certain units and units have the advantage in battle when they are uphillthis game is also very violent and bloody with futuristic weapons
not the kind of game i would like my kids playing
in aok the units use bows arrows and swords with not much blood and historical features
it also has a whole history book of all the tribes that you can be and their historyoh
what the point of the game is
blow the other team to bits with guns as big as you cani didnt like this game much and from my review you can see that i would reccommend age of empires or age of kings
see my review of age of empires collecters edition
before you even consider buying this gameive always like this game
it tends to be one of those i choose to play whenever i want a game to just relax with
i tends to create my own maps and that makes it more enjoyable
one thing
the game will on occasions playing user designed maps just lock up
this shows up as an illegal operation and you can usually hit esc and then tell windows to close the game
i tend to play this game under winse as it runs better under that os
it will runs under xp but not very well and the lockups seem more numerous there
this doesnt totally keep the game from running just really creates a problem running the self created maps
the campaign game seems to run fine without the lockupsthis has to be the most irritating game in existince
no matter how hard you try the controls will not respond how you like
never
do not purchase if you have a low tolerance for anger inducing productson a lighter note the graphics are incredible
the music is unmatched and quite beautifulgraphics control sound fun simon the memory game meets the fifth element the movie with a splash of anime sexploitation
this game is so audaciously outrageously over the top that i had to have it  and i didnt even own a dreamcast system when i bought this gamei am quite happy with space channel   however each of these drawbacks cost it a half star in my book    its a little on the racy side
flashing orange undergarments are par for the course in anime but a little over the top for american sensibilities
 i thought space channel  was brilliantly original but i now know that its not so original as i thought
parappa the rapper for playstation for one is an earlier rythym matching game thats also stylish and fun
 the game is too linear there are no real freedoms or choices along the way and i have yet to find any secret levels
 it has limited replay valueoverall i still love space channel   its great eye candy to show to friends and its a fun party game but it will be on the shelf a lothonestly i couldnt play this game after about  days
there was just too much running around waiting running around some more waiting then finally getting to talk to someone
i do that in real life and its much more fun
now the graphics were outstanding and the voice acting was very goodbut i wish they would have spent more time on the game itself
it just didnt have that something special that most other rpgs havespend million on a game and this is what you get
ranked by many as quotthe best game ever madequot i would have to say it may be the largest signifigant leap into an alternate reality since n mario world however its reign will be shortlivedquotmetal gear solid quot for ps has already been demoed and from a technology standpoint it will blow shenmue awayaside from that tidbit i gave this game  stars because of its cultural differences
as an american i didnt pick up on all the humor and its cultural elements are kind of annoying had the game been placed in the us it may have been more enjoyable for me and i would have given it an extra starit is an amazing game however it requires time effort and probling solving skills like any adventure game
id rather play sonics adventurei listened to all the hype about his game creating an entirely new genre of videogames but when i played it i realized that there wasnt much new to this versus any other rpg
its just more time dependant which is more annoying than anything i heard in shenmue  youd be able to fast forward to a specific period of timebut as a game its okay
thats why it got three stars
unfortunately the game was cut short due to time constraints and the story ends very very abruptly at the end it continues at the beginning of shenmue  but its obvious that where the game ended in shenmue wasnt where it was supposed to endoh and this game isnt for everyone
if you dont have a lot of patience skip this onefirst off this game is a graphical masterpiece
the graphics are ultra realistic
watching ryo run around and open doors even fight itll keep your mouth on the floor
however i do emphasize quotwatching ryoquot
the game is really more of a watch for  hours and play game
on top of that the meager tasks it asks you to do can be irriatating and sometimes not very directed
the fighting system is a downsized version of virtua fighter and not very in depth
the free roaming aspect is very well done but the lack of story control keeps it from shining
the control scheme is also clunky
it takes a bit of getting used to but i found myself turning around when i wanted to back up and running when i wanted to talk
it uses the dpad to move and the l button to runwalk
the analog control is used to lookaround
the story is somewhat nice but is incomplete a la soul reaver
play to the end of the game and find out theres more to do but in another game
which means another couple monthsyears
i say rent this for a couple days and play it
it really isnt worth a purchase in my opinioni got this a week ago and im amazed at how they put a good idea to waste
it had a decent storyline it wasnt a ff  the graphics were amazing and the fighting system was good
they did however ruin it
first there are few to many fights and the game goes incredibly slow
next the analog stick is used for camera u have to use the d pad
finally frequently throughout the game u have to wait for  or  game hours  minuets real life just siting there waiting for either the night clubs to open or if u have an appointment with somebody
its games like this that make believe square is the only company which can make good rpgswell i think my title says it
i was very excited to play this game at first then i was confused
why am i not fighting anyone
that was the question i asked myself after a few hours playing the game
this game can be very dumb like asking the same question over and over again
its new to the people your asking in the game but not for you
then of course there is the constant wandering around trying to find people
then when you find them they dont tell you anything
they just tell to go find some other shop and waste some more time
dissapointedwhen i purchased my sega dreamcast not too long ago the first game i had in mind was jet grind radio
word of mouth said it was a stylish fun innovative game and well worth the purchasewell thats only partially truesee while this game is very cool and stylish with nice celshaded graphics and interesting character design as well as fitting music and sound of acceptable  though not exceptional  quality and undeniably innovative the spray paint mechanics are original its just not that fun
heres whywhen i started playing i was expecting something far more fastpaced
but your character moves at a disappointinglyslow speed
also the spray painting system while fun at first becomes boring and somewhat irritating
its no fun to have to repeat the same actions over and over again and nothing is worse than being shot at while your in the middle of tagging a building or sidewalki would only recommend this game to someone who was interested in studying its cool and bold art style or a diehard sega fan but to everybody else  borrow it if you have the chance assuming you have a friend with a dreamcast
if you cant borrow it just forget about itthis games graphics and music are amazingi wish more games were as colorful as this the gameplay is a good idea but they couldve done it a lot better you kind of have to give it the benefit of the doubt though cause its a new idea but still it couldve been betterfirst of all im going to say this game is awesome i would have given it a  but there are a few little problems i had with it
im still going to say that if you have a dreamcast go try and find this game
if you dont have a dreamcast but you see a copy of jet grind radio and you have a few extra bucks pick up the system and this will be one of the only games you will need in fact so far its the only game that i own
i bought it for  canadian and im not sure what the exchage rates are right nowfun for a while but got boring when you realise that its the samething over and over and over
a little more variety and some  player options would have made jet grind radio a lot betteryet again the curse of many dreamcast games has hitits only fun for a while no lasting appeal or repay valuei played this and the one on the xbox trust me if you have not played it yet it is not worth your time
but if you are a fan or a dreamcast collector get it
the game has unique points but it loses its flare in one day
i give it  instead of  because i know it is not a terrible game to most people but to me it is terrible since i play fighting and rpg games
i did not buy this on amazoncomthe original donkey kong country came at the height of the bit era and featured stunning cgirendered graphics and an awesome soundtrack
it was no easy task for rare to compress this all into a game boy color cartridge
rare succeeded in some aspects but fell short in the most vital onesto its credit the game does manage to capture the general feel and essence of the snes game despite the hardware limitations
the screen is richly populated and detailed with stylings direct from the snes game downsampled of course
the levels are all herethat said think of the snes donkey kong country with donkey kong land controls
eewthe problem with the game comes from its poor controls hit detection and general field of vision
the controls are clearly modeled after those in the donkey kong land games which i always thought felt way too loose for making precision moves and certainly not as tight as the snes versions
couple this with shoddy hit detection and you have a real problem
the enemies are much bigger than they really appear to be and trying to weave through dense fields of them like in the forest stages gets to be outright frustrating
another point where this become apparently involves the derailed mine carts sitting on the tracks
believe me  you will convince yourself that you successfully jumped over them only to have the game kill you
argh
that stage took me no less than a dozen triesthe third dynamic that complicates the game is the smaller field of vision
relative to the snes incarnation you just plain cant see as much at once
now of course this is a very understandable limitation
however the way it propagates itself in the game is not pretty
there are plenty of blind leaps of faith
in fastmoving stages like the aforementioned mine cart stage there is very little time to react to upcoming obstacles
even if you remembered the layout of the stages in the snes game you still have the wonky hit detection to contend withoverall i cannot really recommend this game to anyone unless they enjoyed the donkey kong land games
this title has more in common with those than being a good port of the snes gamepros good graphics and decent sound
levels are faithfully built to mirror their snes counterparts
little was sacrificed in basic game structurecons frustrating hitdetection and inaccurate controls
field of vision seems too smallthis is a truely great game for gba and sneshowever it is a near exact replica to the snes version sound and all
my main problems w the game are the graphicsit looks like a child drew this
donkey kong is so hard with his jump moves tooyes
honestly i hated the fact that to get rumble you had to snap in your rumble pak to get memory you had to take out the rumble pak
so even though i had a rumble pack i really never used it much as for the batteries boy that really suckedthen the weigh of the whole thing took some time to get use to its not so special once you play with a cotroller with built in rumble  tremor  vibrationn had its time and when i had to use this technology i did
 now i think it sucks real bad however it was blast kids i sure had my fun while it lasted
 laterzzzz folks  gamersi played wa before this one and i enjoyed that so much that i had to go back and play the first two
while i could never seem to find the first one i managed to find this one
while i liked wa a lot this one wasnt as good i thought
true the gameplay elements are topnotch and all but where it gets annoying are the themes outside the gameplayfirst of all these characters are actually nicely developed
something that i didnt very much expect from this game
they were brilliantly done
however the dialogue was a little annoying at times
there was one npc character that always started every sentence off with quotin my humble opinionquot and that got very annoying at the beginning of the game because i ran into him a lot
the dialogue was also weak and didnt get the storyline across fast enoughthe graphics arent very good for the psx
this was made in  and we were looking at games like ffix and lod then and these graphcis couldnt compare
theyre fuzzy
while they arent that bad i wasnt quite used to thatthe other major gripe and the reason i gave it three stars is the music
the music is by far some of the worst ive heard in an rpg
seems kind of stupid to dislike the music huh
in an rpg you have to realize that you may need to endure some music for hours
the music in this was enough to make my ears explodethe other reason i gave this three stars is because the most important element to me was a little shabby
thats storyline
there was a story in this game but it was slow and boring to get to
the story paced so slowly and i couldnt take iti was a little disappointed in this game but it really wasnt all that bad
but the music and storylinesomething i have to deal with throughout the entire game were overall weak
so to be truthful this game isnt the most worthwhile in the bunch but for any rpger its very promising because of gameplay this game is easily a good one to choosethe goodgreat gameplaygood battle systemcharacter developmentnot a bad story althoughthe badstory moves very slowlymusic is annoyingthe graphics arent the bestoverall the game is a nice treat for an rpger but its only worth for me to play through onceit was okay but doesnt come close to being as good as the first one
if you loved the first one youll be disappointed in this onethe good wonderful story humor and voice acting great graphics and musical score decent combatthe bad that could have been better hair tearing platforming sections poor checkpointsave system hardly any life to be foundi remember playing the first game back when i was young and never really played more than five minutes of it and now i know why
the game starts off after the first game but know you awaken again to fight the same evil as before
the graphics and audio in this game are topnotch and while medievil ii was developed late in the pss life cycle it doesnt disappoint
you have plenty of weapons and different ways to solve puzzles such as using dans head torches etcthe combat is pretty simple with the smashing of x while you can strafe with r or charge up your hits with square
while the combat gets very repetitive its the least of mes problems
the main problem comes into the extremely frustrating and almost impossible platforming sections
the developers made the spaces between platforms so far apart that it requires extreme precision
this doesnt help when you have to double tap a direction to make dan run and when he does jump its not that farthis snowballs into badly placed checkpoints actually none at all
and if you dont have any extra life bottles which are scarce you have to start all over again
the only thing that keeps you from tossing the game at the wall are the short levels
each one can be completed in about twenty minutes or so depending on if you can complete the puzzlebosses with the little to no hints the game gives youif you can look past these major faults you will enjoy mes funny humor and excellent voice acting which was rare back then so pick this up in your bargain bin next time youre outi loved everything about this game except the battle system having to match that falling square at exactly the right time gets annoyingat first it was pretty easy and i thought it was coolbut the fact that later on you have to do it four to eight times without missing
forget about iti am sorry
there are so many rave reviews for legend of dragoon that i am forced to write yet another sobering one so you actually know what youre  buying
and no i am not biased toward the final fantasy series
in fact  ive never played a minute of itlegend of dragoon is a long fourcd  roleplaying game made by sony computer entertainment
the game is  accompinied with the company motto quotcreated by a team of one hundred  over the course of three yearsquot probably aimed to impressnow  legend of dragoon from now on referred to as lod isnt an awful game by  any means
its actually somewhat innovative
the problem with the game is  that it is horribly restrictive as if sony was afraid to innovate too much  and loose the target audiencetake for example the turnbased combat  system that various other reviewers tout as the greatest ever
sony  introduced a minor element of action to each characters turn in combat by  allowing you to increase the number of strikes per attack with a welltimed  press of a button
these combination attacks are called additions
each has  its own name damage multiplier and the limit to the number of attacks
sony went ahead and made it so each character can only perform one type of  addition per battle effectively doing away with any strategy you may have  hoped to develop
in fact these combos are actually standard attacks  since by failing to perform them all the way through will cause miserably  little damage in no way enough to kill the bosses
whether this action  element is good is up to you
i enjoyed the realism a bit although to pull  off some of the faster longer and more complex additions is quite  hardthis restrictiveness extends to other parts of the battle engine as  well too few magic spells most of them attack spells in various elemental  flavors and a laughably small inventory are the major examplesalthough  some of you are bound to disagree with me why else would my reviews  accumulate negative votes
 the music is unimpresive and low on melody
likewise the voice acting in battle not in fmv ranges from uninspired  to ludicrous
although the voices fit in rather well the translations are  hideous flurryferry of styx comes in as the most rampant examplethe  games chief downfall is the hideous dialog which spoils an otherwise  promising story
the characters spout off poor humor and awkward jokes at  the most inappropriate moments while the designated comic relief character  is so amazingly annoying that i had trouble with keeping my playstation on
likewise the characters are stereotypes the shorttempered hero the  valiant knight the mysterious dark lady and the damsel in distress are  just a sampling of the playable characters
the characters also seem  utterly incapable of logical thought
at times hey brought me to tears with  their quotwhatever happens is finequot attitudes
example not word for  word quotwhoopie
were sailing to the place where our chief nemesis  wentquot quoti wonder why our enemy told us where he was goingquot  quotbeats the heck out of mequot and so on and so forth to infinity  and beyondthe prerendered backgrounds are absolutely amazing although  the designers forgot that livelihood depends not only on photorealism but  on movement as well the very few fmvs being literally fantastic
sadly  not too many fmvs ar what you might expect most are quotscroll across  the mural in dquot typethe inbattle graphics are a step back  though
to accomodate the constant motion almost everything looks blocky  and low on polygons especially the enemies crystal golem and wounded bear  being prime examples of low polygon counts
your characters and the  enemies are so far apart that its very hard to orient the camer to see  both sides of battle
the bakgrounds are lowdetil and look washedout  especiualy when compared to the rest of the game
your enemies include a  variety of rats moles bats kiwi birds tutles and such
somehow i  didnt expect to fight forest animals on my quotepic questquotsadly  enough this game is actually up to current standards in gaming
i can only  name a few games that significantly raise the bar and i wont name them  for fear of angered fans
i can only tell you to give this game a try
if  you are easily entertained by large explosions swordswinging characters  twentysecondlong magic spells and muddled simplistic chracter  interaction by all means get this game right nowi bought legend of dragoon based on the wonderful things i heard about it from attenders of the e gaming conventionheres the breakdowningame graphics  very poor for a game that hopes to compete  with the likes of the final fantasy seriesblocky ugly polygonal  characters are remniscent of ff and wild arms seriesfmv graphics   some elements are lacking like character movement is still blocky and  were all spoiled by the emotional fmv from ff
however the actual video  dynamics are superb and actionpackedone sequence featuring a huge clash  between dragoons and winglies is particularly nicemusic  this is where  the game really really hurts
the soundtrack is so bland boring and  repetetive that i need to turn the sound off if ive been in any one town  for too long
sony also took a chance when they did character voice overs  after all the video game industry is infamous for poor character voice  overs
however most of them are pretty skillfully done
some of the  attack names might have needed work and are very silly when pronounced  ie
quotdiemore and morequot and quothyah
madness  heroquotoverall the game is lacking that finishing touch many  many spelling errors cheesy dialogue and grammar problems bug the heck  out of me
if youre a hardcore rpg fan and dont mind linear repetetive  action then legend of dragoon is worth a shotthe legend of dragoon was supposed to be the playstations last premier titles like final fantasy vii or chrono cross or even xenogears
unfortunately it was marred by an incredibly predictable plot really bad dialogue and robotic voice acting
but its one of those kind of games that you really want to admire if it wasnt for its faults and boy does this game have faultsstory theres a war going on and caught in the middle of it is dart a young warrior orphaned by something called the black monster
so dart his childhood friend shana and an increasing number of friends have to battle evil to save the world yadda yaddagraphics keep in mind this is playstation
that being said the ingame graphics look okay at times with certain environments looking nice at times but others look horribly bad
however where the game shines is its fmvs
that is the good ones since some of them are literally looking at old manuscripts or images with a voiceover
why they even bothered i dont knowsoundmusic fairly unimpressive
i forgot most of the tracks right away and like i said the voice acting at times is incredibly stilted like they were worried of sounding too emotional during a recordinggameplay hm well its essentially the same as final fantasy games on the psx walk around screens get into random encountersthat occur way too frequently
the only difference is that theres additions that you can use
theyre kind of like combos where you have to hit a button at the right time to get more hits
its an okay system but work on your timing otherwise its gonna be terrible for you in the long runis it a recommendable game
hard to say
its certainly a likable game at times but other times you feel like ugh why do i get this thing
best thing to do is just try it out and if its bad then sell itas my title states legend of dragoon can only be described as muddled
this game has several failings that cannot be ignored but if you give it a chance you may still garner some enjoyment out of this average rpg
on to the reviewgraphics  not the greatest but not too irritating
this of course is a matter of opinion but the graphics did not seem too bothersome at allmusic  well the music ranges from not so good to decent
theres really nothing about the music that would make me want to buy the soundtrack
the songs are all rather bland and unmemorable while not being terrible enough to make your ears bleed or anything
the voiceacting which is limited is kind of laughable
overall the bland music and notsogood voice acting brings down the score in this sectioncharacters  the characters really arent welldeveloped
they either have stereotypical personalities or are just plain uninteresting
sometimes their actions were not convincing at all
for example one person is traveling with the party to find his daughter who ran away
he then goes on and on about not knowing why she left when you clearly find out in a flashback that he criticized her and slapped her for something she wasnt really at fault for
hmmmi wonder why she ran away
and then after hearing this story the rest of the party sides with him and does not point out the obvious reason she ran away
another example of awkward character development is the romance between dart and shana
yes shes naive and softspoken and hes the big hero and they fall in love
yes weve all seen this before
thats not even my complaint
the romance between them was badly handled by the game developers
it seems as though shana is the only one in love with dart he sees her more as a little sister
this creates some awkward moments between them
i think the main romantic scene of the game is very awkward
instead of dart and shana voluntarily getting together the rest of the party members sort of connive to force them together at a party
then out on a balcony every time the scene between them becomes serious and they are about to kiss some random npc shows up and ruins the moment
i find this odd attempt at humor to be illplaced and intrusive
i never really got the impression that dart and shana loved each other instead i felt that the rest of the party loved the idea of getting them together
rose is the only character who seems interesting and has some back story
overall the game is riddled with character interactions like those above this really makes it difficult to care about these characters other than rose
story  once again stereotypical is the word of the day
guess whos father may be a villian
no really guess
seriously the rest of the story feels like one disjointed event after another
i never felt a sense of continuity with the story and the final villian seems to come from nowhere
i never saw it coming in a bad way
i mean the game really could have used some foreshadowing or building up for the final villian
all that aside the games story does have some high points the mythological feel of the game is interesting and although i cant remember for the life of me what all actually happened during the story i had fun while playing through itbattle system  well its turn based
not much to say there
my only real complaint was with the additions
while i mostly liked the originality of this element it was somewhat irritating at times
the goal is to hit the x button at just the right time to execute your attack
if you miss even one in the string your attack does pitiful damage
as it can be quite difficult to get all of them in a longer string i was often forced to use weaker additions instead of the stronger and longer ones
aside from that aspect the dragoon system was fun
i only wish there were some way to revert out of dragoon mode and also to cast magic outside of dragoon mode
despite my complaints i found most of the battle system to be not too annoyinggameplay  wow
theres alot of backtracking
this can get tedious i think i went through some place three times
another issue i have with gameplay is that in disc  the game forces you to insert disc  again to get into some of the towns
what nonsense is this
i dont think ive ever played another rpg that had this problem
this is what lowers the score most for this section
other than the things listed above i dont have any other issues with gameplayoverall  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
while legend of dragoon does not measure up to so many other rpgs out there oddly i still enjoyed it
this is certainly not the worst rpg out there its just not the best either
since its so inexpensive now at the time of writing this july  it wouldnt hurt to pick this game up and give it a chance
you may at least get some amusement out of laughing at the bad dialoguethough touted as the final fantasy killer why must all new hyped products be the blank killer
this game falls well short of that
however dont let that stop you from playing it if you are a fan of japanese rpgs
the many flaws this game has can be overlooked since the battle system is generally engaging fresh compared to other rpgs overall good graphics and a good way to pass the time in between more hyped gamessome of the flaws include kinda weak graphics regarding the characters themselves though background and cutscenes are really well done odd monster designs and linear nature of the game
the last point being a con for some people and a pro for others who want a straightforward adventurelegend of dragoon will break your heart
it is not a bad game
in fact it is a good game
the problem is this could have and should have been a great game
looking back on legend of dragoon is like looking back on a past relationship there are elements of melancholy regret and yet some pleasant memories as wellpart of the problems come from the characters
the dartshana relationship reminds the gamer a bit too much of cloudtifa from ff vii
there are other types of romantic relationships in this world than hooking up with an old childhood friend
the stoic knight lavitz and the talkative highbrow king albert are much more original
the character of rose remains enigmatic and she remains one of the more intriguing female characters in rpgs for the old ps
some of the characters namely miranda and haschel have as much point as a broken pencilthe game play seems a little tedious
the graphics are fine for a ps one game
the music seems a little repetitve
the battle system is interesting especially the dragoon combat and the fact that the heroes can actually defend themselevesthe main problem is the plot
while the villians are generally interesting and for once an rpg is able to work a mythological back story into the game pretty well the chief problem is the game seems to get bogged down over and over again in wandering around covering ground that you have already gone over
oh look we are in the barrens again and now we are in the place with the weird gravity for the fifth bloody time
this gets old quickly
but the game does intensify in the last stages though the last battle goes on forever with some rather strange interludes
the ending remains one of the most satisfying i have ever seen in an rpg as it reminds the gamer that the events that unfold in the game concern more than just the heroes but also the world they have to rebuild
the only question is do most gamers have the patience to trudge through the game for that longthis game should have come out on the playstation  the idea of thids games battle system would have worked better and the idea would have been more accepted
the battle system may get a little repetative but its lightyears more interactive and fun than just selecting a command and waiting
the dialog in this game isatrocious and sometimes the characters like to shout out their emotions without there being honest dialog
like im pissed
it sort of shows the lack of imagination
and it sort of plays into the translation problems im sure the lack of care in dialog was partly because of translation
the graphics are beautiful there are voiceovers in battles and in cinematics
though i must say the voices dont always fit the look of the character
the story itself is pretty damn entertaining
its a lighthearted storytelling with some pretty dark elements and some big twists
not the most original story but for its time it worked
its nice to sit around and play for a couple hours even nowadays with current gen the product itself shipped to me fairly quick and was in perfect conditioni thought the graphics were great and the story was interesting but it is very boring after not very long
the combat is like a barebones final fantasy system only attacks can be extended to create combos by pushing a button at the right time
it takes a ridiculus amount of time to level up and you have to level up because it is a hard game
i would have finished it if leveling up wasnt so slow but i had to quit in the second disk because i spent most of the game leveling up
if it wasnt for that problem i would have liked the gameproseven when the battery is dead it works when you insert it in the controllerthe screen shows the game title on the vmu depending on what game you play cool onesyou can play minigames on itits portableconsthe battery dies fastuseless when deadvery fragilebatteries are easy to find but again fast deathsmall memory space so you need multiple amountsinstalling the batteries is a hassle because you need to unscrew the back of the vmuif you dont install the batteries correctly your data wipesoverallthis battery is decent dont get me wrong but the risk of data wipes and the low battery life is a hassle
as for the memory i wish there were more space but its dreamcast its an old systemi was excited about the stsc and got it as soon as it came out
that was a dumb purchase
you get to play adventures but all you do is click and you can walk away for a few minutes
there is no real adventure
stsc warp  is the exact same thing
with the exception of a few ships
dont waste your timepretty accurate only complaint is the graphics and the sound is a little annoyingaltogether the game is easy to understand and enjoyablei bought this for nostalgic reasons
the graphics are decent the music is pretty good but the story is terrible
its a ridiculous game but funfrom the creaters who know car combat brings you rogue trip just like twisted metal in a few ways it could have been better if thay put characters endings like thay did with twisted metal
but instead thay put cheat codes this brings the whole game down but the combat is very good
enemy ai is super smart if there helth bar is low thay get to the nearst helth stand
 if thay see your helth is low thay all gang up on you
characters to play asdestroying angelmeat wagonbiohazardgator baitpyrorock n ruleozonebitchin wheelsintrudersidewinerverminand a few unlocks its a fun game but it should had endingstorylinewisethis game is very atmospheric and at many times dark
i enjoyed the story and atmosphere highly but the game seems to stretch on and on into dungeons that highly resemble the previous ones thus making it very monotonous
the weapons configuration also is very lacking there are many weapons and other equipment but it really gets on your nerves and many times is quite lame
the difficulty level while hard is actually very good although i find myself constantly battling to defeat bosses and the whole risk facto system is constantly getting on my nerves
if the developers cranked out some of the faults in this games system this would have potential to be a very great game
however this game would be a good investment for an rpg if you are able to look past its faults
but otherwise i would suggest final fantasy tactics which is made by the same developeri hardly even know where to begin when it comes to an overrated game that turns out to collect dust in my room
i bought vagrant story over a year ago
tried it like the battle system and then found myself hating itthe game play goes as follows you start in a dungeonthere are cut scenes from time to time but none of them make any senseyou run around by monsters and fight
you see the monsters as you are fighting them as there are no random battles
a menu pops up after you click near a monster such as head   right leg   and so on
from there you choose which part of the body you want to attack
sometimes you make no hit points against the monsters because you have to work up your weapons for each type of monster
and it is impossible to make a master weapon against all monsters
more than one weapon has to be leveled up for different monsters and many times weapons have to be changed in midst battle which is annoying
the other complaint i had in this game is that the only way you can heal yourself is either finding a save point or using a curing item
this doesnt sound so bad but curing items cannot be purchased
instead they only can be found fighting monsters
i never seemed to have enough curing items
by the end of the game things still didnt seem to make sense
the conclusions were unsatisfying and overall pain in the neckthe last complaint i have of this game is the feeling i got from playing it
the color scheme is bad
everything was shades of brown or blacks and occasional greens and reds
it was a depressing feel to it and it seemed like i never saw the light in that gamehowever i can still give this game some credit
i believe that it was an attempt of a good thing
there were bad qualities about it that if only fixed a little this game couldve been great
the battle system was actually fun at times but when things got tough and a new type of monster approached it took way too long to level up a weaponi thought for its time the cut scenes looked nice
there are no special movies throughout the game just a short one as an intro before you start your game upit is possible to enjoy this game
i found myself struggling through it but i knew a couple who actually half ways liked it
it isnt a masterpiece in my eyes but it had potential i think that didnt see the light of dayprosinnovative battle systemwell done cut scenes for its timenew game plus  featureconsdull game hardly any change of scenery  besides dungeons and boxesconfusing plot  yet it was deepbad color scheme browns browns tans greenand more brownsannoying weapon level up systemestimated time to complete game in a quicker runthrough    hoursdetailed gameplay estimated time to complete    hoursi brought this game brand new back in  i remember testing it out at funcoland
at the time there was much talk about it and it seemed like an interesting game
convinced i picked it up and brought it home
i must say the novelty of this game wears off quickly
you play as a character named ashly riot who is set out to rescue his partner who is trapped at the hands of a madman named sydneythe game is dark and very depressing
you stay in one basic dungeon for a majority of the game
its  and i pulled the game out to play it again
unlike final fantasy  that came before it this game has not aged well at all
the game isnt too beautiful artistically and you feel as though the designers did not put much energy into the game
not to mention that part of the team that did final fantasy  worked on this project
it just seems as though the game was lazily created
the plot doesnt move you at all to continue the game its a basic hero fights villian and save the girl storythe turning points of the game are the fighting system which allows you to strike select areas on your enemies body
this at the time was new and innovative but not verywell executed seeing as it makes little difference with the risk meter involved
the risk meter is a gauge that increases as you fight your oppenents
as the gauge fills upyour chance to hit goes way down
this really is a down point of the game as it is not necessary and makes the game more difficult that it needs to bethe overall game itself is pretty boring to say the least
the aptmosphere is again in a dark dungeon the entire game which gets tiresome and becomes an eyesore
mainly because you feel as though your in the same area the entire game
vagrant story could of had much potential but its repetitive gameplay and aptmosphere leave this one bitting the dusti recently got this new ps because my old one broke and it would no longer read discs
well i went to eb games to get a ps hopefully an old one and they didnt have any only used ones
i went to eb games for a new ps so it had a lower chance of breaking
well i got this ps instead since it was the only new ps they hadoverall it looks great
its tiny like a book weighs at most  pounds i think its nice and small portable reads discs very quickly etcbut looks arent what matters most
i am a hugggge gamer and i play my games hours on end
since this ps doesnt have a fan well i cant really do it
the most hours you can leave this on without it freezing  for me  is about  hours
i can be playing a game scratched or not and it will simply freeze and i have to reset
its happened twice so far and ive  had it for about  days
both were on tony hawk american wasteland but i highly doubt it was the game
it happened once offline and once online which tells me it was probably just the sytem overheating it would be better if it was a tad bigger and had a fani would stick with the old ps if you dont travel a lot but if looks portability and sometimes unreliability are what you like take your chance with this ps designyou know sonys in trouble when they start making a smaller console for more money and still keep it at the same overpriced 
at that price you could buy a nintendo gamecube which far beats the next ps and add a great game or you could buy just a xbox because either way its better then the new ps
sony just needs to give up theyve sold tons of consoles and are easily the winner of the console wars but now that no one wants the ps sony is trying to think of stupid ideas for some more money
buy a old used ps anyways cause youll get it  times cheaperim sure that you all probably like the smaller slimmer version of this console system but i am a little reculant with it i got this for easter at first i was afraid of it being easy to break trust me it feels like it can break easilyi like the bigger one better its more sturdy
and but i do like the fact that the disc doors wwill never malfunction that was really annoying whenever i opened the disc on the bulkier one itd close if i tapped it jsut lightlyand the discs never have any more errors now a good fact about this but i dont like the cords they get burnt out after six monthswell i really just feel safer with the bigger one since its harder to break in halfthe playstation  system has been around since october  when it first came out it had a motorized tray to put the disc in and it also had a cooling fan which is a good thing to have
the new version of the ps which came out in november  is slimmer yes but doesnt have the two options listed above
its a lot less durable and it heats up a lot faster
my friend has one and after playing it only  hours the bottom is really hot
anyone who knows anything about electronics knows that heat is not the best thing for electrica parts
in most cities that have used video game stores most stores sell the older ps systems for around 
id hightly recommend buying one of those as opposed to the new version
you cant beat an originalnote this review is based on this reviewers experience with one of the earliest manufacturing runs of the new slim design ps
it is possible that sony has addressed some of the issues i refer to in newer runs though with their track record i seriously doubt it in some casesin all honesty to say the ps and the original ps wasis not a great gaming system would be a complete baldface lie
considering their systems have beaten back competition despite never being the most technologically advanced competitor in the running speaks volumes but to make such a statement is ultimately misleading
in reality the pss success and sonys success for that matter really has comes from the plethora of great titles from a handful of solid developers not from the hardwareplaystations biggest failing other than the ps hard drive and any kind of quaility online play has been overall quality
when i talk overall quality i dont mean how many polygons the machine can push at any given second as thats relatively unimportant in the vast scheme of things but rather the machines overall durability and structural integrity
one might think this redesign might solve some of these issues from the original psx and ps
well in short it doesntit may be true sony is not the only company that has had hardware problems cast a shadow over their console the original nintendo would be a prime example but sony seems defiant in learning lessons from its own past considering hardware problems have been a consistent factor throughout their history
here are a few examples concerning the slim ps never buy a slim ps and think your going to kill two birds with one stone with a gamedvd combo
this is the biggest misconception people have over time the ps will eventually have trouble running about half of anyones dvd collection especially anything that runs off a duallayer dvd
the fact my family guy and futurama dvd box sets wont run on the machine after having it for a year and a half proves this to me
the ps is no substitute for an actual dvd player so dont be cheap and save yourself a headache and buy a dvd player to boot the situation with duallayer dvds also applies with many games that use the format as well
i can literally spend hours trying to get my wild arms alter codef and god of war to work yet when i insert the same games into my friends oldmodel ps that is twice as old they work right off the bat
thats not right especially considering those games where brand new the fact you can never fully shut the machine off less you unplug it like one would with the switch in back of the older pss raises too many questions
anyone familiar with the original psx knows even when the power was shut off that it still drew in a minimal amount of electricity
this was probably one of the main factors that attributed to the original psxs problems
why would you bring back such a potentially damaging feature
when i turn the machine off i want it completely off
thats what off means sony
anyone who purchased one of the newer slim model ps shortly after it was introduced probably found it nice when there was a voluntary recall on the power pack
yeah that just makes me trust in sonys products even more
the risk of fire and burns always goes well with any gaming experiencedespite everything i have said above if you like the games the ps contains in its gaming library youre going to buy it anyway hell i did
however as with any system i would definitely advise against buying any kind of playstation hardware the minute it comes out outside of the initial priceive had a ps for over  years and it has never given me a whiff of a problem
i finally got around to upgrading to a ps after playing my buddys the older larger version a lot the last few weeks
the games are great and i find the controllers to be welldesigned and manageable particularly if you already have experience with a pshowever the transition to the new smaller ps has apparently caused problems
the one i bought at bestbuy worked fine for the first  minutes i played it then it would freeze up while trying to load a sound effect and just repeat that sound effect over and over again
this happened regardless of the game played ps or ps
i took it back and was informed by the guy at bestbuy that its most likely an overheating problem and that it is apparently common to the new smaller ps
its a shame because i think the games are generally quite good and i loved the ps but think twice about picking up this miniature version that apparently hasnt been tested out very welldont get me wrong this game has a lot going for it for about a week
obviously this is an arcade game and as a result the longterm gameplay  suffers
i had a lot of fun with the quotworldquot mode but after a  certain time period the practice sessions were determined by dumb luck  and the singlesdoubles matches were just too unforgiving
leaving you  with a customizable though pointless and boring exhibition mode and an  arcade mode that simply lined up  matches against  players in  different  locales
though player games are always funthe money system used in  the quotworldquot mode is great until youve bought  everyoneplacething
then its merely an exercise in frustration with  random training courses and impossible matches
the graphics here are  superb as is the control mostly especially since the computer often  cheats for you in order to get far away shots
but the option of only   volley styles standard amp lob makes any sort of strategy a moot point  and games typically devolve into ragged runfestsmy advice by all  means rent this title as i have had loads of fun with it and i dont  believe a better tennis title besides mario tennis has been released  since super tennis on snes or atp tennis on genesis
but beware that the  fun is irritatingly shortlived as in any arcade port crazi taxi also  suffered from this problemmy original modern gaming console was a playstation and one of the first games i bought for it was the original gran turismo
it was extremely popular spawning gran turismo  and on playstation gran turismo   each far better than the previous game in the seriessega gt seems to be the dreamcast response to the everpopular gran turismo series
for a first attempt at this type of driving simulation this is an admirable effort but there is still a long way to goon the very positive side the license tests in sega gt are very generous toward the player whereas the gran turismo series sets very high standards including keeping at least one wheel on the racing surface at all times and not permitting any contact with walls or barriers or other obstacles the only requirement in the sega gt license tests is that the player complete a lap at a given course or segment in the time posted
another great point of sega gt is the variety of courses available from two drag strips to a highspeed course reminiscent of the pennsylvania turnpike through the tunnels of the allegheny mountains to a wintry course to several desertbased courses between tall rock cliffs
the ability for players to create their own cars which requires a lot of money is a novel addition to a driving simulation and there are specific licenses and races for which these original cars can only compete
finally the use of sponsors is great for each raceseries win each sponsor pays a given amount of money which can thus turn lowpaying races into nice cash machines if a player can accumulate a lot of sponsorson the down side sega gt has some nice cars
but there are relatively few of them especially compared to gran turismo  the navigation of the car shop to buy the cars new and used cars are available is a bit awkward
while there are a lot of tuning parts which can be purchased there is little effect gained or lost in making adjustments
finally car control in general is awkward at best especially with highhorsepower vehicles many highhorsepower cars are simply impossible to drive at competitive speedsfor those with young children sega gt will be good for the kids as well as the parents  especially since there are numerous preowned dreamcasts and associated games available at least in the states for fairly low prices
however those looking for a true driving simulation would be much better served by acquiring gran turismo  for playstationpsone andor gran turismo  for playstationfiguring out the puzzles in safecracker or rather codes is a pretty challenging thing to do
puzzle games have been around for years and i think this is probably one of the better ones
dont be alarmed by my star rating the game is okay
i just cant play a puzzle game for longer than an hour without having to take a break
they can really wear you downit really is amazingly fun to wander around an abandoned house cracking safes
the only problem is that this game is really only possible with an older slower system say a  or so
my yearold computer was too fast to make it possible to scroll through the inventory list slow enough to actually select items in the middle rather than on one end or the other
quite frustrating since by the time i discovered this i was about halfway through  and now i cant finish
oh well thats the price of having uptodate technology i guessupdate if you like the idea of this game check out its updated version called safecracker the ultimate puzzle adventurer
same general premise but it works on newer machinesperhaps the best aspect of this game is its visuals  an expansive and detailed visualisation of the tower of london right down to the souvenirs on sale in the gift shop
ive never been to the real tower and so cant vouch for its accuracy but the game certainly provides a realistic graphical environment
most of the locations you can visit are not essential for completion of the game but add to colour
there are secret passages and rambling corridors galorethe game is also far from straightforward
some may see this as a plus others a minus
your mission is to steal  well actually borrow  three of the crown jewels and replace them with fakes fitted with tracking devices so that another operative cannot steal them
there is a time limit so you have to make your moves count keep saving your game and replay key scenes if necessary
you start with a small inventory but quickly pick up a large number of items  both tools of the trade and various keys and items lying around the tower
this can sometimes lead to long sessions trying many different inventory items to see which one worksfrom soon after the start you can visit most places in the tower
this can be irritating as the tower is filled with information literally dozens of tourist information boards books paintings items etc and a couple of these contain vital information for completing the game  but which ones
its a laborious process to photograph and read all the information boards in the hope that you will strike it lucky
similarly despite you having some interesting equipment such as a grappling hook and ropelift there are only a couple of limited locations where you can use it which it will probably take you a looooong time to find without a walkthrough
this means the game is not open to creative solutions despite the tower location potentially providing many opportunities
theres a lot of guesswork rather than deduction involvedunfortunately for such a potentially exciting story gameplay is ponderous
i found new locations slow to load and although there is much tracking back and forth there is no zip mode to enable you to navigate quickly through scenes
in addition the game comes on four cds which need to be swapped often throughout as there is no full install optionthe game will keep you occupied for a while but although the locations are well detailed they lack the wonder of say the locations in myst or other more fantasybased games
there is also a lack of much action you cant let yourself be seen by any of the guards and the plodding pace of the game engine is irritating
i often return to the myst series just to marvel at the astounding visuals but i cant see that happening with this gamefive stars would be too much for this game
sure if you like walking through dark sewers and corridors this is your game but overall i found the surroundings quite dull
nothing like the dreamy landscapes like myst or even the eerie cityscapes in the longest journey
not the haunting atmosphere of journeyman just corridors chambers en sewers
as a secret agent you must replace the crown jewels in the tower of london and well the tower is a castle with lots of corridors as it seems
gameplay is very straightforward and easy
definitely print yourself a map of the sewersystem to save yourself endless wandering around  not funny at all
dont consider this cheating because this is just a not well thoughtout part of the game
so overall this is not the worst game in this genre its funny for couple of days but definitely not in the same category as myst journeyman fandango or some of the other highflyers
so if you can get it at a cutprice buy it
if not dont get your expectations to high upthe first batman game on nes was an enthralling 
experience that made gamers love the caped crusader for being the ruthless vigilante as depicted in the movie
but something happened and konami was granted the rights to produce the sequel
what we have here is a lessthan par sequel but you be the judge
oh wait thats why im here pokay
allow me to give this game some leeway by announcing its finer points
instead of being a platformer like the first game batman decided he wants to be in a beat em up which this game reminds me a lot of the snes version
except that in the snes version the tone was darker there was the ability to use gadgets like the batarang and you had better level design
this game features for the first time health gauges for every enemy you fight including bosses and makes it easier to see how close to beating the baddies you are
this along with batmans creative array of moves jump kick mega man slide and cape swing which takes off one line of health every time you use it make for an addictive combination that will make even the manliest of gamers have a nerdgasmnow onto the reason this game has a lower review score
the games music is really upbeat and happy
if youve played the first game its got a rock feel to it
on top of that the way konami made this game a beat em up and the fact that the story screens are so drab kind of reminds me of teenage mutant ninja turtles  the arcade game which is made by konami as well
this game retains somewhat of a campy and lighthearted mood amidst a guy in bluishblack latex kicking the crap out of clowns
it makes the entire thing seem so wronghaving said that the game is definitelly challenging
enemies gang up on you like they should and you need a strategy to overcome the odds
the same goes with bosses and trust me
ive beaten this game
in my opinion not the best ending but to make it to the end means that youve just graduated to batman forever on super nintendo but this game is better than that one by a longshot
so is it worth a buy
if you have batman and want to collect the series
anyway its fun but the fact that the tone is mixed in gameplay simply destroys the entire mood
konami whythis is a near perfect game
i am a huge fan but its incredibly hard
its not cheap
theres no cheap losses here and theres nothing you can really fault the game for its just hard
its old school hard and you are going to find yourself battling your way through levels and levels a lot
if you have time on your hands bring your a game make a pot of coffee and settle in for one challenge that will not stop
its  times harder than contra but when you make it through to the end you will feel this incredible euphoria something that gives this  stars
however  stars down for time consumption and difficulty
do not take that wrong this is a beast of a game and well worth purchasing
i love it when i have a lot of time on my hands
you wont beat it at first you just wontdemon swordthree stars  lot better than legend of kage but no ninja gaiden
demon sword is an nes game about a ninja released in  developed and published for the system by taito
the title is often seen as a companion game to the inferior legend of kage the  arcade title also developed by taitoin demon sword you play as a kimono wearing ninja who has to assemble the titular demon sword by playing through six levels for the final confrontiaton of the games villian on the games seventh and final level
you actually have the demon sword in your possession at the start of the game and as you defeat the bosses and proceed through the level the sword gets longer and longeryou have to love inaccurate box art the most famous example being the original box art for the first mega man game
on the box art of demon sword there is a halfnaked giant barbarianwho looks rather like heman gazing at a sword blazing with fire
although the barbarian is featured promently in the promotional art this portrayal has absolutely nothing to do with the actual protagonist in the gamegiven the box art you will be quite surprised to discover that the main hero you control is actually a rather thin ninja in a red kimonolike most games there are several differences in the japanese version vs the american version
japans demon sword features six more levels and several bosses not present in the us version
there are also more items and magic spells and an extended ending
finally the box art for the japan demon sword is much more representative of the actual hero you play in the titlealthough not as in depth as the superior ninja gaiden released the same year demon sword is worth playing through at least once
it is much better than legend of kage
ninja gaiden ii released in  and a year after this features a similiar demon sword heavily in its plot
the best ninja games on the nes will always be the nes gaiden trilogy but a beyond that demon sword would be a natural choice for those looking for bit ninja style gameplay even if the ninja is wearing what looks like a red dress
just think of it as a kilt in scottish traditionthe video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all time
for those looking for great unknown nesfamicom games you simply must play moon crystal a criminally unknown famicom exclusive
the graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ninja gaiden amazing music in depth gameplay and a fantastic storyline
absolutely amazing
had this been released in the us for the nes i feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the nes canonmany people were surprised to see double dragon iii on the nes thats because it was based on the arcade version few people knew about
in  acclaim entertainment published this arcade port following the successful previous entry of the series
like the games before it they were changes made to enhance the game but instead it turned to be not as good and it was the weakest of the nes gamesthe story went something like this billy and jimmy opened up their dojo and taught many students their fighting style until one day a mysterious group ambushed everyone
their students were killed and marion disappeared
not knowing what to do the brothers were approached by a fortune teller who told them they needed to collect sacred stones in order to get marion and offered to guide them across the world
like dd ii the game opens up with the choice of playing the single player mode or the two player coop mode followed by an additional two modes
from here on you must go through five stages that span the world usa china japan italy and egypt
you can punch kick jump kick and use your special moves to fight off enemies and boss characters
along the way you can pick up weapons found on the ground and after beating the boss characters in china and japan they join you on your quest
this time around each character in your group has one life each so when one of them dies another person takes over until you run out of people and the game ends
like the previous two double dragon games you cannot earn extra lives and there are no passwords and no continues to usethe pros it looks and plays good and the music is pretty decent
there is variety when going through each stage and while you see the same enemies over and over again the larger enemies and boss characters keep things interesting
for those of you who like a challenge this game gives you plenty of it so prepare to work hard to beat the gamethe cons somehow this game lacks the charm that the other games possessed
first off this is based on the arcade version where the story was the same but everything else was different
the arcade version had a number based health system where in order to replenish your health you had to feed quarters to the machine
you earned money in order to buy extra lives and additional moves for your characters and it was the first game in the series to allow three players to play at the same time
the nes port removed the money aspect and replaced the number health system with a traditional health meter
you couldnt earn extra lives there are less types of weapons to use and the majority of moves from double dragon i and ii are gone only the cyclone spin kick and elbow blows remain
billy and jimmy had one new special move where you do a somersault over an enemy while grabbing his head to throw him across the screen
meanwhile the new characters and their special moves are average at best and dont give you an edge
if you thought the previous games were hard think again the brutal difficulty present in double dragon iii is ridiculous
the last stage alone is by the hardest in the entire game and it is the reason why i had only beaten it two times in my lifedouble dragon iii the sacred stones turned out to be not as good as the previous entries in the series
its too bad because the developer tried to shake it up to keep the series fun
unfortunately they removed a lot of what made double dragon ii great introduced new characters that no ones cared about and made the game too tough for most players who played it even if they played the coop mode
if you still want to see why this game was not received well by gamers check out you tube to watch it in action before you buy the gamewhen people think of the double dragon series they know the series history of hit or miss games
when you ask somebody what the low point of the series was they may tell you double dragon v or the double dragon neo geo game but i think the series hit rock bottom with this game boy conversion of the third arcade game
the weak graphics and sound can be excused but the gameplay is the absolute pits and ruins the entire gamethe graphics are below average even for the black and white gameboy
the characters are very small and undistinguishable
there are some nice cinema like scenes here and there to spice things up and some of the backgrounds are decent but otherwise a disappointment
whether or not you want to admit it there are some classic double dragon tunes for instance the gameboy nes and arcade adaptations of the first game anyway no bias here i just have never played the sega or atari ports so sue me
this game has none of them the music is very drab and the same sort of tinny beat seems to be recycled throughout all of the levels
the feel of the music also doesnt go with the game it doesnt sound like it matches the action or levels
the sound effects are not much better
the gameplay is where this cart really suffers
the enemies are frustratingly hard and move very fast
even the weakest foes can move punch and kick much faster than your character
it is difficult to actually hit an enemy and if you do they can strike back so fast that they inevitably nail you a few times before you can hit them again
for every hit you administer on any enemy they often get at least one hit on you if not more in return
as expected at any given point several enemies are working your fighter at once and wont let up
the bosses and stronger enemies leave your character even more over matched
one particularly tough boss crushes your hopes and dreams in an instant as he splits into two fighters just when you think you have put him down for the count
your jump kick and new wall kick are even less successful and hit the enemy only about one third of the time you attempt it
this game has a coin system in which you can purchase extra lives an energy restoration special moves the same spin kick that you could do for free in earlier games and weapons which you also got for free in earlier games
the special moves and weapons dont make your fight any easier the enemies are still too hard
dont waste your coins on them
youre better off just buying extra lives whenever possible you are only allowed to buy so many youre going to need them
it is almost impossible to make it out of any level even the first one without losing at least one life
it is even toughter to knock the motorcycle riders in this game off of their bikes than it is in the two nes renegade games if that is possible
you start with a select number of coins and can spend them as you see fit throughout the game
this game can be beaten i have done it once without the game genie no less
if you do want to see the end there are some game genie codes that will enable this its the only sure way to make it all the way through
here you go
since many of you may choose not to answer the challenge ill throw you a bone as to what happens later on in the game
your quottravel guidequot later turns on you and attacks you out of the blue near the end of one of the later levels
on the bright side the story line is a fresh change of pace from the usual affair of rescuing marian
in this game you must locate magical rosetta stones before the quotbad guysquot do
i did not notice any of the enemies from the earlier games but i did hear that the blurry unrecognizable boss from level  or  just might be chintai from the original double dragon game
if the enemies werent so cheap and utterly impossible this game would have gotten a better score despite the poor sounds and graphics
a game doesnt need super graphics and sounds to be exceptional but it certainly needs fair game play
i wanted to like this game and am a big fan of the dd series
i can not recommend it though
if youre desperate for a sidescrolling fighter for gameboy take a chance but beware
personally i would tell you to try one of the other double dragon games the first one was a good translation comparable to the nes version on the console or get a gameboy advance and check out final fight one
for those of you who frown upon the use of the game genie but are still stuck i offer some tips as this game is very hardunfair
in levels where you find a store close to some enemies start of level  for instance fight as many as you can until you run low on energy or defeat them all and then head into the store and buy an energy booster
when you have the chance always buy extra lives
if you cant do that go for the energy restoration
if you cant have either of those two you can get a weapon its your best attack only because it is presumably the strongest or consider saving your coins for a later level as there may be another store with extra livesenergy
dont bother with the special moves save your moneyselect from four generic teams the frogs the falcons the bulls or the waves and play some basketball against the computer
its a pretty easy game to get the hang of and the graphics are bad because the game is so early dated
its still fun against friends but not too fun against the computer because it truly cheats
give it a play but dont buy it because there is not enough to keep a person interested more than a monththis is an example of a game that i feel could have been up there with some other classic titles for the nes but its unfortunate that i cant do so as there are plenty of flaws that tend to drag the experience downthe layout for this game is in an overhead view and its been known to draw comparisons to another sunsoft title blaster master
even at that i still find festers quest to utilize this style of gameplay in a decent way
you must walk around town and save the town from aliens
by using a gun and later on a whip you can kill enemies to pick up the appropriate items that can be used with the a button
there are bulbs that have to be used every time you enter the sewers keys to gain more items from noteworthy addams family members and enter buildings in a primitive first person perspective potions to restore health which i guarantee you will need multiple times vice grips to regain your speed if stung by a bee that makes you move slow and thats just a sample from the first areathe guns are rather flawed
theres the obvious upgrade that can make your gun stronger and have a wider projectile range but a flaw to some of the gun patterns include shots being blocked by the walls and shots bypassing the enemies
the major issue with the gun is that it is constant tapping with the b button which means that a controller with a turbo button would be a far more suitable option in this case
also the guns are capable of downgrading and its going to be necessary at times when progressing throughout the gameanother flaw with this game is the unfair life meter and continue options
fester starts off with two blocks of health which can get up to four and its going to be necessary to save up the potions in the games for the bosses
with the flaws of the gun and the sluggish pace that can affect festers movement its inevitable that you might die the first couple of attempts in this game
there is not even a password feature let alone a save option a la the legend of zelda
instead there is a continue option but it starts you back at the beginning of the game
the fortunate part is that you keep all of your items and power ups accumulated from the last session so thats a plusif theres anything that i actually admire in this game it would be the sound spectrum
because sunsoft developed this game the music is excellent memorable and suits the game perfectly not to mention we get to hear the familiar addams family jingle in the title screen as well
also the graphic spectrum is rather good for a console of its time especially in the boss battles and menu screen
the gameplay itself isnt really that bad despite the aforementioned flaws
its rewarding to see the accomplishments made by entering new sections of the game even if it must be done multiple times but overall this game is a passable addition to the nes catalog
just make sure that you have a lot of free time patience and a turbo controller if neededi remember when this game was brand new
it came out around the same time as nightmare on elm street game which truly sucked
i think nintendo wanted to explore the gaming possibilities like perspective and battles with this game because the player got a lot of difficult challengespros jason was very difficult to fight because of the differing perspectives
when he appeared on the side scrolling screen all you could do is dodge his attacks and counterattack till he runs away
and when hes in the cabins it takes careful dodging and counterattacks
not that easy but it is possible
its a lot easier with the pitchfork of course hidden enemies like jasons mom a lot of areas to explore actually getting lost in the forest and caves
i never got lost in a sidescrolling game before
bravo to nintendo for that one music wasnt that bad for a nintendo game being able to transfer weapons to the weaker and slower counselors makes survival almost possible cons the sudden shift from sidescrolling to a rd person perspective in the cabins and fight against jasons mom is very annoying
it takes awhile to get used to and seems almost unnecessary at times jasons ability to jump from one side of the screen to another at willnot too many cons i know
but im bias
its a good game which i recommendyeah hydlides got some serious problems but it isnt unplayable
the whole not actually swinging your sword in combat thing is a bad idea but it does make combat interesting as you have to maneuver behind your enemy and attack his back
i actually enjoyed the item scavenger hunt you have to dothe music is awful
mute that suckeryou start off very weak too
you cant even progress a little in the game until youre at level  and youll only be frustrated if you try
give this one a chance though and youll find its a decent time though not a great onethe other reviewers for this game have expounded on the positive aspects of this game so i wont repeat myself
basically i agree with them on parts of their review but i myself dont feel this game was so good as to get  or  stars
i will explain whyi hated the way the character kept sliding across floors
the controls werent as tight as most other sidescrollingaction games were so i found it frustrating at times to deal with the character and trying to keep him alive
it got frustrating especially at times where there were a lot of enemies because you only got a limited amount of continues
these two aspects were my biggest gripes about this gamebut thats not the only thing that really bothered me
the ending was very disappointing
after the challenge level of this game the ending was very short and simplistic  and totally not worth all the time spent trying to beat the game itself
the final boss battle is especially frustrating because of said lack of tight control so after the boss was defeated the ending really let me down
the first wizard and warriors game was definitely better than thisone little thing that makes me chuckle is that in the game your character is bedecked in a full suit of armor but the guy on the cover is an almostnaked man that looks suspiciously like fabioi found this an odd game to like as i wasnt a fan of disney princesses or prince or whatever
i was an on the farm tomboy whod rather have a pretend dogfight with my toy planes play legos and cars
why i liked this game i never understood
neither did my little brother
but i think i got all the way to the end
it was one of the few games id spend hours and hours trying to beat
 i chose this over bill  teds excellent adventure which i was obsessed overi liked weird movies what can i say
i doubt everyone will find this game interesting that way but i did
i liked the way the mermaid ariel shot at things
she didnt have a gun in her odd collections of many things
maybe i liked it because it was one of the few games we own which seemed to emulate the characters on the movie
the movie which i didnt get and i didnt like either
except for the keep singing part which i kind of liked
and sebastian he was coolest always worried about everything but once i beat it i didnt really feel compelled to play again
i played this when i was little and nes was the main system out there along with snes back then it was easy enough for me to beat after losing some lives in the game and figuring out what worked against which enemy
even ursula herself wasnt that hard to beat
i saw this game at the video rental store and wanted it and im glad it was just a rental not ownership
its fairly fun the graphics are clean the musics nice but it certainly isnt a great game
best for one boring afternoon or whatever it is easy to beat this game under two hoursi found out about little nemo from the  issue of nintendo power dr mario was on the cover when i was seven but i didnt get to play the game until   i bought it for  at a flea market in the poconos and i got started once i took this cartridge home
despite of its slightly juvenile theme slightly complicated walkthroughs for a kidsgame mundane objectives highly unforgiving obsticles and lack of bosses its a playable game
unique on how little nemo can ride or turn into different types of dream creatures by feeding them candy as a nod to grabbing a plant or suit to turn into a firey being or obscure animal
using the powers of some animals is necessary like the minidragon or ape while others simply make the game a little easier like a bee
even with my strategy guide i had a very hard time getting through some of the levels due to its intense difficulty so it takes alot of patience and much finger dexterity to beat this game
dont do what i do and use game genie when you get frustrated
thats how i got to the final boss and kicking his butt was nothing compared to the endless obsticles i endured throughout the game
despite of its high difficulty its a enjoyable game to add to anyones nes collection and its considered to be one of capcoms underated titleswhen it comes to a long running franchise it goes without saying there are going to be moments of deja vu
mega man fans are especially aware of this but even with games that dont truly evolve from sequel to sequel each one manages to contain a feel of its own
the first mega man was a rough sketch of a portrait mega man  would quickly streamline
mega man  would take some liberties with its game play and ultimately stifle the flow that would have greatly benefited the series
but what about mega man 
does it restore the flow of chi or only intensify an abstract case of mental blockagethere are several things about mega man  that are more than welcome
the robot master crew is probably the most challenging out of the nes lineup and we see the introduction of some new characters like dr cossack and his daughter
okay so these characters arent exactly deep like any of mega mans characters are and only serve to fuel the fake antagonist scheme employed by the following two games but they help hide the fact that mega man  is mega man s hangover
its dumbfounding how even the smallest things made me reflect on the last game not the one in front of mebecause of this mega man  lacks an identity
as laughable as that may sound given how many games there are in the series its this same train of thought that makes it a very noticeable and serious problem
the silver lining to such a conundrum is that this indirectly gives mega man  and  a head start right out of the gate something that is of the utmost importance for the titles that wrap up mega mans time on the nesdespite the fact the mega man  ends on somewhat of a downer fans of the blue bomber will find little reason not to add this to their collection if they dont have it already
mega mans downs arent usually that bad or as bad certain other bluecolored character
mega man  proves this to be true at the end of the daythe fourth installment in the classic mega man series introduces a new villain dr cossack a russian scientist who has taken over as resident mad scientist bent on taking over the world
capcom released the game in  to moderate successbetween mega man iii and this game capcom considered taking mega man to the snes but decided to delay mega mans arrival to the new console for a further two years
there is some debate about this but the general consensus in the gaming community is that capcom made the last three nes mega man games because they were easy games to make the development team knew had to make a good product they were cheap to make and would provide a steady income for the company
while it is true the second trilogy of mm games while not nearly as good as the first simply because the formula wasnt so tired and stale by that time are very good games they are completely overshadowed by the first trilogythe storyline is rather simple but then most nes games didnt have the most complex storylines to boast most involve an evil lizard king and a kidnapped princess
it turns out after you defeat dr cossack proto man shows up with the good doctors kalinka
proto man reveals that dr wily is behind this world domination attempt yet again and he kidnapped cossacks daughter and forced cossack to build the eight robots
after you defeat cossack mega man sees dr wily and chases him into a newly constructed skull castle
for an nes game the storyline isnt that bad but unfortunately capcom would use the exact same device for mm v and mm vi as well
this i refer to as the fake villain trilogyfollowing the masterpieces that are mm ii and mm iii this game while a good game in and of itself feels simply like more of the same and theres not any drastic changes in game play although there are several new features
mega man can now charge the mega buster to fire a more powerful shot
two new items are introduced a grappling hook known as the wire adapter and a balloon dispenser ballon adapter
these items have not appeared in any other game
fliptop eddie a helpful robot is introduced and gives you random powerups in certain stages
unfortunately passwords no longer save your accumulated energy tankslike the first game you can now reenter levels to replay them a feature absent from mm ii and mmiii however the boss lair is now empty
also the first game since mm ii to have forced scrolling in one of the levelsthere are several similarities between this and mm ii
the fanfare for level intros and when you defeat the robot masters are very similar to the corresponding music in mm ii
also dr wilys last stage is shaped like an l and while ii has acid drips you must avoid mm ivs level has robo slugs the player can use to rebuild their weapon supply and energy
mm vi has this same l shape on the last dr wily level but in that game the level is much more varied
like mm ii when you finally do confront dr wily the final battle takes place in a darkened lab roomoverall the robot masters are rather imaginative and the levels well designed
pharaoh man is probably the hardest robot master of all six nes games and has a very powerful weapon
skull man is pretty cool
drill man is a little derivative of hard man from mm iii but still a good design
of
the other robot masters toad man dust man dive man bright man and ring man are fortunately pretty original and its clear capcom hasnt come to the bottom of the barrel as far as ideas for robot masters go just yetfor those who like the first mm trilogy this is certainly a worthwhile game to play
but as good as the second trilogy is the first trilogy is great and its those games you should turn too if you really want to play the best of the classic series
the second trilogy is just largely a repeat of the first trilogywhen it comes to the nes mega man titles there seems to be no greater rivalry than mega man  vs mega man  even if a fan prefers one of the later installments its unlikely that these two games instrumental in forging mega mans identity end up on equal ground
so which camp am i in
despite my best effort not to add to the seemingly endless love for mega man  i have to go with it not mega man  but why
while i cant exactly say mega man  is busted there are some design choices at work here that really throw a wench in the experience for me things that were fine last time out and should have been left alonea lot of mega man s problems center around boss fights
first of all the amount of crash damage one receives from making contact with a robot master is flat out wrong
i can understand this kind of damage being higher from a fortress boss but i shouldnt lose onefourth of my health for what is essentially a silly hit
the problems continue as the built in invincibility period after a successful hit on a boss has essentially been eliminated
this means you can score hit upon hit in quick succession without waiting between blows
while one could see pumping ammunition down an enemys throat as a good thing there are times were it absolutely destroys any semblance of challenge this title has to offerthe games other main flaw revolves around the addition of everyones favorite canine sidekick rush
mega man s item   and  have been replaced by the rush coil jet and submarine
giving such items more of an identity is appreciated as is their necessity in navigating the levels
whats not welcome is setting up the stages and powerups in such a manner where the player can get stuck with no recourse other than to exhaust their lives and continue because power ups dont respawn after death
this becomes a real issue in the somewhat pointless doc robot levels as do continue pointsas much as i love mega man i cant give mega man  the same kind of love i give mega man  again there is no reason to put that game on a pedestal but it is free of the problems found here as are solid outings like mega man   and  that said i have to agree with keiji inafune that there are many things here that could have benefited from being redone and the change in leadership from the teams that crafted the first two games definately shows at the end of the daymega man va brother betrayed or more of the samethe fifth mega man game is a very solid if not very distinguishable entry in the classic mega man series
of the last three games mm thru mm this is pretty much neck and neck with mm in terms of quality
good game but it has that whole weve been here done that feeling that drags the whole enterprise down
its yet another remake with the same gameplay of the first mega manthe plotline of this one like nes games really need plots but i digress is proto man has gone bad set himself up as the new current megalomaniac trying to take over the world and programmed eight robot masters to be evil why is it always 
maybe rincewind has a right to fear that number sorry terry prachet discworld reference
if the plot feels a little overfamiliar thats  because its the same as mm iv
and just like mm iv it turns out when you fight proto man that dr wiley was behind it all and you must fight himyou played the other mega man games
you know the drill
select a robot master see what weapon can beat him by beating other roboatmasters beat all  proceed to proto manfortunately there arent as many tired or rehashed ideas in mega man  as far as level design and bosses go unlike mega man   the robot masters are fairly original especially gravity man napalm man and charge man
charge man has a nice railroad themed level
crystal man is a little like gemini man from iii
still the games level design is pretty good for the nes
gravity man and star man have fun stages and theyre pretty innovative for mega mananother new feature of the game is each stage has one letter which you must obtain to get the robotic bird beat
you need beat to beat dr wiley at the end because if you dont itll be really hard
the letters spell out mega man v and they are part of the challenge of the game to get obtain them
trust me when you get to the end battle youll be thankful you took the time to collect those eight letterswe also get a new an improved mega buster even though when it is charging if you get hit you will lose the charge as well which sucks royally
we also get a new weapon called the super arrow which is pretty cool as wellthe challenge is up there
while not damn near impossible like the original mega man mm has its fair share of challenging sections but if you persist you will come to the end of the journeythere are some flaws in the title
capcom changed the rush coil much to its detriment
passwords dont save everything which really sucks
the super arrow is an interesting idea but not very well implemented
the storyline is the same as ivthe biggest damage this game has caused is how it confused a lot of people about proto man
they think he is evil but is in fact a good guy
naturally dr wiley is behind this and the storyline is just like mm ivof the fake villain or fake bad guy trilogy as i refer to mega man  this is pretty strong and for oldschool platform fans theres a lot to recommend to mega man   the real problem with mega man  is that everything it does the first trilogy does better and the first three games are a lot fresher before capcom drove the series into the ground with endless sequels
mm is good but only play it after you played the first three gamesthis is my order of mega man nes titles from best to worst
ii and iii are the best though i give a slight edge to ii because this is the game that really redefined the mega man formula but iii is just as good
iv and v are about the same as well though neither approach the sublime quality of the first threemega man iimega man iiimega manmega man vmega man ivmega man viproto man has turned evil and kidnapped dr light
he assembled an army of robots and unleashed them on the world
come on
im sure a first grader could figure out wily is behind this
and the innovations here
the rush jet is still in the piece of junk mode from mega man  and the super arrow is next to useless
the music is not good in most places
proto mans fortress is a nightmare
im a master game player and even i have trouble with it
there is no energy tank in the final fortress station so if you dont have any to use on wily youre gonna lose and probably have to start over
most nes mega man games are great but this is just mediocregamers were knee deep with the super nes and sega genesis back in  but the nes was still cranking out games whether gamers liked it or not
for those who had the snes capcom released mega man x and was very well received by critics and gamers
in  they released the last entry in the nes mega man series with mega man  incidentally capcom was too busy making mega man x and mega man  at the time so they let nintendo publish the game for them
while it brought a few new ideas as well as the standard run and gun game play the last nes mega man game left a lot to be desiredmega man  started off with a robot tournament in full swing that got taken over by mr x he took control of the eight most powerful robot entries and let them run wild in the city
mega man swings into action to stop him once and for all
of course it doesnt take long to realize mr x was dr wily in disguise so you have eight stages to choose from and two castles to explore each with  stages for a total of  stages
you know the drill pick a stage beat the robot master and get his weapon to use on another robot master
to mix things up a bit the robot masters were created by fans of the series not by capcom
some of the stages have alternate paths where one leads to the robot master while the other leads to a fake version of the robot master
mega man can now combine powers with his dog rush after you collect two rush adapters
of course the robot bird beat from mega man  returns and will help you once you collect the letters that spell out his name
when you want to take a break you can write down a password so you can continue your game laterthe pros it was nice for capcom to finally try to shake up the traditional formula it followed with all of their mega man games
it looked and played like the games before it
the music while not as strong as what you heard in mega man  still sounded good
the controls remain untouched so they still workthe cons previous mega man games looked better than mega man  even though the robot masters are the creations of the contest winners capcom could have picked better choices
most of the robot masters were based on elements that were already seen water ice fire air so that created a sense of redundancy
judging from the stage layouts you could tell that capcom was running out of ideaswith the release of mega man  the series came to a close on the nes but continued on the super nes with mega man  capcom would move forward with the mega man x series
some people liked mega man  while others were disappointed because it really didnt bring anything new to the series
its a shame since it could have ended on a high notethis is by far the worst in the series
i loved mega man  and this was a let down
how long was this in the development room
oh well on to my reviewgraphics pretty goodsound unchangedmusic not that goodgameplay okay heres what they messed up on
this time you got sorry ed cover your childrens ears now losers like centaur man knight man tomahawk man yamato man wtf is a yamato
blizzard man flame man wind man and plant man
with those names it will take forever to think up their weaknesses eh
wrong
the difficulty or lack of destroys this
i killed all the bosses using only my buster
the game also has terrible weapons
blizzard mans weapon shoots outsnowflakes
also what is defence on the boss screen
somebody build grammar man
the rush fuses were nice and the fake bosses were nicetoo but it just doesnt have the feel to it
a lame story toomeh its ok but not that good
i still recommend you to play it and the ending sets the stage for mmps
to the guy who said this is the best one um mm has the rush fuses too and much morethis is not a bad game per se but after five megaman titles with pretty much the same plotline and gameplay this game doesnt really offer anything new
the new features included  two upgrades to megaman jet and power  do not really add anything because megaman is limited in what he can do when he is in jet or power mode
some of the stages have an alternate route which leads to a letter  theres four of them all together which spell out beat  but this is optional and doesnt really add much to the gameplay
the best megaman games in this series were ii to ivmm was the last mm nes game and this title while might be fun to play just isnt that interesting especially after playing the other five titles
some people feel this title is repetitive and i definitely agree with them
still its not a terrible game or anything and is better suited for a diehard megaman completist rather than the casual playerthis game would have been better if it didnt follow the same endingplot twist that happened in mm and  i mean seriously
after the twist revealed in mm and  and seeing the intro in mm it wasnt hard to guess what would really happen at the endingby the time capcom released mega man vi on the nes it was obvious to all in the industry that nintendos bit console the machine that resurrected the video game market in the mid s to the multibillion dollar industry that it is now was on its last legs
capcom wanted to move mega man to the snes but before doing so they made a final chapter for everyones favorite blue bomberironically enough capcom chose not to release mega man vi in the united states publishing the game only in japan due to their decision to put their efforts behind the new mega man x series
when capcom informed nintendo of this decision nintendo took it upon themselves to publish the game in america which is why the game was never released in europehow does it stand up to the other five games
actually not that bad
its obvious capcom is running out of ideas
the basic story is that a mysterious mr x gee i wonder who that could be has been setting up a robot tournament and when mega man shows up all the robots turn against mega man and mr x tries to take over the world
naturally when you defeat mr x turns out it is dr wiley and you have to go into a second castle
while mega man iv and v at least at an element of surprise in their twist ending by vi you can tell its wiley from the beginning even kinda looks like himfirst off the graphics are top notch and so is the sound
but that is little surprise as mega man always had great graphics for the nescapcom was so bereft of ideas they even had contestant winners in nintendo power design two of the robot bosses wind man designed by michael leader of the us and knight man designed by daniel vallie of canadathe other six bosses are largely retreads of previous robot masters or just plain ridiculouswe have plant man who might i add is the single worst boss in not only mega man but in all of video games  hes just gay
his lame weapon is a flower shield and basically hes a poor boy version of the superior leaf man from mega man ii
we have blizzard man who for whatever reason is on skis
ripoff of air man from ii and ice man from the first game
flame man is yet another heatbased robot master weve already had fire man from i heat man from ii and napalm man from v
we have tomahawk man who is very formidable but still feels out of place and like capcom was really stretching for ideas
centaur man is at least somewhat imaginative
the worst though is yamato man
apparently yamato is a geographical term in japan
itd be like oxford man or birmingshire man or las vegas man
incomprehensible
stupid
even wind man who was designed by one of the contestant winners is little more than another version of air manthe levels themselves while compentant are hardly what you call inspired
a lot of them you have seen before in previous incarnations especially flame mans level come on weve had firethemed levels beforea bad part of the levels is that four of them have false endings i guess in attempts from capcom to give the game more replayability
in each of the levels for tomahawk man yamato man knight man and centaur man two separate boss chambers appear one more difficult to reach than the other
by accessing the more difficult of the two you get one of four letters b e a t and when you get all four you can now use beat the robotic bird from mega man v  quite frankly the fake endings are rather dumbthe last levels have some engaging moments even though one of the castle bosses a big dragon is a little too similar too the boss dragon of mega man ii for my comfort
theres another stage in the wileys castle which is primarily dirty water and those spiked orbs which is again a throw back to mega man iithe end features dr wiley being thrown in jail with the last words and a newspaper picture printed
the ending provides good closure for the series but then capcom spoils that by saying to be continued
still a good way to close the nes leg of mega mans journey as far as storywise goesmega man also has some new features
taking a page from mario he has a rush adapter that allows him to fly albeit pretty briefly
this is featured prominently on the game art
beat returns
i would like to have flown longer given how much this was hypedis mega man vi a good game
yes
without a doubt
it would be an even better game its five predecessors did not exist
because ultimately even though they tried adding some new things to the mega man formula at the end of the day capcom with this title feels tired and uninspired like they trying to squeeze one more dollar out of the mega man franchise
but thats largely because mega man vi is just more of the same
if you like the formula youll love this title
but it is still very formulaicall the nes mega man games are good but theyre largely the same
id go with ii or iii first but if you havent played any mega man games vi is a good place to start
but ii and iii should be your first choicebuy this to add to your collection if you also own ps and ps so you know the full story line of metal gearthis was a pretty good transition from the arcade game to the home system
paperboy was pretty fun game for what it was
you are the local paperboy and your job is to deliver the paper to the designated houses but while youre on your route you have to watch for dogs lawnmowers cars and other obstacles
and at the end of each route you get a bonus round for some extra pointsreally though this is a very simple game and the basis of it was also really simple but when it all came down to it it was fun
i will admit for the advanced gamer you probably wouldmt have as much fun because of the games easy gameplay
but for younger gamers and beginning gamers this was great for themi really only suggest this game to younger gamers and beginning gamers because its just way too simple for the advanced gamer and i almost guarantee you youll get bored after a while advanced gamers
if youre looking for other arcade games that hit the nes check out tmnt the arcade game  and gauntletgood quality bring me back great memoryschip n dale rescue rangers great coop title pretty easy gamein the late s capcom made some great licensed games an oxymoron i know based on disney properties with duck tales being the premier example
chip n dale is another example though perhaps less so than duck tales
chip n dale rescue rangers features eleven stages total although some can be skipped
the stages are varied and have memorable boss battles
overall the game is on the easy side which is wholly appropriate for the market this game was aimed for
unlike other titles like battletoads and teenage mutant ninja turtles there are no difficulty spikes that render the game almost unplayble
the boss battles like the rest of the game are on the easy side and are wholly enjoyableafter beating the initial level you are presented with a world map with each level marked as a letter ag
the bare minimum that must be played to reach fat cat the games final boss is actually seven levels
you can beat the game in a mere seven levels completely bypassing four levels
the shortest route to fat kat is skipping a and c and going to level b then d then f then g  e is an optional levelafter beating g you are taken to a second section of the world map with levels h i and j ahead of youthe game is short and wont take you long to beat
however there is some extended life in the game by the great coop play present in the title
i rented this game back in the late s when it came out and first played the game with a cousin of mind  and let me tell you that was a lot of fun
the game is so much better with two playersnintendo talks about how they wanted to get coop mario as early as smb but werent able too
dont know why because there are plenty of coop experiences on the nes and this is one of the better onesthis short game also appeared as a feature article and on the cover of nintendo power
i remember renting and subsequently buying this game on the strength of the coop gameplay as both players one controlling chip and the dale can have game bonding togetherthe video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all time
for those looking for great unknown nesfamicom games you simply must play moon crystal a criminally unknown famicom exclusive
the graphics are astounding with cutscenes that even outdo ninja gaiden amazing music in depth gameplay and a fantastic storyline
absolutely amazing
had this been released in the us for the nes i feel it would be as revered as the other heavy hitters in the nes canonbut thats why im reviewing it to make you remember itits an incredibly hard game
i only made it to the second stage
you are a guy with a knife and you walk to your right stabbing the people who get close to you but its hard because a lot of people come at you
in the first level you get a nice moody and extremely catchy melody while you do this
what a hard game like many nes games
i better not make this review any longer since i doubt anyones gonna read itfinal word buy this game if you want a challenge
its a fine game reallyok first off the guy who posted that other review and said he only got to the second level must really suck but then again ive played the muchmoredifficult arcade version which i have also beaten with the dipswitches set to the secondhardest difficulty
but anyway this game lacks a lot of shine that its arcade predecessor had
the graphics although good for the nes really was a letdown
at least they could have made the guy in a camoflague blue outfit
also theres a lack of the flamethrower which really kicks ass in the arcade version however theres an invincibility star can anyone say super mario bros
and theres a pistol and both of these last for a few moments
theres also  extra levels to make up for the games easiness
however id prefer the arcade version simply because most casual players could only get to the first boss whereas in the nes version a casual player could make it to the third easilykonami released rushn attack as an arcade title under the name green beret in  in japan and also as a famicom disk system title
then in  konami released the title in the pal region and america under the title rushn attack
ah the age of the red scare
it does well to remember historically that this title was released in the late s when ronald regan was battling the evil empire and the russians and the cold war loomed heavy on the hearts and minds of americannaturally all this awareness makes a built in market for products such as video games where your goal is to fight communists and beat back russians holding pows
rush n attack is a side scroller with hordes of enemies attacking your character
and unlike its title suggest the best way to proceed through this game is cautiouslyoverall the game feels very much like a rough draft version of contra
i would not be surprised if the two titles had the same development team
the gameplay is very similar identical really however rush n attack does not have the memorable levels that contra does
also at most there are only two different heights of ground upper level and lower level throughout rushs stages whereas contra you can have several different platforms heights you can play with
contra also allows you to shoot in several different directionsstrangely like most games of the era even though the main character is military the us military sends in the main solider of the game vastly underarmed
the game stars a faceless american solider armed with a knife why dont the military games of the s include more than a knife
and who can pick up guns and rocket launchers
however with all the enemies i guarantee you you wont last long without careful memorization and quick catlike reflexesthe story is simple
free pows
destroy the secret weapon the russians are planning to use to destory the world just like iran and their grab for nuclear weapons of todaykonami released rushn attack as an arcade title under the name green beret in  in japan and also as a famicom disk system title
then in  konami released the title in the pal region and america under the title rushn attack
there are numerous differences between the three different versions
in the arcade title there are only four stages as opposed to the fds and nes game which had six and the goal of the game was free pows
in the nes version the pows were removed and the goal was to destroy the enemies secret weapon
also a flame thrower from the arcade title was removed from the nes version and the nes featured two power ups not present in the arcade title a star and and a pistol with unlimited ammo both of which have a time limitalso in stage six there is a secret underground passage present in the fds version that is not found in the nes version
rushn attack is one of those games i had growing up a kid
like rambo i always wondered why they only equip the main hero with only a knife to fight off hoards of enemies
the game can be rather challenging
like most nes games rushn attack is on the short side
also the end boss a giant missile with hordes of enemies attacking you is rather bizarre as you destroy this giant missile by repeatedly stabbing the explosive with your knife
didnt know you could destroy missiles that wayoverall decent for an nes title nothing to write home about today
my recommendation would be unless you had this game growing up and have some nostalagia for this title like me is buy and play contra instead
contra features the exact same type of gameplay and greatly expands it taking the play in new directions this title never dreamed ofthe video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all timeskate or die was essentially a multi playertournament style game released on the nes in the late s
it had lots of skateboarding games where you can challenge other players
if you didnt have any friends to play with you were out of luck because playing against the computer wasnt as much as fun
the graphics music and sound effects were average at best
the controls were perfect so if you were able to have friends play against you then the game was fun
what could have helped this game even further was to include the ability to save the players names times and high scores
every time you played it you had to register everyone and the game kept everyones results until you turned it offso in short the controls and different kinds of skateboarding games were good
the graphics music and sound effects were just average and since there is no main story mode you had to have friends to make the  player vs mode fun
i got this as a christmas present many years ago and my friends had more fun with it than i did and thats saying something
youve been warned
pskate or die is one of those games that stands the test of time
going back after all these years the gaming and controls still hold up
sign up in the skate shop and compete in all the events
this game has a variety of different aspects of skateboard gameplay down
the half pipe isnt that bad
you can do some grabs and body turns on your board
other events include highjump jam race and joust
the jam is awesome
you and another guy race through an alley way and you get to punch and kick eachother
i also like the race in this game
its called a race even though you skate by yourself
the controls are tricky in this one but you get to race downhill and theres some sweet jumps in this level
and finnally theres the joust
here you get to skate in a swimming pool with a jousting stick and you get  chances to knock down your opponent
after that you have to avoid being knocked down
theres not too much to do when you play this game by yourself other than competing for high scores at the skate shop
because of that the game lacks purpose and can be a bit repetitive
thats why its best to play with friends as up to  people can play in a competition
this is more of a tournament style game thats worth getting with part  its an easy play thats fun to pass around and play with others
different from skate or die  but in a good wayif you run outside and try to dodge the rain it would be an easier task than beating super c  if you thought contra had stupid crazy gay amounts of enemies thrown at you from all angles you aint see nothing until you get owned in super cheese
the fun factor is  but i gave the overall rating  due to the insane difficulty level and having to beat the game on hard to get a lame ending which is stupid
lets put the super cheese makers at gunpoint and tell them to pass super c on hard with one credit or they die becasue we fans want to see the damn ending
to actually be able to play for more than  seconds without getting gayed
how come pits fire ceilings falling falling rocks enemy fire etc only effects the player and the million enemies on the  screen at all times dont get hitthis game was really hard
super c
try to super difficult
the transition from the original contra was just way too hard
granted yes the original contra was a bit easier trust me i know because i beat it within a few days
but super c lets face it this was a tough game and a hard transition at firsti will admit this is a good game if youre looking for a much more difficult harder edge kind of game
this game really made you work for it like how castlevania did
so if youre looking for a tough game check out super c if youre looking for a more fun game that you win at check out the original contra double dragon and of course the mario seriesif youve never played before then this is definitely a piece of history that you can visit
there are some elements to gameplay that have been improved upon like the ability to save your state and history so this is an arcade playthrough style challenge
make your own rules
pacifist or ninja mario where you avoid all badies entirely walker mario where you avoid using run speed mario where you compete against your fastest times  use your imaginationsuper mario brotherssmb  was created by swapping spritesart into an existing gamewhich is why it feelsplays like no other smb gameat its core it was never meant to be oneit is still a decent game but if you are a fan of the other old school smb games you may be disappointedwhen i bought this game i thought it would be much different
i had the first and third mario games for the nes so i wanted to complete the trilogy and buy the seconed one
i played like a  miniute demo of the game but it was not long enough
so when i bought it and it came to me it came to me that this is not the same mario
the only  part i like about it is there is a choice of  cherecters each of their own special moves
mario is just regular but he looks almost completly different
luigi looks different too but it is really annoying with his cherecter that he slides everywhere when he walks or runs
peach is not being rescued on this game she is my favorite charecter because so floats for a short period of time and she controls well
toad on the otherhand can jump very high and go fast
each charecter can duck and when it glows u can do a super jump
they also can pick up items in the ground like onions and plants and throw it at the enemy
that is also the only way u can defeat them too
there is no jumping on them anymore
to defeat the bosses u jump on their eggs they spit out at u and u pick them up and throw it at them
it turns out that this is the japanese famicon version doki doki panicnot mario
they just changed the charecters to mariowhat did nintindo think when they did this
this game is also hard to beat i could not even get to world  if there is even that many
its not even  player
the only reason i still have it is because its part of the trigoly and it will be worth more when u sell all of them together
i gave it a  star because its mario and i love the gamesmany people praise this game to no end and i honestly think its just the quothardcorequot thing to do
super mario bros  smb was a noble effort back in the day and really pushes the idea of what an nes game can be with intricate level layouts maps characters items and play mechanics
it also has a great graphical style thats uniquely its own
no other smb game has ever looked liked thisbut when it comes to actual gameplay it leaves me a bit wanting
my biggest complaint is the levels are really short
even when later levels try to present you with challenges you can often just force your way through and still make it because safety isnt far away
nintendo chose quantity over quality as theres certainly a lot of them
but when you dont have enough meat on any one level to bite into it makes the game hard to get intoanother big let down are the bosses
theyre all almost identical theres a template quotsubbossquot form that all subbosses base their patterns on and a template quotlevel bossquot form that all level bosses base their patterns on
all sublevel bosses use the same or extremely similiar sprites too
all easily squashed with the standard  hits miyamoto always requiresi think smb is just a case of nintendo getting too caught up in the interface items graphics etc and kinda forgetting about the gameplay
try smb instead
either the vastly strange american version thats decidedly unmario but an incredibly well made platformer all the same or the japanese smb which is basically smb on steroids
both much better games than smb isnear the late s the turtles franchise was taking off after starting out as a comic book series
the transition from comic books to the tv screen proved to be successful
after the excellent arcade game came out ultra games or konami as we all found out afterwards announced and then released teenage mutant ninja turtles for the nes
of course it sold very well based on the brand recognition but it divided up the fans when it came to who liked the game and who didnt
it was not a port of the arcade game but rather an original action game with open world game play elements mixed in
to this day some called it a classic while others called it average
i side with the latter as it could have been much betterin this game you take control of all four turtles from the get go
each turtle has his own weapon health bar and were able to use weapons such as scrolls etc
you had to navigate through  stages with goals to complete before you were able to face the boss at the end of each stage
there were two views of action in the game the top down overhead perspective like zelda ii the adventure of link and the regular side scrolling view where you walked from left to right and vice versa
there were weapon and pizza icons to pick up to help you along the way
if you died using a turtle you start at the beginning of the stage with the next turtle available
the game did offer you a chance to rescue your turtle on some stages in certain places so as you were able to find him
when you die using all of the turtles the game is over and you are allowed three continues before you start from the beginning of the gamethe pros the graphics were decent enough and the overall presentation is okay
the controls were easy to use as alternating between the turtles proved no problems to be had
the music was also pretty good to listen to
ultra games used most of the enemies from the tv show and added new ones to populate the stages
several villains also made appearances here like bebop rocksteady mecha turtle and of course shredder
you were given control of all of the turtles from the get go and had to manage their weapon count and health bars
this added strategy as youll use a combination of them at certain points in the game
there are six stages in total and while it sounds like its not a lot for a game they were all rather long
plus it was incredibly difficult which pleased some gamersthe cons i borrowed this game from my best friend at the time and beat it in a week the hardest week i ever experienced back then
heres whyevery stage had objectives to complete
sometimes you can use the map when you hit the start button and see the location for some objectives others you were left on your own to find it
second the game never offered any hints so you had to roam the open world parts to find out which way you would go
third the game demanded precise jumping skills so it was common to try again and again to cross small and large gaps
tmnt had gained a reputation for being one of the most difficult games to beat the underwater section in the nd stage the spiked walls closing in on you in the th stage  facing off against the technodrome in the th stage are examples of intense sections players had to pass through
finally tmnt had one of the worst game endingsever
the feeling i had after i played it every day for a week and then seeing it for myself was of disappointment and anger i realized it was not worth it and never ever played it againsome players had fond memories of this game when they were younger
i didnt and while it was popular for a while that didnt excuse it from the areas that needed work
the top down perspective wasnt helpful the game didnt offer any hints as to where to go you had three continues to beat the entire game and it was brutally difficult in certain sections that frustrated many players
having one of the worst endings ever in a game was inexcusable and that was only seen by those who actually completed the game like myself
if you want an exercise in pain and also see a part of the turtles history in games you can download this title for the wii from the virtual console for  points us 
on the other hand use an emulator because its saferit may not be the best game in my opinion but tough enough especially in certain stages for example in stage  you have to disarm  bombs within a time limit you have to be careful of the seaweed if you touch it you get a nasty shock  in some sections of the sewers if you miss the platform  you landed in the water youll find yourself starting over that section from the beginning but it doesnt count as a life lost i found some areas more fun to play than others i like stage  you can drive the turtle van  you can fire a couple of different weapons to destroy enemies  blockades  another thing to consider when starting stage  you might want to keep track what sewer route you take there all numbered  believe me it took me time to make this easier for me to finish you need to be careful that you dont fall in the fire pits i like that stage  is short i even liked the end boss of the level where you battle the technodromne  not something you would normally find in a tmnt game after destroying the technodrome you have to go inside it  battle enemies to reach the shredder i find him alot easier to finish if you collect the scroll power upthis game was one of the  very first games i got when i first got my nes back in the th century
i was never able to get past the rd level
i tried for years to advance but when you lose all your lives you have to restart all over again and i dont think anyone had the patience to do it again once the snes came into play this game became a forgotten classicnow  million light years since then i recently found myself playing it again on the pc emulator  rom and decided it was a part of my past that was left opened that i had to complete to regain feeling in my left nut againi played it for about  mins and thought  this so i looked for some game genie codes to stay invincible and stuff and i have actually managed to beat this game
so it is possible and its even still hard to beat when you are invincible if you have ever beaten this game without cheating then my hats off to you and a quick flip off and congratulationslooking at it now it makes me wonder if the game was actually meant to be a tmnt game or if the developers where just keen to cash in on the name and just added the tmnt to a game already being developed
i wonder that because the game really has nothing at all to do with the tmnts unless it was based off the comics which i highly doubt
there are some familiar faces like the four turtles april and splinter and the villains bebop rock steady  mousers and about a million rat kings who wasnt even really a villain in the series
but then there is about  different enemies that are not related to anything ever seen in the series such as bulldozers men of fire walking eyeballs balloons that drop bombs weird pink spiders i guess they could say the forces of dimension x where at play but there is no mention of it in the game
krangs not in it but there are bad guys that sort of look like that small chicken walker thing he hadit just makes me wonder if this game was being developed as something else and then they decided hey lets put the tmnt into this thing once you defeat the techno drome that is one th the size of the cartoon one you can fight off shredder and then reach one of those quick endings that basically say well all that hard work was a waste of time thanks for playing in fact the end is a joke i wont spoil it give an emulator with game genie codes active a go and see for yourself if youre curious it was lame lame lame probably lasted  secondsthis mightve been where it started but i prefer the arcade version over any of themnes  teenage mutant ninja turtlesthree stars  tremendously popular when released still good todayteenage mutant ninja turtles were a hot property back in the late s
they had spawned a successful comic book series a television show three feature length movies and other related merchandise
they were even featured in pizza hut advertisementsso it was natural someone would feature them in a nes gameenter ultra a shadow company of konami
ultra was a subsidary of konami and created for the sole purpose of publishing more nes titles than nintendo allowed a developer to publish in any given yearthere was already an arcade game as a four player beatem up released in japan when ultra released teenage mutant ninja turtles  in north america
rather than do a port of that title ultra developed their own title
the arcade port would be released as teenage mutant ninja turtles  ii the arcade game
although billed as a sequel the port of the arcade title had nothing to do with the original nes game and had much different gameplay
instead of four player the nes teenage mutant ninja turtles  ii had two player
otherwise the game as largely identical to the original arcade titlethe game proved very popular back in the day
this video game would even appear in the  nes commercial posing as a feature length hollywood film called the wizard
interestingly enough lucas i love the power glove
it is so bad
is now a convicted felon due to sex crimes
its great to hear beau bridges complain about the technodrome
its even better to read roger eberts review of the wizard where he discusses the games as wellthe overall gamestyle is either top down perspective or sidescrolling and this title uses both constantly and interchangeably similar to zelda ii although there is more to do in the overworld perspective than zelda iithe game features all four turtles as playable characters from the start
you are able to switch out any turtle at any time provided they are still alive and have energy
leonardo has medium range sword attacks
raphael has the worst attack range but has the very powerful attack
michelangelo has medium range and power but is the fastest turtle and the best to use in the infamous water stage
donatello is by far the best turtle to use due to his attack range and power almost making the other three turtles obsolete at bestlike previous reviewers have noted the game strangely lacks any major enemy characters from the franchise which is a rather strange omission given the fact konami was marketing this product and kids obsessed with the turtles
for bosses bebop rockseady turtle van blimp the technodrome and shredder are the only main characters from the franchise that make an appearance
where is krang my personal favorite leatherhead the rat king casey jones etc
nowhere to be foundthe game overall is short and brutal
you only get three continues
there are only six long stages but trust me those stages will have you pulling your hair out at the end
although there have been complaints about the controls they are not that bad
the angry video game nerd has shown in his famous review of this title a spot where you must jump over a certain hole in the floor that you actually just run over
that is the exception though not the rule
overall the play control is rather goodlike several nes games teenage mutant ninja turtles  features a stage notorious for its difficulty
teenage mutant ninja turtles is rather infamous for the water stage where you must guide the turtles through an insanely challenging swimming level where you must disarm explosives before the bad guys blow up a dam
teenage mutant ninja turtles  gives you  minutes to swim through this underwater labyrinth in an attempt to disarm the bombs
you must avoid water currents electric beams pink seaweed that is very difficult to avoid
other stages that are difficult are stage four the spiked wall sequence and the final bossthe difficulty and the length of this game was in line with other titles and these features were rather common in that era
other famous difficult levels from the nes era are  from the original adventure island the battletoads racing level and snakes level ninja gaidens  and beyond and the yellow devil boss from the original mega man
the games were just hard as balls back then and short
the length was due largely to the technology of the timethe reviewer who complained about the ending being the worst he has ever seen is rather laughable
it is a nes game after all
overall the endings to nes titles were always rather lame
as far as the worst i would probably nominate ghost and goblins because after beating the game you discover you have literally been tricked by satan 
 and the only way to see the true ending is to go back and beat the game a second time
as that game is damn near impossible this ending just adds insult too injury
how capcom ever got satan past nintedos censors who wanted all religious content removed from north american nes video games  i guess well never know
shigeru miyamotos  devil world even went unreleased in the united states due to the titlefor availability obviously you can get the game used for your nes or emulate which may be safer for your controller as you can save state your way through the more difficult sections
nintendo also sanctioned the titles rerelease in the wiis virtual console the greatest invention in the history of mankind if i do say so myself
 although teenage mutant ninja turtles  is  points rather than the standard  points for nes titles due to licensing issuesalthough now in the twenty plus years the game has been out it has become favorable to blast the game for its difficulty and other perceived offenses largely due to the avgn review it helps to remember that teenage mutant ninja turtles sold over four million copies when first released making it one of the most successful third party nes titles ever
nintendo power gave this game their game of the year award in  as wellmuch like zelda ii the adventure of link teenage mutant ninja turtles was a tremendously popular game and much of the hostility present toward the title in the present gaming culture was not present back in the late s though this is probably more true of zelda ii than teenage mutant ninja turtles although difficult and sometimes frustrating this is one of the great nes titles
the video game website ign rated this title as the th greatest game on their top  nes games of all timei first played this game in  when i was  years old ok i was one year late but we rented games and tried them out before we go out and spend  on them
i was a big turtles fan so i didnt care
it was fun selecting different turtles who varied in speed damage in turtle weapons and range in turtle weapons and picking up and using different ninja weapons such as boomerangs shierikens and tnt best weapon other than your main weapons
graphics for its time were awesome and so was the music score and the controls
i love that
i only gave this game three stars because i do have  major complaints about the game
it was way too difficult
even with your nintendo power strategy guide you had to play this game  times to master beating it
i think this game went beyond the levels of difficulty such as how easy it was for the turtle to die and the random changing groups of enemies throughout the game making it hard for you to strategize your attack or moves
even though it had some of the dark elements from the comics the game was suppose to be for kids so there was no reason for the high levels of difficulty choice of characters was my main problem with this game
the cartoon series was already on their second seaon when they were designing this game
i sense that they were trying to mix in the cartoon series bebop rocksteady and the technodrome with adding more elements of the darker comics but when the hell were flying missle balloons flying robot heads chainsaw guy frog man fireman butterflies mechaturtle and flying astronauts appear in the ninja turtles universe
how uncreativethere were alot of ninja turtle enemies to choose from but omitting krang really took the cake
it was great fighting the moving techonodrome but there would be no technodrome without krang
i dont think they did the proper marketing research before making and releasing this game you dont hear the ninja turtles theme music anywhere in the game
what copyright contraints were the developers under
as a child i was confusedother than the three complaints the game was playable and it would be much better to use game genie to beat it
i know its cheating but its more fun that way and it was the only way i was able to beat the game
although this game was a hit ultrakonami knew they messed up a bit and responded by improving the game play and character selection on the future tmnt titles plus targeting them more for kids because kids were the large fanbase of tmntwhen i played this game as a kid i was able to pass level  the water level two times at the most
i figured trying the game again  years later with more improved game skills and a walkthrough just might enable me to beat it
now im thinking theres just no way
ive beaten the original super mario brothers pilotwings zelda  mike tysons punchout jurassic park on snes and other extremely challenging games but this one is just too muchstill im not all that disappointed
i mean im able to get through level  at almost any time now and i actually made it all the way to level   so at least i can do better now than i did  years ago and thats why i bought the game
to see how far ive comebut im not going to make it all the way to finishing the game
its too difficult
there is no room for error
none
ive never seen a game where you had to be so accurate with your jumps
i mean you have to actually watch how hard you press the button
if you just barely tap it too hard or too soft youll miss your jump
also you cant be too far on or off the platform youre jumping from
youve got to press the button at just the right second and with just the right amount of force as you walk off the platform
and when you miss a jump you have to fight a whole swarm of enemies you just killed yet another time before you get a chance to try the jump again
this wouldnt be so bad if there were a way to actually master jumping in this game
but theres not
you could try the same jump  times and after all that youd still be very likely to miss your next attempt even after all that practicefor the past few days i kept getting further and further along in the game every time i played but i think ive finally had enough
i reached this part where spiked walls come at me and all i have to do is drop down holes to avoid them
but i lost all four of my turtles to those spikes
if the spikes touch you once youre dead
and the holes to drop down are way too easy to walk over because you have to be so darn accurate with how much force you use to tap the control pad
of course the spikes move fast enough so that if your timing isnt freakin perfect youre dead
if you walk over a hole by accident forget it the spikes are going to get you
and if you try to be careful so you dont walk over the holes you wont move fast enough to drop down in time and youll die anyway
the lack of room for error is just so frustrating and its present at so many points in the game
you just get sick of trying to beat itand just because i can beat the water level now doesnt mean i cant complain about it
i mean shoot even when youre way far away from the instant death seaweed the stuff pulls you down like a magnet
and if you try to swim off the top of the screen to deactivate a bomb above youre pulled down before you reach the top
this drains a whole lot of the miniscule time you have to complete the level
if you waste even  seconds fighting this kind of magnetic effect youve lost so much time that youll have to just swim through all the dangerous stuff in the level and take loads of damage in order to beat the time limit
again the slightest error is completely devestatingits easier to get a phd in quantum physics than it is to beat this game
gosh its depressing
but it has some great graphics and sound at least
update    okay i actually by some miracle got all the way to the inside of the technodrome after getting through all the random bs where you have to hunt for it
unfortunately all that hunting drained the heck out of my life and i died shortly after entering the final leveltetris was known for being a fun and addictive puzzle game where you fit pieces together to form and clear lines on the screen
this game was bundled with the original game boy and was a smash hit in  over a year later nintendo released it for the nes
its exactly like tetris for the game boy with the only difference being is colorits a fun game but there was only one mode of play the classic marathon
you start a game and clear as many lines as you can for the entire game
it gets harder as you move up on levels meaning the blocks drop faster
the game ends when the screen fills up with blocks
so if you wanted to experience the fun of tetris and play in quick  to  minute sessions this one was for you
otherwise you can get the latest versions of it for the nintendo ds ds and wiithis arrived on nes after nintendo won the rights to tetris in a legal battle
the tengenatari nes version was so much better
it has smoother gameplay blocks dont get caught on others simply by slightly touching screwing you in the process it has more songs better grahpics and it over all a way better version
this version is decent but is not the origional or anything near the best version i have played in my dayi love tetris
i am a puzzle guy and this game is right up my alley
however it doesnt work in the nes console i just bought for my son more than half the time
i dont know if its the console the game or some combination of both
it can be frustrating
the good part is that it wasnt expensiverewritten tetris is a timeless puzzle game
some could say its even flawless
however if theres one thing that seems to fly over many peoples heads its that this nes version of tetris is featurelesswhile the game itself is totally addicting and fun and contains two game modes one with and without blocks already added onscreen it pales in comparison to pretty much every other version of tetris in existence
even the game boy version contains an extra player versus mode which this version strangely lacksmeanwhile the nes version that tengen made has a lot more features packed in and definitely has a bunch of multiplayer features including coopsimply put get a different tetristhis is one of those classic nes games that can still make me smile
the crappy music is great the sorta d world is impressive
oh and lets not forget that bam bam bigalo does cartwheels for his special move and they included the honky tonk manthe game can be a challenge against the computer so its best played with a companion
really it all comes down to luck because the controls can be difficult and unresponsive
punch kick and cartwheel your way to victorywhen it comes to powering up old nes games this one holds up better than a lot of them
youll probably still get bored with it in ten minutes but it will be a quality ten minutesthe original
its needless to say that every video game series has to start somewhere
for mega man the beginning was in december of  on the nintendo entertainment system
as easy as it is for one to slap down a date and call it a starting point when did mega man become a household name when did it really take off
look no further than mega man ii and mega man iiiwhy am talking about the immediate sequels when its the original thats on the table here
when dissecting a game its good to start with a dose of reality
most people capcom included would probably have a hard time saying that the original mega man was a complete success
in fact the creation of the superior mega man ii was considered a rogue effort by the developers involved a project that was far from being on the front burner
so in going from one game that almost never had a sequel to a game that now has nine where does the original mega man fit in beyond being a point of originto get to the bottom of that question one has to at least focus on the first three games
as odd as this may sound in this day and age mega mans initial adventure was undoubtedly unique
im not talking about things like having six bosses instead of the standard eight or the lack of energy tanks but the impersonal industrial feel the stages
other elements like gun turret traps the drab color palette uneven difficulty and lack of support characters fueled the feeling that you were truly alone that you were charged with terminating six humanoid robots with little to no explanation
all you knew was that they had to be destroyedthis begs the question what is the original mega man known for
its collection of robot masters
its insane crash damage when fighting the yellow devil
its somewhat peculiar and forgettable level design
these are all good answers but its only one them  the games cast of robot masters  that are truly memorable
obviously the games music goes hand and hand with this but beyond these simplistic yet loveable characters theres nothing here the sequels dont or cant do betterthis is why the original mega man is for the trueblue mega man fan only casual fans can get by without or have a more engrossing time with one of its sleeker and much more welcoming successors like mega man  or  if anything a nes cart of mega man is more of a trophy than a tangible playing experience which is not exactly the greatest reason to buy somethingof all the games of the nes era mega man sticks out in my mind as being the hardest
i didnt expect it to include the things that would later go into the series such as the charge shot or rush or anything like that but when i first played it i was flabbergasted by its extreme difficulty
as a kid i thought it was a great game
now that im older i can look at it with a critical eye and say that it is a good game but even for an old school gamer mega man is a game that so rightfully needed the remake that it was garnered in the psp and was also a game that seriously needed tweaking even when it was first released in the sas with all old school games of the bit era mega mans focus was not story
it was gameplay
storlyines didnt become important until the bit era
so if you wanted to know the premise you needed to read the instruction manual
of course you probably know it without the use of the instruction booklet anywaymega mans gameplay was pretty simple
you played as the blue bomber and selected one of six robot masters to go off and face
you went through the level and would eventually find the robot master and take them down
each robot master was weak to another robot masters weapon
in the end this proved to be a staple of the mega man series
each time you defeat a boss you get his weapon and move on
fantasticthe game was difficult though
and when i say difficult im not joking
for one youve got no energy tanks and the energy pellets that restore health are not dropped very often
also there are no passwords so you have to complete the game in one sitting
bosses also did a lot of damage to you
for a series mega man got off to a great start but as an indiviual game the fun is actually taken away because of the difficulty the yellow devil comes to mind
youre not invulnerabe to spikes if you get hit and there are no energy tanks
that makes up the bulk of the difficulty
this probably wont bother those who played the games in order but i started with mega man ii
the other big thing about the difficulty was the magnet beam
youll have to grab it in order to get further in wilys fortress but you dont get it by traditional means
you have to find it in a level
this brings about another gripe with the difficulty if you go back to a level you must fight that robot master again and you might not be prepared for thatmusic wise i also didnt think highly of the first mega man
a lot of the music just didnt sound fantastic to begin with
there were some good tunes wilys fortress cut mans stage but there were also tunes i dreaded a lot ice mans stage the boss fight music
again though this is the first game
its just getting things startedmega man is a good game but the extreme difficulty might be a bit much for even your average old school gamer whos used to such difficult feats
its a good game and itll probably test your skills more than the likes of contra
however im not the kind of gamer who is used to that
i was able to complete mega man but its not an easy game
but ive heard of gamers going through the whole game without getting hit once which means the difficulty really does provide a lot of funthis is a good tetris like game
i liked it enough but i bought it for my sister who was a huge fan back when we were kidsknowing its legacy during the s i actually never played the legend of zelda for more than ten minutes back then
the reason for that was the lack of understanding of what to do
eventually it turned out to be lack of a map which was desperately needed
its a huge world to be in and there were too many hidden entrances making the game unfair to play if a map wasnt supplied
now i have a chance to try the game again and it turns out to be a better experience for it due to great supply of maps on the internet
i was able to complete quests  and  with ease
now the question comes is it really the greatest game ive ever played
nopeway way far from that truth
ultimately i found the legend of zelda a very boring game to play because about  of my wasted time was spent on farming for rupees
i was glad to have my monotony to be broken up every time i could go inside of a dungeon
to beat the game handily is to have the proper gear
thats what i knew in order to win
now for the challenge i found the game unbelievably simple and most of the dungeons were a breeze for me
i was often skipping a lot of unnecessary rooms in there to get what i needed
all in all just because the legend of zelda was a revolutionary game doesnt automatically mean its the greatest game of all time it was a quite boring game
however i am glad it came with a save feature something that many nes games are sorely in a need of because the legend of zelda was really too long to play and was too simple to beatalthough i have beaten  zelda games the older ones are my least favorites
they are innovative and quality games for their time but by todays standards they are pretty dated
the graphics are very bright and hard on the eyes for the first two zelda games
the difficulty is also much much harder
theres also not nearly as much of an emphasis on story and overall the older ones just arent as enjoyable
this game does get better the more you play it and you do get used to it but i found myself just progressing in it a little bit at a time partly due to difficulty but mostly just because i got tired of it and wanted to play something more contemporary
the dungeons are actually good but other than that theres just not much to do in the game
travelling between dungeons is not nearly as fun here as it is in other zelda games
this game is important as the first zelda game that invented many conventions that are still used today such as dungeons the triforce ganon swords and items such as bombs and the boomerang but i mostly played and beat this game because it was a zelda game and i want to beat all of themits not a bad game but its just nothing special i mean you play as link in the game and the text is boring
the magic system is kind of cool however you travel from place to place fighting monsters and have to locate new spells and items
its kind of like your regular zelda game just as a platformer
if you really want to try it buy itotherwise you could skip this one
all and all its just average is allif youve played the first zelda for the nes then prepare for shock because this second installment is way different
in some ways better in some ways not
graphics and sound are better this time around but nothing that really blew my socks offeven then
once again the story is dreadfully weak but i dont really expect that much from an nes title
when you start off princess zelda is unconscious or somethingtoo many beers at the ganonisdead party
once again link goes out to save the world
the biggest change in this game is this maps are topdown like dragon warrior or final fantasy semirandom battles too but the towns and dungeons are in the sideview
the sideview graphics are good but i wish theyd stick to the original format that was used in the first game
throughout the game link can learn different sword techniquesup thrust down stab maybe one other
it certainly adds more strategy to the game
also link can use magic spells
once again therere tons of dungeons to go into with the only differences being the ending bosses mazes and colors
the last battle in this game is pretty interestinglink fights his own shadowbut is either too hard or too easy
at first i had the hardest time because the shadow mirrors your every move
but after about the fifth time i figured it out and whooped him good in under a minute
so much for the eversodifficult ending boss
i personally have never found the zelda series all that exciting but this game is not too badthe game works greatbut as far as the game itself to me it is not the best zeldathen again for a regular nintendo its not that bad eitherthe adventure of link is a least favorite game among a lot of zelda fans
i couldnt believe how bad and how difficult at was at first
the overworld is absurd as you cannot use your sword and there are no conventional enemies
every ten seconds three enemies appear and its like pacman in that you have to run and try to avoid them
if they run into you you are forced into this new screen of enemies
you can either fight them at this point or leave the screen and return to the overworldthis game is very annoying at first but you sort of get used to it
i tried to make progress in this game countless times and gave up on it within minutes
it doesnt even seem like a zelda game
it is playable though once you figure out how it works
it helps to consult a walkthrough or a youtube video to get help as there are a lot of cryptic places where you get stuck and theres no way to know that theres a wall you can walk through or a certain grave that you can fall into unless you consult a walkthroughthe dungeons are sidescrolling so theyre basically the opposite of the first zelda game
a really annoying thing is that every time you die you have to start at the very beginning of the game
so you have to complete a palace in its entirety or else you have to start from the beginning
you still do keep items and stuff like that and going through the dungeon the second or third time is much easier but it gets really tiresome
its easily the worst thing about the gamethere are points in this game that seem virtually impossible
i felt like some of them require  attempts before you beat them and thats a lot for a game like this
the worst is the very last dungeon
it is incredibly hard
the last boss took me so many times to beat
theres also a boss right after that one
fortunately theres a technique to beat this boss that makes it about the easiest boss in the game but if you dont know it youll probably never beat the gameoverall i would only recommend this game to zelda completists who want to beat every game
the adventure of link does some things right but its far from a success
if you can get used to this game it is a good challenge and the palaces are kind of different and almost fun at times but the difficulty is just too much for the average gamer
the graphics are also very dated
also as with the legend of zelda theres nothing at all good about the game outside of the dungeonsok this is a great game but it can be very frustrating
you die too quickly
some enimies are very frustrating like the purple flying robot if he finds you he will get to the bottom so you cant attack him unless youre lucky enough to have the ability toplace bombs while rolling
the first most frustrating ememy in the game is the flys that come out of the pipes
theyre extremely annoying
theyre are not stupid if you jump they will go higher on the next attack
it is just so annoying
i reccommend this game but be aware that this game is frustrating
the other thing is that the password system is frustrating because it is easy to confuse different characters with othersoverall i reccommend it but watch out for the flysthis is a fun little old game but cant compare to any of the others
zero mission was an excellent remake of this gamethis games is frustrating due to the horrible controls
this becomes very evidant when fighting soda popinski
you hit him a few times you get tired he hits you once your tired then your kodlamei dont know why nintendo made this game especially considering most poeple would love to beat ol mike tyson up now more than ever
its essentially mike tysons punchout
without mike tyson you fight some pasty blonde guy named mister dream instead
i guess nintendos contract ran out or something when nintendo still wasnt ready to stop selling the game
also great tiger is now glass tiger
the controls are simple enough a  b are punch buttons holding up while pressing either one results in a facepunch left and right are for dodging down is for blocking doubletap down to duck and start is for a super punch provided you have at least one star
unfortunately you cannot pause the game so bathroom breaks must be taken between fights or rounds
as stated in my review of mtpo which amazoncom may not have posted since i used a contraversial word you play as little mac and your opponents are mike tysons punchout
in order of appearance glass joe a wuss who gives the french a bad name von kaiser a former boxing instructor from germany piston honda an angry japanese boxer don flaminco a flamboyant spaniard who loves a woman named carmen san diego perhapse
 king hippo a human tub of lard who wears size xxxl shorts and cannot get up once he is knocked down glass tiger an eastindian with magic powers and a jewel possibly the eye of the tiger encrested into his turban bald bull an oddly familiarlooking fighter from turkey soda popinski a softdrink fanatic who loves soda and looks somewhat like bald bull except hes thinner and wears a speedo instead of shorts mr sandman a classic slooking african american with mean uppercuts super macho man a selfabsorbed champion with a thornado punch and finally mr dream a kurtangle lookalike reject who can knock you down with just one uppercutyou are a warrior that sets out to destroy the evil tyrant who  has his mideons killing townspeople and releasing monsters
along the way to the tyrant you meet up with two others a strong soldier and a young magician
this game was a stepping stone between the original rpg dragon warrior and the amazing dragon warrior iii
this game was the first to feature a party of warriors banded together by a bond to destroy the dragon lord
the game features a great big new world with lots of new enemies tons of new items and equipment with a few familiar faces and places such as the original world from dragon warriorthis is a pretty good game much like tetris
there is an original concept though because little monsters drop down like blocks
they drop down you do not turn them instead yoshi is at the bottom of the screen holding up four plates to collect the monsters and you move him around and pivot these plates to collect the monsters
its not that simple though the only way to kill these monsters is to capture them into egg halves that drop down
first get a lower half of an egg drop a few monsters onto the half egg then drop the top half of the egg
then the eggs squeeze together killing the enemies
like a verticle tetristhis game was fun and i recently played it since my ninteno system crashed in the early s
as a child this game was difficult to figure out
the progression of the levels is linear but within the levels there is exploration and secrets
your stars with rickoshay off windows or clowds or tree stumps and a bonus or a penalty will occur
either you get a fairy who gives invicibilty or minni is taken by a seudo flying kuppa
you can escape
to find minni again you must again find another secret area where you stars rickoshay then find her by luck through a guessing game touch a stone statue and it may be her or just a statuerepeattoday i found the graphics just how i remebered themvery good like castle of illusion for the genesis or a d mario with more interesting levels and bosses but with nes trademark flickery graphics
i would recomend this game for older players
it can be frustrating
the first level has an evil witch boss who is tricky but gives you the key to leave the fun house
the second level the ocean is a straight run for the end but lots of cheap deaths keep running and try to find invinciblity fairy as mentioned ealieriam approaching this from my point of view  if you dont like a challenging game like me you casual gamers need to stay away
here we go tomb raider for the sega saturn it has  levels  about  or  of them are from h
its not a bad game its just something i wouldnt be playing a whole lot dont expect to beat it in  sitting i remember this game on the playstation i never made it that far i beat it  got an ending that was almost mediocre
i finally got a new review in but next month ive got a lot of reviews planned that are christmas related  btw happy thanksgivinga must have for your collection as the first tomb raider game
this game can be a lot of fun with all the puzzles and different enemy types
i personally like it but find the controls slow and sluggish
though its a great game in content its not one i plan on finishingthis game has very nice d art design and good use of color
the towns buildings and other areas are fantastically detailed
birds chirping and other nice little details thrown in
the characters could be better animated and have a  bit feel to them
that is because the game was originally a snes game that was canceled
the battle system is simplistic and takes a while to load
this sort of drags the game down a bit
the story is good enough to keep you engaged
the humour sprinkled throughout the game is a fantastic and actually helps to keep you engaged in the game
there isnt much strategy in this game and at times the battles get that hohum feeling
the random battle encounters are a bit excessive as well
the music in this game is superb and rivals ff games
at times you may get that meh feeling but then something happens to pique your interest again
the timing of these events are almost perfect and spaced out at the right time
if you take out the good music and the humour sometimes overused the overall game is very average
most of the spells here are useless
there is little character development and the main character is practically a mute
theres not much in the explorations dept or puzzle dept
the last section  is on huge convoluted array of doors portals elevators etc
unless you get real lucky somehow it will take you a while to figure out
im not sure what the devs were thinking
as if they determined the game was a bit too short and decided to lengthen it somehow
sans this and some other minor quibbles i enjoyed the game
i would give it a first off i am a dragon lover
i simply love dragons and a while ago about i bought a sega saturn just so i could play two rpgs in which one of the playable characters is an adorable and buff looking dragon
those two are albert odyssey and shining the holy arkthis actually isnt the first time i played this game
years ago i found a nine year old egm magazine in my closet that i once got in a trip to acapulco when i was  i remember trying to digest every amount of detial regarding both rpgs mentioned therein even though i didnt own a saturn and would not own one until  i just thought the dragons were cool
me and a friend of mine both drooled over albert odyssey and he decided to buy a copy on ebay as well as a working saturn
he let me borrow it and we both played itafter playing it again years later i can honestly say its a good rpg but somewhat dissapointing storywise
the beautiful box art and cool name make it sound like one of the greatest rpg stories ever
honestly though its pretty mediocre
it doesnt make the game unplayable at least
the rest of the game plays pretty well
the story however is just lacking
its more like a string of inexplicalbe events tied together to make something like a story
for instance take a scence about four hours into the game in which you enter a vampires castle
the way the camra panes up on the intimidating structure is reminiscent of chrono trigger when you first enter magus catslte
however the vampire is hardly the badass magus was and his entrance and exit from the story is pretty damn unceremonious
thats about how the whole games story is
bad dialouge unpredictable but not amazing plot developments and a story anyone could have come up with
i found myself not caring one iota about the whole struggle of good and evil crap i just wanted more of the gamein summation a soso good game with a cute dragon character who wears armor and uses swords and has different breath attacksps
i paid  for this game andwhile i like it i dont think the price was right
if youre just an rpg buff looking for working designs games try looking for a better price
after all its not like this is lunar or arc the ladcarmageddon ii is a great game if you like driving games its very exciting and gory
you can run over people animals crash on buildings
you can do lots cool stuff with the powerups
the levels and cars are very cool
the things the car does are quite unbelivable it can destroy a truck but its a lot of fun
it is a lot better than the first carmageddon
the graphics are just average
the controls are very difficult it is a bit hard to drive the car but gets easy after some time
a beautiful game with lots of blood and gory and not for kids or the weak heartedthis game is awesome im surprised that a certain big shot lawyer and enraged parents havent rained down on this game and the interplay
the  game features a number of quotevilquot cars which youll eventually get  to drive as you earn them by smashing them into pieces
the old rules of  original carmageddon simply dont apply here
smashing the cars often wont  kill them but destroy yourself instead
instead youll have to employ using  your car along with shoving your enemies into land mines off of cliffs  into walls etc
etc
the body count is much much higher than the old  carmageddon sometimes as many as  times more people to crush maim burn  drown splatter and bounce on each leveland yet
there is  something wrong with this formula
the crucial thing is how the player  advances through the game
carmageddon simply let the player advance each  level one at a time with the option to replay the last  or  levels
this  method is especially useful if the player likes a particular level or needs  to increase money or to grab a certain car
carmageddon  groups three  levels and a final level into group
the player is forced to only play  within these four levels and to defeat the fourth one before advancing to  the next one
its this fourth level in each group that cripples the game
instead of destroying the opponents or killing all pedestrians or  completing all the laps the game forces the player to one goal and to  complete this goal
sometimes this goal seems near impossible
for  example one level requires the player to destroy all satellite towers  within a very specific time frame
i managed to defeat the level with just  barely  second to spare after several tries
another requires the player  to nail a massive dump truck one tire alone is bigger than your own car
  this is difficult to manage at best
i managed to do it by finding land  mines and mine quotdroppingquot ability edited for g rating and  luring that yellow monster into theminterplay really should have kept  the same formula found in carmageddon
despite the problems this game is  rather fun especially if youre a driver in nasty city
its a nice way to  let your aggressions out with out actually killing real pedestriansmarvel vs capcom  is a huge game
it has  fighters but sadly a lot were fillins can anyone say servebot
i expected better than to throw exact ports of old characters what kills the  character draw is the fact that many were ported over as is with no graphiical improvements and with no new moves iron man morrigan thanos etc
some characters in mvc are rad like guile captain commando and the resident evil girl but the others are mostly plain and dead
my biggest gripe is that characters such as thor daredevil or mr fantastic are absent but cheap ports such as thanos who looks ugly as well as morrigan are there
who cares we want real fighters not addins
mvc has sweet graphics cool backrounds fast action but too much cheap play
the partners who help are just abused and when they are i abuse them to the extent that when it is their turn to fight they have little energythe action gets old when you realise that only a handful of the  are actually playable and can compete in this game beat the game on level  with a party of serve bot roll and dan i dare yaoverall i wanted deep d fighter with class but got a d fighter with too much reharshes
its fun for a while but youll move on
i recommend power stone ive always loved capcoms vs series games but i must say i am somewhat  dissapointed with marvel vs capcom   i object to the removal of medium  attacks even though it does make it easier to play on the awkward  dreamcast controller
some characters suffer more than others from it a  few have completely lost their ability to execute their launching move on  command while others seem to benefit from it jin gets chain combos out  of the deal
i cant deny that this game is a lot of fun once you adjust  to the new control style but it still has problems
no personalized  endings gameplay which encourages cheapness over strategy and pixelated  characters will likely dissapoint hardcore fans
marvel vs capcom  does  include every character from every other vs game and more which raises  the fighter roster to an amazing  characters
the bottom line is if you  want quality play xmen vs street fighter or marvel vs capcom
if you  want quantity play marvel vs capcom strider   circa good goodtight controls fast and fun gameplay comes packed with original striderbad pretty dated graphics even for when it was released few levels make a short gamewill it fit your taste d sidescroller with liner levels but backgrounds are d straightforward classic arcade gameplaygame its most assocated too strider mega man x playing as zero and not mega man castlevaina symphony of the nightadditional notes most levels are more like remakes of the classic strider levels unlock strider nemesis the other or bad strider after beating the gamefor a street fighter game this is very disapointing
no where near as good as the originali dont know what everyone was talking about niether because the graphics aint better then the originalthis one has no endings
no sakura
chun li has been toned down a bit
vegas claws look like flat pieces of metalit is a good game if you can get through alot of what is missing and missing from the original but i give it thumbs down
its lucky it gets  starsim keeping this short and sweet  sf ex plus is not the best street fighter game out there but it has several pros and conspros  with the director feature you can make your own movies
most of the standard characters are there ryu ken chunli guile sagat dhalsim zangief vega and bison
  barrel mode is where you choose a fighter to destroy as many barrels as possible
control is difficult but the fun is still there
i got my best score  plus with chunli
  bison has no  damage moves
hes still deadly any how
  chunli kicks enemy but with her spinning bird kick and guiles moves are much easier to executecons no sakura akuma cammy or dan ryus and kens hurricane kicks are a bit harder to execute youll need some patience on loading times only chunli and dhalsim has taunts and can be difficult to execute which that and other gestures should have been added to director modethis game was odd at best and really not completely worth the time it took to complete
i expected more from square at least they redeemed themselves with final fantasy ixthis is definitely the worst installment of the seiken densetsu series but then again that statement could mean almost anything given the sheer brilliance of the original trilogy
i prefer to think of legend of mana as the metaphoric dessert of the series rather than as a complete game
its like the icing on the cake nothing more than a victory lap for the sd team upon the completion of what may be the greatest rpg trilogy ever to grace society with its presence
you can get lots of enjoyment out of it as long as you dont try to play it like a complete gameplus if youre into graphics and eyecandy then for the love of all that is sacred you must buy legend of mana
no one will dispute this point the graphics of this game are beautiful
thats what comes of the combination of a team of talented artists and an engine that uses handdrawn backdrops
perfect  for this sectionhowever as an rpg emphasys on the g legend of mana falls down with a rather jarring thud
each game in the seiken densetsu series after the second installment secret of mana has had a successively worse battle system
you can see that the team wanted the series to be more of an rpg and less of an adventure what they failed to realise was that som was absolutely enough of an rpg already
its battle system was spectacular
but in sd and lom battles are foolishly given their own motion systems different from the physics of simply walking around and exploring
specifically the characters move much much much more slowly
this effect feels awkward and has no obvious payoff other than satisfying the inner qualms of the designers about whether their games are true rpgs
i wish theyd realised they that indeed were
additionally weapon usage is a bit weirdpoor and the magic system here is nothing too special
id say this is the worst aspect of lomim sure youve all heard those terrible rumours about the plot
it doesnt exist
most will complain still others say it doesnt make any sense
ill agree with them on the point that legend of mana didnt have the deepest or most coherent plot ever but if you dont let it bother you its really not a problem like they say it is
and they are exaggerating to quite and awful extent
id tell you something like dont go into this game expecting it to be like final fantasy this game is worth  starshowever the volume for the voice acting is turned way down and there isnt a way to fix it so you strain to hear everything saida real problem when youre trying to follow the storyaside from that however its a wonderfully creepy trip through a haunted  house where you must solve some fiendishly difficult puzzles in order to  find out who you are and why youre there and how to get out
a great  game to play with a group of friends or alone with the lights outwhen maxis put out simcity  unlimited i was very excited
ive always been impressed with their games from simcity classic and  to simtower simfarm and sim themepark
but this game just doesnt live up to the maxis reputationfirst youre lucky if the game loads under  minutes
on my mhz machine with  megs of ram it often took me  minutes to get the game loaded
i couldnt do any multitasking with this game or it would crash
another problem with memory  if you get a large city it takes forever to load and forever to scroll
the image jumps across the screen at a pace that makes you feel like your only transportation is a walkerthe game has some nice upgrades from   better trading of goods  power trash etc  and a better advising system all together
the graphics are more pleasing and the ultra zoom is entertaining allowing you to watch individual cars and people as well as parades in your honor
the special landmarks are pretty but they arent restricted at all nor do they seem to add anything but aesthetic value to the gamer
you lose the stats on visitors like you had with the landmarks in the game is more challenging than  and i found it too difficult to get my city up and started
building to the bare minimum i still would go bankrupt  a problem i had never encountered with simcity i give the game  stars for its new features and for being a memory hog
if you have simcity  id invest in the expansion pack or the special edition and not bother with  unlimited
its a lot cheaper has many similar feautres and it wont crash your systemseems like this series has only updated it graphics from version to version
there is really nothing new here other than updated graphics and some new city management responsibilities
im hearing similar things about scthis series is starting to burn it self out
our mass media culture needs to move beyond the sim experience and into new realms
i have to agree with many others about playing games that mimic our livesplease let us mimic with something more ground breaking
theres a platform game called disaster report which i did not like but found myself wishing i could put myself into the action after a disaster in one of my sim cities
sck was heading in that direction with the drive around town mode but it disapeared from the series all together before it could be improved and added to
too badthis game is ok i got it when it came out
it was fun when i played it then it got broring and i stoped plying it its ture its ture
overall this game is a good game i liked itthis game has held my attention for how much ever time ive played it till now but not without its problems
the graphics are astounding but not all the puzzles are logical
at times its so difficult to figure what is your next move when u dont have any given clues as to what is to be done next
like i got stuck after finishing the first three worlds with not an inkling as to what is to be done with the other three triangular roads sticking on to the circle network in the ship
of course u have the crystal to work on but to figure out what is to be done with it im sure even a person with an iq of  will have to consult a walkthroughfirst of all i had to consult a walkthrough for this game with quite a number of difficult puzzles and once u do that u cannot help but feel a sense of waste of money
the number puzzle in the pyramid in the maya world was way beyond my understanding
you can easily sail through most of the puzzles in this game which require only running to and forth from one place to another as these are the collect objects and place in order or wherever required type of puzzles  too tiring
though the graphics take care of this problem at times the thought creeps in that one can do with a less amount of such puzzles in the game
almost all the puzzles in ireland are in this category
i simply loved the bridge and spider puzzles in the maya world
they were very entertaining
the hell bit in china did nothing but drag the game furthernext  once i got through traveling through space in china i couldnt figure out how to get back to the ship
clicking on to the gong did nothing to the screen and then its not that i didnt try getting back to the ship by clicking on to other objects
to top it this is the second time through the game that ive faced the same problem
now im stuck halfway through the game with an in game problem
looks like i have no luck with this gamei very much enjoyed playing beyond atlantis ii compared to this game
the game was short but the puzzles were quite reasonable with the usual stunning graphics worlds   starsthis wasnt a very challenging game
i did have to use a walkthrough a few times but only because the graphics were a little too dark for me to see some items
the characters were very creepy almost disgusting
but overall for the price it was ok to play
i plan on purchasing the sequel last sanctuaryi have solved both dracual games nowi definately think resurrection is easier than the last sanctuaryi like sanctuary a little better but i thought the graphics in resurrection might get the edgei give sanctuary  stars and resurrection  starsi liked how certain parts of resurrection were also seen in sanctuary like the minethe cemeteryand the courtyard at draculas castlei have several computer games and will get morei have solved kings questmask of eternityboth dracula games and cameron filessecret at loch nessi give loch ness a  star and kings quest a  starthe control is hard and the story isokay
other than that it offers online gameplay and is a cool game to ownthis game is too damn hard
the graphics are awesome but the gameplay with a controller is impossible
it is impossible to target opponents with the control pad
thank god that unreal tournament has autotargetting
i want to love this game but i canti know im crying about it but unreal has smoother gameplay
maybe i just suck but this game is too hard without the mouse and keyboard optionalthough this game is visualy impressive it is not a madden  you have  difficulty levels which with most sports games easy provides absoluetly no challenge bump it up to medium and you can barely score a touchdown
ive never had a quarterback go an entire quarter without a reception receivers are wide open but they seem to always drop the ball this happens all the time with nflk
the computer cant seem to do any wrong in this game
the good side of this game your blockers actually block you can see your holes in the running gameif your looking for a fun realistic football simulation stick with madden  its got  skill levels and many other fun goodiesto be fare i have not played this on sega net but have heard good things as long as you have a fast server
before you buy this one rent it and check it out yourselffirst off this is the best basketball game out there but it could have been better
graphics good but i think it actually took a small step back when compared to last years
some of the players look a little cartoonish and the crowd what crowd was poorly done
animations are great the animation for a block shot is great with the ball flying into the stands which gives cause for a little smack talking
new dunks are crazy as well are the crossovers
the main menu is a joke
gradebgameplay pretty much the same as last year
the crossover has been redone which is a nice way to lose a defender but can sometimes be a little tricky if not done correctly
a little more variety would of been nice iverson crossover vs jdub crossover vs t hardaway crossovergradebextras online gameplay is a plus
of course you have to find an opponent with a good connection the lag affects game play significantly
the school yard parks are a nice addition to nbak as well as the olskool legends
franchise mode is available of course you cant have your created player in it  gradeabottom line good graphics good gameplay online play franchise mode
overall gradeb this game gets a   from me
it is good if you are looking for a basketball game its the best one out there but watch out for nba live on ps it just might give nbak a run for its moneygamer is out
game oni wanted to play this for so long
and the fact it was being done by hudson soft the same guys who did mario party   and the upcoming made me confident it would be good
now its here and im happy and disapointed
let me start with the good
first the graphics theyre very good
the game uses the celshaded thing for the characters like jet grind radio did this was a good idea
the levels are well rendered and colorful
second the controls
theyre pretty simple
not as simple as mario party but simple nevertheless
the minigames controls are tight and responsive and moving around the board is pretty easy
the minigames are lots of fun and the sounds are good with the voices of all the characters from sonic adventure
now the bad
first no online play
it was orignally going to be in the game but it was taken out
second the ai artifical intelligence
this is what almost destroys the game and is by far the biggest problem
when you pick a card to move only you can see your own cards the next player can only see his own cards and so on
when you play against the computer when they pick one of your cardsit happens a lotthey always pick the card they need ie
they are  spaces away from a precious stone and dont have a  you have a  they pick from you and they always get the  and this happens on every difficulty level even easy mode
strangely while the computer players seem psychic on the board in the minigames they are very dumb
plus the load times are a little longer then they should be
but all in all this is a fun game paticularly with  players
fun and new minigames help round out this package
while mario party  is better than this game this is a fun game
rent it before you buy to see for your self if its for youi got this game as part of the sonic bundle with the other sonic games and the dreamcast
boy im glad i didnt buy it separatelyfirst of all this game has great graphics
they are cartoony and are very good
but the gameplay is boring and confusing plus the minigames will leave you yawning
i am an avid sonic fan but this game was just so soperfect dark on the nintendo  was a nearly flawless shooter for the console
this game boy version comes out and ends up being a complete waste
why must rare create a game that makes it impossible to really sneak around and use stealth tactics when they claim that you must do so in order to survive
survival of this game is simply having ammo always low on that and trying to shoot people that are coming from an angle
the only saving grace of this game is the great use of sound and the features such as boss attack and such
make sure you know what you are getting before you pick up this titlethis is a decent game but the nintendo  version blows it completely out of the wateri mean i could really use a combat simulator to play when im stuck in the main game but still there are some great action scenesthe graphics and sound are terrible thoughi suggest you skip this one unless youre a die hard perfect dark fanyou should get super mario deluxe instead at least that is more funperfect dark was one of the few games on the nintendo  worth playing that wasnt designed for little kids and while the gameboy version doesnt hold a candle to its n cousin its still pretty decent
instead of a firstperson perspective like in the n version its played with a topdown version and missions and gameplay similar to metal gear solid
however there are some major glitches
targeting your enemy is complete hell and when you have to use stealth is even more hellish because you never know if the enemy can see or hear you
the good qualities are you can hook it up with another gameboy for some multiplayer action but most of the game seems unfinished and could have been done a lot better
overall its decent but far from perfectafter downloading the demo i was immediately hooked
the graphics sound and ambiance in general transported me into everything i could imagine space would be
just flying around and exploring kept my interest for a couple of hoursthe tutorials were easy and interesting toohoweverwhen i bought the actual game a immersed myself in real gameplay i got pounded time and time again  never made it past the rd level
the enemy in this game doesnt fool around and immediately swarms you with zillions of ships and relentless firepowermuch more than your resources can handle for more than a few minutesi dont have the attention span to slave over a strategy guide in order to simply survive in a game in which im supposed to be having funthis was a good game for its time but i think its showing its ageafter purchasing homeworld for a great price always wait until the quotgame of the yearquot goes on sale for a great deal i natually felt inclined to try cataclysm
what a mistakethe whole beautiful quotspace is a large lonely placequot premise has been completely manhandled with foolish commentary
the music and sound effects are trite
the ships are still huge but a lot of the quotimprovementsquot or other enhancements seem visual or unnecessarythe fact that quotbarking dog studiosquot never heard of them places their logo on the pause screen helps to solidfy the fact that sierra and relic seemingly dont want to touch this one
im hoping that homeworld  being developed by the relic team is a closer match to the awesome originalcataclysm is simply not the mindblowing experience that homeworld was a year ago or even today 
the core gameplay has been tampered with too much
granted cataclysm manages to improve many aspects of the first game but the sum of the parts do not add up to a complete wholechanges are made to the very basic way you can play the game and at first they seem exciting but after a few battles they  quickly become tedious
for example the technology tree now adds quotupgradesquot which means you must take time out of the fight to search the map for outdated ships and stop what they are doing to upgrade downright annoying
also there are many new technologies which must be micromanaged for them to work such unlink ships to fire missles then linking them again to attack once the missles run out
overall all this forces you to micromanage every battle you have instead of concentrating on the big picture
a fight in two seperate places usually means that youll lose in the place you cant watch overthe graphics engine has been improved for the better
the game can now handle more ships onscreen at the same time before slowing to a crawl
progress bars tell you the status of research or building without having to go into those respective screens
the almost useless quotfog of warquot has a single redeeming factor  it adds a sense of depth the sensors screen and you can more easily tell the relationship of different positions in  dimensions
too bad you cant use the old ships in homeworld with the cataclysm enginefinally the worst offense  the story in cataclysm is nowhere near as good as homeworld
the feeling of mystery and strangeness present in the first game is just not there in the second
the voice work is overacted and even the music is a step down
given that the singleplayer campaign was much harder and more frustrating the story barely motivated me to finish itif you loved homeworld and want some change to a comfortable game give cataclysm a try
just dont except lightning to strike a second timethis is a great space stratagy game with a few things wrong
the game gets old fast
the levels take to long to complete
i havent really played multiplayer but i found the resources to few
this is a great game if your looking for something different andor really boredas of last year relics homeworld was perhaps one of the most original real time strategy games to have come a long in a while
however despite winning pc gamers coveted game of the year honor homeworld didnt exactly break sales records how could it when it ran up against such master pieces of software engineering like who wants to be a millionaire
but it sold enough to generate a sequel but instead of coming out of relic it was produced instead by barking dog another canadian game house and released under sierras banner
though i suppose we should be glad sierra is releasing anything these days given the financial woes the company has endured over past year
so bad was it that they cancelled the babylon  space combat sim among others
so can barking dog catch and run with relics ballyes and no
homeworld cataclysm is essentially the same game as the original though they changed the menu graphics it is still basically the same just more colorful
in either single player or multiplayer you will control the same command ship basically a kiith somtaaw mining vessel that is used as your primary basegone is the awesome crescent shaped mothership it having been relegated to an orbital ship yard above hiigara
the mining vessel assumes the role of the mothership and can be modified by adding various research and manufacturing modules that enable the player to develop then build new ships weapons and upgrades
however the ships that are built are a far cry from the wonderful designs of the previous game replaced with uninspired vehicles that display a marked lack of creativity in their appearancein fact none of the original vessels are present except in cut scenes and possessed by other kiith
instead of the scout interceptor and attack bombers we now have the seeker recon fighter which resembles a plumbing fixture
and the acolyte heavy fighter that bears more than a passing resemblance to the old salvage corvette than anything else
the resource collector has been replaced by the bumpercar looking vehicle that is also a salvage vessel repair vessel and delivers the new infection vaccine to ward off the effects of the beasts borglike beam that it uses to take over your vessels
if fighters and noncombat craft are uninspired the capital ships are even worsegone is the ion frigate replaced with the blocky multibeam frigate and there arent any assault or support frigates to speak of
gone are well designed destroyer missile destroyer and heavy cruiser replaced instead with a horseshoeshaped dreadnaught and carrier
also gone are most of the little corvettes cloaking generator grav well generator etc
having said that however they have added some neat little touches like the leech which attaches itself to ships and damages them over time and the improved drone frigate
i really miss all of the original ships because they were so beautiful and i suppose i will get used to the new designs in timegame play is pretty much unchanged except individually most of the ships can do more such as the ability to link two fighters together or a holographic system that enables you to sneak into enemy fleets undetected
most of the key commands are thankfully unchanged
multiplayer games now happen over a much larger arena making them last longer while resources may seem more sparse asteroids contain more rus resource units and with the addition of resource rich crystals i found myself with    rus at the end of a skirmish vs cpu game
visually the game is still a treat
campaign missions follow the discovery and accidental release of a million year old technoorganic species dubbed the beast by your kiith forcing you to eject a third of your ship as it becomes infected
it is then up to you to hunt down and wipe it out before it spreads across the galaxy
the beast go around assimilating ships and crew and begins to spread like a massive virus unfortunately its already been done and theyre called the borgits the little things that count
if you remember those great nebula sequences from star trek ii or the clouded world of neptune in event horizon players will instantly see the inspiration for the presence of lighting flickering through gas clouds down into the swirling vortex of black hole
the delicate ripples of thunder only adds to the overall mood making games almost hypnotic
d lighting and effects are still topnotch but it was the nebulae effects that really caught my attention
if anything barking dog have improved the d navigation system making it much easier to move and position ships around the map i found myself missing my destination targets less in cataclysm than i did in homeworldthe manual is not nearly good as the original even though it details the fall of the taiidani empire the shock the  hibernating kushan suffered upon release from the cryotrays the problems encountered on resettling on their homeworld and the continuing problems with imperialist taiidani raids into the hiigaran sector of space
it lacks much of the wow factor the original manual contained with its brilliant and inspired history of the kharak the kushan and their kiith families
manual lay out isnt nearly as neat wasting space to fill more pages making it obvious the creators just didnt put all that much heart into it
is it fair to compare to the two games
of course it is because they are essentially the same game cataclysm just has an inferior story
the urgency generated by the creation of the beast just isnt there and doesnt require any where near the same emotional involvement of the player as was the case with homeworld
it just isnt that goodthis isnt a bad game
i tend to use the full range of stars for reviews so truly fantastic items get fives
threes dont mean the game isnt worth your time it just might not be your tastepositives  a well thought out spin on the classic monopoly game
all the elements are there
railroads properties color groups hotels and of course monopolieslooking for a competitive game that wont drain your whole afternoon
want to know exactly how long the game will last
this game can be played with definite limits
a plus for those who have time windows to play indifferences  the game isnt so much about controlling the whole gameboard in this case a city or driving others to bankruptcy
instead you play against others in a race to complete the goals of the scenario
this might be overall sales empire value or election to mayor
some scenarios do pick off players one at a time in a weakest link style fashion but this doesnt mean that player went bankrupt just that they were in last place in some fashion when voting was conducted in the town by its quotcitizensquotnegatives  marketing fluff  this isnt really a sim but a complex game
to call this the worlds first competitive sim isnt anywhere near the mark
rollercoaster tycoon is more of a traditional sim and simcity more so
this is definitely a souped up boardgame that is complex enough to require a computer to model it
second complaint this game has nothing to do with rollercoaster tycoon chris sawyer
the folks at deep red have made a great game but the association by the publisher quotbrought to you by the folks who brought youquot is plain irresponsible
thats like saying activision quotmakesquot quakedepth  the game seems to have a lot of different strategy
i have gone down several paths to win scenarios
in other words i dont feel like ive played the game out yet
the computer ai is challenging but doesnt seem to practice the same depth of strategy i do
you get the feeling you can manipulate it
online play may be a key here havent played online as of this writingoverall i find this game fun and challenging with enough variation to allow for subtle strategy changes mid game
some people are reporting lockups and freezes on the community boards but its unclear whether something is really wrong with the code itself or these are jsut isolated issues
i myself am not dropping a warning on this for game stabilityi am a computer game enthusist esspecially simulation game
i like roller coaster tycoon sim city the sims etc
and esspecially the older transport tycoon
and when i heard about this game it sounded awesome
a sim with a monopoly twist or if you like the other way around
i love games where i own my own business
so i got this gameso i booted it up and started the tutorial
the game had decent graphics but it was jerky
my computers not top of the line but it goes way beond all system requirements
the tutorial was well done
it made the game seem better than it really was
so i then started my own game and i understood the game but i had a question
why do they have the nerve to call it monopoly tycoon when it barely relates to monopoly
the only thing that does is the fact that city blocks are named and colored the same as the origonal monopoly game
but other than that it was completely differentthe game was still okay though
but after a total of  or  hours the game gets extremly boring because your just constantly doing the same thing over and over again
it just doesnt have enough customability and optionspros a good challange good tutorial fun for a little whilecons gets boring fast very repetative less than average quality graphics jerky even on fast systems barely relates to monopolyfinal verdict over priced messed up sim that says monopoly on it
get capitalism  instead for half the pricethis game is a lot of fun  initially
played on a monopolylike board its up to you to create a balance of shops and housing for your sim residents earning you the big bucks and wiping out the competition
there are a series of challenge levels that take you through various competitions from earning the most money by the year  to who can make  in sales first
the auction part is interesting as you try to outbid other computergenerated competitors to own the most property on the board without going bankrupt theres only one days leniency if your bankroll is in the red
however the game has no perceptual difference between the bronze silver and gold levels to warrant that designation
its like playing the same challenges through each of these accelerated levels
this game was a lot of fun though it occupied hours of enjoyment for me so its worth the money
enjoymonopoly tycoon is significantly different from the monopoly board game weve all played so even if you liked the original game you might not like this one
monopoly tycoon is a realtime strategy game where the object is to build up city blocks and satisfy the needs of the citys residents in order to win
the pace is fast and the computer opponents know the rules and play hard even on the easy difficulty levellet me point out that you can play games against the computer without playing a scenario
ive read reviews that say this is impossible but they are mistaken
the game allows you to host a multiplayer game with up to five computer opponents
you can also select various types of win conditions
even though you are hosting a multiplayer game if you want to play by yourself simply start the game without any human opponents
simple
but be warned when playing multiplayer you cannot pause the game nor speed up the clockthere are a lot of positives to this game
ive had no problems installing or playing the game and i only have a pentium iii mhz
the graphics are excellent  true d with easy camera controls wonderful lighting effects night and day cars and people that move about the streets and more
the environment really makes the game  it is well done and fun to look atunfortunately you dont spend much time looking at your creations
youre always on the lookout for new business opportunities which typically means identifying a need for a given block for example your citizens might want a grocery store and then building the appropriate store to service that need
repeat indefinitely
you rarely have time to sit back and appreciate what youve built
the game does have some timesaving features that become easy to use with practice
but ultimately i found myself wishing that i had some time to enjoy my citytheres some fun buried beneath the surface of this game but it wont appeal to the average gamer
unless you like economic warfare mixed with realtime strategy this game probably isnt for you
and it really doesnt bear much relation to monopoly
but its still an innovative game and its certainly fun to look at  when you feel you can spare the time just to looka little onenoteish if still addictive
the premise sort of smashes sim city with monopoly imagery which is kind of cool except the game unfolds in a linear scenariobased way you cant just go hogwild and start building a cityfinancial empire until youre broke against computer or online players ina freeform environment
you always have to do it in terms of scenarios with goals so you end up doing the same thing over and over again until you can beat the level youre on just so you can go to another level that makes you have to do something similar just in a bigger box
i cant believe nobody over at infogrames didnt think gee maybe somebody will want to just start from scratch and play against a bunch of players computer or otherwise and see who can break the other players
thats what we do with the board gamewhy wouldnt we want to do it herethe game engine is sound and the graphics are okay but there just isnt enough to do ghere outside of the box
hey infogrames think outside of the paradigemi just recently had a chance to try this game out and it wasnt that impressive
the graphics are ok but ive played a lot of other formula one games with much better graphics gameplay and features
i wouldnt buy  this its not really worth itairport tycoon is good but not the best for a couple of reasonsits good for graphics collection of types of buildings and sounds
bad things are the whole point of the game quotmanagementquot there are problems i have had
only  runways please most airports like hartsfield in atlanta have more than that
it is hard getting the rating of my airport up
after putting a successful airport for around  years on the game it still give me the    face
it is too complicated to raise it to a happy  face to me
it is a good game but things in the management portion of the game need to be improved
hire electronic arts or infogrames to do this gamei have a natural love for aviation and things realated to it because i have a dad who flies for fedex and the national air gaurd
i was very excited when i first saw it at the ebx store in meridian ms my dad flies for the gaurd there and we went with him as we sometimes do
i immeadiatly bought it expecting much more than i got
for one thing after about five years of succes and you have set up all the four and limited aaaarrrrghgh
runways there is nothing else to do with your airport accept make more money and expand a little bit in the front of your airport
the replay value is extreamly low
i can get a airport running pretty easy and when i do that is about it
the timming is really weird too
it is especially weird with timming with graphics
you can have the clock running at full speed and and a plane will land on average of one per two or three days
i guess it isnt really that bad but they could have made a whole lot better i would have even bought it if it had been thirty dollars anyway if it was as good as should havei still suggest it for the cheap pricei came across this game when i was a small child
after playing this game many times without completion i now reject this game at all costs
why
because i cant finish itthe furthest i got was level  with level  being the longest
i saved and i came back the next day to finish it
the save game was completely gone
i had to start from scratch
i mean im actually surprised everyone else are able to finish it
and no its not a problem with my memory card
it works fine with  out of my  ps games
the other one is pandemonium this takes a full  hours at my estimation for completion
if you save and carry on afterwards you have to start over
get the other spiderman games because im sure you can finish them
just rent this game if youre a fan of action games andor spiderman
its actually fun and really interesting to play but because of the bad save system im afraid i can only give it  starsi was really looking forward to the release of this game after playing the demo
all the elements are there wallcrawling webspinning swinging  from building to building and voiceovers from stan lee
the whole package  is amazing in its capture of the comic book look and feeland yet i  found myself getting bored with the game after playing it for about   hours
after going through a few of the missions beat up guys then fight  boss or try to complete some sort of platformmaze puzzle under time  pressure i realized that i had no incentive to go back and replay any of  the missions
exploring the buildings of the city is not very rewarding   its just one empty building or rooftop after another
theres no  scorekeeping so its not like you can go back and quotimprovequot  your performance on a missionultimately the game is fun to play and  really captures the feel of the comic but it wont keep you entertained  for much longer than the  days it takes to finish all the missionsmaby i just gotta try better to get into iti played to when you first met kid i should still go on  but im gonna wait into nighttime
if my view has changed i will gladly come back and change my review and applogize for this reviewbut at the momment im angry at the gamealright i bought me a brand new playstation system today cause my old one wouldnt run it right  i bought this game about a month ago never once opened the package and how badly i wanted to i didnt
i actully had to buy chrono trigger first and beat the game i played it on a emulator and i couldnt play the whole thing
but i had to
so i bought it for  dollars and i finally beat the game just a few days ago
what joy i finally opened it anyhow im depressed at it this is supossed to be a sequel to chrono trigger
now let me state that i would go through hell and back for chrono trigger on playstation in english so mainly that means if i was buying chrono trigger for the game id pay even as much as  im crazy
but i love chrono triggerthis game is ok so far but it just doesnt have the magical start that chrono trigger had
i think the new battle system is horrorble regardless of what anyone says i think the main charicter looks so god damn stupidwhy the hell couldnt they just remake chrono triggeri get the feeling of course that this was just a game they desided to say was the sequel to chrono trigger  i want the return of everyone
i want to contiue the story of chronoso far im just not impressedso this game regardless what anyone says i have no doubt it will still end the same in my opinion
it is lightyears away from the masterpiece chrono trigger was nd best rpg game ever madeand gave up
i cant give this a one or two star grade cause it certainly has quality
my three star grade was hoping this game would grab me and it never did
too many weird looking characters to enlist
the violin battle music i found irritating
the combat system itself didnt make much sense
neither did the story
i completed the first disk
it could be possible that i just didnt get it
maybe over my head or something but ive played enough turn based rpgs in my time
based on all the glowing reviews either i didnt get it or this game is overratedthis game had two huge flaws to be great
one was that the battle system just plain sucked
it really wasent enjoyible
two the story was way to confusing
if it wasnt for these  things it would have been a great gamei have little experience with ps rpgs but after completing ffix i decided to try chrono cross based on the rave reviews
chrono cross overall has shiny graphics and an interesting plot
you choose between a fun cast of characters and certain choices can lead you on certain paths
unfortunately this game is just ok it didnt seem to have the relevance and certainty that other ps rpgs have
i was committed to ffix but not to chrono cross
and thats just it the game is ok it never seemed to drive me to play and i have not yet completed it
for the most part it seems that people have enjoyed this game yet perspective there is just a plethora of other rpg games to dedicate your time to
cfirst of all i am a huge rpg fanespecially the squaresoft rpgs
maybe its just me but i just couldnt stand chrono cross
its okay for a while but it just gets so boring and youll never play it again
i think the plot is just stupid and the boss just isnt evil enoughlike i said maybe its just me
anywaythe graphics are great the sound is alright control is good but the gameplay dissapointed me
i just didnt like the battles
they just get so boringthe characterseh wellare just stupid
not all of them but most of themall in all i just didnt like this game
i am a huge rpg fan and i was really looking forward to this game but it just got so boring that i got rid of itchrono cross would have been a great game it had a unique system it was hard it had a good plot it had many side quests
for any one who played chrono trigger however this game does the idea of a sequal little justicechrono cross picks up  years after chrono trigger ends at a series of islands too small to use in chrono trigger but i have heard they are there
it has innumerable playable characters which makes the game interesting but has many issues which squaresoft should have seenfirst of all with the multitude of playable characters you lose plot
some of the characters of the story fit into it in many ways these are the main characters such as serge and kid
however there are many characters who just appear
starky van and others have no point in the story only a side quest which sticks to the story like an old wet bandagealso with that many characters they couldnt give them many techs so therefore another of squaresofts great innovations from chrono trigger was lost
some history in chrono trigger you have abilities called techs
you learn these as you gain ap gained like exp only slower
monsters who moved about on the screen would be targeted by techs in different ways
some techs would only hit one monster some would hit monsters in a certain radius from the character or from the target monster and some would hit all monsters
since the monsters were constantly moving this made placement of the characters and monsters essential to how techs were cast
also each character had three double techs with each other character and each combination of characters which included the main character had a triple tech
not so in chrono cross
i believe there were about  to  double and triple techs and three techs per character there were about  or more in chrono trigger
this meant that you would have to go through the game more than once possibly to discover who had them
sometimes these characters couldnt even be gotten together in one game so you may have to go through three times to find a certain move
also with all the side quests to get many of the items i recomend the strategy guide for this game alsothe games plot also had some gaps
there are certain places where you are expected to do something but either dont know which world to do it in or cant find where to do it
sometimes you will have a suggested opportunity to get new characters which you wont know about because it never suggests exploring certain places
there is one point where it is essential to find characters but it doesnt tell you they are available
another annoying plot point is that any character will suddenly join the party with the knowledge of every event that has occured in the story there is no explaination scene a fact which annoys me when a new character in the group starts talking in detail about an event which happened before they joined the groupthe game is fun and the new game  one of the few elements which was kept over from chrono trigger allows for great replayability
all in all though i was dissapointed
i expected a sequal true to the originals good points something not delivered upon to my dismaylet me say right off the back that i did not enjoy cc very much
the story is bordering on nonsense the pacing is poor the battle system is overly complex until you get the hang of it there are too many playable characters  some of whom are entirely superfluous  and it hardly lives up to being a sequel to chrono trigger
i had some fun with it at first and gave it a real chance but i got bored with it easilysome of the alternate endings are highly amusing and no doubt the game has some very good and creative ideas
it also has the benefit of great colouring
but i cant say i enjoyed the overall experience
i did complete it once then i couldnt even play it again for months after because i remembered how little i liked it
however picking it up again the boredom was lessened and i tried different paths that the game offered
and it was better
i no longer hated it  now its just okthe game wasnt for me and thats really all that can be said about iti bought the used one and i regret it because once you get top the second disc it stops working my playstation stops reading itso if you get it you can take your chances at buying the used one but if you dont want to take the chance get the new onebut that could just be my playstationits an ok buychrono trigger is my favorite game of all time
chrono cross is my least favorite game of all time
ill tell you whychrono cross didnt strike me as very fun or even interesting even though i played through it mainly because i loved the first game so much and i really wanted to try and at least figure out the connectionsure it had a couple tunes from the first game and for a playstation game the graphics were fantastic but other than a few names of characters from the first game thrown out there it had almost nothing to connect it to the first game
the story was confusing and bizarre the battle mode was completely altered so that all the good stuff no longer existed there were  plus character that were all basically the same in the way they fought and usually had no part in the botched up story
double and triple techs were pretty much replaced by a generic equiping magic system that was boringthe graphics were good thoughanyway i know it got good ratings and heard it even got a some kind of reward but to this day i cant figure out why
i didnt feel this game was much fun at all
i still love chrono trigger as my all time favorite game but i just dont get what they were thinking when they declaired something as different and horribly scripted as this to be related to the ground breaking chrono triggermaybe squaresoft now square enix can learn from its mistakes and just treat it like a spin off because i really would like to see something that looks and feels like the origanal chrono trigger if there is a next time when it comes to a sequelanyway if you have a playstation  and are think of getting this game because youve researched it a little and think you like the sound of its gameplay i would suggest getting or at least looking at suikoden  instead not suikoden  that one stunk
it actually has a lot of similar ideas when it comes to the battle mode but onlysuikoden  did it right
chrono cross is lower than low when compared to the gameplay of suikoden this game is a giant leap from the other game boy pokemon games
everything in red and blue are twice as better in this sequel
now you can get  badges and like twice as much pokemon as red and blue
this game is a little harder three times as long and more fun
you can do more things like breed pokemon travel from one region to another get on the boat as long as you want and lots of other stuffthe game plays almost as it should but the internal battery is dry time based events are screwed up
also my save file corrupted fairly early in the gamea mediocre purchasei bought this game used in hopes of bringing back some nostalgia since i was fairly young when the pokeboom was in effect back in  the game worked great sound was perfect graphics never aged a year but one thing that took away that experience was the save functionthe battery for the save function inside the cartridge ran out of power therefore it never let me save my gameif you are wanting to buy this game used make sure to buy a screwdriver to open gameboy cartridges  a watch battery to fix the issueboth gold and silver are good games on the whole however they are unable to link with any recent versions of the game and thus are a little dated for use
the glaring problem was the version i purchased did not save the game data
at all
certainly a good game on the whole it can lose its charm after a while and can be a little frustrating when you cant find certain things in the game
personally i recommend the newer versions of these games for all but the vintage gamerspokemon silver is the newest addition to the pokemon series
it has the same gameplay as the original and has over  more pokemon
this game would have gotten a higher rating if it was the only pokemon game to come out
unfortunately its similar to the other pokemon games making it repititous
if you arent a crazed pokemon fan then dont get it
if you are then i highly reccomend it as it will give justice to the pokemon phenomenonill start off with this i am not by any means a pokemon fan
i hate the show and believe that nearly all of those mutated things with their trainers and merchandise should there now you can see that i dont like this pokemon fad at all
i played red and blue and they were good yes they were actually good
they may stinkwhen it comes to tv programs and merchandise but this franchise is popular for a  good reason
these games are by far some of the best rpgs ever made for the game boy
the monsters may look like something some japanese artist cobbled together in his sleep and yes they have names that only yr olds care about pronouncing and yes the whole fad behind this is incredibly huge and anyone above age  has good reason to hate and fear it
these games are good and this is much better than the first two
the new monsters are very stupid but the games are pretty funeasy to play and to understand
as an rpg for kids is easy to guide the main character into battles and puzzles
no troubles playing the game but its lasting apeal does not last long and the songs get annoying
over all great game couldve been better
great for kidswell i am not really a fan of skatebording games lol i just got it cause it was a dreamcast game lol
the game is fun and alrightits worth gettinglet me start by saying after crazy taxi tony hawk  has the best video game sound track
another thing great about this is the create a park i found myself having more fun creating the park than playing the actual game
now about the actual game tony hawk  is very challenging
i have been gaming for a long time 
in all my experience i would have to say that tony hawk  is the hardest sports game to be  complete in
if you can not unlock the cool stuff you will just have to use cheats
the graphics by todays standard are medicore
i reccomend to rent it first before buying it
and if you are good enough you can skate as spiderman or just get him with cheats
this game is pretty fun
to say it is perfect is wrong
still fun thoughthe biggest hit of the summer was an improvement on the original in every department but alas unlike true classics goldeneye ff series the tony hawk games will soon be forgottenthe main reason for this is the inability to change the genre
eventually theyll run out of tricks to motion capture and jumping up and down will get boring until then have fun
my biggest problem with this game is that it seems like more of an add on pack than a sequel to the first gamenewcomers crave created a fantastic game engine with tony hawks  and it seems that they have been all but forgotten remember without their game engine their would be no tony hawks  the developers of th activision merely added some new skins and levels and released it under their nameunfortunately for all the fun ive had with this game it is still a perfect example of the downward spiral that the gaming world is in right now
each sequel is the same as the game before ie
final fantasy gran turismo tekken and now tony hawks not to mention the fifa serieseventually someone has to put their foot down and demand new game engines and until then new games will continue to be fun for about a week before you trade them in
i wont comment on the music in the game simply because it isnt the kind of music i listen towell im sure everyone has this game already so all i have to say is enjoy it oh yeah and mark my words when i say the next three sequels will be exactly the samei didnt love this game quite as much as the first one
first of all the soundtrack isnt as great
the first games soundtrack was very catchy and never got old
even though the tony hawk  has more songs it is more rap and light rock
i liked the pop and hard rock feel of the first game
second of all some of the challenges are almost impossible
who can expect you to beat the game when you have to score  in  minutes
in this game you do not truly earn new decks stats and levels you have to pay for them
i personally dont this feature
career mode overall is very weakthe one thing that wowed me however was the skate park editor
i like the idea that you can have almost complete freedom in creating your skatepark
the only thing i do not particularly like about this game is that there is a specific limit on number of ramps rails and risers but i guess it keeps you from making your park impossible to ride inoverall i guess this is an allright game but the fun factor of this game is not as great
the only thing i advise though is to rent this before you spend  or more on this gamei just got the game ignoring everyones talk about how poorly it runs on a voodoo chipset
and boy were they righti have a voodoo  and a p ghz and this game runs absolutely horrible when playing onlineso please stay away if you have a voodoo card of any kindnow that out of the way this game does have alot of promise hence the reason i gave it  starsif they get some more patches out that fix the slowness on the voodoo chipsets then i will mostly likely buy another copy since i did take my copy backthough i like this game it couldve been much better
the graphics arent good on some things like the explosions
they look cheesy
you blow up a turrett and all you see is pieces flying
the ground has no detail and the bushes are generic
one of the good things from the first to the second is that the machine gun hits a little better but only a little
the jet pack doesnt have enough energy especially when your plasma gun pulls from that
the connection isnt that great either as you seem to constantly get a slow connection and mind you i have a piii mhz  rdram meg video card and i have a cable modemsome of the other weapons are just stupid but there are some cool features
you can play different warrior classes
and i love the team play function though some people who play this have no clue about team play
they could have made this better on many levels but it look like they were trying to beat the rush of new games coming out like halflife blue shift return to castle wolfenstein amp the new duke nukem
they should have taken their time and made this better which is probably why sales havent been very good
its still a fun game but it coudlve been betteri play fps on a regular basis quake ureal and the like
tribes  is definatly a lot of fun
nice open maps the ability to fly
you have a jet pack to do this
you can even drive vehicles
now that is a good idea
it really makes the teamplay more fun
now onto that very subjet of teamplaytribes  was meant as a multiplayer experiance
but as with unreal tournament i once again find very little teamplay
no one seems to work as a team
there is no communication
it is because of this that i prefer quake  deathmatch
i can just blast away at whomever
you can play deathmatch in tribes  but the most popular game is capture the flag which is my least favorite game for the reason i mentioned above
no one works as a team
rabbit i think is the best game in tribes this game would have gotten five stars if all the gamers really did work as a team in ctf
this is what the game was designed forteamworkthe game has great weapons and unique tactics to winning beacuse of your jet pack ability
and it is fun
i just long for that ultimate teamplay game
this one isnt itthis is an excellent game
that said only if you have a very powerful computer
my mhz amd and geforce mx with a cable connection still the game is choppy with most of the graphic settings reduced or off
there are also a number of bugs expect to sit for a half hour waiting for the autoupdate feature to update your version
assuming that you make it in to the game you will find the gameplay to be mostly the same from t wich is very good
it remains a solid online team play fps
however some of the new features favor offence attacking more than defending
what new toys you get to defend your base with are mostly useless
the enemy team however is free to attack using new cloak packs
these make them invisable to players sensors and turrets
it is no fun to have to deal with a camper in your base with a cloak pack
while these are not really flaws if you are on a losing team just expect to lose more
this drains the quotgee this is coolquot feeling to quotgee why do i botherquotif you have a light speed connection and a cray  computer you might have a chance to get good if you play long enough that might turn it around to a perfectly enjoyable game iftribes  is a good immersive and solid game with a steep learning curve
those looking for a first person shooter will be somewhat disappointed
yes it is amazing to be able to wander around huge expanses of land and frag people but the difficulty in controlling your man as well as the  weapon selection will turn off fans of qiii and unreal tournament the latter being by the by the best ever in my opinion
also the first person mode stinks i realize tribes  was designed as an online game first but so was ut and that st person mode is greatdont buy this if your just going to play counterstrike
you can download it for cheapfree
if your buying this it means your connection is slow
if your connection is slow you are going to get slaughtered in multiplayer
even cable modems are slow
 or k modems are not going to stand a chance in the game
you need minimal dsl preferably dual cable lines or a t
if you dont have the connection to download it your not gonna survive in the gamethats just the connection speed
contrary to belief counterstrike cs is full of hackers
people use external programs to change things for them in the game
they have hacks that let them see where you are shoot through walls autoaim hacks that aim for the head
no flashbag or smoke hacks so special weapons that are meant to stunconfuse you have no effect
there are also no damage hacksscripts which make people invicible
you cannot kill them
these hacks also make it possible to fall  feet and take no damage
there are also weapons hacks
they can make a shotgun get a headshot at  meters aganist a full health fully armored opponent
its totally not cool
they can shoot through brick walls with berettas and get headshots
they can even use these hacks to get jumping headshots with sniper rifles
the online cs serveres are full of hackers
theres a new hack whicha allows players to run extremely fast essentially you can be in their spawn point in seconds on the game starting
meaning you if your new havent bought weapons are are almost totally defensless
theres not much you can do even the server moderators use hacks occasionallynow the other players
there are alot of players with no respect for anyone
they will kill you to get your weapon if your on the same team
theyll finish off the guy youve been stalking because they want a kill
theyll just shoot you if theyre feeling madangrysad
theres alot of uncool people outtherenew players beware there are alot of older  or more years of cs out there with fast connections and good vid cards
they will own you
there are even a few with ts gforce  ddr with  hacks and are better than  of the players without hacks
theyre extremely hard to get rid of if your new
they also memorize the maps and camping pointscampers alot of servers dont have scripts that stop campers they damage you until you move 
alot of players simply wait in camping spot and wait
its boring and a form of cheatingthe game is not realistic
you can get shot in the foot and still run at normal speed
you can shoot a awp sniper rifle while climbing a ladder
how i dont know
you can open doors and still shoulder rifles at the same time
you can fall  feet and still run
the game is far from realistic
there are barely any weather conditions and no gravitythe weapons are cool sorta realistic
the terran is okgraphics are good online with exception of hackerscheatersriggers is goodthe game is overall good but its been abused beyond belief
beware
not everyone is bad but theres enough of them to ruin the game for you
bewarefirst ill say that this is probably the most overrated game i have ever encountered
that doesnt say anything about the game just the hype people give it
overall id say its satisfactorypeople express their awe of its dedication to realism
this should annoying to people who actually know what it would be like to at least fire a gun
i dont consider people firing the ak from the hip on full automatic with half the accuracy you can in the game as realistic
especially when theyre running around
i dont consider people accurately sniping using a scope while running and jumping around as realistic
you have to look through the scope at an exact angle the fastest youd be able to move while using the scope would be a careful walk
these are just some of many distortions of reality you can find hin this gamefor some reason most cs players are very immature and annoying
their only concern appears to be their statistics and if that means camping while everyone has to wait  minutes for the round to end so be it
team work is usually nonexistant as well
team members are hardly more than players you just dont shootdont let the hostages and bomb sites fool you cs is basically a deathmatch game
mostly mindless killing heredespite all this cs can be an ok game
it can be fun when you accept the game for what it truely is
that and youll need a good server with the right kind of players
if  youre an average gamer the mindless killing will probably satisfy your desiresif youre a gamer looking for a more realistic game day of defeat will be a better betferrari f is a pretty difficult simulation to play let alone master
this game is true to its arcade roots tough yet probably one of the most realistic handling simulations out there
if you are looking for a game to quickly jump into and start competing for the championship right away then stay away from this game test drive lemans would be more to your liking
if you want a game with a very steep learning curve that will test your mettle then this is the game for you
the music does tend to get a bit monotonous so its a good thing you can shut it off
all in all not a bad game if you can get it at a discounti bought his game because i loved the original so much
the problem is that this isnt really a sequal as the original premise of a dinosaur hunter has been scrapped
too bad too because thats what made the game stand out from all the other shootemups
but at least theyve given the game an excellent design that has no problems standing alongside others in this genre
graphics are crisp and clean but kept dark to heighten the scare factor
in other words instead of fog like in the first turok things are kept in shadow here
ive noticed some stuttering in the cut scens but never durring the game itself
by the way the cut scenes are done very very well so much so that the characters lips seem to be in sync with the dialoguenote that there is definitely less blood and gore in this game than turok   im not complaining tough
i dont see the need for so much gore
but dont get me wrong the m rating is deserved as you can decapitate enemies and blood does fly when you shoot an enemy
also the overall feel of the game is very darkcreepy
this a good game to play on a dark night to get really spooked
a great feature is that you have a choice of playing as one of two characters at the beginning which that adds a bit of replay value to the title
youll be able to use different weapons and access different areas depending on which character you chooseone real problem i have with the game is that the onscreen gun site is so small and darkly colored that i have a really hard time seeing where it is in the heat of battle
using the auto target system doesnt seem to do much at all as even when there is only one enemy coming towards me the site wont target it
whats up with that
this little flaw makes the game much harder than it should be and causes a lot of frustration
thankfully there are many places to save game progressso my overall feeling is that this is a very solid game but one that lacks any real orginality or invention
i really miss the feeling and story of the original turok and would much rather see future sequals follow in its footsteps
hunting dionsaurs is too fun an idea to pass on so quickly
killing monsters from another dimension has been done enough
get this game if youre an avid fan of first person shooters but not if youre a fan of the original turokridge racer v is a disappointing sequel to the ridge racer series particularly after the many positive enhancements in ridge racer type  and rage raceras many other folks have pointed out rrv takes advantage of many of the hardware capabilities of the ps and the graphics are stunning
notable enhancements include rather convincing depthoffield defocusing during replays a total lack of popup or other noticable glitches that were common in the previous rr games on the ps very convincing surface reflections etc etc
the game must be seen to be believed graphicswisethe controls are decent
the force feedback isnt very strong but thats ok with me
the pressuresensitive buttons are interestingit took me a bit to get used to it but its definitely a major improvement over the old quotonoffquot accelerator and far better than trying to use the analog stick as an acceleratorim not that impressed with the cars
in particular i think the highend quotgripquot car makes a far better quotdriftquot car than the drift carthe drift cars range from quotthis is rather twichyquot to quotthis is almost undriveablequot
nope not realistic and im not expecting realistic but it harkens back to the original rr
its just surreal to see these realisticallyrendered cars behaving just like rr cars complete with the little rearend swivel when a collision occursthe gameplay is basically not there
while its true that the rr series has never been known for deep gameplay rrv is a solid step backwards to the original game format and its a mistakethe game features one track composed of various sections hooked together
while this is a traditional rr hallmark its no longer an acceptable one
it made sense in the arcades when rom space was limited now with gb of space available on a dvd theres no excuse not to add additional tracks
racing the same track quickly gets old and for some reason i found the similarities among tracks much more apparent in rrvthe gameplay consists of nothing more than quotrace these tracks oncequot
i managed to complete it on normal mode straight through without losing any races while im admittedly a longtime rr and racing sim fan thats still far too easy
the only quothardquot part was sitting through the tedious hour and a half of driving around the quotendurance racequot which seems to be more a test of how strong your thumb isthe sound effects are very good in particular the car sounds arent annoying which may not sound like much of a compliment but believe me it is
the music is mediocrenothing really stands out the music played while choosing a track and car to race is actually better than the majority of the soundtracks which is kinda scary
unfortunately the quotdj announcerquot is completely awful no doubt about itand whats worse he cant be shut off completely you can still barely hear him even when the announcer volume is turned all the way downthere is basically little if any replay value in the game
once youve mastered the tracks on any of the modes the exercise of completing them again on a more difficult mode seems rather futile
most of the extras that you win from completing races arent very interesting
whata set of almostuncontrollable cars
just what i always wanted
and im silly enough to replay rrr at times so weve definitely reached a new lowi really thought the rr series was heading in the right directions with rage racer and rrt but none of these enhancements money car upgrades the admittedly bad attempt at a quotplotquot in rrt rubbed off on rrv
its little more than ridge racer with improved graphics which was acceptable as a first ps game but a serious mistake nowi dont exactly regret buying it but given the lack of replayability ill quite probably end up selling it
its probably better headtohead but i wasnt looking for a hh game
and im definitely looking forward to gt or whatever its going to be calledwhen i received this game as a present from my parents i had hoped that the ps was going to add that extra bit of realism to the racing games that i had been looking for for so long
after playing the game for a short time it became apparent that no such luck had blessed the game
the steering of the game uses a sliding system where by the cars do not turn but instead do some type of strange skidding to make tight turns
this was not the only problem that i had with the game however
the game also sported absolutely no damage to cars from impact with objects or other cars and a strange physics reaction when two cars hit that causes them to change speed without changing direction
all in all the realism was nonexistentin the games defense this was an excellent example of the potential for the ps
in addition to the graphics ridge racer also offers a terrific sound track to go with the game
the audio functions as a radio broadcast of the race and supports the game rather than acting as backgroundin conclusion i would only recommend this game to people who already like racing games
this is probably the best one out there but for me im going to wait until something a bit more real hits the marketi had never played any of the other ridge racer games so when i bought this title for the ps i expected something like the ps gran turismo series
i was right in terms of graphics but its a disappointment otherwisethe tracks zoom by at an awesome rate of speed and the lighting effects are top notch
if i could rate the game on graphics alone id give it a  star ratinghowever the one aspect of the game that irritated me the most was the announcer
anyone familiar with the cultural differences between japan and america would understand why the radio dj in the game is horribly out of place
the voiceover is of a guy supposedly on the radio talking about the race and occasionally making a comment or critique
hell often quotthat was closequot when you narrowly miss hitting another carbut theres one moment early on when the announcer talks about how there are multiple racers racing in races all over ridge city hows that for alliteration
 and that we the radio listeners of ridge city should quotgive all of them our full supportquotour what
what americanbased game would have this kind of cheesy communal camraderie between its citizens
none
were the country of the hardedged and arrogant fingerflipping competitor
the trashtalking capital of the world is right here in the us baby
the japanese value their sense of community which is all well and good for them but it feels pollyannaish and cutesy in the states and it was quite irritating to meat any rate this is not a horrible game but i expected much more from it
it has rather mediocre gameplay which surprised me and its certainly not a title you should run out and buy
if you have a ps lucky lucky us huh
then id suggest that you wait until the next gran turismo game
it will make this game seem like its standing still by comparisonthe ideal jaggerific racing expierience
actualy its quite entertaining and should not be overlooked especialy by fans of the seriesmany people may not realize that a second snes castlevania was released after iv
dracula x is a port of the muchheralded japanexclusive akumajuo dracula x chi no rondo rondo of blood
dracula x is pretty rare and youll have to shell out around  bucks to aquire itremember the opening playable scene in symphony of the night where you battled dracula as richter belmont
well the game said that scene was from bloodlines sega genesis when it was really from dracula x  basically you play as chain whipwielding richter belmont whos girlfriend and her little sister have been kidnapped by dracula
naturally you have to journey through dracs castle and eventually kick his buttthe first thing that struck me was the fabulous music
seriously this is the best castlevania music ive heard since symphony of the night which is a must play btw
passwordmap theme opposing bloodlines bloody tears cemetary are all fantastic
i suggest you locate the mps online look up rondo of blood music but be sure to listen to the snes tracks theyre actually better than the originals imothe graphics are also gorgeous
much betterlooking than castlevania ivnow lets get to why this game sucksthe game is insanely short
there are only  levels and theyre shortthe same old enemies are everywhere and you get tired of them real quick
theres one level that has you climbing about  flights of stairs and fighting about  brutal spearwielding knights
youll be trying to fend off one and twoll hit you frrom the platform above
terrible levelrichter walks so damn slow
my god its literally like hes wearing links iron boots from ocarina of time
maybe its because the levels are so short konami wanted the game to feel longerrichters jumps tend to be far and floaty making jumping from tiny platform to tiny platform extremely trickyin some places you are assaulted by way too many pesky enemies causing certain death
there are times when you dont even have a chance of staying on that platformsome of the bosses are way too hard considering that the game is stingy with continues and youll frequently find yourself starting over at the beginning of the level no thanksthe levels are well kind of boring
theres no creativity
you walk slowly to the right slashing everything in your path climb slowly up some stairs walks slowly to the left walk slowly up more stairscompare these levels to the creativity of the levels in castlevania iv and symphony of the night and youll see what i mean
boringoverall not a terrible game but its not much fun to play although it is nice to look at and listen to
its not worth your  dollars
just go download the mps
i suggest you play sotn and the sinnfully underrated castlevania this entry in the longrunning and fantastic castlevania series was a mid s offering for the super nes
it came on the heels of one of the best in the series super cv  and was ported from japan from a much superior version of the same gameunfortunately the game fails as a followup to scv as well as a weak version of the japanese title
it suffers many setbacks from the game that came directly before it whip control is now much more basic and the levels are a lot more basic washed out and awkward the main character doesnt move the way wed expect and the character sprites are just differentsome of the great systemshowcasing effects from cv were left behind as well
scaling rotation and other fancy effects arent really displayed here
instead its a pretty straightforward sidescrolling actioner without many frillsall this would be fine if the gameplay was good but that too is just average
as mentioned gameplay just doesnt have the same castlevania feel as far as gravity speed and so on
and while the graphics are pretty it just isnt as fleshed out and impressive as most other castlevania offerings
the music itself is also only fair while theres a familiar tune here and there and it is done well it just isnt a new palate of instant soundtrack classics
add to this the fact that the game gets somewhat difficult and cheap in later levels and it amounts to a pretty shallow experiencecompared to other castlevanias especially the japanese game this was based on it fails to live up
castlevania has always been a choice franchise and this is one of its weakest offerings
as a standard action game its not bad the game definitely doesnt just flatout suck
but be warned its a very washed out experience if youre looking for the next great castlevania
pay the high price only if youre a collector because the game itself is average at besti had this game back in  when it was released in the us
its basically a censored version of rondo of bloodfor the snes
the snes version is ok it just doesnt have all the bells and whistles as the turbo graphix  hasthe graphics are good controls music and replayability are ok i even enjoy this game better than castlevaniaiv for the snes
if you have a psp or wii you can either buy casylevania dracula x for the psp or download rondoof blood on the wii vc
the wii version of rob is an import version with japanese text though at  wii pointsits a good deal
castlevania dracula x for the psp is the better deal here
you get the original rob with  bonusunlockable games for under  on amazon
by the way most of us dont know what a rondo isa rondo is a type of music for instruments in which the main tune at the beginning is repeated after each of theother tunes are used
that is a handful if you ask me
anyway id forget about the snes castlevania andbuy the psp version instead it completely blows away the snes version and its much cheaper as wellgranted the game is colorful and it has a great replay option but thats the best there is
controlling your cursor can get a bit complicated
the announcers voice is annoying
he reminds me of my biology teacher and i just want to snore
the rules are very simple which is good
i would say that this game makes for a great filler when youre bored and there is absolutely nothing else going on in the worldat first this game is great its cool it takes place in this cool world the action is fun
but after the first  hours the little bugs start to annoy u and the plain repitiveness is unbareblebugs ur allies and enemy ai is reallly bad
your allie will sometimes just stand there while being attacked and the enemys see u while ur try to hide behind somethingbasically if its not a wall u cant hide behind it
theres another huge bug if u play as rau in some levels there will be a latter suspended in midair and u cant get it downatleast i couldnti tryed and tryedthen replatyed the level as tati and it fell down after i killed the enemysand i didnt even see rau pull it down or anythingok the repitivenessu paint ur enemys with the right analog stick then beat them up with the button over their headu pull leversover and over and over and over againand u have an occasional boss fightbut myyyy goddddafter  hours im sick and tired of iti stopped playing at  hours and returned it to blockbustermaybe rent this game if u like hack nslashbut theres much better hack n slash games u can buyi picked this up for a grand total of about  so my expectations are probably set lower than some but i really enjoyed the game
i didnt play the first game mark of kri until later but i was able to pick up the story well enough
some review sites said it was confusing because it jumped around but i found it perfectly finebefore i get into reviewing there are two important things you need to know  all the cheat sites say that having amark of krisave on your memory card will unlock all the costumes
thats not entirely accurate
you must have a completed game save and then it only unlocks the remaining outfits that you cannot unlock by beating the arena challenges  be very careful completing the challenges
if you finish all the tasks but then die before you reach the save point do not save your game
there is a fatal glitch when unlocking content that will register all tasks as completed but wont unlock the associated content if you die before you save
youre only solution then is to delete your save file and start overi can respect the targeting control scheme that they settled on even if i dont particularly care for it
you use the right analog stick to paint targets on your enemies then use one of the four shape buttons on the controller to target them regardless of if they are on screen or not
its a nice idea but i found it seemed to mess with my successfully executing combos
it also limits the number of moves you have so theres no jump button
looking around corners is a royal pain though you do have an ability to possess the lamppost things and use them to sneak a peak at enemies
the stealth in the game was hit and miss but when it worked the stealth kills were pretty cool
really though you can mostly play the whole game just running right into the mess of bad guys and coming out on top
i never bothered to do much of anything with it until the very end of the gameyou have a total of four choices of characters though characters play in pairs
in past levels you can pick either the barbarian or the stringy guy
in current levels you can pick the barbarian or the chick
in either case one plays like a big warrior the other a faster assassin
personally i went with the faster warriors almost every time
you also have some choice of weapon you use and it matters where you use them
for example you can go with bigger slower weapons but you might get overrun by faster enemies
if you fight next to a wall your big long axe will bounce off walls or get stuck in wooden beams
it was nicely done overallthe real problem comes from all the glitches
i did get stuck in a wall once but was able to escape by attacking an enemy
the combo system is a train wreck with combos failing to register more often than they work
the ai on your partner is a little flaky at times and just sits there for no reason but is often really handy in the fights
i had numerous freezes when watching the movies
normally you could just skip the movies but theyre really the point to playing the game at all
it was annoying to have to finish a battle watch part of the movie see it freeze then restart and have to fight the battle again
the game provides a really good number of save points that you can use or even skip if you want the challenge but they would have done much better to let you save before you trigger the movieif youre looking for a really deep game you can play over and over you probably want to look elsewhere
if youre looking for something inexpensive that tells a good story and is enough fun to play through once then by all means give it a trycool light saber action and this time you can throw  it
nice
same game play as other two but this time its a bit more challenging
seems like anyway
go see the game play video and samples of each level on youtube at jbuggamer channeldont let the screen name fool you
im actually a guy
but getting that out of the way im really into music and i have an eyetoy so i got groove
its atmosphere is extremely feminine but this is a great game
there are only  songs to begin with and a grand total of  to unlock
yippie
however girls this is a very good party game and guys try it out
youll feel like a pussy but youll have fun doing it
overall this is a great rythm game but its in the minor leagues when compared to its awesome competitors like dance dance revolution and guitar herosly  band of thieves is the muchanticipated sequel to the blockbuster platformer sly cooper and the thievius raccoonus released in  that was around the same time that the other two franchise giants of ps platformers jak  daxter and ratchet  clank debuted
both of these games were phenomenal successes too though in different ways jak was about acrobatic puzzle solving and ratchet was all about blowing stuff up with a myriad of cool guns
sly was about stealth and speed attacking only when necessary with a much less forgiving hit point system one hit and youre outthe jak  daxter and the ratchet  clank teams both managed to put out a second game only a year after the first of each respective series was released and managed to make the games bigger better and more visually stunning
the guys at sucker punch took two years to get sly  out though and the rate of return turns out to be less than expected
the games much larger and longer fixing one of the few faults of the first one and instead of being based on traditional level structures it uses a mission system with occasional visits to small levels based around a large central area where most of the action takes place similar to grand theft auto iii or jak ii
you can also take multiple hits without dying though this was a necessary change because of the more difficult nature of the enemies
overall though game doesnt live up to the expectations of a toplevel platformerthe biggest problem i have with the game is the homogeneity of some of the levels
the game consists of  grand episodes each with its own location plot structure and set of missions
this episodical structure is a great opportunity for game designers to create a full diverse world see the ratchet  clank series for the ideal execution of this concept
in sly  for reasons i cant begin to understand episodes   and  are in only slightly varied locations ie
an indian palace near a jungle in  and an indian palace inside the jungle in 
this obviously let them reuse a lot of the resources like textures and enemies but this kind of frugality makes the game feel cheap
if i get  episodes i expect  distinct locales like the  completely distinct ones in the first sly game
i was rather tired of jungles by the end of episode  really tired of gothic prague by the end of episode  and completely sick of snowy tundra at the end of episode the second major flaw in the game are the earnedpurchased skills
only  or  of all the skills sly and his buddies can acquire are actually useful like the glider the rest are battle skills i just never used
i got them but they just kind of sat there
you certainly dont need any of them to fight any of the battles with only one or two rare exceptions
also you can only have  active and usable at a time meaning the impetus to never use the others is very strong
theres a few really nice moves from sly  that werent brought over too like the power roll
the makers of jak ii understood that a character in a sequel should be able to gain new moves while retaining the ones from the previous gamethe third and most major flaw borders on a sin theres no replayability
none
once you get  youre done
and you get  just by completing the missions not by doing any side quests or secret item collection
why in gods name they couldnt have spent an extra week or two putting in some simple but entertaining secondtimethrough features or at least some secondary goals like the timed runs in sly  is beyond me
you rent games with no replayability you dont buy themother more minor flaws involved things like the voice acting which were subpar on some of the secondary characters most notably carmelita fox
especially at the beginning of the game
also some of the controls were a bit irritating like slys penchant for perching on the edge of things even when you dont want him to
finally i was incredibly disappointed to get the coolest move in the game a hyperjump that makes him jump  times higher near the end of the last episode only to have it taken away immediately after that mission ended
you just lose it no explanation given and you never get it backdespite all these flaws theres a few things about this game that i really enjoyed
first of all was the retention of the cellshaded animation style used in the first game along the comicbook cut scenes and campy action sound effects
the second was the whole scope of the game while sly  was noticeably short sly  is a fullyfeatured game with large sprawling levels and numerous clever missions
getting to play murray the strong stupid hippo and bentley the weak superintelligent turtle separately from sly is a nice touch too though i really wish theyd have made it so that you could choose which character to use on some missions rather than forcing it on you all the timeso yeah a decent game with some pretty large flaws
in the end i just cant recommend buying this especially since ratchet  and jak  are also out now
my advice is rent this game and save your  for one of those other two gamesthis game is almost perfect
the graphics are cartoonish and great  and you feel like your playing a comic book 
also i liked how they combined arcade with action and stealth
the game really had a stealthy and thievie atmosphere to it  because you had to sneak around all the time so the guards wont notice you in each level  and you can also pickpocket them to get money  or get jewels from them so you can then sell the jewels for moneyyou can use the money to buy gadgets for your gang  
another thing that gives a thief atmosphere to the game are the missions
some missions really have the stealthy feel to them 
there is one mission were you have to bug your enemies office and then at your hq you can hear what he says
theres also another mission where you have to shoot a guy with sleep darts  then when his asleep you have to steal something from him 
and there are other missions like this  and they are very well done and fun 
there are also many fun minigames to play in 
and people who played the previous game will be glad to know that in this game you can control sly  but also bentley and murray your partners you can buy gadgets and upgrades for each of them with coins you earnas mentioned above
the game is also pretty long  it took me about  hours to finish it it has  levels and theyre really fun 
also the bosse sand characters are cool and funny 
but the only and i mean only thing i didnt like about his game is that you cant replay any missions after you finish them  unless you start the game over from the beginning
also there arent any unlockables for the game  so there isnt much replay value 
i found this a major diappointment
but the game was really great other then the fact that there isnt a big repaly value the first sly cooper was a simple celshaded stealth that was both easy and fun
this one the sequel is also celshaded stealth based game but this time the little levels are replaced with a few giant episodes with multiple missions within that episodesthere are three characters that can be controlled bentley a little turtle with bombs murray a hippo with punching power or the character youll primarily play as sly a racoon who can jump and pickpocket
there are eight episodes each one requires either one of the characters to move towards one place in the level in order for the mission to start
each mission usually consists of pickpocketting or sneaking around with sly smashing or carrying stuff with murray  or participating in a mini mission with bentley either a d flying shooter or a low tech move a triangle through an obstacle course thingy  both are pretty boringwhile the description is pretty basic the unfortunate thing is that that is pretty much it
for  hours you will constantly move traverse to one part of a level which is sometimes not trivial view a slideshow do a few of the things described above and repeat over and over again
the eight episodes are different looking in some aspects but its still the same thing over and over again
after a while i find myself screaming at the game sly can pickpocket i get it can i do something different
the good thing is that the game engine is fantastic
the jumping the sneaking the graphics the controls are all well done
if they shortened the game added some different types of missions and removed a lot of the repetitiveness it would be one of the greatest games ever
another great thing is that even though most of the missions are the same you rarely repeat parts of a mission because if you die or get caught you usually dont have to start the whole mission over again
it really cuts down on the frustration
also the game is really balanced in terms of difficulty
its never really hard at any one point and the later levels dont leave a bad taste in your mouth like other games where the make the final parts of the game nearly impossiblein terms of graphics its overall very well done
usually an episode consists of a small town castle or prison that is both cartoony in a good way yet very detailed
a lot of time and effort was done making the episodes
the only problem i had was that color scheme was pretty similar making it look monochromatic after a whilethe movies are decent though most of it was in slide shows format but you still get a lot without interrupting the actionall in all its quite a different game from the first one
in some aspects its much much better but overall it just wasnt as funproshuge levels require lots of exploringgood mixture of stealth and thieveryrequires little repeating of missionnever really stuck at any one placegood graphicsno guide requiredgood balanceconssame basic missions over and over againrequires traversing the same terrain over and over againjust plain annoying after a whilemini games are stupid and lametime to complete  hoursfrustration level lowmediumdifficultly level lowa pretty standard actionespionage game
i got this at one of gamestops infamous for sale on used games
i endedup selling the game pretty quickly online so i spent a few hours over  nights whipping thru it on easy as well
overall it was okay but not particularly great
i enjoyed the combat  the ai enemies were actually fairly good at evading my shots and the cut scenes were decent though the plot was contrived
i liked  the series back on the ps but havent played it in years
the price point seems excessive  should probably be around  for what youre getting  a limited port of a psp gamesonys long running actionespionage shooter series syphon filter made a stunning debut on the psp last year with syphon filter dark mirror which really showed off what sonys handheld was capable of
now dark mirror has been ported to the ps but sadly the fun action game from last year has been stripped down and much of what made the game so fun the first time around has been lost in translation
what really made the game so fun on the psp namely the online multiplayer content has been completely removed on the ps
this is just unacceptable to say the least considering that in itself was what made the game worth picking up the first time around
besides this noticable glaring flaw the rest of dark mirror isnt all bad despite the short length of the overall campaign
the game looks great on the ps the controls are tighter using the dual shock controler than on the psps face buttons and the action is highly enjoyable
though theres little reason to go back to dark mirror once you finish it theres still enough here to warrant a look at the very least but considering the best feature of the game has been removed and the game doesnt have a budget price syphon filter dark mirror is better off left on the shelfi must say this multitap is one of the worst buys their is out their
playstation doesnt have the multitap built in like xbox or other similar systems so you have to buy this in order to play multiplayer gamesspeaking of which how many are thier
have you noticed that their really are not that many multiplayer games out there
this multitap costs so much i am surprised many buy it for how many times they would actually use it
the fact is is that the consumer rate compared to the cost you are paying for the actual prodcut is much lower then the  you are spending
you have to consider how many times you are going to use the product before you start going out and buying it
i use this product has much as i can with my friends
party use is useless cause you know how parties go everyone goes crazy
for sports games it excellent but with large numbers of people over  people you will have to get another multitap anyways so you can fit at least  people onto the system
thats a  value
unless you all are really going to play it that much i would recommend not to buy this product
it sounds good but in order to buy it you must be able to use it
with certain amount of nonuse the sony playstation multitap causes disorder and turns defected which is hazardous to your playstation  instead of buying a mulitiap i would recommend a online adapter
same multiplayer value no wires and no smelly people sitting next to yathe multitap for psone also works for the ps and it is five dollars lessthis is a must have to have your friends join you in playing ps games but guess what
ps games need a different multitap
games like bomberman and crash team racing need the ps multitap to have multiplayer functionality
 i figure they would have made things totally backward compatible but they didnt
the ps adapter will plug into the ps but it is not suppose to work with ps games
you need to buy the  different multitaps if you intend on playing ps and ps multiplayer games on the ps systemmy friend got this game for christmasshe brought it over to my house and we had alot of fun with ityou could do a duetfreestyleand much morewe infact played for  hoursbut then when she kept on bringing it over it got more boringi mean choosing from only  songsyou play them really fasti love all of the songs but when you sing them to much you get incredibly boredi wanted to get the pop version but once i heared the songs on there i said i can get computer games instead of thisbut dont let this review get you down i may be the only one who thinks this waymy wife absolutely loves karaoke and singing in general
going to a bar singing karaoke and watching tipsy bar patrons attempt karaoke is a common event for my wife and i so naturally a karaoke game belongs in our house
the choices are somewhat limited its either karaoke revolution or singstar rocks
for our first karaoke game i went against the odds and purchased singstar rocks
part of me wishes that i would have picked karaoke revolution howeverbefore digging into the game mechanics lets see what you get
first i must say that the packaging is very attractive
you get two surprisingly good quality microphones with this game
typically you would expect cheap plasticy mics  but not here
the mics feel very solid and durable which was a nice surprise
also in the package is a usb adapter that allows you to plug both microphones into one usb port
the microphones for this game are proprietary so there is little chance that these mics will work with any other karaoke games that may come out
these mics will not work with karaoke revolution games
the other usb port is left open in case you have the eye toy
we dont have this peripheral at this time so little will be said about thisin its core singstar plays as followsyou pick a song or medley and sing it as you would if you were actually singing karaoke
the words to the song are displayed on the bottom of the screen
in realtime the words are highlighted much like a real karaoke machine
above the words are horizontal bars that show the target pitch you need to be at
as you sing your pitch is highlighted either above below or right on the target pitch
the more you can stay on the target pitch  the higher the score you will get
there are three difficulty levels  easy medium and hard
the main difference in the difficulty levels is how sensitive the game is to your pitch
so for example if your pitch slightly fluctuates then easy mode is much more forgiving then hard mode
this game will definitely train you to become a better singerthere are a total of  tracks in this game
both my wife and i believe that the song list could have been stronger but that will not affect this review because that is an opinion
below is a complete list of all of the tracksgwen stefani  coolfall out boy  dance dancethe killers  somebody told mecoldplay  speed of soundkt tunstall  black horse and the cherry treearetha franklin  respectelton john  rocket manmarvin gaye  i heard it through the grapevinethe cure  friday im in lovedj

you can form your own opinion about this track list though
we enjoy about  of these songsthe interface for this game is pretty slick
menus are easy to navigate
while singing the songs you get to watch the bands videos in the background
from what i read if you opt to use the eye toy then you get to watch yourself on screen with trippy visual effects i cant comment much on this though because we dont own the eye toywith a decent song list slick interface and good quality hardware it seems that this game is the perfect karaoke package but its just not
this game is definitely geared more towards multiplayer rather then single player which is a bit disappointing
of coarse games like this really shine in multiplayer modes but for the karaoke lovers like my wife it would have been nice to see more single player modes as we dont always have a group of karaoke singers at our housethe biggest disappointment for us is that there is absolutely no career like mode in this game
all  songs are available to you right off the bat so there is nothing to unlock
if you are playing in single player then you will spend most of your time simply singing the songs and achieving the highest score possible
although the game does keep track of your highest scores the scoring system doesnt really provide much insight into how well you really did
you may get a score of  on sweet home alabama but when youre viewing your highest scores what does that really mean
how good did you actually do on that song
did you nail  of the song or 
who knows
the single player mode feels more like a practice mode
even a very simple career mode would have really made this game betterwell enough griping about the single player mode
the multiplayer mode is where this game tends to shine the most
there are modes such as duet battle and a mode where you pass the mic
in duet you simply sing the song together and achieve the highest score possible
in battle mode you sing against each other and see who can achieve the highest score
pass the mic is probably the best mode for larger groups because you play in two teams up to  players per team so a total of  players and the teams battle against each other
in this mode you play a few minigames of sorts
one of them throws medleys at you to keep you guessing another is a test of who can reach  points the quickest and also there is another that forces you to stay in the good zone to keep playing
the variation pass the mic really keeps the game fresh and fun for all who enjoy singing karaoke
i do have one major complaint about multiplayer
players do not have their own difficulty levels
this is really too bad because good singers will beat the lesser skilled singers every time  hands down
for example my wife is actually quite the singer
she likes to play on hard mode because easy mode is just too simple for her skill level
lesser singers such as myself are forced to play hard mode or she is forced to play easy mode and she will beat me every time
there is absolutely no chance that i will defeat my wife in battle mode
it would have been much better if each player could set their difficultly level to provide some sort of handicap for the lesser skilled singers such as myselfone other complaint is that you cant adjust the volume of your mic
this is too bad because its quite hard to hear yourself through the game
the options are very limitedwith all the gripes aside this is a fun game especially when played in groups
the singleplayer mode was quite disappointing which hurt the overall score the most but if youre looking for a good karaoke game to play in groups then this is a decent choice but dont rule out your other optionsi have played the demo of this and i thought that it was not up to much having played settlers  and  which i thought were really good
they shouldnt have got rid of the old format
one thing to improve all of the game would be to make it a bit more realistic in the way that all the buildings were built as i ony can take about four pieces of wood to build a whole hosue
i think that they should bring back the style of settlers  which was a fantastic game without a doubt
i just liked the way that you had to make our own paths and get the little people to bring all your things from one end of the map to the other
i think that it has lost its original game format from the beginning which is a bad thing to loose
they should bring back the original format but revamp it but not as much as this didthis review is based solely on my experience with the singleplayer campaign of neverwinter nights
thus i cant comment on the online capacity of the game
i bought this game thinking that it was the successor of biowares excellent baldurs gate series which are among my alltime favorite video games
in a few ways it does improve upon these earlier masterpieces but in many more ways it proved to be an inferior gaming experience
unless you have the time and patience to explore this games online side dont bother getting it
there are many better computer roleplaying games out there eg morrowind baldurs gate diablo  etc
gameplay this is a ddstyle fantasy adventure that bioware has made a reputation for presenting well
you create a character at the beginning and build himher up with experience points during a  hour main quest
the basic idea is similar to other such games but the implementation here is unexciting
first this is a singlecharacter game in which you dont have a party
you can hire a mercenary but for the most part you are on your own
it makes for a rather uninteresting experience since your hired hand does not have much of a personality and specializes primarily in poor pathfinding and suicidal behavior while in combat
unlike great games by bioware such as baldurs gate and knights of the old republic you virtually have no control over your mercenary who is often a liabilityanother problem with the game is its structure
it is largely comprised of dungeon crawl after dungeon crawl after dungeon crawl
a few of the dungeons are well done and memorable and the game does pack in an awful lot of monsters
but the experience is rather claustrophobic insofar as your adventures are boxed into four chapters in which you simply explore a town its countryside and underground areas
unlike baldurs gate you cant revisit towns that were in previous chapters and there is really no reason to since they are rather generic in feelthe story itself is not a bad one but is full of cliches and rather predictable
you can take the noble goodguy route or be an outright villain but the main story will unfold in the same way
the main deficiency with the singleplayer campaign is the almost utter lack of connection that you feel with your character and the other npcs youll encounter
there is none of the banter bickering and cameraderie that made the characters so memorable in baldurs gate
here your mercenary has no stories to tell and even main characters like aribeth and aarin gend are just there to push the story aloneperhaps even more distressing is how unstable this game was on my computer
i had the  patch and it crashed to desktop about every  minutes
the current patch  is available at biowares website but its mb
if you have a dialup internet connection like me you know what that means hours of waiting to download
its really a shame that bioware has fallen into the pattern of other developers and has begun releasing games that still have technical issues i had similar crash problems with knights of the old republic but the baldurs gate games were models of stability
i hope that they avoid this with neverwinter nights graphics the game looks good but not great
graphics are largely an evolutionary improvement over baldurs gate
there are a few interesting changes such as more combat moves spell effects and so forth
you can zoom the camera in close to the action but things get blocky looking
those who do use the aurora toolset that comes with the game should have a lot to choose from though this game is not the best looking rpg availablesounds the music was good and set the atmosphere
voice acting was hitandmiss with the whiny main character aribeth being the worst offender
overall the sounds in the game served their purpose but didnt rescue the otherwise mediocre plot or excuse the lack of real character developmentreplayvalue since i dont play games online or have an interest in downloading mods by others neverwinter nights had a short shelflife for me
due to the hohum story bland characters and crashing i wont be rushing out to buy neverwinter nights   if you like dungeon crawling for dungeon crawlings sake and havent played some truly extraordinary games like morrowind or baldurs gate then this game might be worth a try be sure to get the latest patch
otherwise skip this one since it doesnt begin to measure up to the high standards previously set by biowarethis game does a good though not perfect job at implementing dd rd edition rules
the main storyline of the game is interesting
the game allows for multiplayer and also comes with a kit for modding
i quite liked the combat system in this gameone thing that i really didnt like about this game is that its very not open ended
theres one set way to do just about everything in this game
if you play an evil or chaotic character theres little chance to actually do things the way a character of that alignment should
this game is very strongly geared towards lawful or neutral good characters and it makes me wonder why they even allow you to be any other alignmenttheres very little room for character development which doesnt bother me in other styles of games but is something that an rpg like this really needs in my opinion
also there were parts of the game that really really dragged on way too muchhowever i did really like both of the expansions for this game though they too were very set in stone as far as how things are going to play outif i could think of a way to best describe neverwinter nights it would be diablo meets baldurs gate
the game is made by the same people that designed baldurs gate but its more of a mainstream hack and slash adventure than an epic rpg
dont get me wrong the ingame story is great but it just doesnt feel like a classic rpg
one reason for this might be because of the easytouse aurora toolset
if youve ever messed around with pc game editors this one will probably be the easiest custom content maker youll ever use
it was designed that way so that dd fans everywhere could quickly create their own adventures
the game even allows you to act as a dungeon master with your spiffy new adventures
unfortunately the official adventure included with neverwinter nights also uses the same toolset that was designed for joe schmoe and something probably gets lost in the process because each map uses the same same grid design and d structures
frankly most maps just feel the same and after all is said and done the offical campaign in nwn comes across as an average gaming experience
keep in mind too that while its very easy to place items and creatures with the toolset youll need a basic knowledge of programming to script actions in your module
if youre convinced that this game is for you check out the newer neverwinter nights gold which comes with the original game as well as the first expansion shadows of undrentide
you may even want to wait a little longer because the second and last expansion hordes of the underdark just came out and undoubtedly it will soon be packaged in a newer platinum edition
make sure you check the official bioware website so that you can download one of the many custom adventures designed by gamers
there is also a fairly large online community and many gamers have set up their own servers that are up and running  for online dd fun
i had a good time with neverwinter nights but not everyone may find the game as enjoyable especially if they dont like online play or the easytouse toolset
if you enjoy the feel and gameplay of nwn it has an extremely long lifespan because of the online community but many gamers dont find the game that appealing to begin withi havent played a lot of computer rpgs so this one would be my first onefor this reason i cant really compare it with anything elsei will say my first impression is that it started slow and then got really interesting as it went bythe story is a mix of fantasy and scifi wish it refreshingit starts out as you pick the class with many customizations in face skill and raceyou are a nobody but the king is desperate and needs a cure for a citywide plaguelet me just stay it takes a while before the story becomes interesting as you spend a good hrs or so in the citytrying to destroy different groups and find answers to why and how did this plague started
once the story leadsyou out to the city the meat of the story begins
theres a bigger picture to than just a plaguethere are some bugs with either the game
first off the video of the cinematics do not show but you do hear iti actually watched the brief clips on youtube
the game does crash at times and you need to save constantlythe camera can get in the way when you are trying to pick up things or your npc companion blocks your way and youneed to readjust in order to pick up and use items
you cannot equip your companion and you only get one
towards the end the enemy bosses get ridiculously hard
be prepared to be frustrated because you could be kill enemies left and right until you get to the boss and then forget it
youll need to use the stone of recall a lot of times to transport you to the temple and heal and then go back to face this tough enemy over and over again
you can kill everyone in a dungeon but this one particular enemy seems like it doesnt want to die
frustration sets inoverall its a pretty good game
it gets tedious as the design does seem to repeat
not a lot of variety
bland environments
there are some twists here and there so that was interesting
not bad but i wouldnt give it the title as a greatest rpg of all time
it was missing a lot and it could have been streamlined
felt long and thats not what i want in an rpg
i would recommend playing this if you have played rpg before but as your first you might be disappointed
pick something elseneverwinter nights has been praised by much of the gaming press in the time since its release yet i cant help but feel that they have somehow overlooked the games numerous and glaring flaws
im not claiming that nights isnt a fun combatoriented rpg with more brains than diablo and most of its ilk  but does it have problems
oh yeah it definitely doesfirst of all heres a list of what the game does well as one might expect from a dungeons  dragons product the character creation segment is deeply involving for diehard rpgers and it is worlds better than the heres your pick of classes and a name system that so many shallow rpgs employ these days
the graphics are immediately appealing to the eye  particularly where the player character models are concerned
swords shimmer in the light and armor flickers as you pass by flaring torches
the handdrawn artwork that accompanies this polygonal world is also topoftheline
this game is massively replayable assuming you dig the game in the first place
with all of the character options and quests the official single player campaign is quite massive although the storydriven part of the campaign is rather brief
on top of this the mod community is thriving and should produce material that is even better than what the folks at bioware have given us
the combat animations are the best ive ever seen in an rpg
you can actually see your character deflecting incoming blows and generally fighting for his or her life
your opponents do likewise
the best thing about neverwinter nights is that it generally allows the player to tackle problems in various ways
for example you can enter that dungeon through the main entrance sneak around the back or enter through the cellar in some cottage nearly a mile awayneverwinter nights certainly has its strengths  some of which should henceforth be required in a selfrespecting rpg
unfortunately the game has more than its share of faults that you may not have heard about at pc gamer or gamespot
here are some examples despite all of the things there are to do in and around the city of neverwinter the scenery is horrendously repetitive
sure the outdoor segments of the game really shine from a graphical standpoint most notably the druid encampment midway through the campaign but once you head indoors things get really bland
its not because the level design is poor but because the game suffers from repetitive textures
for example you begin the game in the academy at neverwinter which oddly enough resembles pretty much every other indoor locale the game has to offer
get used to it or youre not going to enjoy adventuring all that much
as i mentioned before the game sports some impressive visuals  but somehow despite this the enemy character models tend to look rather silly
orcs look like blocky rejects from warcraft and panthers legs disjoint as they run to catch up with you
needless to say the enemies probably wont impress much
the storyline is severely lacking in neverwinter nights
the game does include some memorable characters events and one particularly good surprise but apart from that its just another bring down the evil cult sort of scenario
note to all you gamemakers out there hold the evil cultist stuff
its tired
neverwinter nights also suffers from poor writing
conversations with npcs are most often boring and thats a shame since theres so bloody much conversing going on throughout the course of the game
on top of this the voice acting is generally bad
these people like to chew the heck out of that proverbial scenery
hahahaha
you are too late to stop me
yeah its like that
there are many portraits to choose from when youre setting up an alternate persona and yet the npcs wandering about in the game world can end up looking just like you
it was annoying in baldurs gate and its annoying now
npc portraits and pc portraits should be completely different from one another and i dont care how busy the artists get
buggy
i reached a point in the game where a bug prevented me from continuing and i had to restart the entire game
that is bad folksall in all my take on neverwinter nights is that its a good enjoyable adventure thats worth taking provided you know what to expect and dont subscribe to all that media hype floating around out there
dont be fooled  this game has its problems and it is completely undeserving of its  of  score in mags like pc gamer
fortunately solid gameplay keeps you coming back for more provided some of the bugs dont force you into early retirementfinal grade cneverwinter nights nwn is another creation by bioware which is the same company that brought life back to the dungeons and dragons series mainly through one of the alltime rpg series baldurs gate
nwn is the first test for biowares new playing engine which promises to deliver dungeons and dragons with better graphics and smoother online play
the game begins with four options one you can play the included campaign by yourself two you can join online and play the campaign with other gamers three you can create an online server and host a game as the dungeon master if you have a very fast connection and computer four you can use the tool set which allows you to create any kind of campaign you can think ofmy first warning about this game is that if you dont have a highspeed modem and a group of online friends to play with on a regular basis the multiplayer experience in nwn will not be much fun
nwn is a revolutionary game in that it makes an honest attempt to simulate the pen and paper dungeons  dragons product by allowing someone to host the game as a dungeon master and control the adventure
the dungeon master can change the creatures the players are facing create dialogue and alter other plot aspects to make the game more fun for online players
all pen and paper roleplaying games rely on one player to control the game and this is probably the best attempt at having a dungeon master control a pc rpg gameunfortunately i havent had much fun with it
the experiences one obtains from sitting at a table and watching a dungeon master articulate the adventure roll the dice and act out a story are not present with a pc game
most of the servers are password protected so the best way to enjoy nwn online is to already have a close group of friends that you can hook up with on a regular basis
the online experience even tries to simulate player vs player scenarios and bioware has already released an additional tournament of champions module that allows people to fight against each other
if your main intention is to player kill youll have more fun in an mmorpg
also note that many servers only allow people to control serverbased characters which means that you can only play characters stored on the servers hard drive and will have to join that same server to play the character againaction fans    stars  this is not a game for people that want action first
some rpgs such as diablo and dungeon siege are more hack and slash driven and draw in more action gamers than an rpg normally would
this game is not in the mold of diablo so if you are expecting those types of fastpacedcutdowneverythinginsightnoreadingrequireddungeoncrawlers you probably wont enjoy nwnstrategy fans    stars  the campaign included has some puzzle solving but nothing that cant be figured out quickly
probably one of the biggest appeals for strategy fans in previous bioware games was taken out the ability to micromanage your adventuring party
in past bioware dd games you could pause the game and pick individual commands for other party members in battle which made the games more fun and added a strategic angle to the game but sadly this option has been taken out of nwn
while you can still pause and change the commands of your character you can not do this with your henchmen anymore and even worse the game only allows you to hire one henchman instead of the five members that tagged along in previous bioware dd gamesadventurerpg fans   stars  this it the game that the pen and paper dd crowd has been waiting for
unfortunately the only way to enjoy that experience is with a great group of online buddies and fast connection
for those that purchase nwn to enjoy the great singleplayer experience that brought in so many fans to games such as baldurs gate and icewind dale you may be disappointed
bioware promised to pay as much attention to the singleplayer mode as it was to the multiplayer aspect but it looks like the singleplayer mode was neglected
hopefully bioware will add some changes that the singleplayer fans are asking forx factor  new bioware engine   stars  while the new playing engine definitely improves the graphics and adds several userfriendly options like more control over the journal and maps it seems like some of the previous perks of the old dd engine were changed for the worse
one example would be the new camera angle which doesnt go below  degrees making it almost impossible for you to see ahead in a dungeon without drawing back the camera until your character is a little spot on your monitorbugs    stars  very few bugs which bioware is known for
while some have complained of bugs and crashes i myself have only had one ingame freeze and i have played it for several days and too many hours to mention
there is also a very friendly updater in the game that allows you to easily patch it with any fixes that have been releasedreplay value   stars  while i havent enjoyed the campaign included in the game as much as previous bioware dd stories i feel the redeeming factor is that an easy tool set has been included in the game that allows anyone to design a campaign of their own
already some small campaigns have been released at various fan websites
comparing the editor to other games it is very easy to use and bioware has just released a great online tutorial for it
considering the vast imagination in a fan community that plays dd im sure there will be several great mods released in the future that promise to bring hours of enjoymentsimply stated i love this game
it is addictive challenging and after one week of playing it still not boring
wonderful except  nwn is like a nice sports car with a flakey ignition computer
when you get it running it is great but you dont know how long before the car will quit on youinstallation patching and getting it to otherwise run took nearly two days of frustration
for my installing was a simple matter getting it to run was another matter entirelyon my amd xp system with  mb of memory windows  it crashed the system intermittently requiring a hard reboot every time
the upgradepatch utility aborted during the update
i had to manually install the patch files
this didnt resolve the issue
i ended up updating my agp driver video drivers irq driver and soundblaster driversas a result my system no longer crashes
however nwn will crash and become cpubound after a few hoursif you are frustrated easily i would wait
it is irresponsible for biowareatari to release a product in this state
after five years this is the best they could dothis game contains two main parts a singlemultiplayer campaign and the toolset and dm toolsthe single player campaign is really just here for the sales and should be avoided by anyone expecting a rich immersive gameplay experience
the campaign is linear repetitive almost completely hack n slash there are perhaps two subquests in the entire game that dont have killing the boss as the main aim and plays much like diablo with rd ed add rules
you can play the same campaign through multiplayer online or on a lan as well which though making for a somewhat more immersive game cant hide the fact that the entire campaign feels rushed like a last minute addonthe toolset is graphically powerful quick and easy to use and though limited in the environments creatures etc
available this is something that will most certainly improve
the scripting tools the parts that create npc interactions etc are a different kettle of fish as you code them in what appears to be a derivative of the c programming language not the most user friendly approach especially when compared with the graphics tools
this disparity will no doubt encourage users to follow the same approach as bioware took with the sp campaign and create mods based around violent encounters as they are far easier to make
im sure in time the occasional mod will arise that will do justice to the designers original concept but they are likely to be swamped by badly written and unbalanced slash festsgraphically this game is on a par with others of its ilk but does tend to suffer from shudder even on high end systems
in this and in the woeful pathfinding the aurora engine differs little from biowares previous efforts though a special mention must be made of the appalling henchman ai yes it really is that badall in all this game is by far best played over a lan with an experienced dm
hey but if you had that set up you would be better of turning those computers off and playing pnp instead as then the only limit would be your imagination not your coding ability and the toolset
and for those of you looking to relive those heady days dd sessions of your youth you cant because those days were about more than just the gamea great game if you have loads of time on your hands
many rpgers like the complexities of this game like setting everything yourself including countless subdivisions of attributes and skills
i just find it annoying and taking time away from fighting monsters and searching for powerful weapons and magical items
if you are a true hardcore rpg fanatic you will love this game
if you like to play oldschool rpgs like the ultima and might and magic series neverwinter nights may be a little too overthetopthe game is put together very well i just could not stay interested in it since it had no st person view on iti was deciding whether or not to join a rpg club and i wound up playing this game
i played for the entire time
part of this was learning how to set up magic and all the other controls but once i figured most of the stuff i had fun with it anyway
what i liked about this was that i think it allowed for both mouse and cursor movement i think but i played this awhile ago which is good because i hate trying to click on a moving object
i also liked how the game progressed and even allowed for multiclassing
the other thing that took so long was that i wanted to get every little treasure and for the most part i managed itthere was one thing that wasnt correct though
a friend and i sat down one time and wrote a character sheet and it turned out that the druid learned one spell per day plus perhaps one or two extra for his wisdom but could use it up to three times per day at the start
nwn seemed to be designed backward in this respect as it said spells per day was different spells that the druid possessed but they were only useable one time per day
the sorceror seemed to have normal uses per day but i believe they were just starting out and this might account for it being normal rather than backwards as well
as we understood it spells per day actually meant just that the spells that were used per day whereas this spells known meant sepearate spells known
while the spells known might plausibly have given up to  different spells each with  uses spells per day though i doubt it i really dont think it was designed to have four different spells each with up to  individual uses
it seemed like it would make more sense to have it as a mana pool especially since wizards have unlimited arcana this would mean spells per day was actually  uses per day with any spell and in a mana pool once  spells were cast from that spell level it gets expended
rather than  spells and unlimited uses which is why i pretty sure it was backwardthere have been a lot of reviews posted for this game already and they all seem to share the same basic sentiments so close and yet so far some are very original some are just dry repeats of whats already been said
i will try to write this review in such a manner that it adds to the comments made instead of restating themi bought this game after checking out the box on the store shelf
that was the only exposure to it that i had at the time
i finished it
now im writing a reviewmany of the ideas packed into this game are original and creative giving a whole new dimension to the gaming experience
the nonlinear storyline is especially nice as it allows you to follow your mood instead of trudging down a straight path with no deviations
this does have some issues though due to the implementation
because you can take any path you choose to get where you need to go it is very easy to circumvent points in the storyline by stumbling into areas of the map via random exploring that you otherwise would not find until much later in the game
this can create some real confusion when you get a quest in your journal then talk to anthe npc and immediately the quest is solved
this is a little sloppy  it would have been better to either kill the quest or just solve it the moment it is assigned instead of making you go talk to another npcby wandering the map aimlessly i found places that were never mentioned otherwise but obviously had some significance based on what i found there
i have no idea what i missed or wherethe graphics are mediocre
worse though is the very awkward interface
the repetetive actions are a tedium that most players will want to avoid but alas it is unavoidable in many cases
even allowing some kind of visual macro facility would have been helpfulanother neat innovation is the intermingling of magic and technology
at one point my character attained some level of mastery in a magic discipline after which i was repeatedly kicked out of blacksmith shops
nice touch
there seems to be a little bit of an imbalance in favor of magic but using technology is still fun and allows the player to try something really interesting in an rpgsome players are upset about the level cap
dont be upset about it level  is high enough to finish the game quite easily
if you want to really go beyond that theres a patch out there that lets you reach level  and at that point youre simply wasting your time because youre too powerfulthe distribution of new experience points for the player to allocate is one way in which a player can directly manipulate the character
the system seems a bit strange and awkward giving one point at a time to allocate to one of dozens of options
you need to carefully consider how you allocate your pointsi must concur with one of the reviews i read  this game caters to the male chauvanist pig to the point of being a little offensive in a couple of areasinteraction with npcs usually involves selection of canned statements
these can directly impact the game
this is a good thing
these same statements can be issued over and over and over and over with no progress
this is a bad thingone interesting point is that the npcs can get mad at you and even leave your party when you tangle with a game character that the npcs seem to think is a good person  even when said good person attacks you first
not good
if you are the instigator thats one thing
but when youre the victim having your npcs go turncoat is unacceptableso why should you buy this game
well you should buy it if you are extremely patient with software that sports poor interfaces or if you have a lot of free time on your hands and the moneys burning a hole in your pocket or if you just want to try something very different in the rpg genre of gamesi give this game  stars for its innovations
its a shame that such creative ideas are so poorly implemented in arcanum
there are better rpg games out there dont bother with arcanum unless you want to experiment with the technology aspectsarcanum was a good time burner but it wasnt a game that i got into very much
graphically i felt like this was on par for maybe  or  years ago but for  standards it was lacking except for a few of the spells wich looked pretty hype
gameplay was what i felt too similar to diablo ii a lot of point click hack and slash
the plot was decent but i didnt like the whole quotyou are the onequot type story line its been played out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much
the interface could be tricky at times but it wasnt too difficult to figure out
i like the character development it was very good as far as that goes but thought they could have used a few character classes as well
all in all if you want to waste some time before neverwinter nights comes out and you have played every other top of the chart rpg then pick up arcanum i wouldnt say its a waste of moneythis is a game done by original authors of fallout one
it is put in s but imagine you got dwarves halflings and elves instead of humans only and magic alongside with guns electronic devices traps swords etcgood playing a magical character is greatgood having expert and maxed out persuasion skill gives you opportunity to solve things with wordsgood there is still enough points to become formidable melee fighter although strength is not your forte
swords are goodgood magics are very well thought out you can even charm enemy or revive and use him as your foot soldier  to wipe out stronger monsters than yourselfbad there are some skills which prove to be useless ask someone who played a game before which are theybad you never know what you will and will not need
and there is no place in inventory for all stuff so you have to use your friends to carrybad bugs
you tell someone to wait and cant pick him up after
you can pick him up and dont see pic of him on the left
save often
very bad to end game with major quest called altar quest you need some items that seem useless and you cant find them easily later in game
read about last quest items from faq  i am level  and played   hours to get bone dagger and cant find one
this quest is major but thanks goodness not mandatoryvery very bad you cant level up after level fifty
bad is your characters dont get xp from fights and they will be stuck at base level
so get charisma and low level chars npc early 
patch is said to fix thing about leveling up npc when you are at level impressions after beating the gamegreat story better than fallout 
i hope they make movie one dayi also liked the thing that dialogue can solve a lot if you have persuasion and charismamy mage was great and i beat main boss ok i knew strategy without much troubleadvicescant beat cursed paladins
run get cursed sword run to furnace throw use exit scrollbefore going to void get high level people like francis payne  gilberts security ogre and summon familiar if you cancant beat  giant knights near teleport in void
open door run downleft to get to teleport and teleport yourself to main boss
he is not so difficult if you know how read faq if you are stuckstatistics of my character yeah people will hate me butelf male  years level molotov knowledge usable to kill thieves at bridgemellee and persuasion expert progress bar one step from fullknowledge of black necromantic magic harm spell is important summoning conveyanceunlock is good and white necro magic important at the end to heal and revivest  cn  dx  be  in  wp  pe  ch impressions after playing half of the game again but this time as halfogre muscle manthis is definitely less humorous way to play game dialogues have not so many options and i would recommend that whatever you decide at beginning make intelligent character with persuasion and charisma high enough just to get max fun and laughs out of gamehaving played through arcanum i cant really say i either love or hate it
it was definitely one of those games that inspired both feelings at one time or another
since i think its about average in general i would recommend you wait until the price goes down to about  before getting itlets start with the good thingsyour character is endlessly customizable
this is immediately evident from the point system which has few restrictions
about the only thing you cant do is have magic and technology at once but otherwise you have a free hand
theres also a lot of trait and racespecific things to explore in the game which makes it fun to play againthe story and quests are very well done
theres a ton of things to do and you will actually have fun doing most of it
a lot of the quests are challenging but none are impossible especially if youre patient with them
you should find that you get at least double the experience from quests than you do from fighting which goes to show just how many there arethe setting is cool
who wouldnt want to see a place where magic and guns exist together
its definitely a unique world
i actually liked the graphics and i think that anyone who complains about them should a play fallout and b start focusing on the gameplay instead
this isnt baldurs gate
its not supposed to look gorgeousit plays like fallout for the most part
you really cant go wrong with a game that tries to emulate that one
in fact the only places where it does go wrong are where it deviates from that triedandtrue formula
i wish the designers had stuck to the programand now for the bad stuffload times are way too long
theyre way longer than baldurs gate  which i find odd considering the simple d graphics
the game often stops to load something dont ask me what during battles which is highly annoying
it also seems to load small areas one at a time making a walk through town a painthe game is buggy
im not going to complain too much about this since it can be remedied but the version it ships in is absolutely full of problems
youll find yourself saving pedantically to avert disaster at various crashes
some quests dont work right and your followers and minions act very stupid in battle
they are especially retarded when fighting around small doorsa lot of the features dont work well enough to be useful
among these are the real time combat very risky until youre of godly power your followers skills you cant tell a thief to go look ahead for traps the inventory youll notice this right off the bat and multiplay its simply lousythe game is too easy
im not sure if anyone else agrees but i found the whole thing to be a milk run
i suppose if you dont bother to do quests you might find it difficult but i found that battles actually got easier as the game progressed
i suggest that any veteran fallout player turn the difficulty up to hardest if you want a challengewhen all is said and done i think arcanum is a pretty decent game
the thing is it could have been so much better
it really is a pity they didnt streamline it a bit moreive been a veteran of fighting games for over  years now and every new incarnation of street fighter gets me excited even though the series is  older than dirt
when capcom finally learned how to count to three they  went in pretty much the right direction
the new characters were a long  time coming and though most of them arent very quotstreet  fighteresquequot theyre unique enough to keep the series interesting
fans of quotoldschoolquot fighting games will get a kick out of it as  well as those who enjoy the millionhit aerial combo madness of capcoms  quotvsquot series and just want to calm down for a bit
double impact  contains both the original street fighter iii and nd impact the only real  differences between the two being the backgrounds and a couple new  characters but youll probably want to go with nd impact anyway
if you  want an honest opinion though just wait until september and get third  strike
youll get all the same characters as nd impact plus four new  ones including chunli
and some more new features
the character  animation wont be as good for some reason they rushed third strike out in  development but its not bad enough for you to notice much
gameplay  graphics and music are all there from the arcade version on all counts
if youre a fight fan youll dig it but like i said unless youre a  complete street fighter nut and simply have to have them all id wait for  third strikesarges heros  is fun to play and the levels are exciting but there isnt enough of a challenge in this agme to last
there are new battlefields like a pinball table and in a toystore which is  the main appeal of the game
there is a  player mode which adds a bit more appeal but  i still fell that no game can beat the multiplayer on goldeneye
to sum this game up if you can get it cheap its worth buying as yopu wont feel that you have wasted loads of money when you complete it easykoudelka seems to be a survival horror game that has substituted battles from an rpg game into the action instead of quotreal timequot encounters
as a resident evil fan it was inevitable that i would have to try out this title and in a lot of ways i was not disappointed
first of all the graphics and cut scenes are superb
the decrepit abbey is beautifully recreated in the many prerendered backgrounds and the characters are believeable and interesting they fight with each other all the time and the resulting slanging matches are often very entertaining
as you explore the abbey a disturbing story unfolds with some truly unpleasant secrets being revealed especially in some of the written documents that appear along the way
however i have to say that the game is let down by the implementation of the rpg battle sequences
every now and then at random times there is a quotwooshquot and a swirl a la final fantasy and suddenly the three characters are in a huge arena confronting a monster or three
the battles are actually very basic you take a turn to either move position which actually scarcely impacts on the proceedings or cast a magic spell or attack physically
this is followed by the enemy doing likewise until one of you is defeated
its all incredibly slow and after a while the battles become tedious
its not helped by the fact that the battle music pleasant though it is is actually very nonthreatening and relaxing
however stick with things and there are some real challenges to be had beating a couple of very bizarre and difficult bosses beating the mighty gargoyle took me well over half an hour
 and a lot of the monster designs are pretty nightmarish so its not all bad news
there are also lots of weapons and items to try out which adds interest
dont worry about the fact that weapons break after use i never got close to running out of swords and hammers but the infuriating thing is that you inventory soon gets full and you find yourself having to discard items you have never even used
but i enjoyed myself enough to stick around with koudelka through to the end so think about picking a copy up as it seems to be going cheap everywhere now and enjoy the sights and sounds of this brave and mostly successful merging of styleskoudelka is very interesting its got a nice horror feel to it some elements of rpg thrown into the mix but overall its rather average
the graphics even during the time period it was released are great when used in prerendered backgrounds but the character design is quite badanother problem with the game is the movement and voice acting
its rather difficult controlling the youngster as you attempt to run up stairs using the exact stairclimbing from resident evil what a disappointment there and even though the actors did a relatively good job come on
they dont sound their supposed ages and they do not have accents from where they are supposed to be from
it sounds like konami didnt really feel up to it to make the game any betterits a nice entry into the survival horror field and i like the battle system alright
you fight across a chessboard in a strategic kind of way
i hate the bonus point distribution it would have been better if you got a point on each attribute and had the bonus points too to do whatever you wanted with them
the game slowpaces like hell too offering no real funif you can look past all these flaws youll find koudelka a bit engrossing and a little original
i like the ghost thing as well
dont mistake my words for something else im not saying its a bad game it just could have been much much betterwould have been a lot more fun had the multiplayer component workedthat being why i purchased it
the error was that it could not connect to westwood online although my internet connection was mbs and currently connected
having tried multiple times i eventually gave up mourning the loss of my wasted money
the game itself is aged but still fun it has the exact same difficulty level as the game boy version does
too hard
the graphics and sound are the only good parts of this gameif you really want to play with pikachu without wasting too much money i recommend that you go over to blockbuster video and rent it instead of buy it
why
because it costs way too much money
otherwise its a fair game to play
you just have to be less than  years of age to play or the game wont let you play it at alljust another pokemon game the game play is good but the voice thing does not work good
half and half
a other bad thing it gets boring
my finaly word is pokemon fan buy if not dont buyi bought this game and i thought it was going to be easy
so i played it for a while
somehow i found out about everything but the only thing that is confusing is which temple to go to or which dungeon do i go
thats why i rather buy the players guide to cheat on this game as soon as i can
that way i will understand the game
i did the same for ocarina of time because it was kind of confusing too
so whenever zelda comes out with a new game
buy the players guide so that you can cheat on the game
i hate to break the code but its worth winning the gameit been awile since i played this game back in  but now for fun and nostalgia i have gone back to playing my old n games and this one is one that defineatly deserves a review
this of course is the sequal to the fabulous gorgious ocarina of time and is the start of the new theme of zelda games nothing to do with predescor more japanese themed more childoriented thus starting the trend  towards the overlycolorful and strange two new game boy titles and the celshaded cartoony gamecube title yes im going to hate it too
this game starts out as link is searching for navi in some unchatred forest only to be robbed by a colorfully masked bandit who is very short and wears a huge multicolored mask with japanese designs on it
he steals links ocarina and horse and runs off with them with you chasing behind
links possestion of the ocarina and horse are the only things that have anything to do with ocarinaoftime other than its the exact same game with new placesquestsobjects
same character models same animations same songssfx same objects with only a small amount of new things to fit those categories although i really didnt hear any new sounds oh well on to the review
the gameplay and controls oooh big suprise here are the same as oot only now link is traversing through an ancient japaneurope type place that is much more technologicaly advanced than hyrule with neon lights large telescopes with blue starpatterend walls  postal services clock towers and carousel music that kills zombies
if you havnt noticed the way this game is overunned with cartoony japanese stuff theres something wrong with you just to let you know
oot completly emmersed you into its renesance english type city complete with a marketplace shrine and castle
majoras mask substitutes that with a freezing cold mountain next door to a flaming hot beach
ok so the world is very differnt and alot like a japanese cartoon so lets get to the gameplay
as i mentioned before the gameplay is excactly the same as oots same moves controls some new enimies mostly old enimies same old same old only now the dungeons half the amount of em as oot are more combat oriented than puzzle based
but this time there are more sidequests
using a special notebook to keep track of what side quests you completed and who you still need to run errands for you can embark on a jorney to save a farm from aliens trying to take its cows a little inocent and suprisingly alive girl heal her mutated mummified dad or stay awake while listing to grandmas storys seriously that really is a sub quest
the sound is nothing new with many birds chirping and flapping in the background and water trickling down streams thunder roaring up in the air while this may sound great you wont be impressed because you already have been impressed by oots sound
graphics smae as above
i dont know about you but i think this is still a good game but when you really think about it this game is overloaded with japanese and fantasy themes than the renesance medievil themes that oot was placed with wich i loved and honestly i just cant play this anymore and be excited about it im playing a japanese cartoon not an epic medievil knights tale filled with mysterous shrines beautiful villages adrenalinepounding boss fights no im saving a worthlessanyway land from a moon that has a face with yellow eyes and teeth anyway if you already own oot dont get this because its cheap if you dont own oot get oot but if oot is not even being selled used anymore and you know its not not anywhere get this game as a small subsituteafter recently beating twilight princess i decided to go back and try majoras mask on the wii virtual console
id never played it before but had fond memories of ocarina of time
for whatever reason though i just couldnt get into this game
it just doesnt seem to have aged well and i cant justify playing it especially when compared to all of the other games and activities i could be doing with my timesome of this isnt the games fault
after being spoiled by twilight princess graphics and the more intuitive game control of the wii this n game just feels clumsy and not aesthetically pleasing
admittedly the graphics were great for their time but look old now
the music and characters and scenery are all well done but just dont provide the epic scale of ocarina of time or twilight princesshowever my biggest problem with the game is the central game mechanism  the day time limit
you have  days not  actual days but  ingame days to complete a quest and then you have to reset the game and try again
thus any items you need must be acquired within that time
even though this is usually plenty of time it still feels rushed to me
i always like taking my time and exploring in games not rushing
in twilight princess one of my favorite things to do was ride hyrule fields on epona and kill goblins
the  days takes some of the fun out of the exploration for meoverall id really only recommend this to hardcore zelda fans
if you want to try a zelda game try twilight princess for the wii or better yet wait for skyward sword which should be out later this year or early nextpros new fairytatl song of time transformation powers all new masks cons  days to finish game evil moon lose some things while saving
must start game as a weak deku scrubi thought this game was very good but not as good as zeldaocarina of time
the graphics were much better and it had much more subquests than the original but it didnt have as good of a plot and wasnt challenging enough
for example in ocarina of time it had  levels three spiritual stones and  medallions  songs and tons of items
majoras mask only had  levels  remains of the bosses of those levels  songs and a less amount of items
the good thing about majoras mask though is the grpahics the ability to change to a human a deku scrub a goron or a zora and there were cool new options like the bombers notebook and how there is only three days to beat the game but it is annoying that you have to keep going back in time to save
i would totally recommend this game though because it is still good but it is more for beginners and is more kiddy
if you want a more mature challenging game though id recommend you buying ocarina of timeas with anything majoras mask has its good parts and bad parts
ill start with the bad firstfirst and foremost this cart is expensive
the game itself is  a higher end priced game but there is also an expansion pack required on top of that which can cost another  so you want to be sure you want it before you get it
mm
is also much more difficult than the previous ocarina of time
you should definitely plan on buying a players guide to go with itprobably the thing that stands out most once you get past the sheer cost is the new time limiting factor of game play
as the story goes you have three days to finish whatever sidequest or dungeon you are currently on before you have to play the song of time and start over again
when this happens only side quests and dungeons are saved
you lose everything else
this has a tendency to make the player feel rushed and may keep them from taking the time to make the most of this gamethe time limit does have an up side to it however
it forces the game to be extremely compartmentalized
you have a specific goal to reach in your time of playing you reach it save the game then when you come back to it you move on to a different goal
you always know what you want to get accomplished in each three day period
therefore game play is very goal oriented and you know when youre making progressthe graphics are much better than ocarina of time
the cinematics are amazing and often very humorous
link is also given a set of new abilities that are always fun getting a handle on
the last word is that this game is fun
ive found it very hard to put down its so addictive
if you can justify the cost it all boils down to a really good game especially if youre already a zelda fanusually these legend of zelda titles have something to do with zelda in the storyline
you only see her once during a flashback and thats it for her
its just like the gameboy games where the focus is completely on link with zelda not even being mentionedon the other hand this game is quite good
there are many many sidequests that link has to complete in order to get pieces of heart and other masks collecting as many masks as you can play an important aspect near the end of the game
even though there are only four dungeons in the game youll have to complete them all over again starttofinish at least twice
but once youve done it through the first time you become familiar enough with it and complete through the second time without much hassle
short game you say
absolutely not
even with the four temples along with sidequests that have to be completed youre looking at a game with  hours worth
yeah the storyline isnt really as vast as the ocarina of time and contains some music directly from that game but really the game did its purpose it was funhowever after completing one playthrough with this game im not sure if im willing to give it another playthroughall the humor is this game might be amusing if not for the gawdawful controls
even after conker sobers up he still acts like hes drunk  just like the developers
thanks a lot rare
you ruined my life
seriously though i dont remember the controls being this bad so maybe my controllers bustedthe game opens with a tribute to wendy carlos clockwork orange theme song and conker sitting in a throne about to explain how he became king of the land
it was a bad fur day
next thing you know conkers in a bar leaving a message on berris answering machine
berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink twopiece
the controlresponse starts out really bad because conker is drunk stupid
then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant
from there on things just seem to get weirder
rare wanted to make a fairy tale parody with sick humor and thats exactly what they didit is a wellcrafted fun game
i wish the graphics concentrated less on unrealistic rainbowlighting and character expressions and realistic fur and things like that and just attempted to make the graphics easier to discern with decent textures instead the screen is cut up and you have to squint sometimes even if you have perfect vision youll see a boatload of fuzz
the n really made this game look almost too fugly to play id say whats the point of d is it isnt clear whats ahead of you
multiplayer is the best in years though the screen gets smaller and soooooo fuzzysingleplayer is pretty fun as well
the movie nods are really dull its not unique or funny you just recognize it as from a movie you dont really get to play through a scene
for instance you just watch the opening of a clockwork orange only with conker as the star maybe that will make you laugh like crazy but not me
actually i hated most of the cinema scenes
some like the bee talking to conker are nice but the evil villain and his henchmen were so dry conker really isnt laughoutloud funny or even laughinside funnyplaying as a bat was much fun
it went out of its way to be immature though and that cheapened it
im sure conker  will be way better on xbox it has a lot of potential it needs to be more unique when it comes to gameplay but i like most banjo kazooie aspects
weve just seen this type of gameplay repeatedly made since  and its getting quite a bit old
an interesting plot would go far with this along with a better reason why hes moving through all these different worlds
the humor would come from being characterbased maybe there should be more than just conker starring in the next game
i would prefer if conker were to make fun of different videogames instead of films that has never really been done at all unlike movie parodies which are lame and done to death
conker  could make fun of rpgs in a vulgarviolent way 
 or cutesy kid games like banjo firstperson shooters like goldeneye any videogame stereotype or genre etc
etcthis first game is a rental id say
its about as engaging as a dumb movie
hopefully the sequel will be out quicklyok i picked this up  for price
 i do not think rare made the right decision when they put all the cussing and the gratuitous violence in this game
no matter how funny this made the game
i dont think that it was really all that fun and most of it is too easy but the parts that are hard are too hard to know what you are supposed to do next unless you have the guideit was just the same old stuff you always do in scavenger hunt type games but with grossouts galore
however i do now understand why rare decided not to make this a kids game
they thought that this would bring teenage money back to nintendo
however they ended up with a game that only appeals to guys that permanently have a thirteen year old brainconker is a good person
why is he in a rated m game
i see him in little kid stuff all the time oh well
i guess everyone goes bad after awhileim not sure why i purchased this game really
i guess i got suckered in by all the media hype surrounding the m rating and the socalled constant swearing
i dont know if its my age but when a game promises bad language why are some of the words still bleeped out i know why but that isnt the point here
it should have been an all or nothing dealso pushing aside the unusual choices in their words is the game really that good
well sort of
the controls are bordering on deplorable
conkers jumping ability as well as the action buttons are instantaneous
yet conkers attack has a very distinct lag
why
because the programmers for some bizarre reason chose to have conker go through an extensive animation sequence of drawing out his frying pan and then using it to whack whatever
and why cant i run and wa 
hit at the same time
the lag and quirky controls during some sequences could be forgiven if it wasnt for that idiot cameraobviously the programmers have never heard of jellycams or even a ghostcam
the camera is a crucial aspect to any good game
it doesnt matter how good the game play control story line of the game is
if the camera isnt up to par the game isnt up to par
there are numerous instances where the player is unable to see what is around conker because the camera is forced to obey the laws of the d world
never in any game should the camera be the direct cause of the death of any character
the angle of the camera makes it very difficult to gauge the distance between conker and numerous climbing ropes enemies dangerous blades platforms and several unmentionables
the camera controls do little to alleviate the camera problems since the camera cant pass through insignificant walls platforms and sometimes enemies
there were numerous times i couldnt see the next place conker was supposed to go to because i couldnt rotate the camera due to some idiot platform in the way
it saddens me that numerous gamers today have forgotten how a camera is supposed to behaveso pushing aside the crummy camera work quirky controls and bad language is there anything good at all about this game
well yes there is
this game suffers from what many modern day games suffer from a whole boatload of eye candy
aside from some unusual areas that could potentially cause blindness the in game graphics and animation are very slick given the limitations
hasnt anyone noticed
the box nor the instructions specify that the game requires the n memory expansion card that a previous rareware game required
since the game doesnt require one i sometimes wonder how much more the game could have been if it took full potential of the n
its fairly safe to say that i have never met a person that owns the n and doesnt have the quotoptionalquot mem card installed
and along with the quirky controls and slick graphics comes a story thats neitherthe story really doesnt make a whole lot of sense but then again neither does the fact that a drunk red squirrel is dating a a tailless gray squirrel which looks like her design was heavily influenced by lola and the baddest guy around looks a bit like a beefed up bagheera followed around by hyena henchmen
strange really
im not going to give away the story but the reasoning for the panther kings obsession with conker is certainly strangegiven all of that the game has numerous hurdles most experienced gamers like myself will breeze through this since weve played worse games than this
however beginner gamers will quickly become frustrated with the quirky control and terrible camera work
i suggest you pick up either of the banjo games or something similar
however if you want something thats a good title to show off and a title that could potentially pave the way for adult players pick this one up
i guarantee this title will be forgotten by the masses but will become a cult favorite by the few dedicated players in a few yearsthis game is really cute and has great humor but to be honest it does not have a whole lot going on
the thing i really did not like was that you could not save very often so you really had to devote a lot of time to playing at one sitting
i did like the way the game was drawn and the story
just not all i thought it would be
great for kidsthis game is okay for the younger generation and is quite boring after a couple of days
when the princess get kidnapped by bowser you gotta find her and you use all kinds of nintendo characters
this rpg is okay for little unexperienced gamers
if youre over  this game isnt for youthe first time i played tr chronicles for the ps i found it not that interesting
face it the rome levels are just not that exciting
i played and beat levels    then attempted  unfortunatly it took me  weeks to figure out how to beat level  it was way too hard
and thats just one of the many things that make tr chronicles fall short of being one of the best in the series
ok so theres alot of pros lara can now interact more with the characters around her instead of just shooting a weapon she can now bash people over the head with crowbars  stuff she can now open and search file cabinets for various items and she can kick down doors which she could do in tr last revelations but its still a cool move
in addition to new moves there are  massive adventures to be explored
but as with all pros there must be cons and unfortunatly the cons are major
my first complaint is puzzles particulary timedpuzzles being way too hard
i couldnt complete level  in rome colessium for  weeks because of the timedpuzzle in the middle of it i almost tried to give up on the game in all but after i beat the colessium i found it not so hard
in adventure  which takes place on a russian submarine personally my favorite adventure of the game lara must get onto the sub dive under the sea and collect the sphere of destiny i think thats what its called
not only is the storyline fun but you have alot of fun exploring the subs many levels and areas but once again a con came into play
i found the deep sea dive level incredibly difficult and it took me awhile to collect the sphere and escape back to the sub
adventure  takes place on a haunted island in ireland i really just didnt like this area not only is it boring but it is so dark its hard to see what your doing
finally adventure  which takes place in the vci headquarters is a partly fun adventure
but even with its cool graphical images of a hightech city its really difficult to complete the  levels involved espicially since you on have the hk weapon
on level  of vci i found it difficult to get the iris at the end but luckily i found a cheat not too much of a cheat where you can press the button sideflip left flip backwards then press and crawl like your crawling off a ledge you will go through the glass
it took me awhile but after that helpful little clue i completed level  of vci
level  of vci escape with the iris is incredibly difficult espicially since you have no weapons i found all the portions with the elevator shafts and that slide where you half to jump and swing off two poles very difficult i could barely complete this level
and the final level red alert it is almost impossible to complete shooting range  it took me  to  times to complete this one obstacle
pretty much i found tr chronicles a cool game graphics wise but gameplay is very difficult and sometimes annoying if you want an allout fun tr game that still has cool graphics check out tr or tr just remember this one is just a sample of what will be on tr the angel of darkness for the ps  pc coming soonthis pokemon pikachu  gs is fun and ive had it for years now but i can never get pikachu to be my friend
no matter how much watts i give him he still remains at calling me a meanie
i walk with it and was very active carrying it with me everywhere but i never accumlated enough watts
i tried to play the higher or lower game but i lose more than i win
is there anyone who can zap me a huge amount of watts or at least give me a clue to win pikachu over easily before spiderman became a box office smash and became everyones favorite hero activision changed the way super hero licensed video games would be by releasing the surprisingly great spiderman games for the ps n and dreamcast
eventually a gameboy color version would be released and while its nowhere near anything great it is surprisingly solid and challenging
the graphics are typical bit side scroller fare but are colorful and well animated
controls are simple and the enemies especially venom are very challenging
this game is also surprising in the fact that it is more solidly realized than any other bit or bit home console game that was nothing more than a repetitive beat em up with a comic license attached to it
all in all those who only have a gameboy color and are fans of the web head should give this a whirlto be able to make a rpg sounds real good but it can be a long hard process
to finally get your own rpg made and actually play it is very rewarding
this game lets you appreciate the great rpgs that are out there
you will never be able to make a rpg like that but you can use your creative talent to produce a game of your own
just dont buy a used game without the instruction manuals
i had a hard time to get very far with the instructions and i would have been totally lost without them
not having the manuals is like being blind you wont know where to start
or maybe im just a hopeless ignoramusgood game awesome graphics sound and simple controls
fails in replay valueafter looking at many screenshots and interviews with the creators i was actually really looking forward to the release of this game
everything about it looked so goodhowever it wasnt what i expected at all
this game iswella mess
but its an organized mess if that makes any sense at all
the graphics are welldone but overdone because the animation is rather choppy at times and can be rough on the eyesim not a big fan of the battle scenes either
they take a long time and can get very tedious
however this just shows that this is a game that requires strategy instead of just whacking the quotattackquot button over and over like in other gamesanother beef has to be the music
the music in this game is quite poorly composed whenever you heard it
while youre travelling on the world map you travel in complete silence with some nature sounds in the background
this takes a lot from the game and sort of gives it a creepy edge if staying up playing this at a late night
the different battle compositions are quite shabby and get very annoying to hear afterwardshowever im not entirely against this game
i quite like the storyline its very interesting and it certainly stands out from the other games up to this point
the characters do seem to have their own personality and that affects how they react in battle
for example if a character fights especially well during night hours then they may have trouble fighting during the day
others may fight well during the rain opposed to when it is clear etc
so a really neat insert into the gamethis game didnt seem to be designed properly at all
the designers spent too much time on graphics and cutscenes that they didnt spend enough time on other elements
according to other reviews the game crashed a few times and a save file continued to become corrupted
the expantion pak exclusive high resolution option only makes the animation that much more choppier and even harder on the eyes than normal resolutioni think they should have spent much more time cleaning up the animation adding and enhancing more music tested it thoroughly that kind of thing
that way it allows for much smother transitions and if the battle music was a little more upbeat fighting the battles could become a lot more funanother note is that the replay vaule wont be very high
with all of the wandering and exploring of towns and the world map one could only be glad that the long trip of aidyn chronicles is finally over and would be rather hesitant to start another game right awayso really this game was just a great game that managed to get tangled in a disastrous mess
weve waited so long to see something that just wont be accepted
if thq had waited another few months or so this game could have been on the gamecube
that way it wouldnt seem so choppy and that means they would have had more time to enhance finetune and testrent this game first like i did
dont buy it right away unless youre absolutely positive you will like the game
because of its inconsistency i give this game three out of five starsthis game is a great multiplayer game
the graphics are ok but the wrestlers look like they just fell off a five story buildingthis game only has two modes
if you are not good at it this game gets extremely frustrating
the stadium is always the same and the controls stink
you can not use the analog thumb padif this game wasnt such a great multiplayer game i propably would have given it only two starsthis is not a game i can reccomend but if you have siblings that like multiplayer wrestling games maybe you should pick it up and try it outi hope that this review was helpful to youthis game is much better than the abhorid port of attitude it still cant compare to the awesome ps and n thq titlesquotsummonerquot is your average run of the mill rpg that will please some and totally put off others
seasoned rpg fans might want to pass on this title since it pales when compared to any quotfinal fantasyquot game or even other ps rpgs like quoticoquot and quotdrakan the ancients gatequot
for people new to rpgs this is a pretty good startthe story is nicely put together and fairly easy to follow
it has a few original elements to it giving this game some credability
the combat system takes some getting used to but becomes sencond nature after a while
magic plays the biggest rols in quotsummonerquot aand you have a wide variety of spells to choose from
as you progress you learn more skills gain more experience and obtain better weapons
there are times when this game reminds me of quotsuikodenquot more in style than setupin the visual department this is a pretty well done game
the animation is nice and fluid and the textures and colors make quotsummonerquot a visually pleasing experience
there are a few glitches which might be annoying to some maybe not even noticed by others
the camera is a bit dodgy at times and i often found myself struggling to get a good angle
the music is average nothing memorable but not unappealingmy beef with this game is the lack of a good ingame map
i have gotten lost so many times and have struggled to get back on track
this adds time to the game but not time you spend enjoying the game
this is a flaw that might make you give up on quotsummonerquot
overall this is nothing special
but it is enjoyable enough for me to stay interested until the end so i guess thats saying somethingvolitions summoner is a game in which it is easy to get lostlost in the unnecessarily huge locations lost in the insane amount of side quests lost in the insanely slow pace or lost in in the insanely high amount of text and story detail that means little or nothing or in my case all of them
those teamed up with somewhat shallow characters a horrible frame rate and a small scene count make summoner one that any and all impatient rpgamers should probably steer clear ofhowever during the last  hours of a  hour quest mind you the game while somehow getting slower got much more interesting and increased in intensity very sharply
also later on the game made sense finally and from what i hear summoner ii plays off of this games plot beautifully and also from what i hear summoner ii is so good that its actually worth playing through this one just so that you can understand it betterthe graphics are totally a mixed bag and actually a contradiction
you see if you play this game with the camera zoomed in all the way not only will the spell effects mainly the projectile and summon effects be much more impressive but also the textures when viewed from up close actually surpass any textures ive seen on even the xbox all except for the cubes resident evil titles
however in order to win any battles or find your way through countless obstructions youll have to back the camera up all the way turning the textures to practically single colors and turning the fps to about fps or sothe sound effects are not only mostly recycled from psx rpg foley discs but also during the whole second half of the game the sound effects are almost cut out and you hear one every few seconds and thats while in intense combat
its as if the programmers werent sure if the polygons textures music and sound effects were too much for the new ps system so they reduced the sound effect quantities to make sure itd make it
for whatever reason they did it that way
the voice acting is also a mixed bag ranging from horribly dead to perfect to horribly overdonethe music on the other hand while commonly really just quotambientquot music is sometimes quite grandi can think of three examples the lanelle sewers which is a sort of epic creepy theme one of the forest themes which sounds much like the lord of the rings themes and the world theme which is simply incredible
overall every time you hear music its either good or better but commonly the quotmusicquot is just a sort of beat or random notesthe gameplay is cool enough with an original battle system based off the chain attack idea only where you can keep the chains neverending until you win if youre good enough but thats nearly impossible and the interface is nice and clean with several types of equippable armor peices a great special skillmagic system and a great level up system except that each character will probably only level up about once every  min of action and with all the nonaction parts of the game that could stretch out to less than once an hourall in all summoner is something thats rewarding if stuck out to the end and has certain merit but also has severe weaknesses
lets break it down for the endplot movementrevelations  storyline  characters  battle system  interface  music  sound effects  dialogue  graphics  distantclose voice acting  replay although the story is very nicely done and all the game just gets boring about halfway through
at least for me it did
the quasi realtime battle system isnt that fun
its basically realtime turn based so even though you can still move around the enemy and all that you basically just tell your character to go kill that or cast this on him and thats about itfirst of all i was expecting more for a ps game in terms of graphicsthe good the characters do have some interesting quotfeel amp lookquot
the environment is usually nice with rendered images
the storyline is okay
you can have multiple sub quest leading you into a nonsomuch linear gamethe bad not much fmvs a still picture that moves is not fmv for me
the d rendering has major problems rendering buildings that are far away in that regards you see the background picture and then the far buildings start to pop in looks really badbottom line it does have a good storyline so far and the fact of have multiple sub quests is cool as well
it will attract some gamers until a real complete adventure game comes in on the psi really enjoyed this game
the plot took many twists and turns and really helped keep me in the story
there were lots of quests that will keep you busy for sure
the one disappointing thing was the ending movie
it left me saying quotthats it
quot and feeling a little unsatisfied
as rpg games go this is one of the better onesexcept of coarse you can unlock secret playersshaq mjackson bill and hilliary clinton through winning in arcade mode the game play is the same as the first one the championship mode is very differnt altough i would have prefered that you could be able to defend your title after winning it
a minus is that the credits play after you win in championship and arcade mods they are extremely long
this gets cumbersome when your tring to unlock secret playersover all its an ok game kinda funny and cute if you have some one to play it with i believ youll get more satisfaction from itwell its been two years since i bought this game and i finally got around to playing it
threads of fate was one of squaresofts trial games from the summer of square in   i say its a trial game because square rarely brings their rpg talents into the realtime action adventure arena
for fans of brave fencer musashi this game is a must buy
it showcases a similar fighting system and one of the playable characters rueis able to take on the traits of his recently defeated enemies
whereas the other character mint uses her skill in magic to fight the bad guysunfortunately there isnt much to this game
the challenge is very low and the only parts that can be considered hard fall into the quottime your jumps or elsequot annoyance category
my first playthrough only took me  hours and in that time i was able to find all the hidden items
however the games saving grace is its humor and that you are able to play through the game using the  different characterswhile not one of squares best games i recommend this to someone looking for a quick little diversion or even to the more amateur gamers out theresquaresoft used to be considered the bomb games to own
if you didnt own a few square games you didnt have a library
i question why square let  this game even get past the design stage
the packaging is at least honest  this time
the backgrounds are impressive not jaw dropping though
with  only minor quotshiftingquot and cracking but this is a limitation with  the ancient psx hardware and not so much a fault with the game
world size  is somewhat lacking
towns tend be extraordinarily small especially for  this type of game
as well as the exploration and battle areas
after  playing games with comparatively huge worlds spryo  for psx or zelda for  the n this game seems to sorely lack in areas to explore
no amount of  beautiful backgrounds can save a game that has a smaller virtual world than  my own living room
exploring is severely limited
make sure that you pick  up everything before moving on to the next screen
forgetting something  means you wont be able to go back and pick it up
this game has a huge  potential to blow other rpgs out of the water and this is one of a number  of faults that will prevent it from becoming a classicthe battling  system is a saving feature
the fights are truly quotlivequot not done  in special areas like legend of mana
with a quick menu design changes  are done quickly without ruining the rhythm of the battle
the menu rings  really should have been used through out all the menus to maintain  consistency
hopefully the next big square game will have better  consistency
alignment with the weapons and enemies is an issue and the  quotautofocusquot feels like it was thrown in at the last minute
but  its a last minute thing that helps a great deal
too bad the battle areas  feel like im fighting in a hallway
oh well i have no real complaints  about the battle controls other than it feels unpolishedthe choice of  having two characters to chose from with wildly different play styles is a  big plus
with plenty of story to lead the player through the adventure  buying this game wont leave you too bored to play through again with the  other character
unfortunately this leads me to my last gripe
there seems  to be a horrible trend among rpg games that they are all story and no game  play
the storyplay balance is rotten to say the least
youll spend most  of your time mashing the x button just to get through the tons of  dialogue instead of actually battling creatures
what battles there are  have nicely balanced baddiesthis game is wonderful game for the younger  playstationn generation
many younger players will not know what great  rpgs were like
for the older players anybody from the snesgenesistg  generation or before
 it would be best to save your money for something  else unless youre a diehard rpger
the game lacks many of the elements  that made past rpgs shine like gems
to compare this gem is uncut and  unpolished
six more months of planning would have made this game the  greatest diamond in the us too bad square better planning next timethis game was quotall rightquot
i think i bought it because squaresoft made itanyway the game is really short and very easy
its got some replay value as you can play the game a second time as the other characterthe worst thing about this game was the music
it was driving me insane after the first hour or soi found this game a little tedious and not better than mario kart for crash contests
crashing is serious business and you need the absolute best graphics to do it enjoyablymany people believe the third time is officially the charm
when a game finally gets everything right as far as gameplay graphics and music go and delivers the ultimate experience
other times game developers disregard the things that were most enjoyable the first couple times to put more emphasis on other areas of the game in this case the fantastic bonus stageswhy so many people believe year of the dragon is the ultimate spyro game is a total mystery to me
i believe something went wrong with the level design because several of the stages are flat out boring
maybe insomniac was under the impression during the creation of this game if it aint broke dont fix it or maybe people are confusing the fact you have a bunch of playable characters besides spyro as something of an additional bonus to enhance the gameplay but i have to disagree strongly
these extra playable characters definitely arent enough to put this game over the top im afraid
nice additions perhaps but nothing spectacularno its not an example of me getting tired of spyro either
ive played the first two spyro games quite a lot
i must have completed the first one at least  times and riptos rage  times
id play through them again right now if i couldthere were some minor flaws with the first two games but they honestly didnt mean anything to me
certainly nothing to distract from the incredible gameplay and graphics that were so revolutionary in the development of d gaming at the time
i now feel a bit guilty for complaining that the very end of zephyr seems boring to me because comparing that little area near the end of zephyr to many of the areas in this game lets just say i had nothing to complain aboutto me the most exciting kind of d platformers are the ones that are positively loaded with tons of little things to collect such as what the first two spyro games delievered
you know things like colorful gems scattered around the stages a nice variety of enemies to take out little things such as trees and grass included into most areas of every stage with special care and consideration for detail
adding these minor details actually make the graphics and gameplay better because they leave a lasting impressionyear of the dragon feels flat in comparison
to say im a little disappointed would be an understatement
im very disappointedafter all the hype that spyros third installment is supposed to be the ultimate spyro adventure by the majority of the gaming community i was expecting to be blown away completely by this one
i was expecting this game to blow away the previous two by leaps and bounds
instead many of the stages are quite ordinary and bland in spyro  and to be totally honest many of them feel exactly the same or have that been there done that feeling
year of the dragon is quite similar to riptos rage as far as atmosphere goes but feels inferior most of the time for reasons that could have been avoided had insomniac worked harder on making the levels better
insomniac instead gave us a game that does nothing truly noteworthy to separate itself from riptos rageits disappointing
rushing through large areas of empty land just to finally come across a few scattered gems here and there or enemies spaced out in such a way that it takes a while to arrive to them these are the kind of things i dislike about most d gamesspyro the dragon and riptos rage avoided most of these boring problems since both of those games did just about everything right
in these two games traveling your way through the many stages was always exciting because there was a ton of things to collect or destroy along the way with detailed areas around every corner
not to mention when you entered a level covered with water or ice in the previous two spyro adventures it actually felt like a water or ice stageif it takes me several seconds just to arrive to something while playing year of the dragon that tells me the gameplay is a bit on the boring side
year of the dragon falls victim to this im afraid on more occasions than i was hoping for
many times you will run up and down hills platforms and other areas and come across nothing the entire time
this is a problem to me because this kind of thing didnt happen very often in the first two games
there was always something to do in the first two games no matter where you turnedwhen the levels felt boring in the beginning of year of the dragon i just thought the game was leading me gradually to more impressive levels
but once arriving to world  and still feeling bored and disappointed i realized the level design was just below typical spyro standards this time around
not to mention all the home worlds are so ordinary they become boring almost instantlydo i still like this game more than most video games ive played
absolutely
its still spyro youre still going around collecting gems and dragons youre still having fun controlling spyros movements and taking advantage of his fun abilities but i dont know i get the feeling insomniac didnt put as much care into this one that they did with the first two games which are both classics in my opinion
the game does have a few interesting stages on the same level as the ones in the previous two spyro games but theres a bunch of average ones along the waybesides insomniac not bothering to make the levels impressive or particularly fun theres a couple other problemsthe object is to go around rescuing baby dragons many of which require the player to attempt something harder than usual in order to achieve
however you get the feeling youre just repeating whats already been done in the very first spyro game when if you recall the dragons would actually talk to you after youve freed them and say funny things
the dragons in this game are babies and they dont talk and its not nearly as much fun freeing dragons this time aroundthis isnt a big complaint but a mild disappointment and a nagging feeling that all im doing is the same thing ive done before but much better the first timethe baby dragons are cute and they sometimes do funny things after theyve been freed such as spin around scratch behind their ears and basically do things puppies and kittens do
if youre an animal lover like me youll fall in love with the way the baby dragons act
its adorable and a nice touchi dont know if most people noticed but most of the bonus games consist of constant shooting
shooting shooting and well more shooting
one bonus level even morphs the gameplay into a first person shooter similar to quake as you go around eliminating enemies
of course this particular one gets quite repetitive after youve blown through a few rooms and its not very exciting because its overlong but some of the shooting action you come across in the game is quite good such as blasting away that machine shark in that one game i love this one
plentiful shooting throughout year of the dragon such as shooting fireballs cannons and other things that first appeared in riptos rage but usually they are pretty memorable so i wont complain about thissome of the bonus stages are quite difficult too such as the boxing one
just like real boxing when you throw a punch your opponent either immediately throws a punch of his own or blocks to defend himself
this makes these boxing games incredibly hard and perhaps the hardest thing you will discover in the first three spyro games from the playstations first console but at least its funthe skateboarding bonus games are awesome
they appear more than once throughout the game and they deliver a lot of excitement
im surprised how much detail went into the skateboarding games as far as the approach you take with the skateboard itself
not quite at the level of detail that tony hawk provides or anything but enough tricks to make skateboarding fun and something you wouldnt mind mastering with time and patience
the biggest highlight of the game easilyanother highlight are the special characters you play asone of them is a kangaroo probably the best one since he jumps high and has a kick move thats devastating
you have another playable character thats a beastly creature and he has a big club going around pounding things
its fun but he moves slow and hes not particularly interesting
theres some kind of monkey that shoots with his little outer spacelooking gun
this is somewhat fun but like i said above the game really goes too far with the constant shooting youll be doing throughout the game
the sparx games are fun because the gameplay turns into old school gradius gameplay for each of his levels
its an interesting change of direction and not nearly as frustrating as trying to master gradius thankfullyi hate playing as the bird though
he flies awkwardly hes very very boring to play as and his stages and challenges are just uninteresting to meto be completely honest though id rather play as spyro the entire time if given the choice but these characters are decent enough overallthe boss fight at the very end of the game is fun but the boss is way too similar to ripto with the whole arena showdown battle and compared to that epic battle this one is over much sooner and not nearly as memorable
boss fights overall are a notch up as far as difficulty goes howevermost of the music in the game is good but nothing compares to the original spyro including riptos ragesome of the voice acting is questionable
for whatever reason moneybags doesnt sound nearly as conniving as he does in riptos rage
his voice definitely sounds different
whoever thought it was a good idea for sparx to talk needs a spanking enough saidoverall this game is not a classic which is unfortunate because insomniac nailed the first two games right on the head and made two classic and original platformers
year of the dragon misses the mark and unfortunately cant be put on the same brilliant scale
why so many people claim year of the dragon is the best in the series is a mystery to me because even though the levels are longer they clearly arent better or more fun
but year of the dragon does succeed in the bonus games above everything elsethe main thing in this game is collecting eggs
its fun and theres a lot to learn in order to progress to higher levelsbah another spyro game
zzzzzzzzzz oh excuse me i almost dozed off at the thought of another spyro game for the ps
the game and story again is very good but with the new ps coming out i think the developers should have chose a different console
the game is more of a cartoonish game like mario  but the playstation can no more deliver the smooth vibrant colors of a cartoon
the ps or nintendo  would have been a better choice for this game preferably n because of its excellent adventure platformersnot a total blow to the spyro series but the game designers just spitout more games for more money when they could have taken the time to develop it betterintro  now dont get me wrong i love vampire hunter d the series its just i am doing an unbiased review that wont spare any of the flaws with this particular title
to say this game is the best game in history is just foolish and to say its the worse game in history is also just as foolish
it may be really fun to someone but the truth of the matter is its got some issuesflaws  well the major flaws arent to be ignored
jaleco the company responsible for this game needs to realize that the prerendered backgrounds so famous in the resident evil games just doesnt belong in any other game that cant pull it off just as well
resident evil tended to switch camera views when it was most convinient well most of the time but this game will switch camera views wella lot
and a lot of them arent very helpful and will get you killed a lot
also the fact that drawing your sword takes a minute and you have to do it every time you enter a screen is just annoying
drawing a gun is much quicker than a sword i know but when you are being ambushed right when you walk through a door and your only real weapon is sheathed this can be a big problem
another thing is the controlsugh
they arent horrible but then againthey arent anywhere close to perfect
youll find yourself being stuck on the walls facing the wrong way to attack enemies and so on
its just frustrating and will take a lot of getting use to
as a nitpick a lot of ds moves could be a little bit faster to keep up with the computers foesgraphics  the graphics are about as good as the playstation  can really manage for this type of game
there isnt a lot of distortion in the character models and compared to the japanese version of this game they actually improved a lot of the monster models
the cutscenes are good use cgi and youll find yourself being familiar with a lot of the charactersaudio  the audio is pretty well done
i was skeptical at first because the bloodlust movie offered some great voice actors but this game managed to boast some notsoannoying voices
from as much as i can tell meier links voice actor in this game is actually the same from the movieand leilas voice actor is a deadringer as the movies in some partsplotgame story  this game is based as few people know on the vampire hunter d  bloodlust movie that was released recently as a sequel to the classic movie
this game captures the movie pretty well but changes a lot of the stuff to get the pace moving faster
if you want full character development though check the movie out firstpuzzles  the puzzles arent impossible but a little difficult
the only thing i can say about the puzzles is that they arent very encouraging
they are about as boring as puzzles come sadly enough
i usually am not inspired to pick up the controller just so i can look through the sewer for a wrench an actual puzzleabilities  the abilities are pretty cool
your hand as most fans know already can absorb enemies after they have been weakened and their power is added to a small meter at the bottom of the screen
this meter once increased by a slot   slots total will allow you to use one of your hands  special abilities  heal full energy plus cure of poison and attack a devastating attack that inflicts major damage on bosses and kills basic enemies
this is a cool and unique feature and also the fact that you can gain an instant resurrection life if you fill the meter up to full once you can gain further resurrections if you use the current one and fill the meter up again
besides this much you can use a variety of weapons grenades throwing darts flash bombs etc
and powerups blood pills potions cures which is common for any video gameoverall  overall this game is pretty fun once you get used to the annoying flaws and can manage to beat them you can save anytime in your items menu so there shouldnt be any problems
other than these annoying problems this game is a major have for any collector of anime games survival horror games and ripoffs of the resident evil series since it boasts a lot of each of those categories and since this game is better than the import version its both easier to find and better by farvampire hunter d is very much a creation of yoshitaka amano a visionary designer who among other things has had a significant influence on the visual effects of game and anime design
he is most famous for his work in the final fantasy series but this game as a derivative of his anime work
as such it arrived with a built in following but failed to live up to expectationsit is a fairly representative plot based on the  vampire hunter d  bloodlust dvd
rescue a young damsel from the claws of vampire meier link a story with several unexpected twists which are used here as well
it is a puzzlesolving watch your vitality sort of gamethe puzzles can be difficult fighting is simplistic and clumsy and the interface is awkward
for someone who has adjusted to games on the newer consoles playing vampire hunter d may be an unsatisfying experience
it is even a bit primitive by psone standards
still its not a bad game just one that is very datedits real value today is as a collectors item for d fans who probably all believe that there isnt enough of the dunpeal vampire killer to go around
the graphics are murky but its still the world where halfbreed vampires get even with their sires and damsels are there for the rescuingcollector diehard fan or curious game player this is worth picking up
just dont expect final fantasy level play and you will avoid disappointmenti bought this game and played it most of the way through my computer crashed not as a result of the game just before i got to do cets pyramid
the storyline is okay the graphics and music are great
if youre a fan of the might and magic series youll like this game
there are a few things in the interface that are awkward but you get used to them quickly enough like  having to switch between different menus all the time to do things that should be on the same menu
there are also a lot of red herrings  active objects that give you a description when you mouseover or click on them but dont really do anything
otherwise the game is pretty goodthis game is based around three towns on your journey where you can join guilds and do quests to gain experience
those quests also enable you higher rankings in the guilds and the occasional superelite role such as the valkeryie assassin and zen master
the armor and weapons become increasingly interesting through the first  of the game anyway although the assortment of weapons is rather low unless your characters use swords
you can do a full array of movement  back forward side looking up and down running and swimming except no squattingducking
youll even ride a horse and a few other modes of transitthe early characters youll come across are memorable
my mate and i have come to deem the game quotukabuquot a name youll be given by a strange group of toad people
youll kill spiders skeletons trolls and some other interesting characters
watch out for the manalily traps
theyre a sore point of the gameas for technical issues the game stopped crashing after i installed the patch
overall you should be fine as long as you save fairly often and dont try to alttab to another programi still havent finished i have the final dungeon to complete and ive put twice as many hours into the remaining dungeons and getting to them as the ones beforemy opinion of this game has dropped the more i play because the quality of this game went down considerably after the first half
except a few new monstersthings to fight that appear when you reach the ocean you dont see much development in the fighting
it became boring and required little skill
my people are almost invincible to all the monsters which makes fighting just an annoying task
unfortunately you cant level up to get the spells you need to do the dungeons and travel unless you fightthe worst part of the game for me has been getting to and being in the sunken city
you have to spend forever searching for crabs to kill for their shells then go all the way back to the second town to turn them in
then you have to buy them back as breathers and helmets
you need both a breather and a helmet to survive the long dives with your characters totaling 
it took me hours just to get the shells not a fun task
i finally gave up trying for all  and had to let  characters die during my dives until i found breathing areas to resurrect themthis games needs a quicker way to get from town to town and town to dungeon
its okay to have to take the long road there but once youve gone through a dungeon once its crazy to have to travel back through the same dungeon just to get back to the town 
it just wastes timei was really disappointed that this game went from being so good to so cruddy
i guess the changes in who developed the game really hurt it worse than i expectedit doesnt take long for humans to become nostalgic about the good times in their lives
likewise it doesnt take long for a pc game to be considered a classic
id software and apogees wolfenstein d became one of the most revered pc games in the last decadefor the two or three readers who dont know wolf launched the firstperson shooter game from a gimmick to a genre back in  it offered what every person on earth wanted to do run around a maze with a gatling gun and mow down hordes of nazis
nine years later gray matter took this title off the mantle and carried it into the st century
with id softwares blessing return to castle wolfenstein is a sports car of a game and a complete remake of a classicobviously then rtcw was hyped
for example the december  issue of computer gaming world offered an exclusive firstlook at the hottest shooter since halflife
it continued with two years and counting after halflife and the singleplayer shooter bar is about to get raised again
the overall impression was that of a storydriven wwii adventurewithin the wallsbut rtcw isnt what its cracked up to be
computer gaming world scooped a considerably more epic and intricate game than what actually shipped
cgw described in step by step detail a medal of honor style amphibious assault as the opening of the game
the player character was reported as taking an epic journey across europe
cgw reported that friendly ai
would fight alongside the player character that bosses and enemies were vulnerable only at certain times with certain weapons and that enemies would not spawn and would fight most intelligently such as recognizing that your gun is bigger than their gun
since cgw strongly implied these points to be expected in the final release i foolishly lowered my guard and accepted the hypethis was after all before anybody knew that id software would delay rtcws release by a full year and have it redesigned
none of the attributes i cited above appeared in the released version of wolf
instead medal of honor allied assault would adopt the epic wwii mantle while rtcw turned out to be another weekend shooterthis should be no surprise considering id software has always been about speed and violence
but i have to admit im getting tired of the current deluge of tenhour titles and id softwares formula offers no respite
rtcws story is pretty incidental for all of its cinematic air as little more than shooting and explosions occur during play
between levels an orders update shuttles the player from one killing ground to the next
most of the levels are your standard maze full o monsters only much simpler and easier than those found in previous id titles such as quake and doom
all enemies are vulnerable to guns and rocket launchers and with no hit location most levels are solved with your standard circlestrafeandamachinegun trick
rarely will the player need more than a suppressed sten gun and a mauser k and rarely will the player need to do more than kill people and find the exit
expository cut scenes stitch it all togetherdont mistake meall of this stuff is fun
i just dont like it when a game hyped as a halflife competitor turns out to be another runandgunner beat in two days
i especially dont like it when said game is an alist title from alist developersreturn to quake iiibut lets give credit where credit is due
wolf certainly competes with bigtime shooters on the media front this game looks and sounds great
the quake iii engine gets a work out with photorealistic textures and lighting while the snarls of zombies and undead warriors echo down stone corridors and into the marrow of the players bones
and while circlestrafing is often the solution to beating enemies their ai is smart enough to take cover while reloading and to strafefire back at the player
i have to admit from the flamethrower to the smoke to the late afternoon shadows i find rtcws effects gorgeous
best of all it runs smoothly even on my antiquated amd  processorfinally rtcw has a few nice features to liven up the playladders have cages to reduce those annoying ladder deathshelpful icons pop up to tell the player what to do so he or she isnt banging away at every wall looking for secretsvenom soldiers are invulnerable to the weapons they carry so dont get into a flamethrower fight with onethe leaping lopers charge no matter what players throw at them though a venom gun or a rocket launcher will make short work if the player is quick on the drawhumorous messages and orders litter the wehrmacht bases and labsand of course plenty of hitler portraits hang about for the players to vandalizein for the killbut make no mistake this is an id software game big on style and short on substance
if players want to kill a weekend chasing nazis in a maze with a gatling gun rtcw is a goodlooking scarysounding smoothrunning choice
if players want a little more meat on their firstperson nazi shooters they need to boot up the medal of honor seriesnope in all the hype i was hoping for a game much more involved than it turned out particularly since id and gray matter were remaking the granddaddy of firstperson shooters
still return to castle wolfenstein satisfies on other levels and it will probably be as fondly remembered as its progenitor
its no halflife killer but it can kill some time while waiting for halflife remembering the original castle wolfenstein on my commodore  in the s and how original difficult and cool it was back then
the level of anticipation i had to play this one was very high
and it lives up to the anticipation with a few  criticismsgameplay is excellent if not repetitive graphics are outstanding without the open environment of a gta
as result the game is very linear with only one path to take to get you from one level to the next
not that this type of game is bad it is just very objective focused with little to explore other than achieving the objective at handthe biggest disappointment however was the final scene as i was able to beat the game on only my second try
it was too easy and not very satisfying
you go through a hundred or so levels to get to the climax where youre expecting a monster so hideous that it will literally take everything you have and multiple attempts to defeat but alas the weapons in the game were too overpowering even for something as gruesome as heinrichvery good but too much effort for relatively easy payoffrtcw is not another max paynethis is the most expensive first person shooter that has come out sincemedal of honorsheesh
the game has a decent amount of levels the cut scenes are pretty good but is that really worth all that 
the actual gameplay is nothing new
i would give this game a higher rating but serious sam has graphics that are just as good gameplay that is similar and is much cheaper
but you ask well you must have paid  for it like everyone else
nope i bought a used copy its a cd remember
for  the price that is what you should pay for this gamereturn to castle wolfenstein is a first person shooter with a good but very short single player and a fantastic multiplayer gameplay
it is not a sequel to wolfensteind it is a remake with an expansion pack
the game does not start where the first game ended
like the first game rtcw starts with the soldier escaping from the prison in the nazi castle but does not end when he get out of the castle
set during the world war ii you play bj
blazkowicz an american soldier captured and imprisoned in a nazi castle
he escapes from there but discoveres strange things that the agency wants to stop the nazis from creating thier evil experiments they send blacz on many missions to destroy the robotic soliders the ending was dissapointing
the story is told through lots of cutsences between the missions but the cutsences are boring as the charecters are just talking and the hero does not appear in any of them
the single player gameplay is very short with about  levels in seven missions
the gameplay is good and fighting the nazis and the sten gun female gaurds are great but the robotic soldiers zombies were are very dull it is also quite dissapointing to see zombies and robots in this game
level design is very good and there are lots of secret passages and most of them remind me of the thief games
the levels are also quite hard to complete shooter missions are very good but the stealth missions are dull and quite frustrating
in one mission you must kill all the nazi officers without sounding the alarm it was very frustrating
the boss levels and the ending levels are very hard
enemy ai is ofcourse not as good halflife or no one lives forever but they are impressive they react well if you snipe their partners throw a grenade near them and to sounds ectreturn to castle wolfenstein is created on the quake engine but the game looks like it is created on the max payne engine
the graphics and sound are very good the german outdoor hilly environment is very beautifull
the charecter animation is great they look and behave like real humans sometimes their caps will fall down female gaurds will dive on the floor when dogging gun fire
but still the graphics were a little dissapointing to me there are not much blood in the game
the game is very violent you do feel like you are killing real humans but there are not much blood and gore like halflife or kingpin
the selection of weapons is good able to use your leg to kick and break objects is good because you do not need to switch to the knife to break a box in case you want to save ammo you could just kick it and break it
but the weapons damage is dissapointing they should have been a little more powerfull flame thrower is almost usless in the single player
rtcws multiplayer gameplay is really great deathmatch or ai controlled bots are not here but you will not miss them
though almost everything besides voting is the same as team fortress it is great to play with better graphics and a better looking flame throwermedal of honor beats it in graphics gameplay control and every other catagory other then blood
it has alot of blood which is funner but you can also download blood for mohaafor a while rtcw and mohaa had a battle going on
i bought medal of honor and later bought wolfenstein
moh outdoes this game
wolfenstein is ok the multiplayer is alright but you have to download numerous files to play
if you are a fan of single player this game is just stupid
if this game was focused on just world war ii it would be awesome
on the single player evil scientist are creating nazi monsters
how stupid can you get
the game is alright but if your in for really great multiplayer and single player war get medal of honorbeautiful graphics and atmosphere
i started playing the game on the easiest setting because i wanted to get a feel for the gameplay
it seemed too easy so i switched to the next hardest level and did ok until i got into the catacombs
i got down to two health points and at that level all youre gonna do is die which i did frequently
so i went back to the beginning and started over at the easiest setting
let me say that the only difference between the two settings is the amount of ammo and health available
there are just as many enemies and they are just as hard to defeat
the game can be very tough at timesthe game also has some bugs i noticed at least on my system
on the save game feature i must return to the main menu in order to go to a previously saved game or strange things happen
for instance i was in the church battling helgas elite guards and those babes are tough
i got to saving the game after killing two so as not to have to repeat it and after one save the game allowed me to proceed as if invisible to the guards
so i just walked up to each and knifed them one at a time and finished the level that way
there were so many of them i might not have been able to beat them anyhow
they never noticed or hurt menext i went to the level of the demolished church and the game seemed to take a left turn into the bizarre
there was a giant monster that looked like an ape along with some kind of flying ghouls which killed me every time on the easiest setting remember
now i am thinking this game is getting a little too weird for my tastes and i might just give it to the kid across the street because it seems to be right on target for a fifteen yearold mindbut i am very impressed with the graphics and the immersive atmosphere
theyve done a really good job on thatyou know when i first played street fighter ex i thought it was the most awesome d fighter around for the psone
then last year street fighter ex came out and after playing it i was disappointed because it seemed like the first game with a few new characters to fight with
the only redeeming quality it had was where you could record your fights and play them back in your own fashion
it was disappointing playing through the whole game only to be toldthank you for playing
see you next game bah
but i tried to understand as capcom was working on street fighter exwell street fighter ex comes out
i rush to get it and play it and wham
it was disappointing
seemed to me it was even worser than ex because it didnt have anything to redeem it from boredom
i mean it didnt even have fmv endings to it like it did on the first one
you play through the whole game only to be greeted with text telling what happens to your character afterwards
ill admit the graphics were lush
it was cool to see all my favorites in highrez
but that wasnt enough for me
i had such high hopes for sfex and they let me downdo i think the game is worth it for the price tag
definitely
just to have my collection completewould i pay fullprice for it
no way
i dont think its worth itif and when they come out with a street fighter ex i hope they do a better job to bring the series back on toplearn from fighters such as soul calibur and virtua fighter 
give us fighting fanatics something to go on about
not drivle like thisstreet fighter was the only fighting game that captured my interest ever since i was only  years old
i got into it when i played street fighter ii for the super nintendo
and as i grew older i began going to arcades to find all the newly released street fighter games street fighter alpha street fighter alpha  street fighter alpha  street fighter iii new generation of street fighters street fighter iii nd impact and street fighter iii third strike
they were all great except for street fighter the movie
digitized fighting games are so old and worn off 
despite the change of each d street fighter title they stand as one of the most popular street fighter titles ever
when the ex series came to the plate including street fighter ex for the playstation  the ex series disappointed me
it was great hearing that street fighter went d but they shouldnt have changed the fighting engine in the first place
now lets talk about the game
street fighter ex comes to the playstation  with a lot of improvements and new modes of play
the graphics are excellent
our favorite street fighters move at an incredibly smooth framerate and the special effects are eye popping
for the first time ever you can now do tag battles rather than just doing plain old oneonone
the music tracks sound great but not the voice acting and the sound effects sometimes
and the thing that will definently grate on your nerves are the controls
this game does not resemble the old street fighter series whatsoever
street fighter ex however does not feel like street fighter
it feels like youre playing a faster version of rival schools
whats worse street fighter ex doesnt have enough depth even with the new modes of play
this game is too freakin short but not easy to beat which makes the game much more challenging
its not a bad game its just that capcom shouldve made this game much better than the other ex games
just take a look at street fighter iii third strike 
the game produces smooth animation solid play mechanics and a whole lot of modes of play
third strike was a perfect translation to its arcade counterpart
unfortunately street fighter ex wasnt all that cool
its not the best street fighter but fans of the capcom series will still give it ago
but still capcom shouldve thought of a better fighting engine that would fit in the d universe
my first suggestion is go ahead and buy this game 
dont refuse just because you read this review 
this game is great and a true must buy for diehard street fighter fans
my second and important suggestion is to rent it before you buy it 
thats the smart way 
my third suggestion is if you want to play a good street fighter game play capcom vs snk or street fighter iii third strike my friend rented this game and my friend said it was sweet so i decided to check it out i rented and in a hour i had beaten the game
no prob plus i wasnt to happy with it either the only reason i went on playing is out of sheer bordem
the graphics r soso and the fights can be very predictable if you have my opinion buy tekken tag tournament youll get your moneys worth at leastwhat can i say
tekken tag tournement as another reviewer said is tekken   and  put together
i enjoy the tag feature
it makes for a fun actio packed and quick game
this game is a ton of fun while playing with friends yet the fun factor isnt as great when playing alone
sincerly i dont know if this game is worth  renting this game first might be a good idea before buying itwell i really liked this game when i got it and still play it every now and then but the initial thrill is mostly gone
there are numerous characters to earn and moves to learn plus an entertaining bowling mini game but this all becomes old news after a month
button mashing will get you through this one same as with all the other tekken games but i dont see that bug ever getting fixed so i guess ill have to come to grips with that
dont pay too much for thisok this game is obviously a classic lots of people still play it but does it really build up to being the same as say tekken setup its a good game as all of the tekken games are besides tekken and it goes well
some of the menus are a bit tacky and mixed up but no real complaints heresettings the settings are nice you have plenty of choices to choose from for your own preference
you can play bowling you can go to a chinese temple area a dark shrouded and candlelit room its pretty good but i dont like how a certain map will stretch out as you move the floor turns weird and it stretches out i dont know how else to explain thischaracters so many characters
its fantastic
i love the amount of sheer quality that was given to each character
i wont say they each are unique but i will say that there are plenty of combinations to suit your needsmovesets and statsfirst of all i have to say that the health values for each characters are proportioned bad there is little chance for depth when battling your enemies for example maybe  good kicks can win you the round
that isnt fun ok
its intense but it doesnt get you your moneys worth in a round
my helpful tip for a game is if you dont find your moneys worth in a single round in a fighting game but obviously paid too much
some might argue that it is too difficult to tell and might wonder about who cares but games are games you like it or you dont and if you arent interested enough to learn a character and take the time you paid too much
i personally find that the movesets are repetitive about  characters have a same kick and about  
have the same punchall this said it is a worthwhile game it was the first time they really got it all right and you wont find some of these characters much anymore its a good buy for around 
otherwise its too old to get it for much more than thattekken is definitely one of the best game series but for anyone who is experienced with the series will find that tekken tag tournament really hasnt broken any new ground in either the tekken series or the fighting genrenamco has managed give tekken tag tournament a visual upgrade
unfortunately backgrounds and foregrounds dont blend nicely together and because the playstation  hardware lacks antialiasing you can notice pixelation within character models
the title of the best graphics in a fighting game still belongs to soul calibur
even with features added isnt this the same tekken weve been playing all along
tekken tag retains the same features from the arcade version
every character from tekken  and  will be selectable here
better single player modes could have been added which would have boosted the replay valuethe newest fighting technique in the tekken series is the tagging system
youll be able to select two characters to go against another fighting pair
during battles you may switch off between fighters at any time to beat your opponents
unlike the tag options in dead or alive  or marvel vs capcom tekkens tag option doesnt allow you to completely finish a battle
once one of your team members die the fight is over which is degradingtekken tag tournament may certainly become a hit with its famous franchise while at the same time showing off its new home with the sony playstation  unless youre a hardcore fan of the series youll find this as nothing more but tekken  with a tag feature
once you get past the new look of the game the fun begins to turn routine
gamers who have never had experience with tekken or fighting games should investigate the game but others looking for something new would want to check out the other titles the playstation  has to offerthis is overall a decent game and since its only money at the moment it would make a good buy
i personally am not too allured by tag team games and this one didnt change me
many of the characters that you must earn are very forgettable
the game itself is laid out in a fairly confusing manner you can only change players outfits by hitting certain buttons on the control pad and they have to hit back to reselect a different one if you dont like it
overall i would just wait for tekken  to come out but thats just meat first the game had graphics that i thought couldnt get any better but when i saw the movies i was very disapointed because it looked just like the gameplay graphics and the begining movie looked real
i beat the game with evrey single character and saw the same old corny short messed up no meaning movies
the movies lacked the great real d graphics of the past tekkens
and the game puts up no challange even on ultra hard
and a big problem is u lose after  character is kod
and it has nothing to do with the tekken series
the good thing is they brought back good old tekken  charactersincluding my favorites kazuya and lee and it offers tekken bowl
and they as always make the fighting graphics look great
if u love tekken  and tekken  this is a game for u  if u havent played tekken in a long time this game welcomes u back with a warm reception but if u want a tekken game with meanin wait till tekken  cumz out september one of the better ones for sure
your mileage may very
tekken games are quite hard so newbie fighter fans need not apply
dead or alive is a better series for newcomers of fighting games though still takes some skillim a great fan of the tekken series and when i saw this latest incarnation i was a little disappointed
granted the graphic effects such as the snow falling on one level grass thickets on another and all the cheering yobspracticing ninjas in the background look really pretty but they dont do anything for the gameplay
i found the game to be noticeably slower than tekken  on the playstation ps ps
my main gripe however was the lack of new decent characters
for starters old crappy characters have been resurrected lee pjack jun when they already have counterparts that have identical moves
panda and that ridiculous kangaroo are still present and who honestly picks them
the final boss is also very uninspired
id consider this as tekken  with small bells and whistles rather than a sequel to tekken  four games in a row with the same characters is getting more than a little datedyou can yell at me you can scream at me but i apologize i cannot call tekken tag tournament and above average game
this game seems to have been able to make the already traditionally clunky tekken controls even more awkward and pales in comparison to the amazingly fluid vf controls
if not for the mediocre controls and the lack of fluidity that has become known to the tekken seriesthe one exception would be tekken  this game would be much better and may even merit a   give this game a rental and buy it if you are a tekken fan but stay away if you arent a true fan of the fighting game genrewell i think this game is ok but it could be a little harder and a little less cheap
the computer ripps you off way to much
i beat the game in about  days at  hours a day
so my advice is never buy this gamewaste of  darn bucks
dont even rent the stupid thingit is somewhat surprising how little difference there is between the various implementations
visually the ps version isnt that much different from the ps version
even the cutscenes arent much betterthere are more characters that one can control but the characters dont gain a significant amount of visual detail in the ps version
part of the problem is that the characters remain about the same size in each version and there isnt a whole lof of detail one can fit in that same amount of screen spaceif you dont have a version of gauntlet for any platform then get the ps version in this regard i give the game a 
if you already have the ps version get the ps one only if you are a diehard gauntlet fan in this case i would give the game a unless midway ups the visual quality of the next version of gauntlet significantly they are going to lose their market to competitors like how they lost mortal kombat to the cloneslets be honest theres virtually no story to speak of in gauntlet
its you versus crowds of enemies with bosses every now and again
there are more minibosses in this version with generals and chimera but they end up being more annoying than challengingstory even for a cheap franchise rerelease the graphics are pretty poor especially on the new characters
if youve played the arcade youll find nothing new
if you havent then try to be forgiving because theres not much to seegraphics the sounds are generally corny but there are some good aura effects like hearing people pounding on the nailedshut coffins in the desecrated temple
voicing is pretty lame but it faithfully reproduces in other words regurgitates gauntlet legends on the arcade and n
lack of independent volume leveling brings the score down to mediocresound while the music is surprisingly decent thats probably more because its catchy when its there and so many of the other standards are so low
more for nostalgia than any merits of its ownmusic this game might seem a chore when going singleplayer but add friends and it gets exponentially more fun  up to four players
the levels change subtly depending on how many players are there and while theres little real depth its still good arcadey hackandslash fun
best with  players
there are plenty of items and powerups but for some reason this version disables the ability to turn them off for better timing or selling them so everything ends up being almost completely useless and this seriously degrades the scoregameplay you can replay any level youve unlocked at will including boss battles but unlike the n version you dont get any cool abilities like permanent antideath halo for beating the final boss
while its enjoyable spending time with friends youll probably only want to run through a few levels before youll want to take a break or put in something different
it might have been better if item management had remained but special abilities are almost useless and the long time it takes to levelup and upgrade makes this game get tedious at higher levels with no real rewardsreplayability theres little about this game that shines but it is undeniable fun when played with friends
i wouldnt recommend a rent characters are too weak at the start and options are limited but its not a game you should get for yourself when i say its best with friends i mean its good only with friends
admittedly it is good for nostalgia or if you and a few friends want an arcade fix but its not going to surprise you with any qualityoverall i played gauntlet legends and gauntlet  dark legacy almost religiously in the arcades for months
when i finally got a ps  i simply had to have this gamehowever  while its a fun  simple game at first  it later becomes tedious and repetitive after some time
the game controls are easy to grasp  allowing you to dive into the game almost immediately after cracking the case open
the graphics rival the arcade versionshowever  as you get into the game itelf  you will quickly discover a stark lack of depth
the levels are linear  with few turns off the beaten path  and the puzzles lack imagination or any degree of complexity
its a classic button cruncher to the end  and an unimaginitvie one at thatthe bonus levels  are at least somewhat more complex  although it will take you very few tries to master them and be able to get the hidden characters consistantlyto some  this kind of gameplay will appeal  amd i must admit it was killer fun at first  but i cannot reccommend this game for more than a few hours of gameplaying funthis is the sequel to one of my favorite dreamcast games
there are new boxers featured and even some suprise celelbrity charecters such as bill clinton michael jackson and shaquille oneal
the graphics are nice and a little cartoony and the music is pretty standard
voices in the game include michale buffers lets get ready to rumble line and more standard voices ofr each charecter
the arcade mode is a fun knockout fest complete with ridiculous charecters and extremely realistic bungie cable physics
theres also tournament mode with training sessions which are little button tapping mini games that get kind of annoying but its stil fun to build up your charecter and ot fight in scheduled matches
multiplayer is great only  people but its still quite a bit of fun
the game is a nice attempt for a sequel but it gets old really quickthis game is very highly rated and i expected more out of it
the graphics are pretty good and the quotcut scenesquot are interesting providing a good story line but the game play between the cut scenes is all too shortas with a lot of games with a mission once the mission is completed the first time a lot of the fun goes out of the game
this game is probably a better game to rent than to buyi bought this game and finished it recently
not a big fan
theres a major reason theres a million copies of this game in the bargain bin of any used game storeid never played games with similiar control schemes like the resident evil games myself so im not used to the choppy control style and the lack of platforming no jumping period
the cinematics were wonderful and dramatic
whoever designed the visuals deserves a raise but i hate the controls
the worst thing about the control is that manuevering is a  step process instead of a more intuitive and efficient  step processfor example lets say you want your character to walk to the right
you must first rotate him in the direction you want to go then press forward on the directional pad this aint an fps
he rotates way too slow
they try and compensate for this by using another button to pull off a quick  turn also your character will often automatically face the next enemy the ai thinks you will want to strike
when youre surrounded by three enemies your disadvantage is compounded
some may say this is challenging i just call it what it is crappy play control
also the fact that you can simply just tap the attack button and watch your character slice several enemies in sequence without doing anything else is not a plus in my book
i want a game that actually requires me to play it not tap a button mindlessly
i think this exemplifies the meaning of the term button mashingif you want an action packed and cinematically impressive hackemup i highly recommend god of war
see my other reviews the gameplay was loads better and just as impressive graphically if not more so
plus you can jump in it and there is a moderate amount of platforming thrown in for varietythis game is like a role playing gamebut to much figuring and solving puzzles not enough actionsthis game like a sim game with some actionsi bought the ps adventure pack and this game was included in it so i got dissapointed from ps after having finished this game fortunately after playing gt i got my expectations back high again
in short this game has good graphics not as much as i would have expected capcom could have done a better job with the graphics
the sound is ok except in some parts that there is not syncronicity between the voice and the movements of lips from the characters
the story is good but not too deep very simply actually fight the demons save the princess solve a few puzzles etc better storyline you can find in silen hill 
the most dissapointing feature of this game is that you can finish it after  or  hours of playing meaning that it is too short for hardcore gamers and there is not replay value at all
for those of you who are about to buy it i suggest you rent it first it is not worth paying dollar amount for a game that you will leave behind after  or three days of playing
anyways i still had a good time after the four hours it took me to beat the game so thats the only reason i give it a  stars otherwise i would have given it  or  stari sort of like this game its not that bad but the control is like resident eveil i hate that control now a days and the blood was almost like it wasnt there im not saying buckets of gore should be shooting all about but com on blood that evaperates befor it touchs the ground i guest i just didnt like this game or more like the resident eveil control just dosent do it for me any more i say rent it fristthe game is very difficult and fun
the only problem is that it is too short
it takes only  hours to beat and believe it or not that is one of the objectives to beat it in less than  hours
this game was not worth  dollars back then and isnt worth  dollars now
i would definitely reccommend a rentalits a great game but after the game is ended you dont want to play it again quotand that funny costume is patheticquotonimusha warlords  circa good a nicely styled samurai horrorfantasy an original story based loosely on japanese history cool samuraisword combatbad this game is sort of showing its age from the lukewarm voice acting to the controls not for those who dont like survival horror gamesif it fits your taste a samurai game that plays like a survival horror magic and fantasy are a pretty big part of the story some backtracking and fetch the key quest but over all very well paced and enjoyablegame its most assocated too onimusha  samurai destiny onimusha  demon siege resident evil code veronica xadditional notes this game is also for xbox but it is called gemma onimusha when capcom was first making this game there was a glitch that make enemies fly into the air after being hit it was later fixed and taken out before release well one day while in development the programming team for another upcoming capom title sat in on the very early build of this game and tried it out turns out they liked the glitch so much the same one which the onimusha team later removed that they added it to there upcoming game which later turned out to be devil may crybland story save the princessu might get paronoid u will feel like ur in the game even when ur not playing it which can be a bad thingbad controls and cameraconfusing at timesbut its a fun game overall beat these zombies to death and when there down u can stick ur sowrd in them which is a good affectif ur not into survival horror then u might not be able to play it all the time cause its not one of those games u can put it in and play when u dont feel like it and have funlike gtaif u liked resident evil and think sorwds are cool this is a must have
but i cant recommend it to everyoneyeah i did thathrs in line for this game
was it worth the wait
right now tekken is the only game that deserves mass attention for ps
as for madden if you have the sega dreamcast and nflk then you know where im coming from
madden  is a great game for the quoteyesquot to see but it lacks big time in the realism catagory
a qb
shouldnt scramble to one end of the field and throw  yards over his shoulder down the oppisite side of the field or a running back shouldnt stop on a dime and turn the other way while in full stride
youll break your ankels doing that in real football
these are the top  things that frustrates me about this game
    the none ability to run down the player after he has passed the line of scrimagefagetabowdit its a touchdown      if a player has good stats like issac bruce or keyshuan johnson they hardly ever drop a pass double or tripple team coverage      the ability for the qb
to scramble  yards backwards and still hit the receiver  yards down field without breaking his route how lame is that      the very slow play of the entire game
    the crazy ability for the qb
to throw a pass while being taken down in a sack
nflk has the upper hand by far because of online play with anyone in the country
bordem sets in fast when playing madden  against the computer because of the ability for the computer to cheat at will
when ever ps decides to go online with there console i may pick this one back up onei am a huge nfl fan and gaming fan
this game appealed to me at first but then slowly lost its appeal after several games here is a short list of reasons the punting system just stinks it is way to easy to kick a long punt and one bounce it out of bounds without a chance of a return the learning curve of the game is also quite high because the controls arnt the easiest thing to get used to for younger gamers the controls are a little sluggish and are a little slower to respond sometimes in sports games this is intentional to be realistic but this just got annoying
well that was my two cents and i would just like to say that i am also a proud owner of nflk which also has its problems but til next year when ea fixes all these problems ill put it up against madden any dayi thought madden  would become even better than  edition but i was wrong
the graphics changed but the linesmen are still d pictured
now you may think who cares
and you might think that playing the game is exciting but its not
the fans on fifa nba and nhl k became detailed and d modeled except madden
now the game is having trouble shooting aswell
it runs very very slowly that you may think youre playing golf instead of bonecrunching american football
just think about what i said and remember its up to you if you want to order this game or notmadden  is the most visually stunning football game ever
the game simply amazed me the first time i saw it
but when i started to play it i noticed a problem
the running is too smooth and the tackling is too hard
i swear my friend and i were playing and whenever we handed the ball off wed get around  yards per carry
it turned the game into a shootout we were scoring every driveif you can overlook that problem the game is amazing
the passing is highly realistic and the graphics are superbi recommend this to anyone with a ps its a must havethis reviewer is a die hard nascar fan and has been for over a decade now
when i first heard that nascar  was coming out for the ps i was quite excited
unfortuntately although this game is pure eye candy its rather disappointing when playing its previous version nascar    and  on the playstationea had to rush this game and must have cut a whole lot out of it in order to ship it in time
what is missing is several tracks on the winston cup circuit including homestead michigan phoenix las vegas new hampshire pocono and dovera second problem is the inability to set your car the way you like it as you were able to in the previous games
you have the ability to set your car up one of three ways loose tight or neutral
no tweaking the tire pressure spoiler angles or wedge in this gameplayers can choose a quick race no track or car selections a single race in which you can choose driver and track or championship where you can try to win the winston cup championship in a series of races on the  tracks in the gamenascar  for the ps isnt all bad
the tracks and cars look better than they ever have in any other home console version of this game
cars seem to wreck in front of you more often than ever before and its not uncommon to see a car start to smoke up ahead leaving your visability on the track to a virtual nil
these features have to be seen to be appreciatedi tested the collison detection by running a polish victory lap  aka alan kulwicki during the race i was running at talladega
the end result was a pretty cool collision with cars turned upside down on the track and tires and debris all over the infieldthe cars in this game seemingly have a more arcade style feel  are easier to drive and look great
the problem with the graphics lies in the two player mode where it breaks down badly and when you turn on the real view mirror in single player mode
this really breaks up the frame rate and it is very noticablethe bottomline on this game is this if you have to have an nascar style racer on your ps then this is your only choice
if you have previous versions of this game on your playstation save your money until ea sports releases a respectable version of this gamenot recommended by this nascar fanthis game is funthe graphics are great
i rented this game and beat itlike i said i rented it and beat itit got boring fasti beat it with all the secret chars and all the other stuffgreat game
rent it dont buy it because it gets broing really fastthis game is same as all of the fifa games except it has better graphics and rosters
dont get me wrong fifa is a fun game but after all the years they have had it you would think the might have changed the game a littleif you take my advice i would only get this if you have not had a fifa game in a couple of years
i think that i will just rent it again to beat it
that is what i would do unless you like buying the same game year after yearthis game turned out much better than i thought it would
its not as slow as i thought it might be and can be downright fun at times
probably the best part is slide kicking the goalie when hes down and watching it again and again on replay
the announcers are very annoying especially if you have surround sound and youre in another part of the room
the referees are a little too strict for my liking but all in all not a bad game
graphics are good
just a few little things that i might fix
rent it first this probably isnt for everyone as the british announcers can be very very annoying and you cant completley shut off the penalties
good for a few laughs and a couple hours or so of entertainmentthis game has nice graphics good gameplay and it probably the best soccer game ever made
i do not see a franchise mode in the game and the buttons for menus are not consistent with other ea games which is just ridiculousthe game will provide you with hours of soccer fun
if you dont like soccer you will probably get bored of it after a while but this is one of the better games
i would rent it before buying it if i could go back in timenhl  for ps looks great and has tons of options that hockey fans dream of
unfortuneatly it seems that the frame rate was put on the backburner in favor of great detail and great graphics
so just beware that youll be getting a mixed bag in this one
the graphics are simply amazing but the gameplay is a bit slow and the framerate suffers
so depending on what you look for in a game you might or might not want to get this one
in a nutshell amazing detail amazing graphics amazing options amazing presentation but far from amazing framerate and game speedits a fun hockey game and definately worth owning there are some annoying parts camera is occaisionally too close which cuts out view of teamates
this makes assisting difficult play slowdown when the benches are in view computer teamates arent very predictable making it hard to set up shots in one player mode fighting looks like the benny hill show the punches move super fast and are jerky checking animation could be betterbeing relatively new to the ps ive had mine for slightly over  weeks ive been in search for a few games to add my collection
the first game i purchased was madden  arguably one of the best sports games ever developed
my next purchase was nhl why nhl 
good question
being a southerner my knowledge of hockey is very limited i couldnt tell you the difference between icing in a hockey rink and icing on a cake
okay thats not entirely true but not far off
i purchased this game because i was disappointed in the baseball and basketball titles out there  in addition it came highly recommended by several peopleto me this is a highly enjoyable game
like madden  the graphics for this game are remarkable and the gameplay is very solid
i tend to play with the camera set to overhead   this detracts from the awesome graphics but to me it is the only way that i can see whats going on elswhere on the court
otherwise i am simply making blind passes
in this respect the game dops offi continue to be frustrated by ea sports inabilityrefusal to put adequate franchisecareer modes in any sports title other than madden
as is the case in triple play baseball and nba live  for the ps nhl live  does not feature a franchise mode
to this extent i feel like this  as well as the other titles i mentioned  were rushed
simply put any sports title for the ps that does not feature some sort of franchise mode simply isnt worth itthat being said since this is the first go around i have to give nhl live a favorable review
from someone who knows very little about hockey this is a highly enjoyable game especially against human opponentsthis is the best hockey game i have ever seen
the graphics are amazing
better than the playing graphics in fifa or madden
all the games have just stunning replay cinematic graphics but the playing graphics in nhl  for ps are spectacularthis game does not have a franchise mode like madden does at least i couldnt find it
the interace to pick teams make players and run a season are just terrible
madden has a great easy to use clean menu interface and nhl  has a clunky muddy interface that is difficult to usethe game is fun to play against other people the rumble feature of the controller works great when you get checked
if you are a hockey fan you will buy this without any regrets
if you are not a hockey fan you will still like it and have fun but i would recommend trying the game before you decide that you want itthis game has great graphics
this a game when you have  or more players playing with you
it gets boring when playing it by yourself
it is a good game but over time you will grow tired of itokay lets start with the good points of the game  its essentially evil dead 
  bruce campbell as ash
 a button just for oneliners even though theyre somewhat few in number locations and a few surprise characters from the movies good game graphics that have a certain amount of graininess to them that helps to recreate the atmosphere of the original evil dead with a few great touches like the moving shadows of trees outside the windows in the cabin nice music and sound effects for the most part chainsaws and boomsticks decent cutscenes a few good puzzlesdespite all of those good pointsand regardless of the fact that im a huge fan of the evil dead trilogy as well as something of a survival horror veterani have to give this game a mere  stars  why
thats easythe gameplay
you have some of the stiffest and least responsive survival horror controls ive ever experienced
then you have fixed camera angles where at times youre down at the end of the screen and so small you cant even tell which direction youre facing
couple that with the lack of an autoaiming feature and it adds up to dozens of deaths just because you cant tell if youre facing whatever it is youre trying to hitnext i have to mention the constantly respawning enemies
you kill an enemy and another one pops right out of the ground to take its place  battles are often unavoidable as the various enemies usually either chase you down or block your way
each enemy you encounter has the ability to kill you usually very quickly
youll find yourself using healing items after every battle or every  if youre lucky
during boss battles youll find yourself going into the inventory screen to heal yourself every couple seconds which really kills the atmosphere of the game and makes things fairly tedious
if he really used that many healing kits ash would have looked like a mummy within the first  minutes of the game
the respawning enemies are also annoying as they sort of take away your ability to explore the game
there were areas from the movies in the game that i would have liked to have walked around and checked out but it was really impossible to do with enemies popping out of the ground  at a time and chasing you down
you really dont get a chance to take in the atmosphere of it all and that really is a shamebasically with the deadly respawning enemies and poor control the game becomes annoyingly difficult and playing through it is basically just a matter of playing a section over and over until you can survive to the next save point note save points are fairly sparse especially on the first disc  its really not fun at all and it boiled down to more or less just a matter of suffering through the frustrating gameplay to follow the storyline and see a few cool locations from the moviesalso note that the game is very short  i only clocked about  hours game time about  hours less than i normally do my first time through an average survival horror game  apparently the high level of difficulty and frustration is just to cover up for the fact that there isnt much game there to play throughin the end if youre an evil dead fan you have to get it just because its more or less evil dead  and stars bruce campbell
if youre not an evil dead fan but are just a survival horror gamer looking for something new stay away
this has to be the least enjoyable survival horror game ive played and its definitely not worth the high price
im a huge evil dead and survival horror fan and even i thought about playing frisbee with the disc and a wall once or twicei hate to say anything bad about evil dead i love the movies but to review the game honestly im going to have to give it an average rating
the graphics i thought were good
the story was no different from that of the movies
the funny ash was all therethe zombies i had a problem with
they floated through the air like balloons
their attacks were so nintendo yes the regular version not nintendo or  or whatever the hell they call it
and the zombies lacked anything real
even ash seemed cartoonish
if youre expecting the same realism you get when you play resident evil or silent hill youre not going to get it in this game
when i shoot at a deadite i dont want to see a white spark thats suppose to be a bullet fly across the screen
i want to see that witchs head get blown off like in the movie and her decapitated body running after me with a chainsaw
all well i guess ill live
they could of been more creative on how ash collected items
you pick up mushrooms the size of your head to make fuel for your chainsaw and collect medic packs by killing deadites
if i went out and chopped up my girl friend with a chainsaw shes not going to drop a medic  pack for me
just little things like that really make the game ridiculous
something else ridiculous were the puzzels like in order to unlock the church doors you have to put a starw hat a plant and a gravestone before the entrance which makes absolutely no senseanother horrible factor is that the game isnt scary at all
throughout the entire gameplay it has the same humor that youll find on army of darkness
that might not be bad but believe me i think if the game had some of the same morbidness youll find in the evil dead  and  movies it would of been better
the game doesnt have the roots of the evil dead tree only the dried leaves on the crownenough complaining
if youre an evil dead fan you will have fun playing the game im just saying it could of been a heck of a lot better
you will laugh but you will not cry because the game isnt painful at all like in the beginning movies
its really hard at first but it comes easy like learning how to drive
and im talking easy man
i beat the game in two hours the first time around
so its a quick fun play but not thrilling like silent hill or anything
and its cool to show to all your evil dead buddies if you have anyin fact after writing so much about it i think ill go carve me a witch and play a little bityeah i only gave it  stars because i never really got the hang of the game but it was fun while it lastedthe most annoying thing about this game is that ash your hereo has to find his own fuel for the chainsaw
other than that and the unusual angles that the camera views abstract the game is great
unfortunately it reminds me of the days of genesis control functions where going up a hill made your character look strange on the screen but its evil dead
if youre a fan youd love it
i have to give the game one thumb up not bad for a beginingjust look at the impovements since on the siblings fist full of boomstick and regenerationim a big fan of the evil dead movies but i must say this game is not fun its cool to travel in the rooms of the cabin but this game is sad because the monsters are never over if you stop kill a hundred deadites theyll still attack you  graphics are ok to be a psone game hint run run and run
buy this if you are a big fan of the movies or if you like horror gamesthe man the myth the legend  bruce campbell
in a video game
its a fanboys dream
his voice has appeared in some playstation classics such as broken helix and pitfall d but never in his much immitated role as ash from the evil dead movies
so this game is a godsend right well not entirely
thq has surely shown its love for the series of movies
overall if its in the movies its in the game
everything from the dead girlfriend to the disembodied hand are covered in it
thq knew that as long as the fans got what they wanted to see they would buy it
they even went so far as to add a oneliner button so you could hear bruce campbells funny catchphrases as many times as you wantthe first half of the game covers the first two movies
ash takes a trip back to the hut to see if all he had been through was just a dream
it doesnt take long until a turn of events causes the tape with the reading of the necronomicon to be played and the dead rise again
starting with ashs trademark chainsaw arm and an axe in the other you set off to stop the evil again
the second half of the game takes place after you are transported back to the medieval age to wreak a little more havok on the plans of the undead
it even ends with a famous twist like the previous sam raimi moviesthe gameplay really takes the game away from the mainstream gamers and leaves this to only the fans of the movies
overall its just the control scheme from the earlier resident evil games except the difficulty is unreasonably high
you can tote two weapons one on each hand and do some creative combos  all  of them  really
upgrades to the chainsaw are aquired a few times during the game even turning it into a hacksaw
but the difficult part is that whenever you are in a fight  of the time its a hand to hand brawl so you are always guaranteed to get bashed
you are constantly using health packs after every fight
and the creatures are constantly respawning so even though the health packs are in great quantity fighting a monster more than twice ends up sucking up inventory and healthoverall this game is great for fans of the movie but gamers just looking for a good resident evil clone should just keep lookingwhen i heard about an evil dead video game i didnt know what to think
well the game isnt real bad but its not good at all either
first off the characters are blocky and the animation stiff the graphics look more  bit than  bit
not to mention the constantly respawning enemies theyre good for a scare but they keep the game frustrating and the controls could have been done a lot better
however here is where evil dead fans can rejoice the great bruce campbell offers his voice bringing ash to life plus so much attention to detail has been paid to the environments the cabin is straight out of evil dead  and the midevil stages look directly copied from army of darkness
all in all this game could have been an all time classic if the controls and gameplay would have gotten as much attention as the detail of the game did evil dead fans will have to play it either way but those who dont like the evil dead universe wont dig the gameeven though this game tries its best to be realistic it isnt all that fun
graphics are nice the music okay but its just too boring
because of this i would only recommend this to gamers looking for a simulation of the sport
more casual players should go try ssxdont get me wrong this game is great but it is so liitle and you can beat it in less than thirty minutes if you are playing it for the firs time
i played this game in the arcade and it was my favorite game for a long long time
when i saw that it was coming out for ps i perorderd it right away
when i took it ome i was thinking i got a big long lasting game
well it ended up i beat the game in about thirty minutes
this game is completly the same from the arcade
ig you want a good shooting game i would suggest to get unreal tournament or time splittersim sorry but i still comprehend the fact that this shooting game is missing a gun
i know this is a slow sniper game but still imagine playing area  and all the great sega arcade shooting games without that big freaking gun
besides that this games great ive tried shooting pedestrians but was banned from doing so
damnthere have been many star trek games over the years and while a few have been outstandingly fun others have been terrible and still others had great potential but were hobbled by flawed presentations
this game falls into the last categoryim going to write this in two sections
first some basics on on the game and on gameplay and second a how to about how to make the game run properly
about the game and gameplaystarting off i have to point out that several reviewers here have made categorically untrue statements about this gamefirst there are several who have stated that the game comes with no manual whatsoever
this is false
there is a manual
its small and is in fact a booklet found in the cd case
it provides all the information you need in order to play the game howeversecond several people have stated that there is no way to change the perspective of the game and that youre stuck in a behind view of the first ship you choose
this also is categorically untrue and had those people bothered to read the manual theyd know itfrom the bottom of page  of the included booklet manualbasic controlsmouseselect ship or destination  left mouse buttonanchor camera on object  doubleclick left mouse buttonzoom camera inout  hold both mouse buttons and move mouse updownrotate camera leftright  hold right mouse button and move mouse leftrightkeyboard to   select group  to ctrl   to   create group  to spacebar  toggles battlestrategy camera viewesc  pause game single player only  bring up saveload menuadditionally there are some other controls  see pages  and  of the manualc  open communicator multiplayer onlyreturn  send communicator message multiplayer onlyg  assign ship to guard a targetm  toggles movement grid onofft  activate transporterp  pause game single player onlyo  display mission objectives

those who have been overly critical of the game clearly never bothered to do soas far as general gameplay is concerned  its pretty challenging at times
you need to keep one eye trained on the tactical map its especially challenging when you briefly see a flash of a cloaked ship coming in and then have to guestimate where it may actually show upall gameplay is essentially on a single plane
this is common for star trek in general and is really necessary for this sort of gameplay
think of this as almost like an tabletop game rather than a true d space simulation
its a compromise but it doesnt harm the game playcombat is not directly controlled as a rule  that is youre not steering the ships with a joystick
then again a ships captain normally wouldnt be doing that and youre essentially playing a ships captain not a ships helmsman
youre giving orders your crew follow your ordersgraphics are pretty good but theres no antialiasing nor is there any ability to change graphical options
not a big deal but disappointing
the ships look fine upclose but higher resolutions and antialiasing would have made a huge difference in the prettiness factor of the game especially when viewed at tacticallyappropriate ranges
making the game run properlythe game as originally shipped version  is severely flawed with a number of scripting and programming bugs
it was clearly released before having been fully tested and it shows
there were several updates released with the final one being v
you can update sequentially from  to  to  to  to  but ive found that doing so causes significant issues with the games user interface
so i recommend finding the  to  patch doing a clean install of the program then installing this patchnext the code behind the mouse control is defective
it works fine provided that your screen resolution desktop screen resolution i mean
is sufficiently low
ive found that by setting my screen to x prior to running i escape any problems
however my systems native resolution is x and at that resolution the problem is definitely there
if you attempt to run it at that resolution youll find that assuming you get the application to run the software is unable to find the mouse and thus the program can only be killed by ctrlaltdelete and cannot be controlled at all
but if you start with a sufficiently low desktop resolution youll find that his problem does not occur
i dont understand how they managed to make this error but no patch ever fixed it
fortunately the fix is pretty easy if slightly inconvenientif youre running windows x thats all youll need to do to get the program running
on the other hand if youre running on winxp vista or win thats not enough
or rather if youre running directx  or higher thats not enough
there is an issue with the version of directx this was written for dx and later versions
it seems that directdraw ddrawdll was dramatically altered between the time that this software was written and the the release of directx   for those unfamiliar with this directx is the software microsoft puts out which allows software to have direct access to the hardware most games use directx for video and audio for example while desktop applications do not need directx
there is a fix for this which you can find if youre serious about running this program
i found the fix just yesterday which is why im writing this review todayyoull need to do a search for the terms dominion wars wrapper
i cant give the link address on here but youll find it pretty quickly using your favorite search engine im surethe file is a new dll file called ddradll
youll be putting this into the same directory as your programthen youll need to use a hex editor to actually change the program executable for the dominion wars program
this is not a trivial thing to do so youll need to be reasonably confident in what youre doing
but basically there are two places in that executable file dsdwexe where using a hex editor youll be changing the term ddrawdll to ddradll
if you do this itll allow the program to be run on windows xp windows vista or windows   the issues is with incompatibility with the old version of directx and by doing this basically youre substituting a renamed old version of directdraw for the current one without otherwise altering your computer
its a painless fix really except for the need to do hex editing
the publisher should really be responsible for providing this fix
however they publisher has shut down their games division entirely and no longer provide any form of support to this or to any other game they published
and unlike simon and schusters other programs which have no hardware acceleration and thus can be run from within a virtual machine this application cannot be run in a virtual machine and thus can only be run using the technique ive just describedhaving discovered this fix im now able to run the program for the first time in many years as im legally allowed to do under fair use laws
and as a result im having fun with what was really a pretty great star trek game for the first time in many yearsemi was a big disappointment because of its overall did not feel as a mi game
the environments felt fake and constructed like an amusement park too civilized and uninteresting
the graphics didnt fit the series because they moved from a charming hand drawn d graphics style to doll like d figures the controls where terrible and there where lots of bugs
it felt like they where trying too hard to make it funny in the writing and i did not like the way guybrush character was changedive got mixed feelings about this game
there isnt anything really wrong about this game but during the whole game i found myself comparing this game with grim fandango gt which i liked better
the graphics of mi are pretty good and the voiceacting is even superb but i didnt feel drawn into the game
it misses some kind of quotadventuremagicquot people whove played grim fandango know what i mean and if you havent played it go buy it
this is i think the most important feature that an adventure should have and this one lacks it mafia is hard to review because i have such mixed and strong feelings about it
in the end i do recommend it and i do understand some of the intense passion it has elicited among some of its fans but there were some serious limitations and problems for me with the game as well
some of those limitations have to do with my general disatisfactions with gaming in general i think games are fascinating for the most part but they are also consistantly a little disappointing
anyway thats alot of preamble
to get specific i prefer to go into the discussion of categories that are important to me as followsstory b  story is extremely important to me
in games sadly i find it takes too long a time to go too little a way into the story if they even bother to put together a decent story at all
mafia is no exception countless hours of play 
to cover maybe a half hour or  minutes of story
and that is  actually quite a bit better than most games like this
on the plus side the story here is actually pretty good
its told mainly in backstory about a fairly decent guy and how he gets involved in the mob in the s and about his career in the mob
in the specifics of some of the gameplay it is of course ridiculous no one killed that many people
but the general arc of the story is good the cutscenes are good excellent voice acting too
its suprisingly quiet and personal as a story in its funny way
i liked that
it had a little dignity
it was not great and well didnt quite hold together to the end but it was good mostly and it was respectful to its time to what it was and to its subject and inspirations
there were some ridiculous holes in the story  tiny spoiler warning like i cant see the consigliare doing what he did things that just made no sense and were more in service to gameplay and that did take some toll on the game
compared to a decent book or movie its grade would be maybe a d compared to most games probably an a maybe or acharacters b maybe even b also very well done and related to the virtues in the story
your character is actually not a thug
hes a pretty decent guy for what he is i mean enough so to keep your sympathy enough to have the feeling of being real
his family really seems like the better of the two rivals and gets some of your sympathy i mean helps keep the game a little grounded
they bother to put things in context and try to flesh out the characters a bit
and its here that it parts hugely from gta which is its relative of sorts you can play it a little on the level of being this character not just an empty shooter but sort of playing the part of someone else someone possible in a way its not just purely a joke which seriously is the only way to play gta love it or not kind of as a mean jokegameplay c  starts to get very complicated here
some of it was really really good most of it alot of the shooting good mix of driving a diverse feel to alot of the different scenes you go through
had a crisp honest feel to the stuff that worked both in level design and in the feel of shooting and driving
some things didnt work so well and seemed absurd a fighting scene run away hit run away hit a notoriously difficult racing scene though a patch helps that
some of the stuff with allies was frustrating because they could be criminally stupid
i cant remember all the problems now and they wouldnt have been such severe problems if it werent for some of the other issues belowgraphics a dont know if there are even new games out there now that are much better than this
technically sure not that this game slouches too much on that score yet  i just mean they got the feel of the era dead on and take you through things that makes the world theyve created have some real life
its very impressivedreariness factor b i mean this in terms of darkness dank characters and killing things all of which can grind on me
this game is certainly not lighthearted or full of good times but it has its moments of sweetness and relief and with the big open city the story the little touch of humbleness well it really keeps that dread level down
the one that so easily overcomes computer games especially shooters and action adventure gameslearning factor c not too bad an in game tutorial but could have been a little more detailed still i appreciated it
it took me a long time to learn to drive decently as it was my first driving game
but it was all mostly simple and clear
it wasnt notably fun to learn though and there was not too much that was like wow i can do that
product materials  b cant remember how helpful the book was fairly good i think though more complete info would be nice
i dont need a guide to the characters as i actually meet them in cutscenes that i watch passively
i found the map modestly essential and would be afraid to buy the jewel case version as i figure it doesnt have it but dont actually knowchore factor well f maybe be prepared
there is  alot of driving and i just mean you put your speedlimiter on so you dont have to worry about cops and you drive and drive
it is somewhat effective in immersing you in the world and even the mundaneness of it but it  is  also  very  dreary
b there are huge scenes or levels or whatever you want to call it where if you fail you start again
from the beginning wherever the last autosave point was
sometimes it is not much and sometimes it is way way back at the start of the scene
i am talking about like i drove  minutes saw a cutscene maybe found someone killed fifteen people guy pops out from out of nowhere whoops he shoots me down and the game is over
i have to go back to doing the drive again see the cut scene kill the people  i am decidedly not a fan of no in game saves to begin with indeed yes i  hate  them
but this is the worst of them all
this game is sometimes quite difficult i like easier games and maybe am not great at games but i am not horrible either and so i found myself repeating many long things many many times
i hated this
they couldve fixed this a few ways but failed on all accountstechnical issues this is always tricky because computers are different so no grade but i had some ugly problems with this game namely one problem and it was the worst
the game would sometimes crash while saving and going to the next scene
so all my complaints about playing through some long thing  times and finally making it through only to have the game crash and have to try again well lets just say it made it feel ornerydifficulty  d  yes i know everyone is always going on in reviews about things being too easy and so on though not in this game so much that ive seen
fine
but i am not like that
for one thing i like meaningful difficulty levels ie
easy is actually easy then maybe a slightly challenging level challenging and brutal
this game has no difficulty settings and it is hard
i made it though i used a glitch for the car race thing but with the no in game saves it was kind of cruel
it is a testament to the good parts of the game that i did make it but with an easier setting or in game saves id probably be singing the praises of this game alot moregame saves f  as noted above
none
the automatic ones are sometimes close together and sometimes far apartother  c the game is strongly story oriented but when youre finished it has the freeride extreme thing which is a little more gta like
i tried it a little
if anything it was a bit harder and it wasnt terribly interesting to me as id had enoughthe s
the era of prohibition bootlegged liquor and the mob
mafia from illusion softworks brings us back to that by gone era with some good graphics and decent albeit uneven gameplaymafia tells the story of tommy angelo
a mobster who really just wants to do quotthe right thingquot
as a story mafia works
the cutscenes are surprisingly photorealistic and are well acted and presented
unfortunatley its the gameplay between the story segments that partially drags the game downmafia can almost be described as a s grand theft auto
only it doesnt quite pull it off as well
set in the fictional chicagonew york hybrid city of quotlost heavenquot the game renders the period extremely well
the streets have that very old time look to them
imagine new york before the quoturban renewelquot of the late s and early s
the city is also enormous in size
the game however didnt run very smoothely in places on my mhz  sdram  mb nvidia graphics card machine even though its recomended for machines as slow as  mhz
even with the graphical problems
this is a very nice looking game
the sound is also pretty good
pedestrians scream bullet casings clang on the ground
even the car radio plays period music
there are quite a bit of sounds that give it a more authentic period feel
the game is installed over three discs and requires  gigs of hard drive space to installthe gameplay is however is a mixed bag
the driving portions of the game are tedious due to the lack of an in game map
making it easy to get lost
a compass in the left hand corner helps with navigations so does the radar to some degree the target appears as a red x on the radar only when youre within about half a mile from it
you can also travel the city in street cars and on elevated trains
and theres always the option of traveling on foot
there are also a varitey of period weapons to choose from tommy guns to a baseball bat reminiscent of the film the untouchables
the controls are fairly easy to negotiate even for a pc game
the game is also pretty long and also has a quotfree ridequot option so you can go on a rampage if you so desireall in all this is a pretty good game for the money
im not sure if i would pay the full playstation  price for it
but at the current price pc of  this is a good valuei actually bought this game a few years ago and never got around to playing it
i finally opened it up and installed it about a month ago and gave it a ride
unfortunately that is all this game really seemed to be for me a ride
i did not get very far into this game before becoming bored with the constant car driving missions
i am probably not being completely fair to the game perhaps there was a lot of great action later in the game that did not involve being a taxi service but i could not stand anymore of it and gave up
i am not a person whom enjoys timed missions in fact i find them almost completely useless and very aggravating
nearly every video game i have ever played that has timed missions gets marked down in my book
mafia is no exception
i found the graphics to be decent especially for an older game
i also enjoyed the dialog quite a bit
but i just can not get past the monotonous driving sequences
how many times do i have to taxi some schmuck across town before i can actually do something else
in my humble opinion this is a slight knockoff of max payne which is a much better game without the needless driving sequences
i love the whole mafia storyline i am just disappointed it didnt play out a little better in the beginningoverall  averagehd is a very nice well produced ww shooter but some of the more ambitious aspects couldve been toned down a bitall in all this game reminds me of a cross between ghost recon and splinter cell in a ww theater
the core of the gameplay is very good and certainly on par with any other shooter out there
where the game mostly suffers is in the less prominent aspects of gameplaythe tactical setup imho is far too cumbersome to be as useful as it could be
to cite ghost recon as reference you were able to plot and execute group commands quickly and on the fly though the use of a simple tacmap
hds interface by comparison requires far too much clickity click and forces you to pull away from the real action to plot manuverswhile this arrangement is suited well enough to more complex environments a simpler interface would have been nice to see included as supplement to itall in all theres no reason any fan of ww shooters or tactical shooters in general should not check this one out
the games respectably high production values and good core dynamics make up for its few shortcommings well enoughimaginary interior of pyramid beautifully renderedmysterious flaming torches everywhere
i have xp but got and tried this older versiondo not obey when it says to change resolution
works ok on regular
movement frustrating
every click brings another wheezing whirr until that bit has loaded itselfgantenbricks tunnel was approx  minutes longit does not bring ancient egypt to lifeboring plod through beautiful but rather pointless scenesperhaps it was the intention here to suggest that an exhausting trek through dead ruins and new age myths is in their opinion a waste of timeeven with all the xp tech probs of the older game beyond time its worth  more than this stupid hodgepodge of useless broken dusty imaginary objectsi grant you i have this silly obsession of wanting to know why ive gone through how many tombs all in the great pyramid and for what purpose
all to find out something i saw indiana jones do to the nazisgame is kind of interesting in the egyptian stuff but nothing other than blind determination  given that id paid full price for it really kept me going
i bought it and by god im going to play it
this should not be why one plays a gamegame starts real slow sound on my copy kept cutting out but rebooting helped
collect a lot of stuff along the waystill to be fair i see there is a sequel
dare i hope
too many loose ends atlantis
mayans
bermuda
stonehenge
go ahead and buy it but there are other egyptian theme stuff out theregame played well no small thing  all things considered
i do like to think that ive earned doing stuff right so i should get a freebe on that one  no cut scenes
im picky and its my moneyi purchased the jewel case version for  but wouldnt pay more for it
maybe because i had just finished a nancy drew game that i found this game to be somewhat tedious and boring
there were lots of rooms to look through  items to pick up that all looked the same after a while
and the ending was so blah blah blah with all its preachiness about religion
a few of the puzzles were challenging
like i said its just an ok gameriddle of the sphinx is a classic puzzle game that draws its theme from many of the new age atlantean and alien invasion versions of human history
sort of a blend of indiana jones and the x files
it is set at the great pyramid and the sphinx in contemporary egypt
as indicated this is like many dreamcatcher games a puzzle game not a true adventure
as such the action is limited to running back and forth in order to find clues and complete puzzlesit is a difficult game to evaluate fairly
it is the product of a small team two to be exact that literally worked out of their house
as such it represents a remarkable effort
unfortunately like many games from dreamcatcher there is little cause for excitement
when compared to a game developed by a full team  such as ultima ix or the longest journey these efforts come off very badlyone has to keep in mind that dreamcatcher sells these games for considerably less than its bigger brothers
the truth is that rots is almost a very good game
it does have several flaws
first of all it is not clear what your real object is until the end of the game
it turns out that this is intentional but it leaves you feeling a bit at a loss when you are trying to make sense of the clues
another problem is the somewhat unorthodox user interface
i was perpetually hitting the wrong key
this will take a bit of getting used tothe scenery is very pseudoegyptian but doesnt really ring true
it is the source of several of the irritating inconsistencies in the game as well
finally there is a hint book for sale
it seems that every time game designers market a hint book as well as the game they view this as a license to create puzzles that are hard to virtually impossible it sells hint books after all
this turns a reasonable priced game into a purchase of questionable valuethis is really a  star game but i cannot in all conscience give it the benefit of the doubt and round up to a four
even so the designers display a good bit of talent
hopefully future efforts will benefit from there initial experiencesi have owned this game for nearly  years now and only just this week finally manage to put it in and play it
of course this game dates way back to the original run of socalled myst clones  it is a testament to the trends of puzzle gaming of that time  poorly acted video actors superimposed over fuzzy animated backgrounds introducing a banal storyline
then read tons of journals and notes find maps pixel hunt on every screen to find the one item that can be picked up for whatever reason you wont know until you find the one place to use it its all herebut it is not without its charm
for whatever reason egyptatlantis games seem to have been an overwhelming favorite of game developers in the late s
here you will spend you time between two pyramids mostly inside the second one
most of the puzzles have ample clues to help you along  even so i found it all too easy to just have a walkthrough open nearby so i could breeze through any trouble spots  the game and its outdated graphics simply didnt interest me enough to give it a cold trywhat really brings the score down for me is the navigation
every room or hallway or tunnel requires dozens of clicks to navigate through  there is rarely any motion animation to the movement i get it its an old game so the programmers seemed to think that having you click through a slideshow of screens just to get down every hallway would help to create this sense of depth
it just made things tedious for me especially when i had to back track
fortunately there is a warp function to bypass a lot of these long passages  unfortunately these warp points only show up every so oftenas i said most of the puzzles had ample clues but there were a few annoyingly unnecessary roadblocks  one in particular involved finding three weights that were randomly placed half buried in the sand in different parts of the pyramid  took a really sharp eye to spot thoseif you are a major fan of the adventure game genre then you will likely find enough here to warrant your time with it  but if you bore easily i would look to some better games like the original myst seriesi played the windows me edition on a pc running windows xp and didnt run into any glitch issuesits hard to get a good picture on older consoles with a hdtv
though this did offer a small upgrade in picture its nothing spectacular
the bottom line is if you want a good picture from a ps ps nintendo snes genesis or other older console youve got to have an older solid state crt style television
otherwise the gameplay will look choppy or blurrynot listed above it does run on winxp
people pointing rifles at your capital building is kinda wrong
hot keys do a virus like take over of the machine after you are done forcing a reboot ie r brings up the run menu
otherwise this spanish sim is more fun that the first simcity
earth grid and weather look exactly like simcity
when you start there are no easly levels but there is one moderate so it is kinda a pain to figure out who needs what
and eventually you grow to hate your people so im giving it a  for that
but it is a good step forward in sim graphics and humorit uses railroad tycoon s engine be your own  every person on your island is affected by human stuff like hunger and thirst environment  around himindustries are bad for that and forests are probably good   different ways to get money tourisma clean island with big beaches and  lots of attractionsrecoursescut woodmine stone and goldand  industriesthisll kill the tourismbut its probably a lot of moneyand  there seems to be  groups of ppl on your island military peasantsand  religiousokay i waited a long time for tropico to come out and overall ive been a little dissapointed with itthe game is fairly complex which is fine but the game manual is lacking in lots of hard data required to base good game decisions on
also has quite a few horrible copy editing errors in key passages so as to render it nonsensicalgaining information during gameplay can be tedious as the interface is a little bit of clickfest through many pages on information
it takes quite a few hours of play to work out where to find everything
it also lacks some obvious info like quotunderemploymentquot as wellthe other issue i found troublesome is the graphics
yes it is quotlush and beautiful dquot but frankly after  minutes of play i was missing the simple d look of rollercoaster tycoon
the buildings in tropico are quotto scalequot which means if you want to see a useful view of the buildings all the people disappear
likewise if you want to see the people up close and personal you cant see much more than a wall of one building
i never found a relaxing viewpoint to play the game from
damn hard to find a particular individual person to throw into jail bribe or whatever toomuch of the pregame hype was that it was an amusing game but nothing really tickled the old funny bone
maybe i just needed a more powerful computer to see the the individual animations or something
also the whole election process is very anticlimatic and i nearly stuffed the disk back into the box after i had my first electionthe good news is that the game seems to be very stable and i had no bug errors to deal with
overall the game seems to have an interesting socioeconomic model to play with i just never warmed up to the gameif you compare the first week that you own tropico with any other game it rates high
a creative portrayal of your typical island dictatorship not many software companies make a strategyplanning game that is also mixed with fun gameplay
an example is your presidential advisor congratulating you when you have accumulated a large bank account in switzerland
the problem with tropico is that the game quickly becomes boring
when rating a game no matter how astounded i am at first with the creative gaming concept impressive graphics etc
 i feel there are many pc games that just arent worth the price that we as consumers pays when you consider how limited the time is that the game remains interestingthe game adapts some elements of sim city with more emphasis on political strategy
this in itself gives the game a unique appeal because not many strategy games give the user an opportunity to have a freehand with the imaginary nations politics
another difference between this and sim city besides the fact that it is more of a south american island culture is that because of your islands limited size tropico is more animated and detailed
you can track the residents of your city as they make their daily rounds and look at their family living conditions politics etcif youre a gamer that enjoys planning games something in the mold of sim city rollercoaster tycoon andor railroad tycoon
youll definitely be more inclined to enjoy this game
while i am a fan of these types of games i felt that tropico didnt offer enough variety to make it last long
the scenarios included are slightly interesting but sim city  is a game in the same genre that is more entertaining
there is a downloadable demo available on the internet
i would suggest you give the demo a try before purchasing the software and keep in mind that the format of the demo is the same as the full game with the exception that they have not allowed a few buildings type to be completed in the demoyou are el presidente dictator of a small island nation
you have your faults your strengths and an island to govern
better get startedi like tropico its a different approach on a city building game
you can set your own scenarios with strengths and weaknesses favors time limit money and other things that make it so you never have to play the same scenario twice
you can also play one of the predefined scenarios but there are only a few and most of them are rated hard which doesnt make them all that appealing to the beginneri didnt mind the game but after a while it got to be old you didnt know what you needed to do to make your various factions happy and i never figured out what relations with the us and russia were meant to do
it really struck me as a way to play fidel castro in cuba but with different shaped islands
the novelty wore off after a couple weeks and i went in search of a new game
if you tire of a game quickly i dont suggest this gameif your thinking about purchasing tropico then you should think about playing the demo first
i played the demo to begin with and was quite pleased with the playability of the game since it runs fast with any d accelerator card
to me its just another sim game where you would build up a tropical island and manage it in many areas such as entertainment political and of coursefinancialthe game is very appealing at first when you start to play it especially in the demo version but of course like all demos your restricted on certain options which entices you to buy the full version
you dont so much as interact with any of the people within tropico but you do have to keep them happy in the areas stated at the end of the first paragraph
given a island your on your way as you start building residence entertainment centres police stations etc keeping track is easy but does prove to be a challenge once you get into the gameconclusion the game is a very nice game to play but can get a bit too repetitive
play the game for some time then put it away in the back of the drawer and play it again when your boredsome people though like this type of game and i do not wish to put you off itjust make sure you play the demo and if you love the gameim glad but its just not meok if youre thinking of buying this game i would not recommend it uness you like managing things
this game has a few good pros and some really bad cons
for example the graphics in the game are really detailed but their stale and lifeless
the only fun i really had playing this game was when i first started a game
i enjoyed building up my city with buildings like pubs farms and even a hotel or two
the game can even be addictive after you build an electric plant
but what happens once youve built everything and you have a good economy
there is nothing left to do except treat you citizens as sims and make them start a coup against you
but like i said earlier get this game if you like games that go on and on without end or something to doblair witch rustin parr is an excellent scarefest
as soon as i started looking for clues in the dark my hair started to stand on it ends
the sounds and the shadows make this a must seehowever it seems like it was designed as a sequel to nocturne
you have to go through quotzombiequot killing training and there is a quotdreamquot sequence where you must kill zombies
this ruined the story for me
blair witch is effective when it is about what you cant seeif they would have left the quotkillingquot and the graphic violence out this would have been an effective adventure game on the lines of kings quest
i give this came a bive had the three blair witch computer games ever since i bought the blair witch experience set several years ago but ive never really taken any of them for a spin until now
given the pathetic nature of the second movie i had to wonder what kind of content might be stretched across three whole games
the rustin parr case makes a natural choice for the first volume as its really the most visceral and disturbing part of the fictional blair witch legend
you all remember rustin parr  the guy who killed seven kids in his basement walked to burkittsville to announce he was finally finished and testified that the blair witch made him do it
you dont actually get to meet rustin parr in this game but you do sort of follow in his footstepsin many ways so they say this is a sequel to nocturne
it uses the nocturne engine and borrows the character of elspeth doc holliday a sort of prexfiles agent investigating weird stuff for the spookhouse
after a rather annoying but somewhat helpful tutorialtype workout at home base you as holliday are dispatched to burkittsville to see if theres anything to the whole blair witch story or not
its  just after parrs arrest and you have to explore the town interview townsfolk and  of course  explore the dark forests where evil is said to lurk
the locals are rather tightlipped and pretty darn lacking in personality and your contact with them mostly consists of cut scenes  so theres not much challenge there
youll spend most of your time in the forest which can be rather mazelike
i dont know why computer game makers think we enjoy wandering around lost in a maze so much but there you goyou do get to kill things though
since you cant go around shooting the residents of burkittsville unfortunately the game makers came up with the idea of zombies wild dogs and stick creatures wandering the forests
its quite a stretch really as the whole blair witch thing sort of fades into the background of ancient indian folklore as recounted by a strange indian living in the dark forest
clearly gameplay and story depth are not this games major strengthswhat makes the game interesting and in its own little way somewhat impressive is the atmosphere provided by the nocturne engine
the look of the game is quite effective as are the sounds
as you walk through the forest your ears are treated to the sounds of the leaves crunching under your feet and the eerie sounds of childrens voices somewhere off in the distance some of whom are calling for help while ghostlike images of children as well as beasts pop in and out of your sight
the creepiness multiplies when you get the chance to explore the infamous parr house where shadows of children suddenly appear in the corners before fading away before your very eyes
none of this is going to make you start calling for your mommy but there is a definite level of creepiness to this otherwise bland gaming experiencein the end though the lack of challenging gameplay and all the ridiculous wandering around in the forest trying to find your way trumps the creepy atmosphere
theres just too little to do with too little payoff for your time and effort
different camera angles make for awkward control at times and the thirdperson perspective keeps you from really being drawn into the action
the ending is particularly blaseacute and so it is that i must declare the blair witch volume  rustin parr a decidedly average gaming experiencei love the feel of this controller
the shape is good
feels good in your hands
buttons feel solid
cord is very long about the same length the official ps controller
has rumble and pressure sensitive buttons some things third party controllers often skimp on
its heavy and has a sturdy and quality feel to it
a great controller all around exceptthe control sticks on mine make a crunching or snapping sound when you use them in certain directions
i thought maybe mine was just new and stiff but it never went away
i considered opening it up and seeing what was wrong but decided against it because it functions normally
i also decided not to return it because i got a good deal and it doesnt totally ruin the controller
now maybe it was just my controller that does this but i just thought i would warn you guysthis controller is ok it dosent work that good on ps games but it works ok on the ps games
it is big giving firsttimegamers a good feel and has a  cord
it however is made my interact accesories and they make horrible products
it might break sooner or later like the memory cards they make
it is a  star for ps and a  star for psthis is not the original cable for any of the playstation consoles
the quality just looks straight out cheapit works though and its cheap so i can place a larger profit on this item as long as it works but if you have the money get a higher quality or original sony av cableall that really mattered to me is that the product worked
you can tell that its a bootleg version
but for what it is
it works and it was cheap and i was happy with itno quality looks cheap but for the price its hard to complain
i bought just to put with a ps console to resell so the price was alot cheaper than buying an original av cable
but if i was buying for myself i would of spent a few extra dollars to ensure i had a high quality sony made product instead of this light weight cheap quality cable
but on the other hand it works fine and i never ran across any problems with it
i just prefer quality for myself i find it difficult to really pin down what made grandia ii a soso game
perhaps if i had played it before skies of arcadia i would not have found the story and characters so tepid
it is predictable and at times tiresome
the battle system is really a lot of fun though and it has the exact right amount of encounters
the music of the game is also very impressive
while the game was fun it just lacked any real empathy
in skies i felt an attachment to the characters and wanted them to overcome
in grandia ii i was just waiting for the next fight as the plot was silly
i would recommend this game if you like console rpgs but only as an after thoughtgrandia is a unique game more of a collaboration of successful elements from classic rpgs than an altogether new game unto itself
there are elements of multiple square and enix role players in here as well as aspects of several other games im sure ive overlooked
still despite borrowing so much from its predecessors grandia ii remains a fresh playunfortunately i cant say the same for the storyline
this is about as mediocre of a plot as ive ever run across
your focal character ryudo is a warrior for hire trying as hard as humanly possible to come off like a real badass but failing miserably
the number of times he says quotdamnquot becomes almost comical by the time youre a couple hours into the gamepretty much every rpg cliche is handled in this one
there are a few moments where i think a little bit of religious commentary is trying to peek through but theyre smothered very quickly by the horrendous writing
four hours in and id already quit speaking to noncentral characters
a lot of time and effort went into giving the regular townsfolk a lot to say but i quit caring after the first village
none if its important or even interestingthe dialogue is almost painful at some points
writers try their damndest to borrow from shakespheare  at one point completely butchering the quote in the process
i kid you not a character actually utters the infamous phrase quothes got intestinal fortitudequot thats right they jump from shakespheare to gorilla freaking monsoon
once you make that leap theres no going back
believability just flew out the windowtheres voice acting in key moments of the game which varies from good to downright awful
ryudos voice sounds hauntingly similar to kanedas in the original english dub of akira complete with the occasional squeak and squawk of puberty
come to think of it all the games voice acting sounds like it came straight out of an anime
id be surprised to find out otherwise
still for the most part the voices match the characters and i found myself enjoying the actors struggle to make poorly written lines work in a dramatic context
unfortunately whoever was in charge of the final mixing didnt share my enjoyment as he put the background noise and music way up
there are points where i cant understand the spoken dialogue thanks to the overpowering musical score or sounds of the villages
thank god for subtitlesspeaking of anime the games spells and graphics offer something unique in this realm
there are portions of grandia ii where liverendered game graphics interact with prerendered animated material and god help me it actually seems to work
this is something that couldve been really really over the top if done too often but the team surprisingly used the effects sparingly maximizing their effect
its an interesting interaction and i cant say its without its quirks but ive got to give them credit for tryingtruth be told i really enjoy the battle system we see here
there are shades of star ocean the second story mixed with touches of final fantasy chrono trigger and dragon warrior
theres no such thing as a random encounter in this world monsters appear on the maps just the same as your playable character does
if youre running low on life you can try to avoid confrontations or if youre looking for experience you can hunt down every last monster in the area
if you steer into the backside of a monster youll be granted quotinitiativequot or first strike
if a monster catches you from behind theyve quotsurprisedquot you and gain first strike themselves
its easy to understand and works flawlesslythe system works despite being somewhat shallow
rather than the final fantasy or dragon warrior method all your guys line up on one side all their guys line up on the other they go instead for a strange mix of chrono trigger and star oceans styles everyone interacts with everyone else
its still turnbased at heart but there are new factors you have to compensate for its possible to catch a monster intransit from his position to the spot hes chosen to attack disrupting his turn
even if your sword is in midswing inches from an adversarys head if they get the spell off they get the spell off
time effectively freezes when a spell or special attack is used which can be both very useful or really annoying
its a fun system that almost completely makes up for the sharp lack of a storygraphically this is certainly a dreamcast game
everything moves almost too smoothly characteristic of the system in my eyes but its better than anything youd have seen on playstation at the time
its like if square had released final fantasy vii on the ps
textures look much better polygons are much much smoother but what it all boils down to is somewhat blocky figures with no nose or mouth
moments in the game are downright beautiful the reflections on the floor in the cathedral the mist coating the floors of a later dungeon but they couldve pushed things it a little furtherif music is a factor youll want to skip this entirely
the score is downright awful almost a mockery of itself
songs mismatch horribly with their surroundings attracting attention to themselves rather than blending into the background and setting a tone for the scene
when youre drawn into a battle i halfexpect giant computerrendered footballs to fly across the screen
the guitar and horndriven rock sounds like it leapt directly from monday night football into the score of grandia ii
while playing weve actually started coming up with our own sportsrelated lyrics
its that badwhat it all boils down to is a really really fun battle system nice graphics that cant possibly compete with the stuff were seeing on the shelves today a nasty musical score and a forgettable storythis rpg does not have a very interesting story to it
however i like the game system
the gauge of initiative is pretty neat
the game is geared towards young babies
the battles are not very difficult and neither are the dungeons
the leveling of the characters are very fastthis game functions real well as a starter rpg
more experienced rpg gamers might be a little bored with its shortcomings
the are four reasons for this the story line the linear game play the semireal time battle sequence and the lack of any real challengestory the story fails almost completely in both presentation and substance
the main character is ryudo
he is a mercenary with a troubled past sent out on a job to protect the pure good girl of the land
now where have we seen that before
of course you see where this is goingryudo uncovers his past and finds strength from within to stop fighting for money and start fighting for justice
now the story itself isnt bad per se but the thing is we have heard it all before
if you take two or three classic rpgs any will do and piece together the story lines you get this one
so if you are new to rpgs then it will be new to you so you wont be bothered by it
however rpgs are special because unlike other video games they rely heavily on the story
rpg fans wont find much to cheer about with this bland tale
also the characters lines harp on the same points over and over again
for example towards the end the game the word heart appears so much in the dialogue that you would think you are reading cardiology weekly
the story awkwardly stumbles along never quite gaining its footing
presentation is also off key
annoying voiceovers have ryudo sounding more like a surfer dude than a swordwielding hero
the in game movies are also subpar for dreamcasts capabilitieslinear game play this game is extremely linear
this meaning that you always know exactly where to go and what you have to do
besides one or two special areas when you advance in the story you dont even have the option of going anywhere but forward
for people who object to rpgs by saying things like you spend hours fighting pointless battles searching for your next task this is the game for you
also for a beginner rpg player this type of setup puts frustration at a minimum
however if you are into totally nonlinear rpgs like wizardry for example this game will be boring with a capital bbattle sequence the battle sequence is the best part of this game
it is a semireal timeturn based mode of battle
this makes fighting flow more evenly
despite the times where my characters would attack an enemy out of view i liked it immensely
it is an original action oriented way to structure the battle sequence
by strategizing your turns and types of moves you can limit certain enemy attacks
also you have the ability to make quick decisions to guard from an oncoming attack or evade before the enemy makes it to your side of the screenchallenge the game is real easy
probably too easy
there are many spells special moves and skills to learn
while all these enhance the game and add variety after about  way through it is pretty hard to be hit much forget about being killed
moreover at a save point you can automatically recover your entire hpmp etc
any enemy near a save point is toast because you can throw everything you have at them and after the battle fully recover
at no cost to you
also since you can see your enemies no random fight generator before battle you can almost always sneak up behind them and get the first attack
after very little practice learning the ins and outs of the battle sequence you can usually kill off most nonboss enemies without them getting a hit off
again good for the beginner and sort of pointless monotony for the experienced gamerby far the worst part of the game was the story
if you can ignore that you have about  hours of fun if not challenging game play
i would recommend it to beginner rpgers and experienced rpgers that just cant get enough games under their beltsi just got this package and let me first say that it is a great looking game with an intuitive interface and seemingly bug free
here are my problems with the game  the only strategic element in the game is when where and how you move your units in to engage the enemy
that is pretty much it
there are no recources to manage nothing to collect nothing to build and nothing to research
you have no idea what type of weapons you or your enemy are using and what the relative combat effectivness of those weapons are
unlike other civil war games i have played victory points are somewhat meaningless as they have no application to future scenarios or battles
for example i have quotcivil war generalquot a turn based civil war game and in that game how badly you beat up on an opponent and thereby how much quotsupplyquot you obtain from making him give up ground counts towards your total supply points which then allows you to purchase better weapons for your troops in future parts of the campaign
without this consideration as in this game there is little point to going the extra mile to really trounce your opponent you merely have to meet the scenarios objective and that is it
the game eventually boils down to you sitting there and watching your guys shoot
you do not have to monitor their morale organization or health
the units even retreat on their own
you also have no idea of your units relative combat effectivness from a numerical standpoint v the opposing unit you want to engage
you also have no control over who your unit directs its fire against you just move them into relative proximity with the enemy and they start shooting
while the map is beautiful it is difficult to determine what is high and low ground and whether your unit is on that area
in other games of this genre your units info card will tell you their elevation and level of cover however there is no such feedback in this game except what kind of terrain you are on grass woods etc
you really have no conception of how the terrain affects your unit from a numerical standpoint only that one type of terrain is better than another
without this info it is very difficult to decide how and where to conduct an attackas this game is only  it is well worth buying and it is very historically accurate
i just would have liked to have seen it in a campaign type mode with the above considerations it really has potentialinstall this expansion pack and youll see that you can add more family members in your house
youll see new furnitures wallpapers and appliances
this will enhance your gameplay from the initial the sims
this expansion pack may not be as worthy as it says
not many new items are added
it would be better if you pick another expansion pack for the sims
refer to my other reviews on other expansion packs for more details
however if you are a the sims addict you may want this to complete your collectionthe added neighborhoods were cool but they dont interactive run out of quotoomphquot on this game and lost interestacording to me all of the sims games are fun and entertaining at first then after a month or so it gets a bit too slowthis is the first sequel that maxis made to the sims and it is an ok addon but its nothing to rave about
first you dont get many new things
an item here or there and four new jobs but other than that nothing
so its really only a mediocre addonwhen i first bought this game i was expecting something just a bit more
the last nhl game i had played created by ea sports was nhl   viewed today by most standards as an quotoldquot game
since playing nhl  i have actually gone back to playing nhl  several times
the graphics for nhl  were amazing almost life like and the cheesy but funny expressions of the players from nhl  had been replaced with excellent frowns and smiles
however the good portion of the game stops right about there
i wasnt nearly as pleased with the game as i was expecting to be mainly for one reason  the realism
instead of realistic checking players go head over heels goalies allow way too many goals and the overall ai
is weak
the biggest problem ive had so far has been the difficulty settings
i have the difficulty setting maxed out allstar and am playing as only an average team which has so far won every single game in the season ive played in
that is completely unrealistic
for any major gamer who loves hockey but also wants a challenge like me  dont expect much with this title
the graphics will cover up the bad spots at first but after you learn the ai
moves and stratagies itll be goal after goal after goalps
dont even try playing the game using a full  minute period  the score will be outragous sometimes   
unless of course you like winning every time
ive been playing ea sports games since the days of  for sega and pc and their performance has gone from simulation to arcade
not my styleicethe idea of black and white is great on paper
the idea that you can be a deity winning followers over and defeating other gods sounds like a great ideaunfortunatly black and white suffers from poor execution
first of all there are the miracles
in order to select them you first have to move the mouse in certain patterns which is somewhat annoying
the major flaws however are the boring tutorial which cannot be skipped and every new career you start must take and the micromanagement required to keep a village believeing in youalso once you get used to these things the game is only fun for a week or so before it gets boring
i wouldnt recommend paying more than  dollars for this gameokay lets get the worst over right from the start the interface is bad
its as simple as that it is a very poor interface and it actively hampers the game which is why im dinging it a full two stars
i understand what the designers were shooting for which is a thoroughly immersive and natural interface but the mouse isnt the right technology for what they were attempting
now if vr gloves ever start to penetrate the consumer market then such an interface could be justifiedthat said if you can grit your teeth and look past the interface and for many players thats just not going to be possible the game itself is nothing short of revolutionary
its complex its detailed its entertaining its imaginitive and above all else it is utterly engrossing
ive never played a godstyle game where you actually started to feel like a deity in charge of real people with the full range of responsibilities and most innovatively moral choices that such a being would face
its refreshing that the game doesnt compell you to be a good guy or punish you for being a bad guy
in spite of that ive found that its actually rather hard to deliberately be a malevolent deity for the very reason that you are so thoroughly powerful and your people are so thoroughly powerless
indeed when i accidentally wreck havok see above notes regarding the interface i tend to feel bad about my actions and i find that i want to do something to set things right
i suspect that for many people the game is going to be a moral inkbloti cant overstress the problems with the interface
i can understand why that would suffice to drive a person away from the game
its also true that the game has stability issues thank the avatars that i had a spare computer to install it on it simply locked on the livingroom system in spite of all efforts
but its also true that there is much to love about this game and if nothing else i would encourage people to buy it just to support this style of game and this level of creativity in game design
it may be a flawed child but it is still a gifted infantwow
i had no idea that other people had such a problem with this game
i bought it when it first came out in  and i thought it was fantastic
i played and i played passing every tutorial challenge and god that dared oppose me
and finally i was confronted by nemesis my ultimate foehe challenged me for final control and domination and i accepted
and my goodness i wish i had never gone through that portalas another reviewer put it and so well i think black  white is simply a micromanagement hell
you constantly have to work tending to your numerous and ever greedy people trying to educate and spend time with your creature trying to defeat other gods passing challenges fighting other creatures trying to win faith and influence heathen villages exploring recapturing villages warding off other godsi think you get the idea
its simply impossible to do all of this
i played this game twice and eventually gave up because of its impossibility
now i hate giving up on a game and consider myself a good gamer and great strategist
but you cant finish without cheats or some kind of secret i dont know
i feel embarassed not to be able to finish this game it insults me
and i tried my hardest
if you finished without cheats i think you really are a god
ill spit shine your shoes and chew your food for the rest of eternitynow back to my storythe final challenge facing nemesis
firstly the jerk puts some curse on your creature making it small and feeble and the opposite of you
nice
then he gives you a village woohoo batman
for you to control
you now have to try and cure your poor creature by capturing villages and passing challenges
and i did that
and my creature went back to normal
yay
but then it went back to being a tiny stinky loser
boo
and i have no idea why because i removed the curse
so i got over this and tried to take nemmys villages
which i did except for two which required so much belief it was scary
and then nemesis starts winning back faith and making you look like an ass with his creature
so i kicked the crap out of his creature with fire and lightning and my creature
and it came back again and again and again
and nemesis although far out of range of his influence could perform miracles in my territories
that bd
it was at this point i realised that there is no god excuse the pun in this game and packed it in forever after my second attempt at the game  years later
the exact same thing happened and i felt like a gaming failure
so yes i the mighty gamer was defeated by lack of logic or faith or whateverthe game itself was alot of fun barring the last stage
i thoroughly enjoyed the actual playing and fighting those idiot gods
it really kept me entertained and busy
but the last stage was just horrid disgusting
and whats with that future room
it always says the future is still uncertain
what a crock of sh
the futures always f uncertain nimrods
not you
its just a game that will eventually frustrate you and p you off
i would recommend it to those who like playing old games on those ridiculously hard settings like duke nukem and doom
i just couldnt do it as a  year old or as a  year old
maybe i could now but i dont have the patience or energy to try againin short black and white gets  overall and  for fun
if you enjoyed it completely im guessing you finished the game or cheated your way through
perhaps my days as a strategy game player are numbered though ive passed numerous strategy games on the hard setting since then such as earth  and red alert 
in any case those who finish black  white honestly deserve to be glorified in the eyes of strategy gamers for they cannot be mortal or of this earth
i wouldnt buy this game again purely because its  too old and  depressing
so make your choice but you have been warnedwell i admit it
i didnt do my research and bought this game because i heard great things about it
i wish i had done a little more research before i bought it
controling the creature is probably the funnest aspect of the game while the constant micromanaging of the villagers is the biggest letdown
this would have been a sure fire winner if i didnt have to worry about getting the villagers food and wood every  minutes
overall if you enjoy simulations and dont mind some tedious micromanagement this might be a game for you
if not take a pass on this oneim compelled to write a review about this game because it is groundbreaking in the fact that the gameplay is unlike any other game
if you find yourself bored by the same crop of first person shooters or command and conquer clones you may want to pick up a copy just to try something new and different but read on first to be sureconsidering ea owns the rights to the simcity franchise this game could have been accurately billed as quotsimgodquot  i think amazon and the other reviewers have done a good job of describing the gameplay so ill try not to be redundantfirst off when you first load the game  be prepared to spend a full evening playing around with it
the game starts off with a very well done introduction and teaches you how to move around  control the creature cast spells etc  youll find yourself drawn in very quickly as you want to see what happens next and that is where the problems startyou see when you first start out its rather unclear what it is you are supposed to do in this game
being weaned on many years of resource management games and trying to be a nice god i spent a long time trying to keep my villagers happy quotwe need houses we need foodquot yada yada yada but they would never shut up
its enough to make me go nuts and destroy everyone  which kind of makes me wonder if thats what god thinks of all of us but thats a different discussion
in any case it took me a while to figure out they wont shut up regardless and i just need to progress with whatever im doing and ignore them
thats a tip for all you new players
so what is it you are supposed to do
basically use your influence to take over villages which allow you to increase in power so you can take over more villages
at its heart it really is a resource management game much like command and conquer
instead of building up a bunch of tanks and army men to take over the next town you cast spells and use your creature in good ways or bad  to quotwowquot neighboring villages into worshipping you
if you dont youre stuck in this constant state of inertia trying to please your villagers who are never satisfied with anything you do
this is quite the opposite of the quotdo anything you wantquot sales pitch eas marketing department puts in their adsanother myth is the concept of your creature having free will and the ability to learn
this is far from the truth
basically the creature will do something and you either reinforce the behavior positively petting or negatively slapping
based on what you do the creature is quotsupposedquot to do that same action more often or less often
at the risk of this entire review not making it past the censors at amazon ill give you an example
you see i picked the tiger creature  not the brightest but supposedly a good fighter
well apparently it has decided it likes to poop on houses
its kind of funny to watch but the villagers understandably dont like this very much
ive been slapping the poop out of him pun intended but he wont stop
so much for the ability to learn
instead im supposed to try to get him to poop in the fields as itll help the crops grow
well what am i supposed to do
if i place the poop in the fields it just stands there
if i hand poop to him hell just look at me funny or worse yet try and eat it
i guess im the one that needs to be praying he poops in the fields so i can quickly pet him and reinforce the behavior
as far as the things the creature has done right positive reinforcement doesnt really seem to make him continue to do the same action
ive found the whole concept of trying to quotteachquot my creature very frustrating and its been more of an annoyance than an asset to the gameand fighting
its kind of like playing rockem sockem robots
theres no control
instead you just mash a lot of buttons and again pray you end up the winner
when winning a fight against another creature becomes a necessity in the game and i know it will eventually my inability to do so will probably be the point i put down the game and never play it againthe review is harsh so far i know but you see in spite of these problems i still find myself drawn to this game
in fact just writing this review has made me want to load it up again
the graphics and music really are topnotch and i havent run into any bugs or system crashes a rarety in the gaming world these days
im usually the type that will give a game one or two days at the max before giving up on it
even games i do like rarely hold my interest to the end
this game is a rare exception
i keep thinking maybe if i do something differentlyreread the amazon and dailyradar reviews or jump over to the pcgamer site and read all the praise theyve heaped on this game
contrast it with the review i wrote and hopefully itll help you decide whether this is the type of game you would be interested inblack and white got a number of things very right
graphics are cool the sounds are fun it has an unusual but effective interface and the quests move you along nicely
most successful are the little details that promote usercustomization i liked being able to create my own logo which then appears over my conquered villages and is a big tatoo on my creatures belly
renaming the villagers with everybody in my email list is fun too and my winamp tunes having an effect in my black and white world is a nice touch toobut i have to confess i got bored after a little while
everything i did in the game was exciting the first couple weeks i played the game but then it all lost its lustre
being a good god is a pain and requires a lot of micromanagement which is pretty much the same for being a bad god
i found internet play to be exceedingly boring  the creature fights werent that interesting to me and there didnt seem to be much point in varying strategy although i must confess i didnt do a lot of online bampw because i was so unimpressed the first couple times i tried itall in all black and white gave me a fun couple of gamebinge days but i got bored after a couple of weeks
i havent played it for months nowblack and white has lots of quotwow powerquot but almost no quotfun powerquot  the game is good in the sense that it is groundbreaking
the creature ai is quite interesting and it is true ai
your creature actually learns and picks up your play sytle
its quite wonderous but you get the feeling that this is this technology is a prototype not quite finished yet
the graphics never cease to amaze in their boldness and subtlety from the bruises slowly healing on your creature to the awesome look of the villages as you zoom out on your island during sunsetthe problem is that this game straddles  different genres real time strategy and simulation but doesnt deliver the best qualities of either
from a simulation perspective this game is seriously lacking in creative outlets
you can place a few buildings plant a few trees and and put a few tatoos on your creature but that is the total extent to which you can make these incredible worlds quotyoursquot
its like lionead decided that quotlets make a simulation game where you can look but not touchquot  if you are looking for the sense of building and accomplishment you can get from the sims or sim city or rollercoaster tycoon look elsewherethe realtime strategy aspects are similarly lacking in satisfaction
objectives are hazy and you never really get a sense of quotcompetitionquot
the creature battles can be won and lost with no consequences
your people do not fight each other and the gods dont really fight each other except to get the people to quotbelievequot more
once you go through all the work of extending your influence somewhere you are rewarded with  the ability to make it rain there
wow  at best you can use rocks and fire to kill the people that you need to win the game no wait why would i do that
the only real fun this game delivers is voyeuristic
like in rollercoaster tycoon everyone has a name and personal statistics
they live and die get pregnant get hungry and do some downright funny things
you can watch over them and help them with their little pointless tasks
its cool to create a male quotdeciple breederquot and watch him stud around the village getting everyone pregnant or watching a sick old man whos crawled miles from the temple to his house just as he reaches his front door then drop a rock on him
but this stuff gets old quick
serious gamers look elsewherei was one of the people who couldnt wait for black  white to be released in early   i read so much hype that the game couldnt help but to be a letdown after i was so pumped for how cool it soundedbut the fact is black  white is a fairly shallow albeit interesting and fun pc video gamethe game starts out interestingly enough with you learning the various basic functions of the game and building up the abilities of your creature
this is the fun part actually in that you see everything for the first time and the creature ai is something to behold for the first several hours
the graphics arent too shabby either and the world is immersive and lifelike including a nice weather system integrated with your local forecast through the interneteventually the game comes down to doing a couple of things making scaffolds for buildings and dropping food in the villager food binssure theres more to the game but the vast majority of your time will be spent doing those two monotous repetitive tasks
the side quests can be fun and interesting but many of them are completely unintuitive and sillywhat makes things worse is that your creature is either disabled or not in your posession for too much of the story  which consists of all of  different similarlooking maps
and the story itself is completely uninteresting and seems to be second to the games mechanicsblack  white is fun for the first  hours but beyond that it gets repetitive monotonous and stale
 i should also mention the winamp plugin giving you the ability to create your own soundtrack
this is a great feature id love to see in more gamesi really looked forward to this game it all seemed so incredibly cool
once it was released i got it and played it quite often
it was a lot of fun
but after a while it started to wear down
training my creature went from being fun to being work
managing the villages just got annoying i dont care if you need wood get it yourself
the game has its merits and it is quite entertaining but if you dont have a lot of time and a lot of patience i have to warn you away from iti had huge hopes for black and white
i love moral discussions and this game had some of the best advertising id seen
one ad said something like good your loving wife makes you breakfast in bed  evil you eat it with your mistress
it made it seem like youd really have these sorts of decisions to makeinstead when you play you have a cutsie little angel and a cuddly little devil both making fun comments
the devils comments are always promptly slapped down by the angel
the quotevilquot you do is more like dungeon keeper than anything else  drop things on peoples houses bug them if theyre not doing what you want to doyou only get to start with a choice of three creatures and these creatures have got to be some of the slowest learners on the planet
you tell one to pick up a drowning person and he pops the person in his mouth and starts eating him
eventually when they do learn something half the time its not what you had been training them to dothe graphics are gorgeous
the whole interface with the game is beautiful and lots of fun
there was so much potential as to how the game could have played but somewhere along the way i think they got swept away in the graphics and lost track of what they were doing
now dumb sailors tell you one at a time the things they need farmers lose their cows even though there are only  to watch and game crashes mean even things that work arent necessary going to last very longif youre a populous fan like i am id get it just to see how far they have come but dont be expecting miraclesblack amp white has been heralded as a masterpiece by many computer game reviewers but my experience with it was the same as my time playing the sims
i was flabbergasted at first but quickly lost interest as the quotunique approachquot of the game wore offthe quotunique approachquot for this game is the training of a creature that you use as your titan to watch over and convert the worshippers at various villages
the supposed ai
of the creature becomes simple programming after you figure out how most of the creatures are meant to behave
furthermore the storyline puzzles and subplots included are interesting at first and add to the overall experience but these too become tedious as they arent interesting enough to make the game lastthis game is capable of an online multiplayer versus mode
i never tried it and it seems like a game that is better suited to the standalone the game itself version rather than a multiplayer matchup as the story is what the programmers used to try and push the game over the hump
it would still be interesting though to play a multiplayer game considering this isnt your typical shoot em up or strategy game
furthermore explore the internet as there are additional creatures to play that you can download
also there are the usual amount of bugs in this game perhaps more than some first releases and as i write this review the patch for the game is only in beta stage
being tested
the patch is downloadable at the companys website but there is a disclaimer for it
while i liked the game but didnt think it was good enough to be considered a quotclassicquot i can see how many people would thoroughly enjoy this game
myst meets warcraft would be my description of this
i would take time reading all the reviews because you can get a good idea if youre the type of gamer that would love this game
not my cup of tea but a good gameintially when i tried out quotblack amp whitequot i began to tingle with excitement this looked like it was going to be one hell of an addictive game
and true this game is very addictive for the first few days that is
when you begin this game everything looks to be in place great graphics pretty easy to use controls and the gameplay looks to be promising
after just a short time later this game slams head first into the ground and does not recover
why is this you may ask well to be honest this whole game consists of you doing the same thing over and over except it increases how much you have to do to make it seem difficult than the previous time
its a real shame too this games originality is unsurpassed because while many other games have the god aspect to a certain extent none of them present it the way quotblack amp whitequot does
but do not give up all hope as of yet some people do enjoy this game to its fullest so make sure you try it before you buy it because you may end up loving it
the reason i gave quotblack amp whitequot  stars is because of how original it is its graphics and i even did enjoy this game for a very brief period of timethe good creatures a fun idea great sense of humor best use of good or evil concept in an rts game very simple to playthe bad horrendous graphics very hard gets old after the first leveli remember hearing about bw back in the day but i didnt have the machine to run it
now seven years later ive played it and walked away about underwhelmed
first off the game is butt ugly but that is expected for a sevenyear old game
the textures are blurry and washed out and the character models are down right laughable
no matter though bw delivers a great style that hasnt been in any other rts
while the story is paperthin there really isnt any need of one
you are a god who is just a floating hand and you take control of creatures
these creatures can help your villagers either farm grain for good chop down wood forermwood and you can pet it slap it around to tell it its bad or encourage it to do bad things such as even eating the villagersthe whole premise of bw is the good or evil premise that peter moloneux oh so loves
the whole concept of the game is to influence other villages by performing god like tasks such as supplying them with food or wood
you can use your creature to impress them or you can do evil things to impress them such as picking up the villagers and throwing them around smashing their buildings etc
when you get a village the people will have needs
these are noted with flags around building
some may want more houses to breed children
some may want a wonder some people may even want more trees or rocks in their village
when you start running out of resources you can perform miracles by having your villagers chant at your temple
you can then use gestures to use wood miracles food miracles fire or shields to attack or protect villages etcthe game plays out in missions via silver scrolls that require you to help or hurt people
when you get the god stones you unlock the next door to pick your next creature
while all this sounds astounding and it is the game is very hard and gets old really quick
after the first land which is the tutorial land youll pretty much have seen what the game has to offer
what makes the game so hard is that you will never have enough resources and the resources are very limited and buildings require too much wood to build
while taking your creature out on walks using a leash use the good or bad collar to have the creature act accordingly sounds neat it is but not for long
back in  this kind of thing was like finding a martianit didnt exist
in  weve seen this many times before and its nothing new
if you really dig this kind of thing i recommend it but if youve played other great rts games you wont see anything new hereblack amp white promised to be an intriguing quotgod simquot where you could explore the ramifications of nuances between being benevolent or tyrannical
while the voice acting is excellent the quotmissionsquot lack variety and challenge and seriously mar replay value
while you are a quotgodquot for your followers your animal presence in the world is more of a baby that needs too much nurturing and care
this makes the whole thing seem to move to slowly to be engaging
one more thing the program requires exceptional horsepower on your pc to perform reasonably well
it slogged on my old pc at an unplayable rate
now that ive got a new athlon ghz it plays good but still has annoying frame drops despite soso graphic detaili waited for the price to drop for over a year
i like rpg games and this looked unique pretty and interestingplaying it wasnt the joy id been imagining
even though its been out for over a year and i have a very stable system it never crashes for anything but black  white it crashed my system about an hour into the game every time i played
which is just insane since the system is popular and over a year old  there should be a frigging patch for it but there isntalso the game controlls are overly complicated
before deciding that it wasnt worth it i spent a good  hours playing the game and i was still unsure about which controls to use for certain actions
that is a serious design flaw as far as im concernedit is a pretty game and if you have the patience to put up with the freezes make sure to save and the time to devote to it this is the game for you
the graphics are pretty and it is really cute  just overly complicated and buggyblack and white is a good game overall
you start out as a god who gets to control a creature to carry out tasks to the island you control
the people build things for you and worship you
the fun comes when you can be a good god or evil god depending on your actions
thi game is fun but youll probably forget about it in a couple monthsthis game was pretty good although i guess it would be better if i hadnt lost the disc before i really had time to play it enough to get my creature and town going oh wellthis game has great potential
beyond great
excellent
there are only a few basic things i have to say  there are too many bugs
wait until december or so maybe they will all be fixed
 this game is a hardware buster
 the gameplay is flawed
it gets frantic the villagers are annoying and impossible to take care of efficiently
this game is downright impossible to concentrate on the missions sometimes because you are too busy controlling the villagers
end of reviewi just bought this game today and wanted to throw in my two cents worth
i have several comments and criticisms but ill keep it short for the sake of space
the graphics are  times better than the first two
the only thing is there are still several of the same limitations on the playability that have plagued the first two games as well
ammo for one thing
if you run out youre screwed since you cant pick any up from the people youve killed in the game
also often times when you get to the end of a mission it seems like youre just stuck with dead time and no way to end the mission
one of my biggest annoyances with the first two delta force games has carried over into this game as well
the ai is horrible
now realistically if you are sniping an enemy camp what are the chances  soldiers will be able to lock onto you instantly
well thats what happens in all three delta force games you fire one shot from where you are hiding and no matter how well youve hidden yourself you have everybody in the camp firing straight at you
it takes the reality and a lot of the fun out of the game
overall a great game graphically except for the weapons which look like they dont belong in the picture at all but needs a ton of work on the ai
the delta force games have all had the potential to be outstanding games but unfortunately for us gamers the programmers havent taken advantage of itim an avid gamer and first person shooters are by far my favorite genre
i loved both delta force and delta force  so naturally i thought that delta forceland warrior would be the next logical step to greatness
i wasnt totally mistaken however it is safe to say that i was disappointed
my goal is to make sure that other followers of the delta force series dont make the same mistake
first of all check out the screenshots for this game
they look great dont they
well ive got news the real graphics dont look half that sharp
a grenade blast in this game looks like the graphics from the original nintendothats right the bit system
in my opinion i exaggerate not
there are in fact a wide variety of weapons however they are far from realistic
the silenced mp is indiscernable and looks more like a stick than a gun
rdperson view looks spectacular in the screen shots that amazon put up however the real graphics will show that the soldiers are unproportional and unrealistic looking
i simply can not comprehend how game programmers allow themselves to slack off so much after creating two very topquality games
the military strategy element is the one bright spot for this game as there are truly no limits to each level
i often found myself crawling for a thousand meters just so i could get behind my enemy for a shot with my barret cal
in this sense there is great replayability
missions can be completed in an infinite number of ways and so this game is more of a time killer
overall if youre looking for a game to beat in a couple of days or if you simply need to feel the rush of an fps while youre waiting for all the fantastic novemberrelease games to come out then buy this
if you loved the other delta force games then you should also buy this
however dont have high expectations coming in to the game as i did
youll be disappointedthis aint no disney alicetake good long look at the cover of alices box
get the idea
something has gone horribly wrong in wonderland
alice who has spent the last several years in an asylum for telling people the truth about wonderland now must return and again set things rightsimple enough plot right
it is
very simpleall three of stars i gave this game were for its visuals
everything from the backgrounds the baddies and the buildings to alice herself are rendered beautifully
movement is very fluid and realistici was also suprised at the ease of the keyboardmouse interface
it didnt take long to get the hang of moving alice around in the twisted wonderlandbut these two pluses dont make up for the game itself
this one is a simple quotrun jump shootquot game like all too many others
the game leads you by the nose as you stumble through the plot
not too many surpises here
for those of you whove played them before this is one of those i need x so i see person  who will give me x if i get him z  so i see person  who will give me z if i give him y so i find person  who  you get the picturethe puzzles are easy enough and theres a lot of jumping involved in this game
but once you get down how to jump sidestep and shoot its all too easyoh
i would be remiss if i didnt note  if your pc no mac support from ea kiddies
isnt top of the line pentium  mb ram geforce  video card creative xgamer live sound  or better on all the game will bog down graphics wont render or it wont run at all
dont even think about running this game on a laptopwhile i liked the game and love the graphics i was still disappointed
if you want to be scared by a video game play resident evil
if you want great action play deusexmore  and a half stars for everything a grudging recommendationusually i write pretty long reviews but i suppose this game is getting a bit long in the tooth so i thought id try and dash a brief one out for the small group of people who might be interested
i mean its not that outdatedthis game is pretty interesting in a few ways namely graphics and design but it unfortunately has a lot of problems that make it not entirely fun and it has a sad tendency to let down in places where it could really shine
here is a brief look based on things that are important to mestory d there is an opening cut scene also a pretty brilliant concept about how alice is older had a horrible tragedy is struggling with sanity is back in wonderland as a kind of subconscious or unconscious struggle for her mind
it is set up well like i said the concept is great however they neglect to actually have a story of any weight or interest to match its all just find this person defeat this creature get this thing
i found it quite disappointing on this scoregraphics  a  these are strange and beautiful and a highwater mark in gaming
the color tone and inventiveness are really fun to look at
while they lack some of the detail current games are now capable of they still hold up pretty well on that score
i think my minus is mostly for the way the game itself can actually detract from the wonderful world construction of the game and well they really went a little too dark with it both in tone and feel which i wouldnt mind so much just its so typicalgame play d not very fun this is mainly a weird kind of shooter with puzzles
the puzzles are mediocre
the weapons while graphically full of the dark whimsy of the game are not a pleasure to use
you use something and have to wait tic tic tic to use it again and that kind of timing is irritating
you have to be patient and use timing and it just does not suit this sort of game
also as the game is purely about advancing it tends to have a breathless quality far too much more than an exploratory quality which is a waste of the lovely design
boss battles are tedious i must admit i find that so all too often in games and mostly involve run employ correct weapon correctly run employ and so ondifficulty b sorry cant remember too well did this have difficulty levels
something i feel strongly about
i just remember that playing it was not too too hard though not exactly easy and some fights and puzzles are a bit of a pain for not especially good reasons oh i can climb that ledge
unlike these other 
 but there is a lot of health around and i do tend to like games to be easierdreariness factor  c the game lacks much release relief or joyful factors
its a bit of a dark game for all its whimsy
time spent with friends in the game is briefcharacters  b  pretty well done but a little brief alice is pretty appealing to play as
pretty good voice acting
of course beautifully designedchore factor c like i said getting ahead is not hugely rewarding without a good story or real light spots and getting from point a to point b can be a bit tiring especially when its a sort of non linear maze kind of approach not a favorite of minetechnical issues  i really cannot remember any problems at all not even minor
of course thats all subjective to different systems but this seems pretty stable works fine on xp etcgame saves b many a mighty game has been brought low by a poor game save system
alice allows for anytime saves which i feel is mainly how it should beproduct materials  b  again i am trying to do this one from memory but i think there was some neat stuff in the box that set up the backstory
the how to play guide was less great but something if i am recalling correctlyooops i guess that was long
if computer games were as inventive and varied as they should be i would seriously not be recommending this game but because the field is generally kind of weak i think there are some points of interest and hope in this sort of game and it might really be worth a try especially at the low prices you can get it for these daysalice is very gritty and bloody
its not the alice in wonderland you might think
alice is in a sanitorium
her parents were killed in a fire and shes gone mad
in her mind shes stuck in the altered and sometimes horrific former quotwonderlandquot
the doctors try to revive her using new untested quotpotionsquot
some show progress but most make her condition worse
this information is all in a quotjournalquot that comes with the game written by the doctor treating her
so once you read that you load the game and wow what graphics
even the blinking of alices eyes frightened me
i played the first boardkind of quotearthworm jimquot style with level after level
it seemed fun at first running around with the quicken movement and  degree line of sightbut soon the slashing and killing become boring
you pretty much just run and slash
the idea is that if alice destroys the altered quotwonderlandquot she will awaken and be sane again
if you get hurt too many times playing she dies and you have to start over
sound too basicyeah thats what i thought
sorry all you fansi did give it an honest try but i exchanged it for a better gamequotthe longest journeyquotsee my review on thatheres the preface for this review your enjoyment of tomb raider
if you liked the tomb raider series then you might enjoy this game
very similar graphics controls remember the jumping and hanging on to even surfaces and then pulling yourself up
it applies here
and objectives
mix in a cheshire cat that you can call on for advice a morbid and psychedelic world weapons that pertain to alices theme  and you have american mcgees alicethe game is entertaining at first with its unique world but becomes boring very fast
i enjoyed the first tomb raider which was released some years earlier more than this game
a major reason for that was because alice doesnt require much problem solving like the tomb raider series does
everything in the game is rather straightforward and its recommended that people who dislike animation and sequences that are nothing more than creative clips meant to point you literally to the next scene should avoid this game
unless youve got an empty schedule the good news is that it will take some time to complete american mcgees alice
but as far as ground breaking games this is a halfhearted attempt
even though you can find other games on the market with the same format alice doesnt stand out much from its competitors
impressive artwork is the only aspect that stands out for this gamebest to wait awhile on this one until the price drops
worth it at a lower price but not nowwhat a disappointment
live  was and now still is
the best hoops sim ever
this game not only doesnt really improve on it but it also take a step back
the pros best graphics yet in a pc sports game cool lowpost moves make scoring with your center more realistic good game flow
the cons  ai the cpu never leads a fast break ever rebounding is infuriating too easy to steal and block no more ingame save createaplayer details have been downgraded  foot shots are missed  of the time even by jordan crossover and spin buttons are useless as you end up out of bounds hard to perform on the fly pass and shoot impossible to drive by a defender
should i go on
because i could seriously do us all a favor and take ea sports survey on their site and tell them how much this game stinks
hopefully next year it will regain its crown
till then play live as you know each year easports produce good games but now theyve gone a step backward
nba live  has referees linesmen and more officials in the game but on nbak the game got worse in detail and graphics
the only reason i bought this game is so i can have the newer better version of nba game but i recieved a game worth nothing
so those readers buy nba  i know its old but its better and not a waste of money
good lucksince this game is not part of the quotgreatest hitsquot family i couldnt loose buy buying the game without renting it
the price was right
i have heard mixed things about quotsmugglers runquot but it sounded like the kind of game i would like
it was
here are my views on quotsmugglers runquotthe pros detailing
the environments in sr are very well detailed
in the forest setting you have small towns mountains cows in the field and deers crossing the roads
there are very few people so fans of gtas ability to maliciously run over people might feel shortchanged
the problem with gtas background popup doesnt exist here so the animation is smooth and fluid
control
controling whatever vehicle you choose is like second nature and moving around is a snap
fans of arcade racing games will love the smooth controls and the ability to flip dive and make sharp turns with the vehicle
the ease of the ps controller is an asset in sr
missionbased racing
srs appeal is twofold it satasfies the simple need for speed and it also provides missions to give the game some purpose
the missions are simple pick up contraband and deliver it
what adds some spice is the police border guards and rival gangs that are out to stop you
the difficulty ranges from very easy to mildly hard
music
though simple the music in sr is very well done
it consists of simple techno beats which are the perfect driving music
as you are concentrating on the road the music is a background stimulant that adds to the excitementthe cons repetative
as with crazy taxi the point of the game is quite simple and despite some challenges can be easily beaten
since the missions objectives and scenery rarely change some might find this game hard to take in the long term
with a paperthin story once the novelty of speed wares off this game might just sit around collecting dust
also there are only three different areas for you to drive in forest desert and snow
though big and well detailed they never really change
i found the replay value to be weakthe the premis of sr is simple it is a solid game
most people who enjoy arcadestyle or missionbased racing similar to driver will enjoy this game
but those looking for something similar to gta might feel let down
overall it is a fun game to play but it can get old fasti rented this game after reading how good this was but it seems that this game is below playstation and dreamcast standards
graphics are pretty goodyou can basically go almost anywhere
if you go too far offroad all of a sudden your car mysteriously starts flying very high and far from where you came fromjust image a car being hit with a giant baseball bat
graphics run at  framesi expected  considering pss power
and the textures need some polishing too
game got boring after a whileyou basically do the same thing over and over
i say this barely passes as a rentalthe idea that this game is based on is easily one of the best that any gamer has ever seen
but this game was very poorly executed and gets quite boring extremely fast
the graphics are quite smooth and fast but it gets boring going from point a to point b there are some missions where you have to go back and forth picking up things but that gets confusing and me and my best friend found ourselves trying to figure out what exactly we were doing
if you are thinking about buying this game rent it firstits a truly great concept for a game take a dune buggy or suv and drive frantically around the backwaters of the american southwest hauling briefcases full of cargo from place to place frantically trying to stay just ahead of the law
suuuuure rockstar you can tell us that those briefcases have secrets or engine parts
suuuuure
if youve ever played crazy taxi think of smugglers run as quotwhat the crazy taxi drivers do to make the real moneyquotthe trouble is it just doesnt wind up being as fun as crazy taxi
in crazy taxi there are always a multitude of options in front of you passengers line the streets everywhere taking you to all sorts of destinations
in smugglers run youre led through a series of linear missionspick up each briefcase here and drop it off there
youre driving through broad expanses of terrain but you dont really have time to explore them youre just racing from point a to point b trying to beat the time limits
and the countryside youre racing through is somewhat bland most of the textures lack the sort of detail youd expect from a ps gamedont get me wrong theres quite a lot of fun to be had here
running from the law is always fun in a game anyway where you can just hit a button to restart after you get arrested
and in the later missions the constant pressure of the pursuing police cars will force you into all kinds of wild maneuvers and wrecks
but even in these levels the intensity just doesnt match that of racing down a crowded street in crazy taxi
the occasional team mission where you and a few cpucontrolled allies compete against a group of enemy cars add at least some variety to the mixto summarize smugglers run makes a very solid first impression but i have serious doubts about its longterm replay value especially given the relatively small number of missions
its certainly worth a look but if you have a dreamcast as well crazy taxi is a much more entertaining trip through the same genrethis game is actually fairly well done even after the sequel was released
the terrain was done well and the vehicles looked like the actual vehicles
the controls are relatively simple and thats what makes this game a great multiplayer title
however like rockstars current trend the game is only good for shallow fun as the game doesn offer much depth
however the game does get extremely difficult in the latter stages nearly impossible to beat
after losing more than  times on one stage this title became a backseat title
this game is exceedingly one of the best games out there  for multiplayer
it does offer the most fun that i had in quite a while
however gran turismo  imho is still one of the best multiplayer titles
if you are willing to venture into shallow games and great multiplayer games this is one of the most funnote rent first
buy later if you like itthis game is very fun in the beginning when you are trying to get better cars and beat faster people it kept me entertained for a few hours but when i learned the map the techniques of the computer driver and the shortcuts the game became very repetative it was just blah i would recommend nfs over this gameits funny how some games get one thing right then blow the rest out the window
this game has mastered rain soaked streets
i have not seen better looking rain soaked streets in a game before
this is the state of the art in rain soaked streetsthe problem is if your looking for more than some nice looking rain soaked streets then your out of luckthe car control is nice if not a little arcade like
this is by no means a simulation of any real world cars
in fact the game has no real world cars
the have some that look like a honda civic and the like but these are cars only found in the world of video gamesthe streets you race on are large and sometimes too large
when trying to chase down an opponent it can get boring
the races are boring at times too
not a test of race skills per say more like how well you remember the shortcutsthe game play is ok  the graphics are ok the sound and music are ok in short this is an ok game
nothing to call your friends up and brag about
more something to be mentioned off hand like quotoh yea
i got that game at the launch
its ok  wanna play ssxquotthis game is fun for a couple of hours but then becomes kind of repetitive especially who pc gamers who have played midtown madness and midtown madness  developed by the same guys
the graphics is decent although it does not appear to be as sharp as on a pc with a good d graphics card maybe its the nature of tv images
i wouldnt say its worth the money if you have played mm but makes a good rental titlei admit i was biased when i picked this title up because i was already immersed in grand theft auto  and gran turismo  at the time
i was not expecting this game to be anything like gta but i did expect the quality to be similar
graphic wise midnight club came up well short of the visuals in gta
the city is bland and choppy
not convincing for a ps title
the racing is ok but nothing spectacular
car physics are a tad sluggish and finding your way around can be a tedious chore
car selection is also very limited at the beginning of the game
the difficulty is also a tad high but not too hard if you get into it
unfortunately i was not impressed since this was one of the first titles i owned for the ps and it just bored me
gt is a far superb racing game and gta is rockstars classic with gta out now
if you are thinking about picking this title up because of its bargain price i would suggest you skip it and hit gt for the same tag
also midnight club  is comming out and it seems to have really beefed up the game so try the new version as this edition was just boringits really easy to control the vehicle and the cars look neat but the game really doesnt stand out as a racing game
although i only played this game as a four day rental i have the following issues with it looks like the used the engine from midtown madness with different cars and the ability to hit people no guts when you hit people litter sparks needs more realism acceleration a bit too slow
it gets better as you get better vehicles but it can be annoying in the beginning needs more jumps and cool stuff
midtown madness had drawbridges and stuff that made great jumps
maybe use car carriers or somethingi suggest holding out for grand turismo and seeing what people say about iti liked this game for the first couple of weeks after i bought it
the game was started to get boring and predictable
i had more fun just driving with my cousin and crashing into each other
the graphics are ok but they could of done so much better with them
i dont think it should be one of playstation  greatest hitsfor one the controls can get annoying
the missions are difficult
i am close to beating it i got like  levels left and i am totally stuck on it
i know what to do but it is physically impossible
i guess its an ok game if you are a fan of the  games
it is better then the n version which sucked
but overall its an ok but i wouldnt recommend this to anyone who gets frustrated easily and are not a fan of the  gamesi know what you are all thinking quotonly  stars
are you insanequot but allow me to explainthis is an incredible new game if you are primarily interested in the singleplayer aspect
like goldeeye it features fastpaced action and intrigue as you wander through mazelike streets and incredibly detailed buildings as  himself
the weapons are mostly new and have a slower reloading time which can be annoying when your screen is full of bad guys but in the end adds to the challenge and feels more realistic
also bond gets to use quotgadgetsquot now like xray goggles and grappling hooks
this is great because now you feel like you really are using qs hightech toys rather than just pressing a buttons
finally the new oneplayer levels are just as good if not better than the original becuase of their incredible detailhowever i am not impressed with the multiplayer aspect of this game which is a major problem in my opinion
first off everyone who got used to the inverted targeting from goldeneye and perfect dark will find they have to manually switch their targeting options on each controller every time they play a multiplayer game
also the weapons selection is very limited and highly unorganized
in ge you could essentially choose almost exactly which weapons you wanted as you can in perfect dark
however in twine you only get  options for quotweapons detailquot and they are high medium and low
so no more choosing quotrocket launchersquot or quotpower weaponsquot for your multiplayer games
now your weapons are mostly a surprise
also pressing quotstartquot during multiplayer causes everyones screen to shut off rather than just showing you your current stats while allowing everyone else to continue playing
this is very annoying during play because it really breaks up the continuity of the game and the flow of the action
finally twine like perfect dark allows you the option of playing against computer players during multiplayer too but it doesnt let you adjust their skill level  which seems far superior to quothumanquot standards
the new multiplayer levels are well new
but they lack the charm of the originals i dont know maybe its jsut because i dont know my way around them all yet but i dont like them nearly as much
i suppose theyre ok if you are just looking for a change of scenery
anyway i suppose once i get used to these things ill like it a little more
but for now it just feels wrongmy final complaint is not at all that important but i feel its worth mentioning
is there really a need for all the title screens at startup
you are forced to eudure about  of them each for about  seconds
first is a licensing screen then a mgm logo then another logo then another it makes you feel like you are either waiting for all the legal warnings to pass before watching a dvd or playing playstation and waiting through those incessant loading timesi really like this game as a st person shooter but i dont think it comes anywhere near its predecessors with respect to multiplayer
if you are mainly interested in this game as one player then buy it
but if you are looking for a good multiplayer game stick with the original or buy perfect darkthe reason i gave this game  stars is because the graphics are so so and gameplay is way to short control is pretty good accept aiming can get a little tricky if your used to goldeneye or perfect darks controls also there isnt enough weapons to chose from but the multiplayer is pretty decent to which gave this game  of its  starswhat can i say
i rented the game
a waste of money
they tryed to make the game like goldeneye but they failed
the graphics were bad for games that require the expansion pak
i mean play perfect dark then play this
these griphics are bad
the game story followed the movie but only to the basic story line
as most games that are based on movies do they added and took away parts that were in the movie
the cut scenes if you could call it that were really bad
in the boat chase in the begining there were no waves on the water this was one of many problems
the music was anouying it
it played a part of the twine theme song over and over
the ai seemed like no one even programed it
oh and the multyplay was the worst of all
i tryed to play the human vs bot mode alone thinking it would be like perfect dark and well it wasnt
over alli wouldnt bye this game
two thumbs down
if you have the playstation or the ps i would say get it on thereyou thought i was only going to review just  bond video game no
well rare unfortunately didnt have the  licence in  or  ea had it  there bond games were pretty forgettable there good but nothing special thank god activision has a hold on the licence now
twine is a good game but not excellent like golden eye
but you should all give it a shot its based on the  movie with pierce brosnan basically it does stick closely to the movie as it can maybe too close i have to say levels     are from hl the ending is mediocre but the movie its self is better than this gamethis game is lousy it has terrible graphics and even worse sound effects
at this point your thinking quotif its so bad why did you give it three starsquot well the fact of the matter is its fun to drive a semi truck trough rush hour traffic
other than that though this game has hardly anything going for itgraphics like i said terrible the cars are hardly textured at all and the traffic cars arent
there are no shadows at all and the effects arent very impressive eithersound bad here to the cars all sound similar and the music is horrificgameplay the races are fun and the cruise mode is the most enjoyable part of this game
there are also some trainingcareer challenges which are just there to unlock paint jobs and new carswhich reminds me no custom colors each car comes with about four or five some have more and you cant select what type of cars you race against so only about four cars are even useful the rest are more of a novelty thing
if you have the original dont get this one as it just ads two cities and the graphics are almost identical
overall this could have been much better had microsoft not squandered a great game with lousy graphics sound and gameplayracing in the middle of a city is a great idea and can be a lot of fun but this game is not as good as it cold befirst the cities will only appeal to those who have never visited them
for those of us who have golden gate and hyde parks seem grossly out of proportion and practically barren
in case of london the map should be larger in san francisco at least part of the town around the other end of golden gate bridge should be rendered
instead of two cities id like to see one city fully and correctly rendered in version  and enough of boring american cities
how about doing rome or paris for a changethe game is quite playable with a joystick but you have to program it in the options menu to separate the throttle from steering
if you dont you wont be able to handle the sharp corners typical of most racesthe tests for unlocking the top cars are at times too tough and too acrobatic and neither car physics nor graphics are as good as they are in need for speed games
for example you cant even see the hood of your car in front as you drive in any of the modelsthis game is good for some laughs but if you want superb graphics and an exhilarating feel every time you play i recommend need for speedim not going to give this game a quotraving reviewquot since i am not a gamer who thinks metal gear is better than air but it is one of the best looking quotconsoletopcquot games around
the visuals look great and the controls are easy to use and configure
the actual gameplay is pretty good but it will take time to master this game for novicesa few years back youd pay  for a force feedback joystick
those were the days when serious flight simmers paid top dollar for the best quality they could get
unfortunately those days are gone and force feedback joysticks along with quality joysticks in general are fewer in number than ever and not as good as they used to be
now that ms has stopped making sidewinder products and logitech replaced their older and better wingman force stick with this one theres not a lot of choice left if you want force feedback
on the positive side the price is now much lower than it used to beim on my second one of these sticks the first one i got from amazon had a defective motor in it
other than that the initial feel of this stick is actually pretty good  better than i expected based on the other reviews  and if i hadnt gotten a defective unit id probably give it a higher score
but taken with some of the other problems ive read about here i have to think there are probably some real quality control issues with this stick
i can say definitively that this model is not nearly as solid as either mss last force feedback stick or logitechs previous model
but both of those sticks were built like tanks
at least the buttons all feel really nice on the force d solid but clicky and springy and with a nice throttle with the perfect amount of resistance
the hat switch works well too  much better than my old sidewinder precision pro and its concave now just to update what an earlier reviewer said about previous revisionsas for the force feedback itself its not the best but its not bad either
if youre a flight simmer you will probably appreciate having force feedback  this is not really a stick thats intended for other types of games
its a flight stick and it does add a lot to the realism of flight sims to be able to feel things like ground bumps and aerodynamic forces on your airplanes some sims even let you feel things like turbulence
the force effects by default are strong enough but you can make them stronger if you want to some people have complained that the effects feel weak but you can really crank them up with logitechs included utility
it can be surprisingly forceful given how light the stick is
that said the motors do feel like theyre straining if you really crank it upcentering is always an issue with force feedback sticks because they rely on the motors for centering rather than springs
some people prefer a standard stick for this reason
unlike some older force feedback sticks that use a combination of cables and motors for centering and other nonforce effects this stick seems to use only motors so the centering doesnt feel very smooth  it feels very digital like the motors have a certain number of levels which feel like detents where they will allow the stick to rest
its hard to explain but the result is if you push the stick in one direction its almost like it quotclicksquot as it goes through the various levels of resistance from the motors
this is constant and theres no way around it you just have to get used to it
its not that hard but its definitely a different feel from an analog stick that uses cables and springs for centeringsome have complained about stick sensitivity with this model i havent had a problem in flight simulator  which is all ive used it for
even with the loose quotdead spotquot when centered if you just take the stick sensitivity down a couple notches in the game settings its absolutely fine
the centering right in the middle is definitely a bit loose but it doesnt seem to really matter much and its a common issue with most force feedback joysticksoverall im glad i purchased mine but i would probably have rather paid more for a better stick
i feel this is priced about what its worth
whether you want force feedback or not is a question in itself if youre not sure this is a good stick to test out being as cheap as it isthis was my first force feedback stick and i wound up returning it
it had its good points  it felt solid and wellmade had good button and throttle feel and is nicely shaped and sized
unfortunately i was disappointed by its performance in games  the force effects just didnt feel very strong or convincing
but the real killer for me was that the stick precision was very poor compared to nonforce joysticks ive used
i fly a lot of flight sims and i really felt like i lost a good deal of control while using this stickgo to an electronics store and feel this in your hands  its the best review you could ask for
unfortunately as much as i wanted to like this controller there is a negative for every positive
i mean that quite literally  for every good feature that feature also has something wrong with it
i noticed all this after only  day with itlayout  the positive is that the rumblepad is nearly identical to the playstations dualshock controller
there are  buttons  triggers  analog sticks a dpad a shift button and even a throttle slide
for many games you will not need to use the keyboard when youve got this gamepad
however the rumblepad is different enough from the dualshock that if you are trying to play playstation games on your pc final fantasy metal gear bleem etc you will have some relearning to do
you might want to wait until sony starts making usb dualshock controllers
which should be in  monthsfeel  this gamepad is nice and big and doesnt cramp my large adult male hands at all
however the buttons are terrible
they are tiny hard to press harder to reach and even harder to figure out which one you want without looking at the pad
i cant simply rest my thumb naturally on the buttons but have to bend it akwardly and press the buttons with the very tip of my thumb
this is a design flaw of the pad not because of my particular build which is quite averageanalog sticks  these are both very responsive and perfectly positioned
the negative is that they dont have a good gripping surface or shape so your thumbs dont stay centered on them
because the sticks are curved inwards console sticks on all major systems are curved outwards i often find i am controlling the stick by its very edge which is uncomfortable and very inaccurate
as if by the hand of god you usually wont need to repositon your thumb until you reach a particular important part of your gameusb  this speaks for itself
usb is great if you dont know yet
you can unplug the pad and move it off your desk easily
however this gamepad requires a powered usb hub
you cant plug this into your keyboard usb ports
great if you already own a powered hub but if you dont that means you either spend another  on one or you plug it into the back of your computer case thus defeating the ease of usbas of oct  the rumblepad doesnt work well with windows me
i downloaded the latest update from logitech but my computer locks up whenever i plug the gamepad in
i have to have my computer off to plug it in
however this might be caused by the power requirements of the rumblepad not the softwarei have given wdl thunder tanks an adequate amount of gameplay but i have not been overly impressed with itthe missions vary from level to level and there are plenty of cool tanks to choose from
some of the tanks such as the one with the flamethrower needs to be seen
the heat effect was pretty impressive
aside from this i didnt think the graphics were all that mindblowingin addition  the gameplay is what falters on wdl
after playing through several levels the gameplay becomes pretty repetitive and some of the missions get to be a little confusingbottomline if you like mindless games where you can blow stuff up you may enjoy this
to me the repetitive gameplay only made this game worthy of a rental and nothing morenot recommendedyou blow up tanks
thats all there is to it
pretty coolthe master of orion games are very entertaining if you enjoy the build resources and expansion conquer themes
the different races make is interesting and it can be done multiplayerdown sides
refitting your ships constantly can take a bit especially when you have to go back and refit or get rid of yoru old ones
and in the solo game you can tell it to keep passing turns until something actually happens making the downtime a lot less
not so for muliplayer
you could each be sitting there passing your turn back and forth for awhile before you actually want to do another turni have just been playing the demo of sof and i must say that i am a bit dissapointed
the graphics date back almost to the old duke nukem d game style graphics not anywhere close to current standards
the weapon fire is the most unrealistic i have ever seen in a fpc
the storyline is good and the playability is good but it could have been so much better if the graphics were worth a flip but theyre not but it is a fun game nonetheless and for the cheap price its going at now should be worth the money but i would never pay full price for a game the lacks as much graphically as this one doeswell it works
but the print is very very light and hard to read
also the paper just doesnt feel rightstraight to the point the series started off as a chilling and entertaining rpg with an real time battle flare and ended up as a resident evil cloned sequelthe series could have ended with the first parasite eve but squaresoft decided to continue the serieswhat resulted was a sequel whos only tie to the original is really the main character and the use of her parasite energytake aya brea resident evil style gameplay and her parasite abilities and you basically have parasite eve ii
its resident evil with special powers
that can go one of two wayslook at it as a stand alone game or survival horror game if you like love or are interested in the resident evil series or you can hate loathe dislike or bear it as the terrible sequel that surfacedon the plus side the interactive environments are a nice touch as they create a strategic approach in battles
you can find all kinds of weaponry to find the best possible way to deal with bosses
the parasite abilities mentioned above do add some strategy to the game as wellits a tough call
as stated before you either love it as a stand alone title or hate is as a sequelbreakdowngoodgameplaygraphicscutscenesstand alone titlebadsequelnothing like its predecessorstorylinecharactersquestionwhat made squaresoft decide to go with a resident evil style approachin the first parasite eve the fighting system was wonderful and easy to get the hang of though still challenging
while this second edition to the series had an equally superb plot cut scenes and game play the fights in this game ruin just about every moment
instead of enjoying the game for the beauty of what it was most of my time was yelling strings of bad language at the television screen as i died for the fifth time because of the bad controls and hard to handle fighting
sometimes there is such a thing as leaving well enough alone and thats what they should have done with their first fighting system and controlsthis game had excellent graphics for its time and is a pretty solid buy maybe
if you can find a way to ignore the abysmal control you will most likely enjoy it
other than that dont even think about itman after getting through the first medal of honor i erased my old game and started over
 months later im doing it again in the second installment of the hopefully long lasting medal of honor series
this game has improved in every way the graphics the sound the ai have all been jacked up so high at times i simply blow away by the attention to detail
in the first one the ai was good but left something to be desired
for example you shoot a guy in the leg and run he will give up the chase after a while and when you come back to the same spot hes there on patrol again no more aware of his surroundings than before
not in this game you walk into an area with a sentry and the light sound of you cocking your gun or even switching to another gun will quickly cause a flurry of bullets to come flying at you
that brings me to the games only downside the difficulty
the nazis never miss
you take off at a dead run and a guy is on top of a ledge eating literally hes gonna put  bullets in you as soon as you see him
aside from that the game is awesome the music sets the mood the vehicles like motorcycles and tanks add a lot of variety the graphics are amazing and the ai is fantastic
one mission in the game is in paris i was walking around in this business and redidential area and you know what came to mind saving private ryan
the ai french resistance guys the good guys were cool and the area looked just like that part in the movie
get this gamenba live has always been the best psx hoops game and it still is but only because of the lack of talent
this version is almost exactly like last years version something that is not common among the nba live series
ill rent this one and if you have a ps you should too because if the ps version lives up too its excpectations it will be twice as good as this
if you only have psx make this your hoops game or nba live  if you do not mind old rosterslive is a very good game put out by playstation knowing they needed to go out with a bang
yet there arent many or any rea good additions to this game
the gameplay is quite familiar to that of live
i do like how it is still hard to consistently hit jumpers and get a good fg
however it becomes very easy once you get the hang of it i mean come on i beat the computer on superstar by 
the graphics arent very good at all
the players faces couldnt look any worse
i know theyre trying but these faces are horendous
and there hands are these flat squarelike formations with fingers just happening to be sticking out of them
i mean come on work on the graphics you barely did anything to spice the game up the least you can do is make it look realistic
lastly i know many of you have been complaining since last year for a franchise mode
well i ask where is it
madden gets one and i think madden is the best sports game ever produced this years version
you might think i hate this game and regret buying it
i dont its just that i really expected a ton more from this game and obviously it wasnt thereway to easy to winlooks sounds all a  nothing better out there sadly so this is the game to getbut only if ya dont have time to play a real game a bballthe graphics are so sweet
i love them so much
but the game just is too challanging
darth maul is almost mission impossible
hes unstoppable
i only reccomend this game for people who like challangesdecent but it was kinda lame even when it first came outaverageokay for one thing this is one of the worst star wars games ive played dont get me wrong but im a star wars fan its just i didnt like this game very much
the best part in this game is you get to play boba fett
i bought this game because i like to collect star wars stuff
it is okay but not the bestif you liked this game then check out all of the star wars gameslucas arts is great at providing the atmosphere of the star wars movies in all of their games and star wars demolition is no exception
unfortunately atmosphere doesnt sell games gameplay does and star wars demolotion is lacking badly in that departmentgraphically this game is quite similar to vigilante  with the exception that the levels that you can compete on are on tatooine the death star ii hoth etc etc
there are many vehicles to choose from including the land speeder snow speeder boba fetts jet pack an at at and a few othersthe atmosphere is great the opening credits are cool there is plenty for the star wars fan to love
however the problem here is that this game is unusally hard
after playing battle mode for  consecutive hours i lost every battle i fought but one
some characters you fight against seem more mobile and harder to kill than others
this would be ok but it often seems like you are being teamed up on by mulitple enemies at once
the limitations of the vehicles makes it impossible to overcome the fights where you are outnumbered
this makes victory impossible for a single playerwhere some players might find this game favorable would be in the two player mode where you can fight against each other on the different terrains with any of the various vehichles
this portion of the game is pretty cooloverall the graphics are adequate although there is lots of popup
the music caters to the star wars atmosphere and is good
the gameplay suffers from a high level of difficultyas a diehard star wars fan i can not recommend this game
rent this one first if you feel like you must own itwithin  seconds this game pulled me in
the ships are amazing the combat spectacular and the story exciting
for once even some of the characters are really cool the alien ones of course
overall this game is really amazing
some of the missions have so many enemy ships flying around it really is incredible to seethe problems with the game are a couple of stupid missions
the cliche canyon run is so over done as to be utterly dull
every starwars game has a canyon run
and the other cliche the fly inside a ship
they dont even make any sense
the space missions were the best and gave the best feel of flying a starfighterbut the biggest problem is the game is totally short
 hours of play and i had finished
 hours and its all over
just when things seem to be getting exciting its overoverall its a good and fun game
but its length is a real drawback
they are on the right track
but not there yetthe graphics are pretty grand in places and i must say that i really adore the flight control on the main three ships a combination of older star wars flying controls and the simpler star fox flying method
the onboard info targeting system shield indicator etc takes a bit to get used to but gets intuitive real fastthe fallbacks are not in actual gameplay but in the fact that ive managed to lock up the game three times on two different copies
twice on the initual bomber stage and once in the one with the sattelites and the planetary cannon
i also absolutely abhor the game boundaries
flying into an invisible wall will shake and bounce your fighter all over the place like youve run into a rock ledge rather than youve hit the boundary of the level
other than the lockups and the poor implementation of boundaries though its a great game something to play on the ps besides ssx and oni finallyif youre buying it strictly with a graphical orgy in mind youre going to be disappointed in a lot of places but if youre buying it for a highpaced flying game and pulling some amazing feats of dogfighting youre in luckthis is the first disappoint ive had with my ps so far
the graphics in starfighter are good but more than anything else they reminded me of how amazing rogue squadrons graphics were on the n a number of years ago
another problem is the fact that the vehicles of episode one are simply not as interesting and thus as fun to fly as those of the original trilogy
additionally the first three or four levels were down right boring and i was soon regretting my purchasethe game does eventually pick up
there are some very cool levels which are both graphically stunning and a lot of fun to play
the use of both planet side and space battles is also a nice touch something that was conspicuously missing from rogue squadron
the control is also top notch
while the graphics arent is good as they could have been its the ps for cryin out loud the sound is top notch
the voice acting ranges from adequate to superb and the characters voices are actually somewhat unique a rarity is star wars games
the cutscenes are also pretty impressivewhile i would recommend this game my biggest peeve is that its way too short
first off the levels are too short
often times i found myself wishing that a level would have gone on for another five or ten minutes
this game is supposed to represent interstellar war yet most of the battles could be completed in a couple of minutes
more than anything else though the entire experience is over way to quickly
it took me around five hours to complete all of the standard missions on the same day i bought it
there need to be about twice as many levels as are found in this game just as soon as things start to get interesting theyre over
luckily bonus levels and bonus ships do make the game last a little longerthe most important aspect of this game is that once you get past the first couple of levels it is really a lot of fun you get to issue orders to wingmen and everything but make no mistake this game is no killer ap
id rent it before buyingthis game started off great
graphics are magnificent sound effects are astounding beginning credits gave that real star wars movie feelbut after a while things just seemed to get too repetitive
basically every mission is to destroy destroy destroy all enemy shipsa short movie scenethen destroy destroy destroyi dont knowit just got tiring after a few hours
controls are sort of difficult
i mean if this was quotreal lifequot flying a ship and targeting would probably be much more difficult therefore this game has certain degree of realism to it
perhaps im not such a big fan of these types of gamesit reminds me of that old game descent where you simply blast everything in sight
if youre a fan of descent and star wars this game may be perfect for you and id definitely recommend it
but if youre expecting a sort of strategic mystery or puzzle type thing this is not for you
this game is simply a flight simulator where you enhance your skills as a fighter pilot by thrusting and swooping in all directions and destroying enemy ships until the screen reads mission completethis game just didnt hype me up to see what happens as i progressed every stage
after two hours of continuous blasting it just got tiring and frustrating
by the way this game will get you really dizzy because you are constantly in motion trying to target that one little ship after another
overall this game is not a bad game
i guarantee flight sim  and star wars fans will love it
i blame myself for buying this game
im simply a star wars fan and not a flight sim type of personthe game starts out very slowly but heats up after the rd or th mission
after that its a nonstop rollercoaster of star wars mayhem
you will actually feel like youre in the star wars universe
the battles are intense with an incredible amount of enemies onscreen at oncethe missions are actually quite long most lasting over seven to eight minutes
this can be a hinderance in some cases for the levels start out easy become insanely difficult at the end thus forcing you to start from the beginning each time you diethe control over the ship is intuitive
the voice acting is ranges from satisfactory to downright outstanding
the movie scenes border on adequate to slightly subparstar wars fans should buy this right now all others should rent it immediately
its just not quite long enough to warrant a purchase for nonfans of the seriesdissapointing for a ps game but worth the buy if you havent played rouge squandron and dont own n
it starts off okay by giving you a training mission to complete that covers the basics but isnt impossible to beat so you have a good idea around how to navigate
the first real mission is a lot like alot of the colony wars ii missions
the graphics are cool lays a good arena for a air fight but doesnt hinder you with slow speed or gun overheating like cwii
i guess the only issue i have is it is alot of what ive seen before in ps and n games
honestly i would say if you want a great star wars game rouge squandron for n is still it so dust it off
if you dont own it and never played rs then this game comes close enough and i would reccomend a buyis how short it is
i want to preface my only criticism by saying that everything else youre reading in these reviews is very true
this game has stunning visuals in both the gameplay and cutscenes
the music as always is the case with products from the star wars franchise is outstanding
the controls are wonderful the diversity of the three shipspilots available to you compliment one another perfectly
i could go on and on about how great it is but ill leave that to the other reviews and address the one issue i had known myself going into the purchaseits very shorti have to admit i played on normal instead of hard easy is also available but the difficulty merely reflects the number of and intelligence of your enemies  not the amount of time playing
in total i probably finished this game in  hours of play
thats including a couple missions i had to take second or third stabs at
the game has no multiplayer element obviously so once youve completed the missions once the only things left to do are complete them at a harder level  or try to get a higher medal in the assignments
this is often as difficult as shaving off a few seconds or killing an extra baddiethis really is a wonderful game but i wish i had rented it instead of just buyingi orginally bought this game because it supports  players
even with a largescreen tv  inches it is too difficult for each player to see enough of their scree to identify the enemiesi do like the aiming system in this game much better than most first person shootertype games
playing in  person mode is pretty good
it is difficult but not too difficult to control the character in the gamehaving lived in japan for about the first year of pss release ive played a lot of the new games
my theory is the first wave of games ill consider metal gear solid the next gen are pretty much good for one kind of thing
its either massive battle attck like sangoku musoo  dynasty warriors cool swordplayswashbuckling zombie killing action like in onimusha  warlords or robot simulation like in gundam
i rate of the above games with a  stars
quotx squadquot or quotcross firequot as it is called in japan is actually pretty good  i didnt buy it until i could get used
that is a good price to pay for this highly engaging shootemup game
think of metal gear solid minus the stealth imperative for its action and feel as you try to take out the army of bad guys
as the amazon editor said it isnt a perfect game
but ive already spent more than  days playing it always trying to go back and improve my skills on the lower levelsconsidering that most experienced gamers can probably beat warlords prob
what is so far the most beautiful rich game out there this game is nice in that you dont feel the need to speed through levels
taking out the bad guys with teamwork and carefully placed shots is really fun
i agree with the amzn editor  you definitely cant count on your buddies to win the game for you but steadily improving them is challenging and part of the games appeallike i said youd be a fool not to pick up this game
anyhow a lot of fun
pick it up and share it with a friendfor one of the first ps games this is a pretty solid shootemup
granted much better ones have appeared since but with the new low price i would still recommended this to someone looking for a solid actionfilled game that isnt too difficultthe perspective is rdperson which might turn some off but after getting accustomed to the controls this game can be rewarding
one high point is the availability of good weapons that you can earn with more points making it a good challenge to outfit yourself properly before each mission
for instance you have  different kinds of shotguns  different sniper rifles and even a massive predatorstyle chain gunthis game features you as ash the leader of the xsquad which include  other members
the effectiveness of the other members is highly dependent on your strategy and leadership during the action as well as your willingness to outfit your team with good weapons
they all have the default handgun
you may often choose to hog all of the great weapons to yourself as this is tempting but equipping the team with shotguns and assault rifles will significantly increase their usefulness instead of sending them in as cannon fodder
theres the usual shootemup story which im rarely concerned with
this one is serviceable and sets up plenty of violent actionbig complaint  the lack of a mature rating
sure the game is violent but there is not blood or gore something red faction and half life feature liberal doses ofstill at the new discounted price this is worthy for a long weekend of leisure
its at least a solid rental
sadly no  player mode
a death match would have been a nice touchnot a bad effort from ea known more for their sports games
their  agent under fire for ps is a much better game with more extrasi loved hot shots  hot shots  was not by the same company and the putting in it was rather awful so now tampe soft is back after working on mario golf
and here is what they have to offerfirst off the loading time is horrible
the quotslow motion of all the shotsquot and etc
can be abated by holding down x on the gamepad it just makes me wonder why this isnt the default mode
the only other nauseating thing about the game is the timing of the swings
it is illogical that the speeds of the swings change depending on your club the timing should all be rather similar as in the other games this in my mind is not an improvementthat being said the horrible  min game you are forced to sit through when playing with a computer opponent is actually a good thing it makes you pace your games
each stroke is important as you are making a time investment approximately  minutes between your own hits if you are taking turns with the cpu
this and the replayability by sitting there vegging out and playing forever is nil
you are forced to play the game over weeks and months there are many stats hooray
as well as items to unlock like gloves bags etcas far as the sound issue be real about it
there has never been any sports game with an announcer coach caddie etc
that didnt get nauseating after a few plays just turn the sound off or down if you dont like itthe physics seem phony at times too
the drives actually bounce and roll quite nicely but short range chip shots are a painalso be aware that everything in the game is possible after getting the right gear by winning or purchasingthere are still the problems with goofy putting physics and par  holes which are just eagle fodder even at the lowest gearskill rating but this is simply the best golfing game in terms of stats options skills and quotstoryquot that there iswhen i rented this game i was expecting a cartoony game with average graphicswhat i got was an amazingly deep game for the playstation with great graphicsthe game is very easy to pick up and play and the story mode is very funthe game does load a little slow and it is sometimes unfair when you are chipping near the greensbut otherwise this game plays like mario golf for the ngolf fans should like this game and non golfers will like how easy it is to pick up and play it for a whilerent and enjoythen maybe buy itthis game is set in the fuedal times in japanese history
basically it is a strategy game where you must make real time strategical war decisions
the cutscenes and graphics in this game are awesome but youll find yourself spending more time watching the cutscenes and cinematic results of you decisions than you will actually pushing buttons
it actually requires lots of patience to go through battle after battle but if you enjoy the time consuming of nature of role playing games this is no rpg but there are many similar elements you will enjoy this game
im just a little too impatient and like the action type button pushing games myself which is why i only gave it  stars
have you ever played final fantasy  or  and wished you could skip the summoning guardian force scenes becuase youve seen them so many times
if so then youre impatient like me   i get that same feeling sometimes in this games regardless of the great graphics
all in all this is actually a high quality game with great graphics
definitely one of the better launch gameskessen is risk of the east
its a great concept with exceptional graphics
the game play is slow but so is war
if youve got the time to play it this game is a good buyif the goal behind kessen was to create a spectacularlooking display of medieval japanese warfare it succeeds and then some
if the goal was to make a good realtime strategy game however kessen fails
while at first its breathtaking to watch the clash of dozens of incredibly detailed th century japanese soldiersriflemen archers swordsmen lancersaccompanied by the roar of battle and epic music kessens focus on eye and ear candy hurts the gameplay
this is most evident in the many beautiful but repetitive cinemas youre forced to watch that show every little thing that occurs on the battlefield
while the closein battle scenesthe best part of the gamelook amazing the player has little control there beyond watching them
you exert most of your control at the battle screen a wideangle view with a totally different graphics enginehere your units are scruffy d icons
sadly the controls in the battle screen are totally counterintuitive making it a slow tedious chore to command your units
its extremely difficult just to roam around the map choose a unit and give it an order
youre also thrown all over the map when responding to your lieutenants constant queries and reports
you never feel in control of a large battle but feel like an observer of many small disconnected battles
if youre looking for a good strategy game seek elsewhere
if you want to show off the amazing graphics of your new ps or if youre a fanatic for japanese history kessen deliversi love sim games
anything you can build and watch grow and develop is fun for me
i new about theme park years ago and fell in love with the series
i found other quotthemequot game like theme park hospital and roller coaster all by bullfrog
this game is very time consuming and difficult but once you understand the basics it becomes repetitive and easy
you can access additonal parks with golden tickets that you earn for keeping your park up to par
for example one way to get a golden ticket is to add a trash can to every shop
the game is fun but after hours of play you only want to gain access to new parks
unfortunately theme roller coaster only his  parks
the game cheapens as you play reruns of the same parks after the th park
you have many extras and challenges but its still the same park
the first park is pre historic park the second is halloween town the third is a wonderland rip off and the final park is a space future like park
the only reason i play this game is to get new parks but you can only get the same parks reruns and you dont really feel like playing the same thing anymore
you must must must have a memory card to play this game otherwise you will spend hours trying to build up your park and lose everything
my game gliches and i lose everything if i dont save every ten minutes i dont know if this is true for all games but beware
its not fun to start all over
all in all this game is ok to good
if you are a die hard sim collectorlover you want to buy this one
if you dont like sim games and have little time to play dont buy this
like i said its a good game but its not the greatest
make more parksreceived my copy yesterday and here are some observations
the interface is very clunky and poorly visible similar to fifa  as compared to the clear menus in madden   the graphics have their moments and there is no slowdown or breakup but compared to madden or ssx live looks psish
the gameplay is exactly like the recent editions of live it is fun to play but after all these years the ai of your teammates is still at the genesis level no motion on offense no boxing out
also there is no challenge system or franchise mode which is unforgivable compared to maddenthis is not a game you want to play season after season
compared to madden this game does not have any type of franchise mode
the graphics are better but this improvement doesnt warrant a purchase
also coming out halfway through the current nba season we know that nba live  will be out sooner than we think this octoberby then well see some major improvements
well hopefully have the franchise mode better game playgraphics challenge mode etc  if anything this game offers less than the ps nba live   the only new things were getting is the better graphics and you can view them at your local store display or rent the game to appreciate that
other than that theres no reason to own this long term because ea sports has not provided us a reason to play it long termlets hope nba live  is much betterea sports new basketball title is just the beginning of what i hope would continue to be the best title i was disappointed in the lack of response between the controller and the action on the court the ai can get a little wild when a player gets a big lead i mean   pointers from mid court in one game come on
the players movement is not that great i hope that ea sport will go back to the drawing board and speed up the play
i would say that i know that they will improve this title for playstation   if you love basketball ea sports is in the gamenba live has consistantly been the best basketball game on the market and every year new things are added
untill now
this years version is just average
the game looks great and the players are very detailed and the new post up option is great
unfortunatly the  on  mode is very boring
another downer is that the players dont have thier actuall faces and the three point shootout is missing
the games season option lost some of its appeal without a franchise mode available
i hope ea uses this game as a stepping stone and improves on it next year by adding some new modes and working on the gameplay
despite these few let downs the game is still a blast when playing with a group of friends and a multitapkiss psycho circus the nightmare child is mildly entertaing first person shooter the graphics are decent the controls are allright using the  buttons as movement keys and the analog stick as your look mecanism
there is a smattering of kiss music in the game and you get to see the characters develop as they find pieces of their armor
the single person mode is fun enough but the weapons arent varied enough they should have put more in the game
there are  worlds one for each kiss band member and  nemesis
what the dreamcast version of this game is missing is any kind of multiplayer  online or otherwise  they rushed this title out without developing any multiplayer or online modes
seeing how nicely the dc is handling online play this is just outrageous for a newly released fps no excuses
this is why the title garners  stars its for die hard single player fps or die hard kiss fans although i am not sure that it will satisfy eitheri love survival horror games
its one of the only reasons i play video games at all on consoles
alone in the dark  is one of those games that grows on you and now i cant stop playing it
im hookedi am a huge fan of the resident evil series and i think aitd separates itself from re in such a way that it is close but not too close evoking its own sense of fear and even loathing at some of the creaturesif you are a fan of hp lovecraft you will appreciate the alone in the dark game even more
if you havent read hp lovecraft do yourself a favor and pick up one of his books
you will find laid out before you the type of gothic horror world envisioned by a person of lovecrafts talents and neatly woven into a game like aitdfor survival horror fans you will not be disappointed with this game
i have always been a fan of infogrames and i will be forevermorethis game would be much better is the scenery was improved
its somewhat boring flying around with only green blue and brown boxes showing on the groundive got combat flight simulator cfs  europe but bought this one too for the naval aviation aspect and thought it cheaper to buy cfs than the pacific expansion disks released for the older game
virtually all wwii sims of the past decade were set in europe
despite a large number of titles there hasnt been any pto sims of note since  pacific air war and pacific strike of the mid s
microprose followed paw up with european air war and the similarly set b eajanes followed world war  fighters with attack squadron  both set over europe ms returned to europe with cfs bypassing korea which richly deserved attention  in cfs you fly missions from japanese or american island bases or carriersin many ways cfs excels as an improvement over the older cfs naval aviation aside but is also a major disappointment for the exact same reason  if you own the older game as i do youll probably spend more time trying to spot the improvements than just enjoying it
though the premise is different and sports a newer look between the missions where the bleak look of cfs seems to have been inspired by episodes of world at war colorful comicstrip panels that seem inspired by noseart ala roy lichtenstein dominates cfs if you saw the old marvel superheroes adventures of the s you know what i mean the game never capitalizes enough on its newer concept to break away from cfs
youre still in a pure fighter sim using the same tactics and weapons as in cfs
terrain is a huge improvement but the graphics quality of the aircraft is not
smoking effects are an improvement the kind you get when you mortally wound an enemy plane but the soundgraphics related to enemy bullets is completely unconvincing bullets sound as if theyre whizzing past you even while punching holes through your hellcat
the naval aviation aspects of cfs are also a mixed bag between wow and huh
on the one hand ships actually move not like the perpetually parked steamers and uboats of cfs and even bob
on the other hand the sim doesnt let you fly the planes that flew antishipping strikes dive bombers and torpedoe planes like the tbf or sbd and none of your flyable planes are armed with torpedoes
though ships are an improvement over those in cfs thats not saying much
while ships in cfs now burn and even stop dead in the water before sinking rather than just disappear in a puff of polygonfire they otherwise slip quietly and whole beneath the pacific  never breaking apart listing or disgorging fuel or men like the games planes or those in their finest hour of 
your own aircraft carrier remains curiously pristine considering how they were magnets for enemy planes but also devoid of any activity  human or mechanical  unlike the airfields of cfs
to help you land theres an lso landing signal officer but he appears not on the carrier but in the radar window on your left side
looking much like the aol stickfigure i cant imagine this guy guiding anybody up the gangplank let alone talking a landing airplane onto the wire
ive become proficient at carrier landings despite getting a waveoff
on every approach
he doesnt even speak  the lso has a pretty finite number of phrases waveoff power raise altitude or youre too high to think of a few
a talking lso was a fixture of f fleet defender 
not that carrierflying isnt a welcome challenge its just painfully obvious that nobody explored the cool ways to make the most of it
campaigns are prescripted though dynamic campaigns would probably be wasted on a sim of this type
that doesnt excuse an unnecessarily rigid mission requirement system that wont allow you to jump once youre out of ammo or damaged
that itself was not as problematic as the alternative  i was willing to fly back to my carrier in real time only to find that the inflight map brought me back to where my carrier had been when i launched not where it had gotten to about  hours laterin short cfs is more of a gameengine than completed game
likely you can fill in the gaps described above with thirdparty software on the internet
but its an insult that cfs is so far short of its potential out of the box
i bought the newer game because i expected more than an evolved form of cfs i couldve gotten that myself
thats a shame because the sim itself is such a beaut  one in which those interested enough can learn about the mechanics of wwii engines face the challenge of carrierlanding battledamaged planes or triumph over the supremely nimble japanese planes using diveandzoom techniques rather than trying to outturn them as pilots will try by instinct
it wasnt until i reached mid that i encountered clouds  but they were beautiful
for its faults cfs is that rare sim that keeps you coming back and goes to lengths to keep you out of slew modei ran cfs  on a pghz winxp wgame port controls
graphics were acceptably fluid and there were no controllability problems though load times are high
if you havent bought any wwii sims since the mids id suggest this one
otherwise youll have to weigh your interest in wwii naval aviation against the price of this one and your eagerness to have to customize a sim in ways youd expect it to behave out of the boxso ive been flying flight sims since the days of fs version  and i was pretty psyched about this game after reading all the reviews
after playing it however ive come away somewhat disappointed
its not a bad game but its not as good as it could bewhats rightbeautiful graphics
this is one pretty gamenice selection of planes to fly with different and reasonably wellmodeled flight characteristicsexcellent detail on the engine controls and damage modelingwhats wrongrepetitive inflexible missions
take off accelerate time to target zone dogfight or bomb accelerate time home
yawn
after about five missions i was starting to feel like id seen everythinguseless wingmenlimited radio commands to issue and the wingmen never seem to listen anywayuseless lso for carrier landings and terrible lookingcouldnt they at least animate him or do him in d
he looks like a cardboard cutout
follow his instructions and youll miss the deck every single timeno torpedoes
how do you model the pacific war without including torpedoesbut the reason i was most disappointed with it was that i never got the feeling of being immersed in a bigger conflictall the missions just seemed very limited and not very interesting
its a shame  theyve got nice graphics and flight models here but it seems like they never spent the time to flesh out the rest of the gamethis is a lovecraft style horror game with lots of mood
the game is engaging enough for puzzle  horror fans but shooter style gamers will be frustrated
its definitely not quake
it has some rough edges
the game saves at level points so anything youve done in an area is undone so its best to clear a room and go back to a cleared area to save
mildly annoying
the camera angles are sometimes awkward for combat and can get you killed as the monsters suddenly appear
on the other hand it gives a nice creepy claustrophobiuc feel to the game
the design and nonmoving graphics are pretty cool
but the monsters while innovatively designed are rendered in such a way to make them look too much like cardboard cut outs
the puzzles are about medium difficulty although in my opinion too many quotfind the keyquot type puzzles
the game has an excellent backstory of a family entwined with evil for several generations
it would make a good novel
the game is worth playing but not the game of the yeari could overlook all of the beforementioned flaws  but the one flaw that sinks this game is the horrible save feature
i dont know what the designers were thinking when they came up with that but it sucks all the fun out of the gameif you truly want a game that is befitting of the horror genre then i recommend clive barkers undying
i can only recommend this game to the hardcore alone in the dark fans of yesteryeargame designerprogrammer ron gilbert is the equivalent of a folk hero for several thousands of old school adventure game fans
he was the brain behind s maniac mansion a seminal graphic adventure game with unprecedented atmosphere and storytelling the brain behind s the secret of monkey island another milestone that took absolutely everything about adventure games to the next level and the brain behind s monkey island  an epic refined and outlandish piece of art that i seriously believe is the best adventure game ever made
he left lucasarts soon after for reasons that were discussed to deathmonkey island  has nothing to do with ron gilbert
it has everything to do with lucasarts greed to make some new bucks off the revival of their flagship adventure game series several years after gilberts departure when lucasarts was very probably faced with diminishing sales and critical receptionthis games popularity baffles me
then again maybe not as i can see where its coming from
monkey is like an indiana jones film not directed by steven spielberg or like a harry potter novel not written by jk rowling
it lacks the soul of the series or worse yet it is replaced with a different soul
obviously this is not sensed by those who dashed through the originals in a superficial way
it is only felt unanimously by fans who embraced monkey and monkey to their hearts or were even obsessed about them like i was in my late teens
see not obsessing about a game series is no sin
in fact the world probably doesnt need more hardcore game geeks
but trying to argue how a counterfeit entry to the series is on a par with the true classic entries is plain wrong
monkey has superior graphics and music compared to the originals which seem to have dazzled several gamers but this is the only upside i can think ofmonkey island  was designed and led by the ackleyahern duo with only one of them present in the team of monkey as an animator
while they prove to be capable game developers by and large in the delicate nuanced semiserious and very personal world of ron gilbert they move and thrash around like a particularly clumsy elephant in a porcelain storeregardless if they do or do not understand what made the original games work they prove utterly unable to emulate their general weirdness their general ron gilbertness
now its hard to define this ron gilbertness in mere words and give it a semblance of justice  but for the purposes of this review we can try bittersweet spooky unpredictable odd offbeat atmospheric enchanting smart subversive tragicomic and poignant definitely poignant
the design in monkey sometimes manages to be remotely spooky andor atmospheric the theater scene comes to mind but thats where similarities endaimed squarely at prospective new fans who were probably still preteens during the run of the original monkey island games monkey island  is an ok if unremarkable adventure game when taken strictly in isolation
it looks well plays well and sounds great
but its not a proper monkey island entry
what lucasarts does here is effectively betraying the old fans and ron gilbert himself i guess and producing something lighter less profound less edgy and more pg than monkey island  and  all for the sake of catering to a fresher audience
out of cold calculation the monkey island soul is replaced by a cheaper downsized one that proves incapable of emulating the feeling mood and peculiar jokes of the original despite trying hardall this results in that no real fan of the series would honestly cheer this game
they just feel its fake like a changeling
what is there to cheer about an indiana jones movie deprived of spielbergi enjoyed this game what i played of it i still havent gone back to it without a cheat sheet youll go nowhere i know i dont have one the graphics are great but its somewhat boring but then again im into action and adventure you might like this someday when im bored ill go back to it and try to get it to go somewhere ho humheres a review for  more than ten years after the game was made
adventure games have always been a friend of mine
having heard grim fandango is the best adventure game ever made time and time again i had to go back to see why this under appreciated gem was so avoided and never reproduced
the funny thing is  i really should of played this game back when it came out to avoid the pampering ive enjoyed with myst same and max episodic content siberia series journeyman project series longest journey and of course the monkey island adventures
grim fandango might be the single reason why adventure games are so loved and so hated
im actually starting to see why the genre is still slowly dyingyouve heard the great things about this game so ill update everyone on the negatives
first of all the bugs
download the patches and run in compatibility mode  or  and you may get the game to work
theres other things youll need to do so check the forums  it will work eventuallynow for the unacceptable this is the single handed reason why grim fandango will never hit the big leagues the interaction setup
its the worst setup ive seen and its why it never caught on in any of the adventure games youve seen or probably played theres no cursor hot spots are invisible and getting your avatar grim to do anything correct is like swimming up a creek without a paddle
if they ever rerelease this game expect them to do away with this setup entirely and go to a cursor
also grim has buckets of invisible walls to aid the avatar in direction a word of advice if at first you dont succeedas for the puzzles the bread and butter of an adventure game mixed bag
puzzle solutions are thwarted by lackluster interaction throughout the game as many have mentioned keep a cheat sheet handy
dont go against the grain and attempt to do what others have not
you wont pass this game without a cheat sheet  theres one small invisible area in this game world that will register an action and if youre not in that small location when you perform the correct action thats too bad for youi like going against the grain and proving that i can solve puzzles that others cant which is why i really hated this game  there really wasnt puzzles per say just chance and an impending passion to finish grim fandango as soon as humanly possible
as we all know the game had creativity design and characters like none other  but the game has scaled terribly
look to grim to discover the greats of the adventure genre as well as its eventual downfallat the time of this review there were an unprecedented  fivestar reviews out of   since it is ten or so years past the release date i had to wait until i could find it new at the noncollector price
during my long wait i allowed myself to build up some pretty high expectations for which i blame my disappointmentinstallation went smoothly on xp but i found a few things to keep in mind game did not work in compatibility mode worked fine without compatibility game frequently crashed with a sound loop
it is not your background programs antivirus or screensaver
it is caused by your processor and is fixed easily by imagecfgexe which is applied to the game executable file and does not affect anything else on your pcwhile the atmosphere story soundtrack and voice acting were among the best i have seen fivestar the keyboard controls were absolutely zerostar
i have played games with keyboard control before and usually dont even notice after the initial adjustment
i struggled with these controls right up to the enda note to anyone considering this game use the decimal point on your keypad to cycle mannys focus in places where there are more than one item to interact with
this will make gameplay much more bearablethe puzzles also rank a dismal zerostar
there is little in the way of logic that can be applied to most of these puzzles
i ended up relying heavily on walkthroughs to finish the gameit is a classic game and i am glad to have had the experience
if you liked syberia you will probably love this game
if you liked schizm you probably will not like it so welli am a huge fan of the rollercoaster tycoon series so i thought i would check this expansion pack out
my first idea was to actually return this
the only thing added are some new scenarios which really are nothing special some small shops and a couple of lame new rides
this is nothing compared to the corkscrew follies pack which was like a whole other game in itself
if someone asked me if they should buy this the answer would be a resounding no
save your pennies for something elsei feel hasbros played an interesting marketing game here with their rollercoaster tycoon fans
if youve been playing and love this game you pretty much have to get this expansion because it allows you to control things and set environments and theming in ways you havent been able to before and thats everything in a strategygoaljust have fun game like thison the other hand if you bought the corkscrew follies expansion pack then there is unequivocally not enough here to justify shucking your thirty bucks
sure you can play in the snow theres a couple new coasters some new scenarios and things are much more customizable
but why couldnt they include such seemingly obvious improvements in corkscrew follies
its really a lackluster handful of new goodies that isnt worth the moneyon the other hand if you own only the original game the combined corkscrew follies and loopy landscapes you get with this is worth it
but as ive said if youve got corkscrew follies wait for rollercoaster tycoon  which im sure will be a leap beyond the current gamered faction is thqs futuristic marstheme first person shooter game
over all it is a pretty ordinary shooter with one or two twists
the first twist is the underutilized geo mod engine
the geo mod engine the purpose is to make blowing stuff up more meaningful by letting craters and holes form from explosions
the idea is that you can blast through walls or around locked doors
its a good selling point but there is hardly any use for it in the game
once you get past the first mission you never use it
all of the doors are basically unlocked for you anyways so whats the point
the other twist is the use of some really cool vehicles
this was my favorite part of the game
flying around or driving around in an armored vehicle and mowing down bad guys with a heavy machine gun is good mindless shooter fun
there are also a couple of points in the game where you pilot a submarine or an aircraftthere is a good variety of weapons and ammo in the game all of which are useful at some point
red faction does a better job than most games of getting all of the weapons into the game
enemy ai is tough but still at the right levelother than that the game is pretty blah
the environments are as repetitive as you can get
you are on mars  everything is either an underground installation or a rustcolored cave
the graphics are decent but not great
the storyline is an unoriginal mix between deus ex and total recall
add to that its somewhat poorly done
also for some reason thq decided to include a couple of contrived bad stealth missions in this game
they are more annoying than anything
the game gets extremely hard about halfway through and towards the end of the game you will find yourself wearing out the quick save and quick load keys
this is due mostly to one annoying and overpowered weapon that allows enemies to shoot you through wallsred faction isnt a bad game
i found it in the bargain bin and i dont regret buying it
it gives you one fun play through and thats probably it
the game probably wont knock you out of your chair thoughthe graphics are great the damage effects are wonderful but it is still the same old d shooter in a fancy new bag
what do i mean
well you have the quotswitch huntingquot type plot
i hate switch hunting
if the game allows you to blow up anything and red faction does not then finding keys or switches should be irreleventthe game is fun but it would be much better if it refrained from the quotgreat keyswitch huntquoti have to admit i am a bit dissapointed in this game
while the graphics are excellent for the most part the cut scene closeups are almost an insult to the rest of the game
capek has got to be the cheesiest looking character i have ever seen in a fps game
the plot of the single player mission is nothing like halflife as someone said in a review and halflife is still top dog in fps games
i admit the weapons are pretty cool but i dont see any significant difference in the so called geomod engine and other good fps enginesunreal halflife etc in fact so far i havent been able to blow much of anything up
also the plot of the game is very vague and you cant even look at your objectives or anything to know what you have and havent done
one of the most annoying things in this game that just about had me spitting nails was the stupid civilian people who when they see anyone waving a gun kneel down in the doorways and block your way every time
bottom line mediocre game at best but definitely no challenge to halflife
halflife is still the best by farwell first let me tell you that i have been waiting for red faction ever since i heard about it six months ago
the ability to punch holes through anything
a submarine and plane flying machine whatever
and a good story
well needless to say i was engaged as nearly every fps fan was
but the red faction they promised is very different from what they released
sure geomod technology lives up to the hype except you can use it almost nowhere
and the engine is complete trash
i almost died from laughter watching guys run around their legs look like a cheap cartoon that is missing a couple of animations and speaking the mouth animation is worse than halflife
and the vehicles are nice but you hardly get any the submarines are very cool though
if this game had been released with the qta engine quake iii team arena with the geomod tech tied in it would have been a winner
now it is just a game to play for a couple hours not really a halflife killer or a legend
if this game had had a bit more polish it would have been the bestrobbiesure the multiplayer is a million times better in the pc version than in the ps but like many other games that have made the switch from pc to console or consols to pc red faction pc has a lot of flaws that the ps version doesntfirst and most importantly do not get this game if you have a laptop computer
that is unless you can figure out an easy way to configure the controls
ive been trying all day to get something i am comfortable with and it just isnt working
i may just have to breakdown and put the game on my family computer instead and i really didnt want to have to do thatsecond the geo mod is a lot slower than the ps geo mod sometimes you have to sit and look at a wall for a second or two before the hole decides to show upthe final negative i have to groan about is the map generator
i thought id be able to make something fairly easily like i do with timesplitters but i dont understand this mapmaker one bitits confusing complicated and not very well documentedthat is about all there is that is really bad about this system but that first one really bugs me since the whole reason i bought the game was so that i could take my laptop over to a friends house and we could hook  or  computers up and play but the controls are just too weirdnow for the good stuffmore characters
about twice as many characters as in the ps versionmore levels
tons of levels plus if custom levels if i can ever figure out how to use the map generatori say if you have a desktop computer or if you dont have a ps go ahead and get this game because it is an excelent first person shooter
but if all you have is a laptop or you dont really plan on doing too much multiplayer with more than one other person stick with the psproject igi is a first person shooter with  very challenging missions all set in europe
the gameplay is fantastic and never boring
the graphics and sound are fantastic
the textures are great and the humans look realthe outdoor environment is really great if you see a mountain very far away you can go and climb it the rain and snow weather effects are superb
the indoor environment is also very good but in all the levels it is the same graphics repeated again and again like a computer room sleeping bunker water tank ect ect
the selection of weapons are superb from glock desert eagle uzi ak spas  jack hammer dragunov colt annaconda ect
but unfortunatly you cannot choose your weapons before the mission starts
and you cannot carry the weapons to the next mission even if it starts at the place where the previous mission ended
the level designing is very good but no training mission almost all the missions takes place outdoors with a few indoor sequences the levels are very large and very hard to get through
it does not have a save game feature but it did not bother me because the gameplay is very good and nonboreing that to start the mission from the begining is not that frustrating
the enemy ai is very poor they will react if they see you but when you are if you shoot one gaurd standing behind him his partner will not respond
in some missions if you shoot the security camera the alarm will go on and in some missions it does not
but still the security camera and alarms are the real threat because the alarm not only alerts gaurds it respawns gaurds
gaurds will come from a room which was empty a few seconds ago if you kill them all and turn off the alarm and when it goes on again more gaurds will come from the empty room
when you are playing this game you yourself will see gaurds reappear from thin air right in front of you i have seen it a lot of times
the enemy ai may be super dumb but because of the no save game they are very threatining
if you are a fan of nolf hitman rainbow six ect then you will surely like project igi
tip before you make you move into the mission use your binoculars to look arround it will show you the enemy gaurds marked in red squares and it will be easy for you to know where the gaurds arei have only played the demo and while it is challenging i am not sure if i like the interface or not
i mean i prefer to press the up button to climb up a ladder not wait for a little picture of the guy climbing to appear and clicking on it to carry out the depicted action
my biggest problem was that it wouldnt let me use my arrows on the keyboard to turn right or left
i am not used to using the mouse as i have always used my keyboard to control the character
but i hope theyll have a patch to fix that soon it looks like a truly good game
i did find cheats online for igi but they wouldnt work when i tried to implement themgreat graphics but poorly planned   the engine works well most of the time
there are a few glitches where dead soldiers reappear if you step in the wrong place
the weapons and action are realistic and thrilling
the big disappointment is there is no way to save the game
even the patch thats out is too complicated for noncomputer folks to figure out
unlike other titles the scenes tend to get a little repetitive
once youve been in some of the buildings you feel like you are back in them again in the next missioni can tell you right away what my favourite thing about tomb raider chronicles is rome
these beginning levels are a characteristic yet eventful start to a game which the other titles in the series couldve been proud of
too bad that its only  levels long
i dont know what to say about this game
i cant help but think it was an unnecessary addition to the tomb raider series being that it doesnt really add anything
not to mention is it just ludicrously short and vague
it has its ideas but none of these were properly developed
part of the problem may have been the premise but the execution is really what killed ittomb raider chronicles really busted out of the back of the phenomenal tomb raider the last revelation
core clearly wanted the story to end there but eidos and the fans naturally didnt so core faced a serious problem how to possibly make a new adventure starring lara croft after the way the last revelation ended
the magic word was midquel the premise of tomb raider chronicles is tying up loose ends
something about that premise was lost in development though as i dont see how any of the four adventures touch upon any loose threads from the other games  except the iris quest of coursethe game is completely identical to tomb raider the last revelation in terms of graphics and interface right down to the font
there isnt much talk of improvement though indeed the fmvs are a serious slip in quality after the last revelations magnificent fullmotion cinema scenes
the environments that lara battles through however are quite nicely crafted especially the rome and von croy industries levels
there are nice little touches such as when you get to explore the locker rooms and showers of the russian military
one thing that bugs me about the last revelation is the complete lack of costume changes
chronicles changes that with the final costume even being a matrixlike stealth outfit complete with black plastic and interlink shades
the lions in the rome levels are beautiful and will make the lions from the first tomb raider seem like a complete joke in comparison
its only a slight improvement over the last revelations graphics at best thoughif the graphics equal the predecessor the music may miss the mark but only just
the soundtrack is not as strong as the last revelations but then peter conelly really was on his own here
its tomb raider  happening all over again with some tunes redone or just plain reused
conelly did craft some sublime music though such as the choir in the opening titles and the riveting underwater music
there is some actionpacked stuff and even some beautiful little tunes so its certainly a more impressive sountrack than the one in tomb raider  you cant score gold all the timethis game will cancel out your expectations of building up a huge arsenal with which to stand a chance against the games toughest enemies and levels
rather than a long consistent game trc consists of  entirely separate adventures reminisced upon by three of her friends two of which weve never seen before tied together by rather lukewarm fmv dialogues
this means that you cannot carry over any weaponsitems between adventures you start over from scratch with every mission
storywise this is more than understandable especially seeing how the two latter missions force you to question your dependency on your marksmanship
one of them sees a teenage lara again this time exploring a haunted island in a fit of dangerous curiosityone thing trc has going for it is in its exploration of four basic gaming approaches
the first mission is familiar tomb raider ground with a nice viewpoint
the second is more actionpacked and claustrophobic
the third sees guns just out of the question while the last is as much about using your head as using your limited weaponry
perhaps the games best excuse for being is the final mission which is not only quite thrilling but also the one storyline that touches on something gamers might have been wondering about up to this point
it explains how the iris first seen in laras mansion in tomb raider  came from being trapped with von croy in cambodia to its pedestal in laras treasure room
its certainly one of the biggest challenges for experts thus far
core didnt hold back when making the final level which is one big challenge from start to finish
youll either love or hate zip a computer wiz who keeps laras ears full of sweeteverythings  essential to the mission at hand but i fear that this is what inspired tomb raider legends constant handholding by zip and alister which to me completely goes against what tomb raider is about
still his and laras chemistry provides loads of reasons to chuckle in a pretty tense gaming environment where one wrong move can have pretty bad consequences
stealth is the name of the game enemy ai has been considerably tweaked in order for lara to be able to sneak past them or even sneak up on themtomb raider chronicles starts out very good and ends very good
and yet its completely unsatisfying to play
once id finished it i found myself wondering if that was it
what could the problem bethe game is vague
nothing is really connected and the dialogue tries more to be witty than informative and meaningful
there is a distinct flair of humour present particularly in the first and last missions but this comes at the cost of any real content
the most serious inconsistency arises in the first story in which laras old rivals larson and pierre dupont try to beat her to the philosophers stone in rome
considering their manner of speech this is supposed to take place after tomb raider  considering that she killed them in said game the suspicion doesnt add up
not to mention is lara not exactly uptodate on her own controls blatantly misinforming you as how to swim and even perform proper jumps
i would have preferred a long game with one clear storyline
admittedly the epic last revelation was a tough act to follow and its one that chronicles was never going to match
still even the story the game does possess is not very involving for the most part
laras teenage story as she helps father patrick fight demons on a remote irish island ranks perhaps as the most unusual plot and a quite interesting one at that
the little part of it thats developed that is
and that is precisely the problem theres nothing epic here
the game promises things but just before they can grow into something the story ends and the next chapter begins
to clinch the deal is the games length
this is the shortest tomb raider of the lot only a measly  levels long usually  levels per story
every adventure is over before it can really begin to flesh itself out
this means that you will whisk through this game in a much greater hurry than the last revelation
the ending of the game doesnt make much sense either and overlooks so many possibilities that could have been exploredtomb raider chronicles lacks the personality of the previous games
even the games shining moment the von croy industries levels while one wild ride from start to finish is not only too short but it doesnt feel like a tomb raider game
the story is unfocused and often nonsensical
it doesnt make any sense how von croy goes from an archaeologist adventurer to a military weapons mogul
not to mention back to an archaeologist adventurer
also why is he in a wheelchair
the character of von croy was completely mutated in this saga
trc is a step back from the last revelations fullon ambitious tombraiding storyno matter how good or bad tomb raider chronicles ever gets a good reason to buy it is for the level editor that comes with it a tool with which you can craft your own tomb raider levels
it comes with last revelation level design schemes for most of the missions not the last sadly but there are plenty of graphical addon packs available
a hefty instructions manual comes on the disc just to get you going
the program takes some memory and i myself have never had the patience to properly get into the thing but its nonetheless a delight for those who always wanted to and many of whom already have create their own tomb raider levelsas for tomb raider chronicles itself i have a lovehate relationship with it
i respect it for its trying to do something with its premise and for challenging the player because it is undoubtedly a challenging game
i equally disrespect it for its vague approach and spirit
i distinguish between enjoyable and concrete
the last revelation was both chronicles is only the first at best
to touch on the rome levels again the first level has doberman pinchers the second has no enemies at all apart from four bosses
good ideas over before they can register
its not as though theres anything wrong with tomb raider chronicles technicallyspeaking its just the fleshedout spirit i miss the spirit which overflowed from the earlier games
it feels a little tired next to them because it has its ideas but it didnt fully develop them
much as it pains me to say it tomb raider chronicles disappointed me a bit and it was a big step down from its predecessor
i still have yet to pick up a tomb raider since that has captivated me though and at least it managed to hold my interest when i first played it
it still holds up as a game i occasionally pop in too so its not bad
it just simply and i do mean quite simply could have been better
tomb raider chronicles was an undeserved and lukewarm finish to laras firstgeneration pc outings
yet for a lukewarm finish its pretty goodtheres much to praise about this latest tomb raider adventure the last in the tr series next year eidoscore will begin tr next generation a game that will be markedly different and feature other playable characters
chrnoicles features new moves vastly differing locales and innovative gameplay
the adventure divided into four areas begins in rome and combines the venicelike sequences of trii with the classic archealogical feel of the original
from there its off to the sunken submarine levels where lara james bondlike must infiltrate a russian military base and stowaway herself onboard a sub
a fifteenyear old weaponless lara then explores the mysteries of a haunted forest probably the weakest area in the game
chronicles then ends with a matrixlike adventure in a highrise building where lara sporting a black leather catsuit and visual headgear must use stealth to escape with a prized artifactthe innovations are quite wonderfultheres an extreme depth suit for underwater exploring chlorofoam soaked cloths for sneaking up behind and taking out unsuspecting guards
the game which is very much in the mold of the last revelation is wonderfully cinematic
the music in particular helps create moodthere are some serious problems with this game however
like last revelation some of the puzzles seem kind of arbitrary
in other words whenever i was stumped which wasnt too often because the game is fairly easy another drawback id eventually find a solution not through logic or brainpower but through trying anything and everything until i was succesful
put simply some time after tr ii core ran out of great puzzle ideas and have resorted to annoying trialanderror style gameplay
sadly though trial and error dont make for fun gamingmore troubling however is the fact that this game is extremely short
i payed  for chronicles because i exptected it to be a full game the length of last revelation say but chronicles is only slightly longer than the gold titles yet its twice the price
there are only fourteen sections in chronicles covering four locales but theyre notfollowing the style of revelationnecessarily full levels the types of levels we all know and love from tr   one can easily beat this game in three evenings
needless to say very disappointingstill if youre not at all money conscious this ones worth picking up only because at times its still a hoot to play
theres also a level editor included with the game for those who wish to design and create their own tr levels but you need to be fairly computer literate to use it
its probably a good sign that chronicles is the last game in the tr canon because laras beginning to wear out her welcometomb raider chronicles is the fifth lara croft adventure game created on the tr built engine
compared to tr it is a very short game
there are thirteen levels with four adventures set in rome russia an ireland adventure with  year old lara and the final adventure in the vci headquaters building
the graphics are quite dated
the storyline is good and the gameplay is very good and not as hard as tr
challenging puzzles with no annoying false paths but the boss levels are very hard
level design is good and not in hub layout so no confusing backtracking
each level has three secret golden roses and if you find all of them you will be given special access
the controls are the same and still not perfect and as usual no difficulty option
compared to the fourth game chronicles has a very good and less confusing gameplay but it is very short and looks like an expansion pack to tr than a brand new tomb raider gamethis game is nice but it is extremely short
there are only  stage arenasstage  you are in a street paradestage  you are in a movie studiostage  you are at a concert in a park
then thats it the game ends
there are also  songs but not all of those songs sound greatanother complaint is that the characters do not react to your button inputs
they dance automatically you do not have any control over their movementsi also own space channel  that is a much better game  stars
you have complete control over the characters movements and there is a long storyline to follow in order to beat the gameim a huge fan of fps on both consoles and pcs and timesplitters was a bit of a letdown
ts is basically a clone of goldeneyeperfect dark
any fan of those games will definitely notice the similarities
the look the perspective the weapons the music everything has that air of familiarity about it
ts was even made by former goldeneye developersif you can gather  friends though be prepared for the epiphany of fps
a round of tspdgoldeneye with  people beats an lan game of quake or counterstrike handsdown
there is something about everyone sitting together that is lost when people have their own screens
still i feel the multiplayer part is lacking
ts offers better graphics than an n fps and the framerate never drops no matter how many bots you play with
however ts just doesnt offer the same number of options or levels that perfect dark offered  months ago
i think that is very important for preventing a game like this from getting boring
i have much more fun with perfect dark because of this very reason despite the improvements in timesplitters
most of all i dont recommend buying this game to play by yourself
the quotstoryquot mode is boring and the bots are fairly dumb
you fun is directly proportionate to the number of people you play with so be wary if you cant get the gang together all that oftenthe biggest disappointment is the level builder
the available quotbuilding blocksquot are very few like  total rooms and various corridors to connect them
dont expect to make a replica of your school or house because every level looks like the same nondescript maze
overall the level builder is easy to use and a great advancement to the genre but most creative people will get bored with it really quickly
maybe a randomlevel generator would have been usefulthis game is tough in one player mode and more fun than a bag of weasels in multiplayer mode
of course there is the limitations of a divided tv
i enjoyed the first player a bit more than multiplayer just because i have had so many games that i play on the net like this where the screen is mine alone
if you have a decent computer and fast internet connection your best bet is quake  unreal tournament or half life
they are cheaper more advanced more workable and more everything in this genrethis game was one of the better ps games i had bought at first but then as my friends i played it more and more i grew bored of it
the game has a definite sense of humor when it comes to the characters and can choose and even the challenges in challenge mode
if you buy this game do not buy it for its story
you will be very very disappointed
the multiplater is what rocks this game at first
the whole time you play it your trying to get more characters and cheats you can use during multiplayer
you even unlock lots of new levels as well
this game even includes a level editor where you can create your own levels
that kicks some butt as well but after a while like i said i just grew tired of it
it may just be me because my friends have borrowed several times and they still love itps may have better graphics but ns perfect dark kicks the  out of time splitters
ive been a fan of first person shooter games for a while going all the way back to wolfenstein and doom for pc as well as a few obscure cheap immitations that i cant even remember the names of and time splitters is one of the worstthe only reasons why time splitters ranked  stars are a it is not that often that you can play an old drunk and b you can create your own levels
other than that just stick with perfect dark for n and zone of the enders for pssure this game is fun and loaded with tons of superstars and different playing modes but it seems like the moves are all the same
wrestlemaina  is the same way
the game to beat has to be wcwnwo revenge
all the wrestlers have different moves and not everything is the same like wwf games
the only thing i dont care about that game is you can only play superstars and not have a career mode or defend titlesplease dont get angry at me for not giving this game a  or  this game is okay but didnt seem to realy feel like the wwf
the characters look like they just jumped out of a saterday mourning cartoon
the control is confusing and isnt very user freindly
it plays alot like wrestlemainia  so if you liked that you will probobly like this too
the reason i got this was so i could play  players with some buddys but the slowdown can drive someone to the brink of insanity
to the games defence there are a good number of charcters with a varity of costumes
also there is a good selection of matches like ladder handicap ect
in my opinon it has better options and matches then smackdown but not as good gameplay
most wwf fans will love this game but if your picky about games like me rent it first
if your looking for  player action and you own a playstation get smackdown or smackdown  and a multitapthis game is very realisticpros the best damn realistic wrestling game ever the championship mode is awsomecon the graphics is not that good rock looks like monkey the feets are flatit still cost tooooo much the wrestlers have toooooooo much musclei cant think of any more but u should check out smackdown  and look for me onyx c i love wrestling ive been watching it for years
i have played every thq wrestling game since wcwnwo world tour
i love them me and my friends played the heck out of wrestlemania k and expected the same greateness from no mercy
when i first got it i was amazed
graphics were suped up ladder match is awesome as heck and the career modes are interesting
the create a wrestler is also very well done
a lot of options and there is also the quotsmackdown mallquot where you can buy new items arenas and characters
also i dont know whats up with the bug everyone talks about
i have had the game for about a month and have not had it happen to me
but my main enjoyment of wmk was royal rumble and the insane tag matches for our quottitlesquot that i had with my friends
this game is amazingly and dissapointingly plagued by slowdown in  player modes
now people will tell you turn off the music
it works to an extent but the speed is down considerably from one player which is strangely blazing fast
if you play one player or  player and then decide to try out  itll  make you sick
you can see moves coming to reverse them and you will get frustrated early on
this one reason soley gives it the  star mark down
this could be a perfect wrestling game if not for  player slowdown
sorry thq see you next year
of course ill be playing no mercy until then although the games themselves are very good and should be played by anyone who likes rpgs there is one major difference that casts a dimlight on these games  the originals used a more archaic language
they used quottheequot and quotthyquot its just not the samei read rave reviews about this game in a lot of video game magazines and was very excited to get it but was disappointed with the outcome
it could be because im not an rpg fan but the game was slow moving and reminded me of the pokemon games which were much funner than this
the one thing i liked about this game were the graphics
i dont recommend this game to anyone unless you like rpg gamesi have to admit the game is kinda entertaining
as far as the quotcreate superstarquot portion of the game you can do whatever you want basically and i i like that
the gameplay is very very very easy so controlling your wrestler wont be hard at all
the only complaint i have is that in the season mode all the loading takes so much of your time
thq really does need to do somethin about this with the next game they release
  if you are a fan of the wwf then of course get the game cause it is cool but if you are just looking for a gamei would wait or rent it first before you buyis oniyou see i actually borrowed this game from the library for pc after hearing several bad reviews about it seeing if they were right heh
however after burning it and playing it i was engulfed in onis worldfor an hour or so
then it became difficult unless you abused the several combos that were built in the game which made it extremely easybut all in all oni seems to be a normal adventure game
sure youre in a thirdperson perspective and you fire guns and everything
maybe the storyline is a little original
oni would be extraordinaryif it were not for the fact that most games have that extraordinary oni touch
tch
skip it unless you want to be entertained for an hour
then dump itthis is an okay game im not much of an anime person but i really like the martial arts they put in this game i found this game to be pleasing to the eye
it is a beautiful game and the levels are gorgeous
but the gameplay is rather frustrating
i found one of the most annoying things was that it was almost impossible to hit a moving targert
it is quite lopsided when fighting a soldier who has a weapon because they can shoot you from a distance with an extremely high amount of accuracy while konoko is moving
also getting into fights with more than one soldier is also to difficult
alot of konokos moves are to hard to perform when she is confronted with an attack by more than one individual
weapon control could have been vastly improved in the game
if you dont mind getting very frustrated and enjoy a good game then i would recommend this one
but be warned you will get extremely frustated fastwhen i picked this game up from the local rental store i was not sure what to expect
the back graphics were not forthcoming on the game and many of my friends had recommended it
to keep this review short i will refer anyone that has played the game siphon filter to replay the game in order to understand what oni is
using a dual motion control that has been used in time splitters and  the game offers allot of control while sacrificing pliability
i am sure that many more adept game players can use this system but for those of you that want an easy game to play this is probably not itcontinuing through the levels a rather simple common plot of conspiracy unfolds with each great revelation coming as subtle as an elephant but does keep the desperate gamer playing
at least as long as it is possible now i know that there are people that have beaten the game but i found the jump in difficulty between one level and the next to be too extreme and prevents many people from enjoying the plot that has been building for such a long timein conclusion i would highly recommend this game to be rented by anyone that wants to play it
there is not enough replay value to it to match up to its price tag and for those of you that like such a game will be able to beat it in the weekend that you rent it forim a hardcore fan of action martial arts style games
when i saw oni i had to get it
at first i was dissapointed by the controls but they dont take horribly long to get used to
if you use the pad and the right analog stick its not that hard to control
i didnt feel that there was enough mixture in martial arts moves or weapons
and fighting the same enemies over and over gets boring after a while
and the more complex moves were usually near impossible to pull off when you really need them to
throws were pretty much useless in actual combat unless you were lucky enough to get one off
and the ending was somewhat of a letdown
but despite its bad points it is a very well done game storywise
but replay value is low
decent to own but not recommended to buy
a good weekend renter thoughoni is an excellent game in terms of storyline and action
the game takes place in the future as a renegade cop by the name of konoko
as the story unfolds konoko begins to learn haunting secrets of her past such as the situation with her family her past life and her true identity
this is where she goes berserk and renegade
konoko possesses a variety of martial arts movesskills and learns new techniques as she progresses throughout her quest
such skills she learns such as weapon disarm and rising fury punch are certain to come in handy in the latter parts of the game
so where do onis flaws lieglitches when i heard of the glitches oni contained i had no idea for most games contain glitches regardless of how beautiful they may appearthey were this bad
fallen characters can be seen throughout other sides of walls
i noticed at times when id punch a character near a wall that theyd sometimes get stuck in between the walls and wouldnt be able to come out
there is also a bad glitch to when konoko presses a generator to access a locked room at a certain angle shed sometimes get stuck and continue to keep walking into generator uncontrollably
because of this glitch i was forced to reset the game and start over from a previous save dataslowdown while some parts of the game run at lightningfast speed others dont
with more than four characters on screen at once the game moves at a horribly slow pace
this is an exception pain in the  when trying to escape from the clutches of three or more enemies surrounding the player all at one timeno platform grab implemented  often at times when forced to jump from one platform to another i would miss by mere centimeters and die forcing me start over due to the not being able to grab onto a platform when close to it
this got so bad at one point that i was forced to use a cheat code to play as a characters that could at farther ranges than konoko such as the ninjasno multiplayer mode  the game was promised to contain one and never didwhile these flaws are tolerable i still enjoyed playing oni due to its excellent plot
i finished the entire game and was left wanting more
id advise anyone who is a fan of japanese anime to give oni a trythis game had some good ideas going for it but the lack of tweaking of controls and laziness of the graphics lowered its chancesfirst off there are many many control schemes which takes time getting use to
learning certain techniques and quickly learning how to maneuver that pesky cameraangle is a task in itselfthe storyline is pretty linear here
enhanced policegirl who has been trained in the company of those she trusted finds out she was adopted
her father who simply wanted to use her for power and the entire organization that she worked for turns on her and tries to destroy her
blah blah blah
pretty much along the lines of ghost in the shell
its also funny how the cut scenes look completely different from konoko in the game
the cutscenes konoko has big poofy outstretched hair while the ingame konokos hair is more short and curved upwardsbe aware of the lack of items and the difficulty of the game play itself
it appears that this game has tried to take a metal gear solid approach with enemies that are able to hear footsteps and alert other enemies
but thats no good when items are so rare that its literally a survival from one level to another to the dismay of the player
the scattered inconvenience of invisible auto savepoints do not restore any health whatsoever
so if your out of ammo or healthpackets good luck trying to finish the rest of the level without being plucked off by an enemy
and if you do perish then youll have the start off from the last savepoint
the levels in this game are very long and this can sometimes make playing unmerciful
konoko can get a boost in both her strength and her health but only when her health is maxed out by a healthbreathalyzer
these can take time to restore her health while in meantime the healing process can be interrupted by enemiesnow the villains themselves are cheesy
they say cheesy oneliners like cannonball
so does konoko
there are really no bosses except for  or  the rest is fighting through the toadies
the more levels you go up the more difficult they become
weapons become stronger and their health is increased
on the flipside you can steal their stuff
just be warn your own weapons can hurt you especially the lifestealing onesthe background graphics look unfinished
unexplainable gaps of doom outside buildings and the inability to really explore your environment is restricting
you are not able to go back to any previous level in the gameplay unless you have beaten the current level
fighting is judged by three colors blue orange and red
blue being the most basic attacks that can be easily blocked orange is more tricky and red is special attacks which cant be blockedthe boss battle with konokos pinkhaired android friend was one of the most annoying battles within the game
there are so many red lasers moving about that its nearly impossible to avoid being hit by them
not to mention the lack of cover to hide from them
there are only a couple of computer towers that you can try to angle yourself behind but dont expect the game to be friendly
it cheats
theyll go right through and youll have a swarm of constant machineguns and souldraining weapons mercilessly on your heels
and dont try to go into the farside of the area with the prison where you think your out of reach they can get you there too
be careful not to plummet down into the depths below the platform eitherfinally i was able to finish the very last level of this game where the real bad guy was located in the snowy base
unfortunately i could not go any further as so many enemies inside the building ambushed konoko to the point where she moaned and flipped over in expirationif you like extremely difficult games with betatype ps backgrounds than this game is a good choice at the used pricedi bought this back in  when i originally had my dreamcast and never finished the game
i remembered it being pretty awesome so i bought it on impulse when it showed up recently in my local game trading store
just finished the game and i wanted to share a more critical opinion of it to balance some of the endless praise it receivesi understand the reviews that give this game stars i really do
there are some excellent ideas in this game
the concepts of ship battles d world map discoveries building a home base assembling a crew  these are all awesome aspects of the game
while there is no shortage of good ideas in this game there are some major flaws that made the gameplay less than enjoyable in my eyes
first lets start with the prospros d world map to explore good graphics interesting story line ship battles awesome dungeons with creative use of d spaces daccats island comes to mind good sidequests finding discoveries recruiting crew optional ship battlesfor the cons i will explain each complaint in a little more detailcons battle system animations  the boss battles random encounters and ship battles all contain a vast amount of unnecessarily long and slow animations that make battles incredibly time consuming
some ship battles and boss battles lasted upwards of  minutes simply because i had to watch the same repetitive animations over and over
to be fair you can press the start button to skip your own partys smove animations but you still have to sit through all magic spells attacks and all enemy actions
it gets hilariously bad in ship battles where between each attack the game shows  different angles of a ship randomly zooming around d world map vs encounter rate  as rpg fans we are all used to traversing a d world map while defeating enemies in random battles
well consider that this game has a d world map and movement in all three dimensions will trigger battles which translates to an extremely high encounter rate
when considering this with the sluggish nature of battles described above getting anywhere or doing anything in this game is pretty time consuming particularly getting all the discoveries which can be a frustrating endeavor
the shame is that takes one of the coolest aspects of the game exploration and turns it into a chore battle system in general  the battle system in this game is flawed in that all magic except the increm spell is basically obsolete in battle
let me explain
during battle your party draws from a pool of spirit points sp to perform magic spells and smoves
smoves are special actions that attack for high damage attack multiple enemies provide extra defense or healbuff status
the problem is that vyses smove attacks are tremendously more powerful than any magic spells
healing magic is useless in battle because you can use healing items which will not consume sp
literally everysinglebattle
in the game can be won with one of the following techniquesrandom encounter  enemies  all party members attack or vyse use cutlass fury while others attack
healing items as neededrandom encounter  enemies  aika use lambda burst to attack all enemies on st turn all other party members attack
everyone attack for rest of battle
healing items as neededboss battle  buff vyse with increm to raise power on st turn vyse uses cutlass fury or pirates wrath as much as possible while other party members use focus and healing itemsvyses cutlass fury and pirates wrath attacks are so much more powerful than magic attacks you will conserve sp and use focus just to be able to perform these two attacks on every boss
the only magic i even considered using was stuff like driln to debuff a boss or the noxi spell set to poison them
driln always misses and bosses never seem to get poisoned
the only other exception is you can use healing magic outside of battle for only  mp per use regardless of spell power
you can then reclaim mp with the relatively cheap magic droplet items
this is a good way to conserve expensive healing items and save them for inbattle use
other than that magic is just useless plain and simpleconclusionif you are an rpg fan i would still recommend a play through simply because of the cool styling graphics and concepts introduced in the game
however because of the three cons listed above i am much more reserved in my praise for the game
there are games out there with much more efficient and rewarding battle systemspersona has all the qualities of a good rpg
the characters have such a history that you actually care about their well being
i have been playing persona off and on for about a year often taking a break from it when i encounter a particularly hard boss like the weng long fortune teller ms shishawa i think that was her name in the underwater maze
uala is my favorite character since i would most react like she would to the weird plot that makes up the drama of the gameit has to do with a evil cult basically wanting to cleanse the world of all corruption by destroying it and creating it over again you would think this cult has very prominent and powerful members heads of state government officials the local police the militarycelebrity fortune tellersetc
well you play a reporter for a small zine put out by the kismet publishing company and you first get involved in the joker murderswell i could tell you the whole story but its very long and if you dont pay attention it gets complicated
you end up fighting narlethotep a creature straight out of the cthulhu mythos for those of you who are familiar with lovecraft
there are quite a few lovecraft inspired monsters you end up fighting
this is a very wierd and difficult rpg
the mazes and dungeons though looking like ultrapostmodern dance clubs buildings etc will give you migraines and you have the bosses for whom youll have to level up as much as possible and devise somekind of strategy because in persona strength is nothing without some brains and even then youll still get a headache
this game is hard and not for the average gamer
i recommend renting it firstvalkyrie profile gives a refreshing breath to a genre its a good game ruined by several flaws that keep it to enter to the elite of the genrethe semi realtime battle system and the dungeon design are the strongest pointsthe positive battle system blends together turn based strategy and semi realtime action great dungeons that require puzzle solving and platform norse mythology setting sad and mature setting send warrior to asgard great innovations skill system reminiscent of star ocean  original gameplay concept  you get the warrior after their death scenes and must training them for the battle in asgard good graphics very difficultthe negative lack of the storyline zero characters interaction the character after their scenes become empty nameless shells useless cities with no shops inns etc dungeon crawling nature make the game very boring limited exploration dungeons dont have any relation to the games plot what the why is so difficult open a treasure chest
this feature is totally useless no money the divine materialize points system is pointless i cant get nothing only curative items the weapons break suddenly arghhh too sad so so voice acting a little bit short limited structure with the period system  any chapter consume period points to get access to any dungeon or citiesgraphics soundtrack story characters development gameplay fun factor miscellaneouslenght  short game  hours a single playthroughdifficulty  hard game very goodreplay value  three difficult levels three different endings many characters theres enough replay value herei played the first gunbird six years ago  when it was released import on the sony playstation
back then i thought it was a great hecticpaced oldschool shooter with bright graphics and solid gameplay
if you werent awed by the game itself your socks were knocked off by the opening animation which at the time was topnotchfast forward to  and gunbird  much like cannon spike psikyo has teamed up with capcom again to produce another fun but shallow game aimed at the oldschool shooter crowd
however in the wake of games such as treasures magnum opus radiant silvergun sega saturn gunbird  feels less like nostalgia and more like complacent game designgun bird  is a traditional  player overhead shooter similar to other dreamcast shooters like giga wing and mars matrix
i consider gun bird  to be better than giga wing however due to its original animetype characters and story
there are several characters to choose from including morrigan from darkstalkers and each has hisher own trademark attacks and endings
another feature that sets gun bird  apart form giga wing is the difficulty
you dont have to rely on constantly bombing or reflecting to dodge an impossibletododge spray of bulletsyou can just set it to a lower difficulty and coast through the game if you want
unfortunately gun bird  is still short and lacks replay value no matter what difficulty you set it on
it only takes about  minutes to beat and the endings for each character arent particularly long or rewarding either
i believe most of the older shooters like raiden robo aleste and twin eagle were much better
when you consider your choices for a old style shooter on the the dreamcast though gun bird  isnt entirely a bad apple
it has more style and flare than giga wing at leastresident evil survivor was a big disappointment for me
i was hoping for a house of the deadlike resident evilstyle game but instead we get  types of handguns to use against these creatures zombies giant spiders lickers mr xs giant alligators gas masked men with machine guns and a shotgun and a grenade gun
ive read guides that say theres a rocket launcher i havent found it yet and i got up to the final boss
i also dont like how you cant save
thats ridiculous
in every re game the tradition was to have a typewriter to save your progess with using ink ribbons
but not in re survivor
the instruction booklet says you must save after dying on the quotcontinuequot screen
thats dumb
otherwise the storyline is awesome
there are a few things that confuse me like why theres a man in a white coat hanging on a helicopters bottom rails at the beginning as they fly over an island off raccoon citys shores
also theres a man i call the quotlibrarianquot because if you go into the library youll meet him
on the second floor of the library in one of the rooms he locks you in to fight a hunter and laughs outside the door
in another part in the prison i killed  giant moths and went through a small ventilation shaft that lead into the sewers which was infested by zombies which i all killed
at the end of my long sewer quest the librarian locked me in a room with a giant alligator
than another giant alligator popped through the wall blocking the way to the door i just came through
i had to kill them both and i used almost all of my health sprays and green herbs there because all i had was handgun b handgun a and the shotgun
theres  places to go at first the restaurant the movie theater and the church
first time through i went in the church
second the theater
third the restaurant
the church is quite big and reminds of you of the famous mansion from re
its filled with zombies
the theater is also filled with zombies and you have to get film and project it on the movie theater screen and than youll get a key that leads out of the theater
in every area you get a key that leads out of the building youre in
then you have to kill  dogs in the next hallway and pick up a hangup phone
going down the stairs you must verse  lickers and collect another key on the first bench you get to
at the end of the alley theres a green herb near the stairs pick it up before going up
once up pick up the phone and after that sequence theres once again  areas to pick fromthe amusement arcade the hospital and the library
thats enough of my miniwalkthrough
well this game isnt that badi didnt think the game was as bad as a couple of reviews pointed out
i enjoyed it for the most part
granted the flaws in the game are noticeable  but its not at the top of my list of terrible gamesthe graphics were a bit smooched and not as detailed as the other games
it seemed as the graphic wizards really rushed thissoundwise the sound is ok the music keeps the game going and doesnt become monotonous
the re games all have a decent soundtrackthe controls could have used work but i still found them to be adequate enoughjust like the re games this has a decent story behind
you play as vincent a guy whose lost his memory and is finding clues about himself
what he finds though is surprising and shockingin the end its not the worst game ever
i enjoyed it
granted its not up to par with the other games but i found it all right enough to play to the end
its got practically everything the other games have except its made into a first person shooter with mixed results
its a guilty pleasureim a diehard resident evil fan so i got this one
ive only played it on my ps and it works great
however you cant save the game so you have to beat it in one sitting
i like that its inventive with the first person perspective no track to follow and the ability to carry an unlimited amount of items
only get this if you love resident evil stars
ill start off by saying it was no fault of the seller
package arrived as it was described and in a timely manner
the problem was i own a ps slim
i have noticed that the slim does not read discs as well as its predecessor
the disc wasnt scratched to bad yet it still couldnt be read
i have encountered this issue with other discs before
so good customer service bad ps slim pthe idea of this game was great
if maybe capcom had made so that say you had to do all three locations instead of just choosing one eg
if you had to do the church cinema and restaurant instead of just picking one of them etc
then maybe this game could have been a bit longer and more exciting
in length its only half a game
there are no fmv sequences like the ones in the other re games and the graphics in the cut scenes are poor compared to the previous games
the character movement and speach is worse than ever before
up to paradise prison the game is pretty good but from the prison section until the ropeway station the game is amazing
and then we have to go to another factory or laboritory at the end just like we do in re and re
the atmosphere in the umbrella labs in re was great but in the two latest games it has really not been up to scratch
and then after this the game ends
the ending is poor and even the graphics on the text credits are bad
a three star at bestmy girlfriend bought this game but also got ffix right afterwards so this was put on the backburner for her
so to take a break from tekken ssx and smugglers run i decided to give this game a go
from my understanding it is based on an anime tv series that i have never seen but am now curious of
the fmv anime scenes are definitely top notch but the main problems lie within the game itselfwhen i first started playing it the characters got really annoying but soon they began to grow on me except magnus orphen the main character has his oh so witty comebacks and yes that was meant to be sarcastic but after hearing magnus whine and such you start to understand why orphen is the way he isbut i digressi personally liked the gameplay for the most part though i dont consider myself a hardcore rpger
i think it is a good mixture of an actionadventure game and a straight rpg
and the storyline seems a bit confusing at first but it sucks you in after awhilei thought the game was a bit too easy i am currently trying to beat the final boss and played less than  hours i would expect a little more gaming hours out of itbut after all it is a launch title and you usually cant expect too much from themssx was a flukethe graphics are amazing the control is nice and smooth and the use of the vibration function is good as well
if you want a quick easy game to play and you have the money to burn pick it upotherwise wait till it drops in price or borrow it from someone elseif it werent already a movie for ps
and unfortunatley thats almost what orphen becomes a movie
with little actual gameplay and loads of animeesque prerendered videos orphen really doesnt give you much to do
sure theres running around with bizarre camera angles looking into these little treasure chests that seem to be absolutely flippin everywhere and then theres always the quotstop the movie whilst we fight a monster without any explainationquot that seems to happen just often enough to keep you from losing your mind from boredom
on the up side the animations are great and the characters though eerily quotharry potterquotesque are interesting enough that you might not mind if this were a real movie that you just paid  for instead of a video game that wont let you do anything
the colors are vivid and the camera work at times is almost award winning
i said almost
to be honest with you id probably have given this game an additional star if after saving and dying you could skip all the superfluous movie bits and get back to actually playing the ever lovin game
borrow a copy from a friend then decide if you have the time to spend on it once you pony up the cash for your own
ive been a little dissapointed with what ive seen for the ps so far
i want more than just slightly revved up ps games
dont get me wrong ive really liked several of the games that ive played but theyre just not up to the hype yetthis is not the worst game i have ever played but it looks like it should be a ps game with a vhs tape to cover all the cut scenes
even though i have not finished the game yet there are already too many movie sequences for my taste and from what i have read about it it doesnt get any better
the graphics and the overall animation of this game generally stink the only part i like so far is the drawn art animation the rest just looks like garbage compared to the graphics of tekken tag and even timesplittersthis is no ace combat game but its still a lot of fun to play on cold northen winter dayswhy dont you all stop writing quotreviewsquot until youve actually played the game
some of you talk about how you cant give  stars bc you havent played it yetwhy even bother giving your measly one star that only brings the ratings down for it
the ones that say theyre quotbalancingquot things out bc people give  stars for a game they havent played are just as bad bc theyre giving  star for a game they havent played either
some people dont realize how stupid they make themselves sound
ill give this  stars bc its right in the middle and no i havent seen the game yetafter reading a few hefty literary works you need to read some fun trash like joe r lansdale
its the same with video games
after playing a few rpgs you need some fun trash like cannon spike
this mindless shooter is a purely visceral experience you run around shooting and beating the living daylights out of anything that moves
even though you get the nagging feeling youve played this game before the slick graphics and snazzy lighting effects disguise cannon spikes quotsmash tvquot core well
at any rate a little depth could have helped this game a loti have seen numerous previews in the past about cannon spike for the sega dreamcast
while taking a look at the screen shots i always imagined how much fun it would be when it releases
when it finally released i kept missing my chances of getting the game until finally i got it for myself
when i played it i was into the shooting action and the seamless d graphics and animation and then it happened
after shooting a few guys down i have already found myself fighting the boss of the stageand the boss was too easy
all you had to do was give it a few close range heavy attacks and a few shots and the boss is dead
now that is sad
the levels are just too short
i wanted more 
i dont care if theres  levels
theyre just too darn short 
the more you play through each level the more disgusted youll become
the music to this game is just plain repetitive
some of them sound like theyve been pulled off a bit game or something
the voice acting is horrible
believe me even japanese voice actors have their moments of crappiness
mega mans voice is great but everyone elses voice sounded too stupid
and another weird element to this game are the jet powered skates
huh 
now this is getting weirder and weirder each time i play
who whould use heavy artillery with some blades on 
thats what i want to know 
heres a thought use your shoes boots or whatever the heck you wear everyday
on the bright side the graphics are cool
seeing mega man dominate in full bit technology was a blast including the characters like cammy arthur simone bb
hood and shiba
the characters special abilities look great
they almost look like one of those beams from dragon ball z the controls are similiar to that of various old school shooters like raiden  gunbird and more
still cannon spike wasnt my kind of cup of tea that i want to drink every single day but that doesnt mean you wont like the game
if youre still into old school games i suggest you get cannon spike
i may have traded it in for another game but im glad that cannon spike brought me back to the old days when snes and genesis were still coolit appears capcom enjoys taking their characters and putting them in unusual settings and this concept works better than similar attempts by other companies anyone remember midways subzero platform crap
 but im sure they could have come up with something better than rocketskates
still fans of action shooters will have some fun with this onethis game is one long chase scene i guess the genre could be called survival chase
it feels kind of like a hack and slash game you run down corridors shooting waves of enemies you arent able to walk and this helps give a sense of emergency to the action
its weak in that only one type of enemy attacks you at once and there isnt even any palette swapping and the controls arent really suited for fast action
unlike a hack and slash game like say golden axe it just keeps getting easier and easier as you go along because you buy super charged weapons
the weapons arent too interesting because they dont effect your strategy it all boils down to shoot first there is no point in using a weak weapon that takes  shots to kill something
there is almost no exploration and the shopping system ruins the sense of being chased because you return to rooms to earn more dinobucks
its similar to ff with the corridors being chased and shopping at save points but theres more freedom the shopping at save points is a fun idea wonder when it first appeared in a game
there are different kinds of levels that happen between the main corridors of the game that do a lot to keep the game from getting too monotonous there is some space harrier inspired stuff some remote control tank action  and an underwater platforming level that i dont think has been done in any other stationary camera game these levels are pretty fun and dont overstay their welcome
the script has some amusing dialogue but the main story is almost totally irrelevant to what was established in the previous game i wonder if the writers of terra nova had played this gameif you played and liked the first one get this one also
its still a fun game for the playstation and is much improved in this title
the game arrived as described and was on time
i had no problem with the cd at all and it was ordered usedi have always beena fan of the muppets but i was a bit unsure about whether or not to buy this game
i purchased this game in the end as it was quite cheap and i thought that if i  didnt like it that i hadnt wasted much money it turned out that i loved this game
you take on the role of any of  muppets and race throughout  tracks all taken from the muppet movieschristams carol tracks are good
using funny weapons to try and get the upper hand on your oonents
worth buyingthis is a great system
it has hundreds and hundreds of titles
its supported by all the leading rd party manufacturers
its adorable but its  this isnt too bad of a price tag when you think about it but when you realize its a
old technology and b
the same price as the dreamcast its a tough purchase to make
a year ago this would have been  stars easy
but since its being phased out i have to only give it  in addition the ps is backwards compatible meaning it actually has the ability to play games that were made for the psonebut on the plus side this thing is incredibly cute
the picture thats shown with the controller thats not depth perception trick the thing is really only a little longer than the standard dualshock controller
how practical the expandability of it will be is another question in japan the screen attachment will be coming out this spring and there are already numerous wireless cell phone addons planned
but will any of these cool accessories come to the states
probably not
the market for people buying a  inch lcd screen attachment is so small given the price is likely to be through the roof that scea will probably hold off its american releasethis is the rd add on to the original everquest game
the comments below are about everquest in general
each subsequent software adds more land to the original everquest map plus more character types
to my knowledge only one of them increases the quotlevelsquot of experience possible ruins of kunark
this prompts your player to play more and more especially if they have not maxed out the original game yet
you need to have a d video card to play this
my  speed dell needed a voodoo  card before it could be usedthis game everquest either grabs you or leaves you cold
in my case it held no interest
as a person who likes the game play of myst riven journeymans project  xfiles etc
i found its graphics too cartoonish and sophomoric
its purpose to go up a level was not enough incentive for me to want to kill things
killing things is the only way to get ahead it seems
i didnt care for the violenceadditionally there seemed to be such convoluted ways to gain items and other stuff to remember just too much work
i like to relax in a gamehowever if you like diablo warcraft and starcraft you might have a niche here
the men in my family certainly did and they were addicts of the games mentioned aboveyou have to not only buy a separate game for each player that wants to play simultaneously but you must sign up for their service to play this game if you want to play simultaneously
in our house that is  of all the games everquest ruins of kunark and scars of velious and  separate  per month accounts
without this commitment this game is unplayable
of course each person then needs a separate way to get to the internet too if they want to all play at onceplayers create their persona by choosing among the types of characters available
each character type has certain abilitiesplayers can speak to other players in this game but cant kill them unless both players opt to battle
this is the social aspect of it
it also fosters team work in the sense that some things just cant be done alone
you need the right mix of characters to do this so some people can get excluded if the team already has that type of character
lower level players can be helped by higher level ones toowe have heard of relationships created by the social aspect in this game and we know of ones damaged by thisanother point i really did not like about the game is the inability to quickly get out of it without repercussions
it seems once certain actions are begun exiting the game has a real potential for damaging your character
supper times phone calls etc
get ignored for this game
if you have a life you will pay for it
also if you lose your connection it can really make a mess for you tooif you want the special person in your life that has already shown tendencies to be addicted to computer games to really disappear buy them this
if you dont steer them awayexperienced everquest grognards know why this expansion will not workfirst of all verant stated that velious will be set up like a huge epic quest
zones will have to be gone through in a certain order
three words huge traffic jam
itll be like another plane of sky
except its a whole continent not just one zone
uber guilds and uber guild alliances will have to take turns going through the placein other words its going to be a mess and probably will not help the high level baby boom problem in everquesti ususally preview software by renting it from the library
if its a hit then i purchase it
my  year old is a huge scooby fan so we rented this game to test outthe graphics and voices are true to the tv show so this game really holds my sons attention
i like that there are  levels of difficulty
we stuck to the spooky easy levelthe main screen puts the gang in the middle of the ghost town
they can basically go in  different directions which bring them to different parts of the town
in each section there are  different buildings the gang can enter suspects to interview and items to pick upnow my son is probably on the young side for this game but searching for clues did seem a little over his head
in some cases you have to go into one building and talk to a suspect who will tell you that they need a specific item
then you have to go to a different building to find the item and bring it back to the suspect
not a problem for a slightly older child but a little too complicated for usmostly my son likes giving out scooby snacks
and there is one mini game that we found in the saloon where you can throw pies at the ghost
i think my son would be happy just playing that the whole time
id really like if there were more mini games like that within the programas an aside our game kept crashing once we got to the part with the train ride
but that may just be that our library copy was defective so i wouldnt rate against that herethis is actualy a pretty good flight sim
the graphics are ok the sound though isnt very real
you can only fly  planes and they all seem to fly the same but they look very real
the menu however is realy hard to use and the ground looks like the same little piece done over and over again same goes for the cities
the damage isnt very real either
get this game though if you like flight sims if not then just skip iti cant get through it
the bad guys constantly respawn
there is an extrememly meager supply of weapons
when you happen to luck upon a weapon laying around count on it being shoddy
the medical supply is almost as bad
going back and forth between your inventory is cumbersomei think the only way i could ever get through this game is to play it through by cheating in god mode several times and then trying to play it without cheats
the makers didnt allow for an effective god mode cheat though
it something to have to go into the game files and text edit which didnt work for me at allthis has all the makings of a great game but its way too frustrating for methis game provided hours of entertainment and lots of heart pumping action
the characters are deeply and magnificently created and molded in a way that only  square could do and plus the gameplay rocks
the graphicswow
i didnt think that any graphics on the playstation could be any better than the infamous dino crisis a platform game not an rpg but this game blew all the other so called rpgs out of the wateryoure not going to be able to put this game down
i dont think ill ever leave those discs out of my playstationnot anytime soon anywayseven if youre not a hardcore final fantasy fanatic i wasnt that much of a fan of them until this game you will still enjoy this game and be able to follow it well
its great fun being able to play so many charactersbutthe reason that i did not give this game five stars is due to the well known fact that it still has that battle system
i dont see how different it is from final fantasy seventhe battle is almost the exact same thing
why is everyone saying that its different
i dont see a difference
theyre the same thing only with different power ups and stuffand how come during the battle you cant move the characters
you  can only use weaponry and potions and all thatyou cant actually move in circles around the boss or the enemyall of your characters just stand there while you wait for your energy and magic bar to refill so you can finally hit the badguy or bad guysand also the musicthe sound effectsget really really annoying
just steiners armor as hes walking is so annoying that words cannot describe the sheer and complete annoyance
i had to put my tv on mute because it was so annoying
the music was at times irratating and not at all as good as final fantasy sevenbut the game is still fun
i would indeed reccomend buying it because it is truly excellent
but if you are expecting a different battle system like i was or just hoping for an easy and short rpg then do not get this game
you will not find any of thosebut still like i said this game does rule
believe me i wanted to give this game five stars but when looking at all the factual information that i had gained off of playing it i realized that this game was not worthy of the excellent and wonderful five stars
final fantasy fans i am sorrythe story was ok i was not taken away with it since its the usual last of species princess in trouble hero with daddyproblem stuffthe characters had some personality it was never developed beyond looking like comic characters i just never took them seriouslythe graphics are ugly i do not like that they are so small i could barely see vivibut the absolute worst part is the battlesystem it almost takes a whole minute just to load all the characters monsters and angle the camera correctlyso much time is wasted just wating for the battle to loadso when you meet weak monsters you kill with a blow you seriously get more than annoyed because it takes longer time to load the fight than to actually finish itsad way to ruin a possibly could be fantastic gamequotthe crystal comes backquot  the catch phrase of ffix and possibly the most inaccurate statement ever in the history of videogaming
i saw this phrase and thought of the days of the very first final fantasy with a completely customizable party a solid inventive storyline amp combat system and everything else generally associated with the first of this seriesalthough ffix boasts the best polygonal characters of the series as well as the best fmv square has long since forgotten that video games are about gaming not graphics
gamers can only be dazzled for so long before gameplay becomes a huge issue
while i appreciate the characters storyline and stability of this game far more than i did those of ffvii amp viii ix lost a lot in the following ways  what happened to the serious plotlines
given not only the recent trend towards serious gaming but also the release of the movie scifi based like ffvii amp viii not fantasy like ix square should have continued their trend of seriousness
a glance at ffx on ps shows that square intends on continuing the serious trends later
why the one reprieve
  the battle system is boring
hardcore gamers and ff fans will yell at me for this but lets face it the battle system is the repeated mashing of a single button with very little thought involved
  the minigames while much better than before yield dubious andor difficult results
there are two extremes to the minigame situation tetra master amp chocobos hot amp cold
tetra master which everyone will recognize immediately as triple triad of ffviii is a collectible card game complete with  different cards collector ranks and cards that can gain experience and have individual statistics
the problem of course is twofold
the first is that the highest collector level is ridiculously hard to attain
the second is that theres no reward for attaining it
unlike triple triad of ffviii you get no items for having the best cards you getrespect
on the other end of the spectrum chocobos hot amp cold is far too challenging and nitpicky for the prizes it rewards namely the bestsecond best weapons in the game for several charactersok thats the end of the rant
the game is still fun
the ending was the best ff ending ive seen in years
so ill stop whiningthis was my very first ps title and very first final fantasy game
i loved the graphics and the story but it definitely earns its t rating
its rated t for mild language but the characters use that mild language a whole lot particularly the d word and some very suggestive dialogue
we all fell asleep
you didnt touch the princess did you
the game is also full of subtle statements and symbols about religion so if you care about things of that nature then be advised that there is prayer to a number of objects as well as items like annoyntment
as far as gameplay goes its a turnbased rpg which   while annoying at first is very easy to get used to
as the name imples you  and your opponent take turns attacking each other
the only thing i found incredibly frustrating was a virtually useless mapaside from a pointer and dots you never know exactly where you are  and the fact that you cant run a foot without being attacked by a monster
i thought pokeacutemon coined that
it gets rather tedious especially when youre low on potions
the music is great for its time and i think they did a spectacular job of making the characters likeable and well rounded but the bad guys were left out of that loop and pretty clicheacute
this wouldnt be a problem if the game hadnt already succeeded in making so many clicheacutes likable again
the princess commoner crush with zidane and garnett loyal knight with steiner
philosopherof sorts with vivi  and a medieval setting
all are  given a new spin but the villains are just flat and extremely so
brahnes only reason for being so cruel and is the death of her husband and kuja seems interested in power for powers sake
the main villain is even flatter than they arethe game also feels extremely rushed to where the supposed big twists become more like deus ex machina or are so matter of fact it makes the drama fail miserably
for instance dont read on if you dont like spoilers
garnett goes to one place
just one place and in that instant has a vague flashback that reveals to the player that brahne is not her real mother when depending on how skilled you are not twenty minutes before we have eiko going on about how her race is extinct and being alone
its the equivalent ofeiko its nice to have guests especially since im the last of my racegarnett what a beautiful cave
gasps as thirty second flashback commences my mother is not my real mother
im a native of mandain sarieiko im not alone anymore yay
lets go pray to the wallothis was never even remotely hinted at previously
aside from branhes hideously ugly face and body in comparison to garnetts beautiful appearancearguably
its random and did not have the intended shock value
sure they develop eiko and garnett in other ways but it doesnt excuse how rushed everything feels emotion wiseaside from that i was able to sympathize with these characters at least the good ones learn their strengths and weaknesses via an easy battle system and feel pretty awesome doing it
overall it was a fun game but definitely a teen onei admit i was about halfway through disc three before i had to quit playing altogether and toss my copy into the garbage due to content
if i wanted to read that much profanity i couldve just picked up catcher in the rye for a lot less 
that and the fact  two and a half of four discs is more than enough time to develop at least one villain to a satisfactory extent and this wasnt done
we had at least four and theyre all woefully onedimensionalvillains make a story and the ones in this story didnt enthrall me at all
sure its great that youre a greedy evil queen but why
what was it about your husband that kept you from greed
did he change you before
why are you so ugly
whats your backstory
sure its great that you want power and to defy those who made you but why
spoiler
why did you team up with the evil queen just to kill her and make garnett the new queen
wouldnt it have made more sense to gain power by rubbing shoulders with the queen and garnett only to kill them both so youd rise to power nextwhere the heck did you come from old guy in armor
why werent you mentioned two discs agough
villain development needed badlyto be honest i was hooked but this game just didnt do it for me
not for young children or people who might be offended by the theistic elements in it or large amounts of profanityi dont have much that i can say about this game that is good
the story line didnt make this game worth while and while the gameplay was better than ff viii the character models were iritatingly childish
this is what we get from the systems that accuses nintendo of being nothing but kiddie games
you cant have cutsie cartoony characters swear and pass it off as not being kiddie crap and im sorry but thats what this game was
it wasnt even an epic kiddie game like mario or pokemon what this was wasa mediocre last ditch attempt to try and sqeeze some much needed cash out of the franchise and while it wasnt entirely unlikeable it was such a throwback to older games that it was completely unoriginal and there in lied its problem
its plot characters etc were all rehash from past ff games
there are moments of silliness that will force a smile out of you but i found myself anxious to have the game overwith and never bothered to dig into side quests bonus eidilons or any of that
had ff ix been ff viii maybe i would have liked it better but to spoil me with ff viiis graphics then expect me to be happy with the super deformed kiddie garbage is unfair
thankfully ff x takes the series back into a progressive state unlike this one which was more rehash than nostalgiai had originally posted that this game wasnt very good and had lost some final fantasy falre
that was before i was wise to the whole final fantasy world
i was ignorant
so i decided to give it another chance and play it over again when i had a more open mind
and i have to say it is much better than i had previously thought
first off it returns to a bit of the classic final fantasy games with the occupation standard
the main character is a theif thus he cannot use black magic
the black mage cannot steal and yaddy yaddy
it also has a better developed plot that some rpgs out there
the score by nobuo uematsu is superb though not among his best in my opinion but still powerful
if your looking for an rpg that is fun challenging and bit old time this is a good oneanother final fantasy and yet again a new battle system set of characters abilities etc
 to learn
the game is itself pretty good there is a good amount of fmv compared to parasite eve  that almost does not have any and they are even better than beforeits yet another square games that takes all my nights until ive explored everything with the game
unfortunately the story line thought good is not close to be as good as it was in ff
in my memory you could almost feel to be in the game with ff while ff is just a quotgood storyquotthe other thing is that i find this ability system a little bit more awkward than it previously was
one thing to notice is the summoning capabilities which only  characters can have and you cant use it much before the end of cd unless you wish to train the princess a lot in the first cd and use her eidolonsbeyond that its still a great gamefinal fantasy ix  circa good recaptures classic nes final fantasy theme on ps some nice cg movies in between gameplaybad graphics are pretty dated not considered as classic to many as final fantasy vi vii or xif it fits your taste turn based rpg no voiceovers so there is lots of reading card battling as a mini game superdeformed look for the characters turned off a lot of peoplegame its most assocated too final fantasy vii final fantasy viii legend of dragoon chrono crossadditional notes all final fantasy are not related to one another think of each final fantasy a its own game not connect in any realtrue way to another final fantasy the only exception is final fantasy x which is a sequel to final fantasy xdefinately the worst ff in the series
i dont mind the cartoony graphics but the story was absolutely horrible
it was sooooo boring and the game was too easy
there were hardly any fun side things to do
i didnt like ff  much either but its definately better than this onedont get me wrong final fantasy  is an ok game
although i wouldnt give it  stars because its lacking what ff and ff have
the story is mediocre nothing mind blowing
typical bad guy trying to destroy the world good guy beats him good guy gets the girl etc the main villain kuja lacks personality power hes just a metrosexual monkey whos all emo
the story fails to build him up as the main villain really
not intimidating and can be confused as a girl
what makes this game any fun is the side quests like chocobos forest where you can dig up treasure and earn points
thats pretty much why i even play final fantasy  other than that the battle system is a fail the characters are somewhat interesting but then again lack any real purpose in combat
skill points are useless and dont work
ill explainok  of final fantasy  is random battles
why
because some genius at squareso ooopps its enix now decided to get rid of the no encounter feature that was introduced in final fantasy   im glad they brought it back in final fantasy  you cant go  steps in this game without encountering some huge house with a canon trying to kill youyep you heard me right
monsters are ridiculous
now there are some cool things they added to the battle system for instance  characters in combat
great idea
also having friendly enemy encounters on the field that reward you for doing something other than mashing x until they die
another good idea
but it eventually falls apart until you end rage quitting
limit breaks are cool at first they do  damage but when youre at level  theres no point any more
the same genius decided to get rid of limit breaks that do multiple hits
so a limit break does  and a regular attack does  know what im saying pointless
also learning abilities is nice but again pointless
example you can learn an ability called  magic null which like the name says nullifies any magical attack that hits you
wrong
magic attacks still hit you and do just as much damage
fail
theres a few more but i cant remember off the top of my head abilities that dont work
how could squareenix miss such simple things like this
tents dont heal fallen characters remedies dont work on some status effects if an opponent casts stop on you its game over no megaelixirs card game offers no reward the turn base is broken enemies take way more turns than you do
that last one gets very annoying especially later on in the game when youre fighting bosses its like for every  turn you take with a character they take  turns
fail
that completely ruins the point of turn base
i can go on an on but ill just sum it up with thisfinal fantasy  is an ok game but to be honest if i was working for squareenix at the time
i would have stood up at a meeting for this game and smacked everyone at the table
except nobou the soundtrack for  is fantastic he did a great job as usual
but the rest of them would have got smacked then i would say we are not making another final fantasy unless it includes everything that made final fantasy   and  great
i mean isnt this the logical thing to do
if you have something great dont start subtracting from it add to it
otherwise you end up with final fantasy  epic fail anywho this game is ok and im pretty forgiving because  was awesome except it was too linear they must have had a wake up call after  then again it was fail city after ff
they should just start calling final fantasy final fail from now on
more appropriate in ok the cg sequences are amazing
the graphics are mostly spectacular but the fight closeups are grainy
unlike some people i really enjoyed the music and even the characters appealed to me
but i didnt have any sense of exactly why i was running around
to fight someone evil to save the world  but from what exactly
i cant even remember now
there are too many random battles and theyre far too easy
there are two characters who basically duplicate each others roles
as usual the main character is way too strong
the battle load times are atrocious
and if you actually like playing the card minigame check with a psychologist
the crystals are most certainly not backsquare needs to remember that its making games not just pretty pictures
theyve made some gorgeous scenes but they forgot to add gameplay and a compelling story
maybe they realized they could never top sephiroth and decided to stop making bad guys with personality
dont get me wrong its still a somewhat fun game and its certainly a treat for the senses
but not for the brainthis final fantasy looks more cartoonish because and the gameplay is kind of like final fantasy  the plot is very complex and has various twists
without any spoilers the plot is about this bandits that that theyre thieves  the game has job classes theyre about to kidnap the princess
zidane a monkey tailed guy the protagonitst one of the band finds the princess and while the queen watches the play  the princess agrees to being kidnap because her mother is acting very strange thinks her mother is plotting a war against the nations
the story goes on and no one in this game is who appears to be the princess is not who she thinks she is zidane is not very human more characters appear as the plot thickenswhat i dont like about it is that it looks less real like ffx xi xii xiii it doesnt have that many sidequests like ff or ffx
the dungeons are not that interesting like in ffx or ff the superboss is not fun like omega in ff this superboss heals himself and is extremely hard
what i do like is that its the story keeps you guessing the weaponsabilities system is kind of fun the weapons have the abilities that the characters need to learnok this game was one of the best games i had but its not really good to me anymore
i think that this game was basically made to get people into final fantasy that never played before
its really easy for the veterans like me the battle system is too easy to know and not really a good one compared ot others thank god it beats ffsout of the ps and ps final fantasy games this one is my least favorite
the plot line is rather bland and the game is too cartoony after the last fewi love final fantasy ix
it is easily one of my favorite games of all time
the story is riveting the main characters are compelling the secondary characters are amusing the music is wonderful the graphics are beautiful i could gush about this game for hours
i have played it through from beginning to end at least ten times and just writing this review makes me want to play it againbut as much as i love ff i cant just ignore all its serious flaws
this game is typical final fantasy which is to say tedious and slow
random monster battles learning magic and abilities the slow way ultralong loading times thanks to the lush graphics and effects and so forth
the game play is old schooltoo old school
ff is essentially an old nes or snes final fantasy game with d polygon graphicsthe story line is also very typical of the ff series the world is being threatened by evil and you control the band of heroes who journey to save it
unlike most of the ff series however this game takes that old clicheacute plot and turns it on its head
the main hero is not some dark angstridden swordsman atoning for past service to the villain nor is he some callow youth who gets caught up in the greatest adventure of his life
he is instead a thief braggart and womanizer who almost accidentally falls in love
and he doesnt get involved because war destroys his home and family or the villain pushes him too far or whatever
instead he is part of a plot to kidnap a royal princess and things just fly out of control
this is probably the only time since the old ff game that square ever really thought outside of the boxunlike the previous four or so ff games that preceded it ff abandons the onesizefitsall jobs and abilities system
instead it gives all the playable characters a specific class and skillset
on the one hand this new system isnt handled very well why does equipping a new hat allow the black mage to learn the fire spell
on the other hand combat and party formation are much more strategic because the player has to really think about who to put in the party
the proper balance really does make a difference
in the old onesizefitsall system you could put anyone you wanted in your party and you would do just fine which made the games too easy for me
that said in ff you dont get to choose your own party until disc  of  until then you have to go with the party assigned to you by the plotspeaking of which the plot never takes itself too seriously
it explores a lot of very heavy themes love duty sacrifice freedom life death and the nature of the soul
but it always remains at its base a lighthearted romp and essentially upbeat in its outlook
this cheerful optimism that permeates even the darkest moments of ff always makes me feel better about life
for all that though the plot is very linear and you dont get much freedom to explore until very late in the game
as i mentioned above you dont even get to start choosing your own party until disc  of   it can feel rather constraining when you want to do some treasure hunting on the side but arent allowed to simply because your only choice is to continue following the plotand of course while following the plot you stuck are playing an oldfashioned console rpg which forces you to slog through a great deal of random monster battles fmvs and loading times
it can get tedious very quickly
the monster fights literally take about ten seconds just to load up and then another ten seconds to return to the world map after the fight is over
the main reason for this is the lush graphics
drawing all those polygons takes time
and then just to take a bit more time the camera spends a few seconds spinning around and showing off all those nicelooking graphics before finally settling down on the actual fight
this is particularly annoying during those times when there is a clock ticking and you dont have much time to waste
and while the fmvs are very pretty and wellrendered they also have long loading times and often happen rather abruptly
they tend to break the momentum of the game and story which gets annoying at timesif the story and characters werent so compelling ff would be too tedious to be worth playing
that is why i give it a relatively low grade
it fixed a lot of things that were wrong with its predecessors as far as story characters and dialogue go
but it also kept a lot of things that should have been changed such as the tedious random monster fighting and the graphicsinduced loading times
i love this game and always will but i would hesitate to recommend it to anyone except diehard ff or rpg fansto sum uppros wonderful story engaging characters great music beautiful graphics nice refinements to some game play elementscons tedious monster fighting tedious load times ultraoldschool game play rigid ultralinear plotthis game was way too easy
when i defeated the final boss i was like  quotthat was itquot my characters were only in the level  range unlike in final fantasy viii i am in the  range and the last boss is still impossible for me to beat
actually every point of this game was easy
where is the challenge
i think squaresoft is trying to please their fans by making easy games so they wont get frustrated with italso learning spells and abilities in this game was dumb
you have to learn them from your equipmentthe fighting was not very fun or exciting and it takes forever to trance
i think each of your characters only trance about  times throughout the whole game
so whats so exciting about thathowever some of the reasons why i gave it three stars is the storyline and the charactersi did enjoy the storyline even though there were no twists or surprises or whatever but it is still enjoyableand the characters all had their interesting personalitiesthe game also doesnt drag much because it goes by so quickly which is i guess both a good and a bad thingbut if youre looking for a challenging game then skip thisget final fantasy tactics insteadafter paying two online grand campaigns with two very worthy opponents i have come to respect this game for what it is  a fun hh game but it is not much morethe graphics out of the box are cartoon cutouts that look like they belong on a kids television show
tank and at guns simply look like they were copy and pasted from a comic book which is horribly ugly to look at when you have the gorgeous maps you play on
fortunatly this can be solved with graphics mods for the game that greatly help and make the vehicles and guns look as they should realisticas for gameplay it is safe to say that any experienced player will have no challenge at all on single player
the ai is atrocious and no mod can help this
the only wayto get any enoyment whatsoever out of this game is to find a good reliable opponent online and play the grand campaign that is where this game is funwwii grogs like myself will love this game however being a serious gamer the bugs detract from the simple play this gives
since atomic went out of business the cc community now has to rely on third party patches and fixes to an extremely buggy game out of the box
if the cc series had actually evolved from its first installment to now its fifth then atomic games might actually still be in business
this is a cheap knockoff of cc which was the absolute worst in the series but can be fun when you find a very good opponent to play who is honest
whyreenforcement bug in gc  unlimited reinforcements for american player in my first gc i had to go up about three times the american armor is should have which ruined the game
fix this by keeping a paper chart with your opponent so as not to ruin the game because there wont be any patch for thisdispite some of the reviews which nearly had me believing this game was not worth buying it is a very good game
you need the tutorial if you are not familiar with rpgs but if you work with the interface you can figure it out on your own
although your skills and feats are picked for you they are apropriate for your given class
no stealthy paladins or witty barbarians like i had originally thought
attributes are not rolledwhich i personally dont like anyway but chosen by you
you get a limited number of bonus points and you have to distribute them wisely your self
unlike baldurs gate where you usually rolled a weak roll and had a very limited number of points to spend you then rolled a weekend away and gave up
in this game its much better
your bonuses for certain attributes are clearly given and in the manual you can find all the info on a given attribute not just a vague discriptionthey gameplay is also good but the interface can give you carpel tunnel syndrom
in combat you must rightclick on your characters to give special orders and sometimes you cannot click on the right one until thier time is up
this can usually be solved by spreading everyone out
i usually put one fighter in  front of a monsters and one beside not both in front like they always tell you in these games
monsters wont go after your mages until they finish with your fighters who are attacking themusually
attack the attackergraphics are gorgious and so is the sound
despite what people are saying i like the sound the ambience is very good and the music isnt that bad
the magic effects are beautifully renderedwith the proper graphics card
hotkeys would have been nice for these extra features like special attacks and magicthe character to npc interaction is also very good the voice acting is not that great but not heard much either so its not a problem
your responsesquestions to certain things affect how people treat you however this is mostly an action rpg and fighting and exploring are your prime concerns
no spending all day in towne saying quotheya its mee imoenwanna buya duck
quoti like rpgs
i like dampd  this game however was not as good as i would like it to be
sure its dampd and it is fun for a little while but aside from that it has repetitive music screwish gameplay and just horrid graphics at least for the people and enemies
i recommend you play this game before you buy unless you are a hardcore dampd rpger or just someone with lots of moneywhen this came out i wholeheartedly agree with the previous reviewers here and then some
it was awful buggy and slow
now with computers much faster than the specifications required and with  count em  official patches later one having been released fairly recently by the distributer its a little better
it is at least playable
you may get better play by turning off antialiasing features in your video cardif you have the discs collecting dust or see it in a  cent bargain bin it might be worth satisfying any residual curiosity
there are still a lot of aggravating aspects but one thing that was good was the background artwork for the time
people disappointed with it when it came out should be aware of patches up to version there are also some good mods out there for changing your character iconsunfortunately it still does not hold a candle to the classic bit gold box gamethe entire game becomes quite difficult to understand and even the tutorials didnt help much
after a while it took several weeks for me to understand how to make a profit and i managed to ever so slowly
but its a funny game from the bouncy music to the way they classify all your customers kids goths plebs vips yuppies students tourists and teens
and unlike most other tycoon games theres a surprising amount of sabotage involvedyou start with joining a bank and advertising agency
the real work divides into three areas with an optional fourth if you wanna get dirty
the branch itself
you buy a building comes in smallmediumlarge and decorate it with chairs and tables and a few knickknacks that dont matter save the jukebox
when you open the pizza branch this is where you see all the customers come in and order
its a pizza place but it runs like a restaurant with the waiters and such
you may also need a warehouse to keep ingredients in
the staff
theres cooks waiters temps and sometimes a manager
they all have skill levels in which you can pay to train but also they have other factors such as motivation and talent which affect their total efficiency
despite how big your buildings may be you can only hire seven workers per branch
full time workers work three shifts in a sixshift day so youll need at least two cooks and waiters to cover everything
also you have to keep them happy with pay increases which you can never decrease unfortunately the pizza
it was tough trying to satisfy all the different classes of people but there are a lot of toppings to put on
even ants and maggots
but by chopping up ingredients and finding the right balance amongst the meat cheese fruits and vegs you could make the pizza very popular
youll put your original pizzas along with four standard toppings on a menu which your customers will choose from
crime if you decide to play with computer opponents a nono for beginners then youll want to wreck their branches through advertising hiring punks to scare their customers or joining a mob syndication
when you pull off jobs you do thirdperson pointing and clicking to move and fire
its something that earns some cash and is thrilling for about an hour thoughthe game offers a fair amount of data on pizza topping trends a pie chart determining the cash flow but many little icons and sections youll have to look at over and over to discover what it actually means you usually do so by holding the mouse over the icon and waiting for a small message to scroll above the iconthe memory card is  well its just a simple memory card and it does workthe reason i gave it three stars instead of five is that i do not understand why sony would engineer a supposedly backward compatible device ps  and force you to use a ps  memory card for your old gamesthis is an ok storage system
you can save all you games progess weapons and etc
it comes in a easy use card that you can carry awaywhere and is easy to use
some of the cons are that you cant store to much on this card it gets filled up to easily and is frustrting when you need to save something and your card is full
this the starndered storage system that everybody who has playstation has
i recommened you get one of the bigger memory cards that can handel more spacememory cards are evil
if the video game companies really cared about the consumer they would include a whole pack of memory card with the game system when you purchase it
instead they sell these things separate and if you want to save any progress on any games you play you have to have one
also ps memory cards wont save info from ps games so you have to buy cards for both systems in order to play all games
back in the day before the modern gaming era the game cartridges used to save what little progress there was to be saved
of course that was when it took between  minutes and  hours to beat a game
of course they could still make games like that even with all the mulitplayer action packed graphics
they just dont
anyway if you have any ps games you need one of these babies
my advice find a pack of them at a local discount store or used from a seller here at amazonchad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fateat this point dynasty warriors  is outthere is really no need to even play this one
dw is far better with improved gameplay and even multiplayer mode
dont waste even a rental fee on this if you really want to see dw playjust get dw theres not much difference
its not that it isnt fun or coolits just that dw is the same thing packed with more fun
the problem i have with this one is it takes over an hour to beat one leveland there really isnt any save points
that can be aggravating if you dont have a full hour to wasteunless your really bored want to waste your moneyor just crazy insane for the seriesdont bother with this one at allquotdynasty warriors quot is an impressive example of what the playstation  can do
the battles with dozens of realistically animated d soldiers with allies and enemies acting independently probably couldnt be done on previous systems and it surely wouldnt look this goodbut theres no getting around the fact that theres a certain monotony to the proceedings
dw is essentially a modern version of old beatemups like quotdouble dragonquot or any number of its clones cranked out by capcom data east etc
in the late s  walk down the street dispatch dozens of anonymous thugs pick up some powerups and fight the boss
in dw you get to do the same thing in d and while youre responsible for knowing how the battle is progressing on the world map you can get by just by moving along with your allied troops slaughtering enemy ranks and taking out their bossessince this is a beatemup and not a fighter the move list is far simpler than what youd find in a quotdoaquot or a quotsoul caliburquot one button for fast attacks one for a slow sweeper and an occasionallyavailable special
not that i want a twopage move list but when youre personally slaughtering  or more enemy troops you cant help but feel like youre doing the same thing over and over againproduction values are very nice it feels like being in a war in nd century china
costumes horses encampments etc
are all well doneultimately its a fun diversion for a while  wanton slaughter but you cant help but think that someones going to take the ideas of how this game works further and make something truly breathtaking  where im doing more in this immense d world other than going squaresquaresquaretriangle to an endless horde of faceless troopsnot a great game
but good
whats so bad about it
well first its not much variety in the game
all you do is fight with the same moves all the time
fight fight fightyou can easily kill over  enemies in one stage
how boringgraphics are ok also
theres no slowdown
however you cannot see much ahead of youbottom line if you like to sit there for hours and just quotfightquot with the same moves over and over again then so be itthis game has wonderful graphics and movement
however there is way too much button pushing for me
if you like to kill  people in  minutes this game is good for you
it requires very little strategy and skill to kill people
the game would be much better if it required the use of some strategy
you are thrown in a middle of a war and you just start killing as many people as you can
you do have to make some strategic moves such as killing the bow men on walls and try to keep your body guards alive
overall my fingers started hurting after an hour and the game got a little old
but like i said if you like to push a lot of buttons and love graphics you will love this game
one positive part of the game is the history lesson i did learn a lot
i would definitely suggest renting it for a few days first
i loved it the first  days but quickly grew sick of it after thatit is way too short for a koei game
even if there are  levels and not just  which takes some work to unlock the extra characters and levels we are still talking about only  levels
that is way too shorti have loved all kinds of koei games from ghengis khan for the nes to romance for the station all give hundreds if not thousands of hours of strategy game play
however dynasty gives you at best and this is stretching it  hours
that is if you use all the characters and really work your way through the entire game each time
however the game is repetitive in nature so doing basically the same thing with different officers each time gets tiresomemoreover there really isnt a whole lot of strategy involved
you play as an officer
basically you go around and try to hack the opposing officers and protect your general
there is a bit of strategy but it is all dependant on how well you are with the action fighting game play
your character and hisher bodyguards get better as the missions go on but any real war strategy moving troops angles of attack etc
are nonexistentif you buy this game you will probably say what i did quotthat was cool but is this itquotgraphics are great and it is a great idea
however there isnt and real strategy like i enjoyed in past koei games
there isnt anything that really requires you to think and try to figure out
so as a strategy game it just fails
as an action game it succeeds but like most action games its life span is relatively shortthis game was made beautifully its graphics are great and the game is fun at first
after the rd level you get sick of it
it is just hack and slash hack and slash
i suggest renting it for a week
thats all the games timespan isi dont meant to criticize the game
it has neat graphics interesting environment and fastpaced action
i have just outgrown this genre
when i was younger i could still play quotdoomquot for hours
this game is far more advanced than quotdoomquot but to every season there is a turn to every age its ownevergrace is a traditional actionrpg game that suffers because it is one of the first releases for the new playstation  it is expected to contain high quality graphics and sound and unfortunately it has neither
from the sort of cheesy leaves falling at the beginning to the lowbudget music that plays behind the action the game looks as if it was a straight port from the base playstation
and indeed rumor has it that this is the casethe storyline is intriguing
you are one of two characters  sharline or darius  giving a nice malefemale balance to the game
you explore the polygon world as in most rpgs looking for enemies to kill and gathering up mushrooms and special items
the terrain itself is on the restrictive side limiting where you can go and what you can see
often vital items cannot be seen and monsters will appear within rockscombat is not very exciting with slow paced action really stupid computer moves and limited fighting options
taking a nod from the diablo  gem system you can find palmira gems and add them to your weapons and armoradd to that horrendous mouthmatchingwords problems and times the spoken message doesnt match the written one on the screen cheezy videos an awful font choice for displaying messages id say to set this one aside and give final fantasy ix a try
even without any porting that is still the best rpg available for the ps seriesokay the whacks first then the good stufffirst whack  the introopening movie thing just really needs to go away
it was aweful
it had very little to do with the story and even less to do with making me want to play the game
from crappy leaves to odd duck looking things to that terrible screeching pseudosong as the movie goes on and on and on and on
 the intro just needs to be trashed and redone completelysecond whack  the camera angles are really lousy
sure you control the camera but thats just it you spend most of your time trying to manipulate the camera to look at the monsters and generally end up getting whacked yourself
there are areas in the game that are so difficult to navigate woth the odd angles that you invariably end up quitting and coming back to it
half the time the cameras not even looking in the direction youre running
very annoyingthird whack  the mapping is nice and all but it is entirely too easy to fall off a ledge
sure its possible to fall off a cliff in real life but in real life i dont control my actions with a  inch button
sneeze and youre historylast whack this is actually a two parter  the words on the screen are only acurate about  of the time with the words being spoken
did we get  different translations
if so lets pick  and stick to it
 the attributes given to various armaments in the menu rarely matches what you actually get
it will say youre getting one thing then you get something totally different
again annoyingpraise the gameplay is quick you change weapons with almost every encounter
there are lots of things to buy from the creepy elephantman shop owner and most of it is upgradeable
the bosses are not ridiculously powerful and the monsters are actually manageable
the game actually allows you to win on ocassionthe graphics are pretty good and the colors are lively
the male character looks realistic and the female looks almost so except for the fact that her wrists are like a foot longall in all i would tell you to rent it first
otherwise i would tell you to buy legend of lagaia
except lol cant recognize the ps mem cards
bummerby far this is not a perfect game
therefore i shall attempt to review it on its own merits
it is a bit of a diablo hack  slash clone which i like
it is bland and the sound can get annoying but for those of you that liked gauntlet seven sorrows or gauntlet dark legasy then this might be for you since the formula is so similar
you level up more through equipment then any of the standard rpg systems but ive played a little game called jade cocoon sorta like dark cloud  and this is almost exactly the same play mechanics
so for  to  bucks its a diablo light version for anyone that likes hack  slash rpgs
gauntlet fans might want to give it a rantal or buy since renting is about  bucks its definately underrated true theres minimal story but in hack  slash games sometimes i really dont want to be annoyed by cinimatic sequences every  minutes sometimes i just prefer mindless killing
and the wealth of enemies are enough for anyone here
albeit a bit endless at times  stars in general but  stars for fun factor
if you dont need ff insert  cinimatics or drop dead graphicsoverall rating  starssound  stars repetitive and few songsfun  stars if multi player had been added this could have been far better
as it is the hack and slash elements are goodgraphics dungeons are ok towns a bit bland and unpopulated creatures look sweet and are varied
  starsi own bg dark alliance  and  and also bards tale champions of norrath and at arms
so i am well versed on the subject of hack  slash
i do feel with more polish and more time it feels very rushed this game could have been a title like baldurs gate or champions of norrath
unfortunately the developers felt they had to rush this one onto the shelf but its a good distraction for a day or twofirst to mr scott hoffmeyer read down for his review  the mechs are based on actual mechs in the fasa boardpaper games the timberwolf is and always was the mad cat and the atlas is suposed to have a cockpit that looks like a smirking skull dat any rate the graphics certainly are a step up from mw and look quite good though the mechs do seem smaller than they did in mw
however that seems to suit the generally scaled down feel of the game as a whole
a blast from a gauss rifle might send your mech flailing but it doesnt seem to pack the same punch as they did in mw
as has been said the gameplay seems to be working away from its strategic roots into more of an arcade style
this might be nice for some but for longtime fans of battletech and strategy in general its a bit of a letdownmultiplayer can be fun but unfortunately even with the new customizing interface people still find ways to hotrod mechs allowing them to deal crippling damage in just a few shots
mp would be much more enjoyable if players were limited to preset variants of mechs thus allowing you to still pick one to suit you but disallowing people from loading up with the most destructive weaponry availabledecent game the simplicity is a definite turnoff however battles tend to be drawnout slugfests rather than a test of piloting and wellaimed shotsi have been a long time fan of mechwarrior and battletech
while mw was leap in graphics i really looked forward to seeing it improved to the next level like a  sequel should
i was wrong
it bares note that mw is not at all a bad game
but it is the latest in a line of topnotch mech sims and does not feel like it
on a basic level it delivers it meets and  surpassed the minimum expectations
but as far as pushing ahead what mw started it didnt
some will argue and justly that mw had flaws and that mw went different directions is a good sign
simply put if it ant broke dont fix it
the environment feels less real the mechs oversized tonka toys the game play balanced the wrong way and the story so lame i would sooner not be botheredfirst on my list of gripes is the new way to customize mechs
before you could stick anything anywhere you wanted weight and space permitting
now each mech  has fixed hard points ware only certain weapons can go
each weapon has also been adjusted for balance
that they felt the need to adjust the weapons when you  are already limited in what you can carry kind of make me wonder
were machine guns really that big of a deal
so what if the shadow cat can carry a gauss rifle
not like it has enough armor to be a real threat to something twice its size
i agree you could make some far out custom mechs but that was part of the fun
so  what if was not realistic
look out the window that is reality
if that is what you want than why play video gamesthe mechs feel less believable
the ambient sounds of the mech in the background is gone
sure weapons still have sound and you still hear the foot falls of fifty  tons but it is less imersive than before
the cockpit even looks different before you were surrounded by glowing lights and panels with worn metal edges
here the  inside is basically medium gray with not details or real texture
a throw back to the first mechwarrior
mechs also move at a quicker pace than before
even the  heavy mechs seem speedier
of course it is  tons and the size of a city building so i see how that makes perfect sense
also when you blow off a limb gone are  the dangling wires
it is just blown clean off
why not have them
it looked cool and was realistic thats why they changed the mech customization after all
the  mechs are there sure but the sim part got lostanother thing
combat is slower
you cant quotlegquot a mech
so you pump enough fire power in to the enemy mechs knee to rip it off
no matter how many alpha  strikes you aim at it no matter how many missile salvos nor how much ac ammo you pound it with that leg is still there defying the laws of basic physics
also there  are different armor types that are more effective versus different weapons
guess what
that lbx  autocannon you were so happy to salvage and managed to  strap to your mech is worthless on a mech with antiballistic armor
wonderful
what am i supposed to use
harsh languagesalvage is still a joke
it is still scripted
nuff saidone of the features that was such a selling point was the story
okay does anyone really play mech sims for their gripping dramatic plot
the story might be entertaining in paragraph form
i thought that it would told with big full screen movies the live actors would have real characters with involving and  witty dialog and a detailed plot
ah yes silly me
the story is told to you there is not real involvement other than hearing your own voice
nor are the movies big they are tiny up in the corner
the characters have  little or no real depth
they come on screen and say things
nothing could make me care if they lived or died
other than i would have lost a good mech
the plot is  predictable to the extreme
the villains are fresh from saturday morning cartoons
they even ware dark cloths
a villain in black who would have known
add to  that they speak in angry tones most of the time
the single one of them that tries to be threatening by speaking in a cool voice comes off as creepy and weird
in the  end they are all evil and thus must be destroyed in the name of avenging someones father
who we never met five seconds does not count and was never told why  is important so add to the list of characters that dont matter
quotsir we must continue on it is what your uncle wanted
everything depends on itquot whatever
lets skip  to the part ware i blow things upas a mech game is stands as a mech simulation it falls
take your pickif you are a long time player of mech games then heres how to gauge mw if you loved mw youll hate or at least be very dissapointed with mw
if you hated mw than youll love mw
there are many intelligent improvements made in mw but ultimately the look and feel of the game is painfully cartoonish and hard to take seriously
the actors portaying the storyline fall far short of the mark in conveying the intended drama of the story
missions are fairly interesting music is superb composed by duane decker who also did the soundtrack of the mw expansion pirates moon terrain detail is astounding and the early lunar missions skyline is awe inspiring but despite these pros and a few others mw just doesnt deliver the impact it should
as far as this pilot is concerned mechwarrior  is king of the battlemech games even though its not perfect either
if your thinking of mw save the cash and spend half of it on the mw that comes with mechcommander gold and pirates moon
but dont take my word for it look at some pics from  and some from  then choose your mechto each his or her owni really loved unreal tournament for the pc so i was excited to see it come out in ps format
i was impressed with how close the ps version was to the pc version but extremely disappointed with how difficult it is to control the characterfirst person shooters are after all about moving your character around and killing the opposition and it is just too difficult to control your character using the ps controllersi expected better everything from this game
i expected fps
you get fps when theres  guys on screenthen drops to like fps or even less when theres  or more guys on screen
or it also drops to fps or less with  guys on screen but with lots of shooting going on
its very hard to shoot someone with this much slowdown
this is ridiculous
the graphics themselves the textures arent so bad
theyre nearpc quality
the sound is good i guesssame with controls
many levels to play inalong with modes like domination deathmatch capture the flag and assault
bottom line  i do not recommend this game
but i highly recommend quake  revolution
it has  better graphics fps gameplay even with lots of action going on
no pop up or jaggies
great sound and controls
this is a pcperfect game
if your deciding to get one of these gamesdont even thinkjust get quake  revolution
you wont regret ityou can play it online
thats the benefit of having this
the control is terrible until you change it as well as how fast your character moves and jumps
its hard to shoot targets and the story is a classic
cool collectible but not extremely playablereally beautiful and fun to fly
im terrible at it but i still play it all the time because i love to fly that biplane through the ravine
if you cant pick up on the standard controls roll right and pull up to go right like star wars you can switch to easymode push right to go right like star foxthe music and sound effects are nice the only problems i have is that it seems that the game determines a stall not by the windspeed which is how im pretty sure it works but by the speed of your plane relative to the ground ie full throttle into a wind storm will stall you outnot a highthrill action game but great for a lazy afternoon of flying until you hit the harder levels that isthis is a game that is packed with a wealth of fighters from ali to de la hoya
the fighting scenes are good and very smooth
the degree of difficulty however is not very challenging
the game play is extremely slow due to the frequent and absurd amount of loading time it required
overall its a better than average game that needs a little more workthe buttons look a little funny but it works
its a controller for an old system so guess thats understandableif you own a ps console this is the controller you want to get
genuine controller officially supported by sony the makers of playstationhowever while the product itself is sturdy and easy to use the design compartment takes off all the credits sony couldve earned with this product and yes ladies and gentlemen it turns out that the folks at sony really worked hard this time and came up with a design for the playstation controller
and i must say it looks awfully familiar awfully is the keyword here because it is identical to the dual shock  except the whole shock concept is gone because they removed the rumble feature also known as vibration
xdi hope youre saying gahhhhhhhhhhhhh because it is time to do so
why do you ask
here are the answersthe grip of the controller isnt that bad normally except when youre using any of the l l r r buttons which you do pretty often because the game developers always seem to find use for those buttonsunless you have hands the size of king kongs your natural grip of the controller will involve having four fingers around each handle and each thumb on each side of the buttons or analog stick
this is a problem because in order to press any of the l or r buttons you have to have three fingers around each handle and have your index fingers on top of the lr buttonsso there are really only two options you can take you can either sacrifice your comfort to get better results at whatever game you were playing and vice versai understand that to some players this is a huge issue but to other players not a big deal
so let me continue xdanother problem with this controller is the position of the digital pad and the analog stick
they should be reversed as seen in controllers for xbox and gamecube because most people prefer to control and move stuff by using the analog stick rather than the sticky digital pad
dpad was suited for d gaming in which you could only move up down left and right
but now the industry is focused on d games and analog stick provides easier and more accurate gameplay than the oldfashioned dpadnot only that the multisensitive buttons are useless and most games dont even support them
when they do support such as in the case of gran turismo the victims are none other than the customers yourselves because then you have to press buttons extra hard for your car to race as fast as it could
see how your life would be easier if you only had to press the buttons so hard when youre playing games for hours at a time
only if there were no sensitive buttonswould you be at least thrice more comfortable racing with your family because you know you dont have to worry about squeezing the controller so much
maybe this squeezing has to do with the controller breaking down from time to time
hmmmm
like i said however the product itself is pretty sturdy and as long as you treat it with care you wont have to buy another for years to come
now let us move on to the positive parts of the controller
well i only have one word to sayvibrationdual shock has a good rumble feature that feels so much cooler than the competing controllers
for instance gamecube controller has a good design that fits your hands almost perfectly but when it comes down to rumble feature it is rather shaky and bulky and um fill in the blank with whatever adjective you can find that means something like shakynot only that dual shock has a longer cord than gc controller and it has two vibrators included in comparison of one for gc controller so there i said all the good things i could find about this productwell now i conclude this epic review because i cant find anything else to put in
i hope you agreed to what i said because you should
xdi recieved this controller when i bought my ps and i have to say i like it its nice and comfey but when i first used it it struck me as lighter than the ps controller which i later figured out why when i opened the controller up
i am sorry to say that unlike with the ps controllers the dual shock  doesnt have the feature that the ps did
that is the rumbler wasnt as safely tucked in as many of us like to toss our controllers around
i was dissapointed when the plastic casing housing the rumbler was snapped and the rumbler itself was misplaced
this is a definite issue as i like to play my racing games and racing games require a rumbler
i also was disappointed by the fact that you cant switch components of ps  controllers into the dual shock  but then i discovered i can use ps for my racing games
overall ill only use it when i must but if i dont have to then i will switch with my old faithful ps controller
one word of advice dont throw this too hard youll break the plastic around the rumblerits a controller it works
cordless is way betterdont buy the cheaper brands  they dont work wellwe now have ps wireless  huge improvement without the wirei find the ps controller more comforable to hold than xboxi have lost so much memory with these memory card
lost files and when lost the memory will say corrupt you will not be able to delete believe me i tried
other then that they are goodthe only reson i bought this was so i could save my gamez and sony is way selfish
there is no other reason to buy this accecesory unless u want to save games
about the thing it takes a long time until u saveload a gamewhat can i say about itit saves stuff
it came functional with saved games full of sports crap that was deleted
but hey no issues
thank youas far as a memory card goes it is great it has alot of space so it is worth the money but the ps should have gone the same route as the xbox and had a buildin memory card with the option of buying one for additional space i have both system and despite the  games i have on there it is still at  space so it is worth the money but should have been optional instead of mandatoryi went to the store and picked up a second one which was much cheaper by like  dollars
the official memory card is alright
i think this memory card can get flimsy though as in worn
sometimes when i put it in it doesnt always read the memory card so sometimes i feel like i am going to lose all my saves but here it is it is exactly like those other memory cards
i have a second memory card it is yellow and has some black markings with a black circle
it was about  dollars at the time it was much cheaper than this memory card and it still works exactly like this one
i would just go buy the cheapeast one you seeworks as expected
what more do i need to say
oh for crying out loud this is getting silly
seriouslythis card fit the need i was looking for however sonys prices for mb of ram is ridiculous in this day and age
when you can by gb flash drives for this price these days and only get mb
wont buy another if this one ever gives outwhat i said about the ps memory card can be said about the ps memory card as well
memory cards are evil
if sony was wise they would do what microsoft did with the xbox and include a memory system as part of the system instead of having the consumer spend more money on an item that should be part of the system to begin with
but unfortunately if you want to save any progress on any games you play you have to have one
also unlike ps cards the sony ps card is the best memory card out there for the ps system so instead of saving a few bucks and getting a cheaper memory card its usually better to just buy the sony version instead and save yourself some time money and trouble
ps memory cards wont save info from ps games so you have to buy cards for both systems in order to play all games
an expensive extra necessity if you own a psfor ps i would have expected the graphics to be better
they do not look as good as maddens dragging down the score
the gameplay is still here and is still quite a bit of fun
the rock music and drum beats help move things along but it has a few flaws that drag it downlets face it people whats more important
slightly better graphics with a few more color schemes for the same costumes and two or three new arenas or more responsive controlsthats right more responsive controlsall the eyecandy in the world wont amount to squat if the game is more sluggishbeing a vet of doa for dreamcast i was excited about the ps version so i bought it
for some reason i cant execute counters as intuitively as i could on the dc version
this is a very serious problem because counters are vital in doai cant stress the importance of this lack of responsiveness in the game except to advise you to buy the dreamcast version if possible or tekken tag for ps
this will satisfy your fighting needs as well as doai feel the ps version isnt as responsive because the game was designed on dreamcast hardware and ported over to the pswhat a shamethe second gundam game to ever come to the us
only this time this one came to the playstation and its about time 
the game appears to be a d fighter it is actually a renamed version of one of the gundam battle master series from japan
this game like any other animebased games is strictly for fans of the original gundam anime series
in this game you get to play as all kinds of mobile suits from the universal century gundam series and after colony gundam series
the only gundam wing mobile suit is the wing gundam
speaking of that in story mode you will play as gundam wings popular main character heero yuy
but dont feel discouraged about playing as the wing gundam throughout the whole game
you get to select different mobile suits like zeon mobile suits earth federation gundams and gundams from the after colony series
your mission is to find the man responsible for starting all these meaningless wars between two centuries
during his journey he will encounter some familiar characters from the gundam universe like kamiru bidan from zgundam char aznable from mobile suit gundam trieze kushrenada from gundam wing and more
anyway let me describe the games bad side and good side altogether
the graphics are okay
the animation is smooth but the mobile suits look totally bad with all those pixels on the edges
still the mobile suits move smoothly as if they are featured in a d fighter
the backgrounds look great
they totally resemble the battle arenas of all of the gundam series
the controls are soso to those who never mastered or never bothered to master dragonball gt final bout for the playstation
to many of you its very slow and very impossible to beat up your opponent with just a twohit combo
but to me its just plain fun to master 
but still i was pretty much expecting the cool gameplay mechanics from super famicoms only gundam wing title on japan gundam wing endless duel but this is more than enough
its all about mastering and understanding the game very well
the music is too forgetable and horrible
it doesnt necessarily match the action
only a few tracks are cool but most of them stink
on the bright side the sound effects really resemble that of the gundam series like the movements of the mobile suits and weapon usage like the beam saber slash rifle beam firing and the sound of brutally scratched metal
the most annoying sound is the voice announcer
gosh 
will someone turn off the voice 
maybe bandai shouldve had a much better announcer
that guy cant even pronounce the names of the gundams correctly
and when the announcer sets up the fight he sounds like hes on drugs or something
for pete sake this is a fight mister not a childrens storybook 
even if gundam battle assault suffers a mouthful of flaws its still worth the purchase if you happen to be a fan of the gundam series
this may never earn its right to be the best d fighter ever but its very fun to play 
to the gundam fans out there go get this game 
youll definently have a blast with this one 
if you want to play other gundam games for the us play gundam side story  rise from the ashes for the dreamcast or play mobile suit gundam journey to jaubro for the playstation  game console
the thing that stinks is that gundam battle assault is a rare game now and they barely sell it that much
but if youre lucky and you found it buy it right now before someone else gets their hands on it before i get into the good things about ico i must say that i finished this game in under  hours
im not a fast or great gamer its just that ico is very short
too short for   on top of this one major section is a mirror image of an earlier puzzle
also there is little reason to play it a second time through so why buy itotherwise ico is a wonderful beautiful adventure game
you play a young boy with horns trying to escape from a mysterious castle
the castle itself is gigantic with towering walls that rise  feet above the ocean
as you climb level after level you can see the levels you completed below you making the sense of scale mindboggling
and while ico has many bland lowres textures that look really ugly there is a wonderful glow to everything almost as if you were looking at a painting and not a video game
this game has some very beautiful moments
also the plot is fairly engaging and the ending is very satisfying  just be sure to wait past the creditsas for actual gameplay ico is pretty standard adventure game stuff
you run jump push blocks and climb rope
there are lots of easy yet obscure puzzles as you must open doors and pull levels to get from area to area
most puzzles are based on exploration
icos biggest twist is the addition of yorda a princess who you must protect and escort out of the castle
she cant go everywhere you can and while you are off opening a path for her monsters sometimes come to grab herrent this game first you see everything in  weekendas an aging gamer my eye for the repetitive and mundane has grown a lot sharper than it was as a child
pretty graphics do nothing for me stupid razor thin plots kill my interest and lack of depth makes me literally fall asleep with my controller in my hands
due to this desire for something new and after hearing so much praise for the game one could see just how much i was looking forward to playing ico
unfortunately when i finally played this game my dreams for a truly unique title were fulfilled but all other hopes were dashedsimply put the game was interesting the first couple hours but i sadly found myself bored as i played more
now it wasnt because of the simple combat or the fact that the game was primarily a puzzler but mainly because the puzzles were neverpuzzling
when i say this i mean that the game threw puzzles at me but the puzzles rarely made me sit for more than a few seconds pondering what needed to be done
in addition everything just started feeling more like busy work since the simplicity of the puzzles made me to bored and unencouraged to push blocks and pull levers all the time
seriously by my nd or rd hour in i already noticed the only reason i kept going was because i felt like i had to finish rather than wanted tothe story or lack of didnt help either
the story which so many seem to be amazed by for reasons unknown was just plain empty stupid and poorly executed
i mean gosh the setup they had with these mysterious black entities yorda icos horns and this sprawling castle was perfect grounds for a really deep and intricate storyline
however they messed up and wasted it with literal mumbo jumbo dialogue and next to nil conversations about nothingperhaps the game wouldve been a little more interesting if the puzzles were environment and text based but since they were all based in the environment they posed no challenge
lastly some people complain about the short length of the game but in all honesty i think it was just long enough a person could only stand to stare at scenery and push blocks around so long before it gets grating
so  hours of it is just enough to get the point of this game homein the end is this game one of the pss criminally slept on classics
for graphics thats a maybe but for everything else i have to answer a resounding nothis game is good but over very quickly
it took me roughly  hours to finish it
yes the graphics are good the environment is amazing but this game has no replay value so why buy it
nothing special happens after you beat it ie
no alternate ending new characters erc
you can complete it in the span of a night rental at blockbusterthis is a beautiful game that really shows off the pss capabilities
the breathtaking views and attention to detail really suck you into the game and into its otherworldly mood
im  and my heart was pounding every time i heard the princess call for help as the shadow demons attacked her and tried to drag her down thier black and smokey hole
the puzzles all revolve around finding a way to get yorda the princess to parts of the castle that you can get to but she cant
the puzzles tended to be pretty easy and the fighting was easy too
the biggest challenge of the game was to not leave yorda unattended for too long so that the shadow demons didnt drag her off
if you couldnt get back to her fast enough you were turned to stone
the game as noted by others is finished in a matter of hours
it has an interesting epilogue though so dont run away after the credits start rollingi have many gripes with this game the poor savegame system the bland level design the constant switch hunting etc
i have found that it is however and in all fairness a very addictive game
much of the addictiveness comes from the crisp and innovative fighting system
some of it comes from the intruiging cut scenes a few of the games surprise plot points and an overall ease of playclearly the designers of oni had some very good ideas
its strange to see a game that got so much right and yet got so very much wrong
there are certainly elements of this title that i would like to see implemented in future games and i would definitely keep an open mind if i heard that oni  were in developmentas it stands however its a game that balances on the thin edge of innovation and frustration
as it stands i cant recommend the game at full price but i have no doubt that it will be the jewel of the remainder bini purchased oni with high expectations and in some respects i am not disappointed
the idea of a rd person shooter where the player could pull off fighting game style moves is a great idea
the animestyle character design wasnt a bad idea either
i just never believed that the games developers could do such a mediocre job with this material
go figurethe main problem is that the game quickly turned into a quotfind the switchquot style shooter
i expect this in older games like quotduke nukemquot not something like oni
i was expecting to be kicking chopping bodythrowing and shooting my way through the games levels not going on quotthe great switch huntquot
im getting tired of this the developers should have found another way of moving this game along
especially since there are so many cool fighting moves that your character can performanother point the save game system
it stinks
what made me stop playing this game maybe ill try it again someday is that you load saved games from the levels chapter points not where you saved it
so you can wind up playing the same thing over and over again
zzzzzzzzzzzzzz why on earth would any developer incorporate a daikatana style save game feature into any game is beyond me
whats worse i saved the game on the nd level before i unlocked a door
when i reloaded the game i was trapped in a corridor because the game relocked the door i opened before i saved the game
the switch to the other door was behind the relocked door
i had to start the entire level all over again
ridiculousmy recommendation buy this game if a you have a high tolerance for frustration and switch hunting or b you can get this game at  price and you have the cheat codes handyi was really disappointed once i started playing this game
it was a brilliant ideas spy game great for anyone that likes bond movies or any other movie in that genre
dont get me wrong this game is fun to play but here i will point out the cons where is the d we all love
this game lacked the graphics that you need to compete in todays market and really fell short of stupendous  weapon selectionmore than disappointing in this field hardly any thing to work with  storywhat we all loved about those s spy movies was the villian and the spys journey into defeating him the game lacked on this side of the game toowell if you are thinking about buying this game make sure you check out the demo  before buying it because you may be glad you didnt decide to buy it
one last note thoughthis game genre is no where near out of the question for making a new game so i challenge any and all manufacturers out there to put this game in the dust
good luck browsingshoppinghalflife
hitman
rogue spear
unreal tournament
deus ex
when i think of first person shooters i think of all of these games
a great fps must have the graphics gameplay and action to get your heart rate up during a firefight but also the complexity to make you think to solve puzzles
no one lives forever is an extremely disappointing fps and would have succeeded as any other type of game
i am insulted when i hear this game labeled as a fps placed into the ranks beside all of my favorites such as halflife hitman etc
sure the ingame dialogue is great
ive never heard anything that is so close to the movies
the plot is also something to marvel atit too feels like a movie
my question is this however if you want something that feels like a movie why not just rent a movie
honestly the dialogue drags on for minutes on end which is a lot for a pc game and even longer for an fps
a quality fps is made up of quick plotnecessary exchanges between the main character and an informant who will help you to solve a puzzle or provide important information
the characterization is good but i never really felt like i got into the game
most fps games i am able to finish in a weekend and i play nonstop because i simply cant bring myself to save and quit midlevel
this game took me a great deal longer not because it was that much harder but because it drags
i felt unconnected and truly could not slip into the role of agent cate archer aside from the whole different sex thing
if you ask me this game is overrated overhyped and just not a good fps
get into the halflife series or deus ex and youll see what a real fps is all aboutnumber one  i love to blow stuff up and wipe out entire armies
thats my idea of a good computer game
this is not that kind of gamepluses the graphics are good the user interface works well like other fps good weapons choices and usage loved the musicminuses too much baloney between action scenes
only losers would say quoti replayed the game just to hear the conversationsquot see one again  especially the doggone training labs
wheres the skip button reference one again  too much setup in the story
get me armed and let me exercise extreme prejudiceread the positive vibes
many admit they dont normally like fps games
this might appeal to the wine and whine club but if you want a real game  stick in the realm of unreal half life and quakei bought this game for my girlfiend since she said she use to play it all the time
she was not joking she plays it quite a bit for a girl who does not play many videogames
if you keep in mind that it is an old game then you will have fun with ithonestly i believe that this packaging was made for parents whove heard their kids say the words i want age of empires and who unfamiliar with the series will think that more is bettertruth is once you play aoe ii and its expansion pack the conquerors  youll stick with that version
the original aoe and its rise of rome expansion pack will just gather dust
its not that aoe and rise of rome are bad games
obviously theyre great gameswhich is why aoe was one of the highestselling pc games ever
but the improvements made  in aoe ii and the conquerors mean that game is simply more fun
make no mistake its no bargain that youre getting aoe and the rise of rome along with aoe ii
these are units microsoft simply couldnt sell after aoe ii came outstill its possible this doublepack is priced right
the list price of this collectors edition is exactly the same as the list on aoe ii and the conquerors combined
essentially microsoft is throwing the two older titles in for free
however microsoft very frequently offers rebates when buying any of these titles separately
as far as i know this collectors edition offers no such rebate
id therefore highly recommend that you see whether any rebate promotions are currently being offered by microsoft before buying this collectors edition
if there arent any go ahead and get this collectors edition
but if theres a rebate you really are better off buying just aoe ii and the conquerors separatelyand putting the rebate in the bankif they were trying to charge big bucks for this game id say forget it but im adding my thumbsup to all the other reviewers because its a quality title for the price
think of serious same as a graphic update to doom
the game adds all the cool transparencies lens flares and other lighting effects but its pretty much a lot of running around in giant arenas and shooting everything that comes at youmy only complaint is the shotgun is too slow to reload in my opinion compared to the other fpss out there
you may find yourself using the rocket launcher more often
dont expect much ai  they all just run at you and either blow up or start swinging
but its a nice looking game and theres plenty of baddies to shoot down if you want to quotkillquot some timeserious sam is a great game untill its over in about  hours
technically the single player takes about a day but the fun for me stops after about  hours because the game just becomes boring and repitious
so if you are looking for a great shooter with depth than this is not the one for youserious sam is a game that follows the old traditional style of games such as doom dukenukem d and possibly wolfenstein dthis game lacks in story definition and also fun factors
if you are looking for a game with the least amount of plotlines and alot of mindless shooting the enemy away this is the game for you
graphics are decent
some of the characters appear so silly that it lacks what dukenukem games had
there is one scene in level one where a couple weird mutants run up to you screaming with bombs in their hands
in my opinion this game just is not for me
perhaps others would enjoy itgameplay  graphics  sound  value  this was a good game but it didnt have much of a storyline and it was terribly short
in spite of that it was very fun it gabve you an arsenal to blast away aliens in egypt
i have to give some compliments to croteam on their rendering i havent seen d models that good since need for speed  good job croteam
if you want buying advice i say get it if you want to beligerantly blast away aliens
it is very arcadeish
it was worth the money if you have a lowerend system stay away from this game it requires some beefy hardware i reccomend a geforce so the final verdict its a blast em game with no story and  has good graphics will get old fast but is fun
go for itgunman chronicles is a first person shooter created on the half life build engine
almost everything from the graphics sound effects and the interface is the same as half life when minimised to the tray the tray bar says half life
the storyline in gunmen is heavily inspired by half life and system shock ii you play major archer of the gunman force gunmans are a kind of soldiers who battle against aliens years ago some gunmen fought a battle against an alien invation and their general was killed in that battle
that is before the game starts and now five years later the aliens are back and now you must take your troops and destroy the alien life forms and surprise
you have to explore four different planets before meeting the final baddie the ai in gunmen is very good and like system shock ii a computer ai will help you along
on your way you have to fight gaurds dressed like cowboys dinos aliens crocodiles shoot a copter with a rocket launcher drive a tank ect you would meet scientist also but they will not help you sometimes they might attack you
gunmen has some nice twist and turns to keep you intrested in the single player experiance just like half life the game starts with you taking a train ride but you need to take a training course before advancing to the main game
a training level in games is really great but that being a must and making it a part of the story and as if the training is for the main charecter is very silly because the instructor says quotpress your use keyquot things like that
the bad things in gc is that it is quite short and liner the graphics are also bad and dated
gunman has a lot of weapons and almost all of them have four types of firing but most of them are not intresting the voice acting is not as good as half life
the ending is quite disappointing i didnt expect the final showdown to be this easy and after what happenes in the final battle i felt that major archer is not the hero of the game something else is and all this time i was playing the heros sidekick
the big boss is very disappointing i expected some other monstor to be the final baddie
and that it is so similar to half life that you could call it half life  gunman chronicles
even though gunman has nothing new and quite dissapointing it is great to see amatures create a game like thisthis had the potential to be a great game but fell short
the other  three reviews on here are a bit harsh i think
if you can find this game as i did it is a very entertaining game
being built on the halflife engine is a plus too
i thought the female voice over of the computer lady was excellent and that the computer lady character itself was pretty cool too but was kind of out place in this games setting though
there needed to be more variety in the different levels of the game
it spent way too much time in the second area the alien planet than it should have and too short of a time in the western area which was excellent in my opinion
but i have to say that the previous three reviews made this game sound a whole lot worse than it actually is
i enjoyed the game for what it was and i think most people who enjoy good entertaining fps games would probably enjoy this one tooshocking words arent they
youll have to read my explanation carefully before you go off cryingthe game is great
there is absolutely no doubt about it
the levels sport some phenomenally high levels of detail as well as careful attention to texture placement
halflife had some badly misaligned textures the new enemies are carefully thought out and nicely detailed
everything that needed to be done right was certainly done right hereexcept for a few gripes
beginning with the games length
the game is too short to justify spending   with rebate as of this writing rewolf developed this game not valve
before sierra approached this team of developers for publishing rights rewolf wasnt even a team of professional developers most of them were amateurs like you and me
a group of people who loved the game so much that they decided to get together to make their own levels to play
im too good of a game player to have a game as short as this to last me any reasonable time
coupled with too linear levels the game just rushes by
how many distinct areas are there
three four
i dont know it all went by so fast
so what would have rewolf done if sierra didnt approach them
same thing that every one else would have done
post it on their webpage and become one of the hottest downloads since team fortress classic or they hungerthe game pulls some amazing stunts with a drivable tank and an attacking dinosaur but there was never enough
how much more could rewolf have added to the game if the free roving tank was better utilized
could rewolf have added a quotfree rovingquot space craft
with the awesome skill of including the tank why were the levels so darn straight forward
it didnt matter that i sometimes had no clear idea of what was happening there was only one direction to go in
why was the quottrainingquot session so short
the learning curve and the control adjustment for better utilizing the multiweapons are a bit sharper than usual
the game is like high school love
it flares in intense passion for only a short while and when it finally goes away theres an empty void and youre left desperately looking for something else to fill that void
remember this game has quality not quantity
which one do you wantwhile extremely impressive as a usermade modification using the halflife engine gunman chronicles falls short as a retail game
as ive made countless attempts in the past to make my own modifications and conversions for games like halflife and quake  i appreciate perhaps sympathize with the huge amount of work maps textures models skins sounds programming that goes into a game like this
for this reason as i played through the demo i found myself quick to forgive the authors for things in the game i found to be confusing annoying or simply of poor quality
then i remembered that someone actually wanted money for it and i felt somewhat insultedfor a commercial product sharing store shelves with great games like halflife and system shock  gunman doesnt really come up to par
the game is not nearly as visually pleasing as halflife
in fact sometimes its borderline ugly
i decided this was partially due to weird architecture the space station you start in looks like something from a bad scifi movie but mostly because of the grainylooking wall textures
the configurable weapons were a nice idea but instead of simply having a few different fire modes the player could cycle through with a single key the guns use a menu system thats difficlt to navigate and becomes frustrating especially when youre getting shot because of it
as far as the actual gameplay i felt bored many times when nothing was happenning and frustrated other times when too much was going on at once
also it often seemed unclear where to go and what to do in many areas of the game
i found myself wandering around in circles for ten minutes at a time before id realize there was some lever i was supposed to pull or a button i was supposed to press
oh yeah and the voice acting is terrible to the point of having a nailsonchalkboard effectim not saying this is a horrible game and that you shouldnt at least try it because you should especially if you really liked halflife single player
the configurable weapons are fun to mess around with and it is after all the halflife engine
its definitely worth downloading the demo but if i had extra cash to spare id spend it on a different gameyes the graphics and the music are great but what about the game play
aside from the fact that the controls are not easy to learn this game features an absolutely ridiculous line of site and ai
even the graphics do not satisfy when you consider that only  camera angles and only  camera height is available
this game is a waste of time
if you want to see great visual effects go to the movies or buy the new medal of honor
if you want a real strategy game with amazing realism and inexhaustibly fun game play get combat missionrealmyst is an update to the original myst back in the early to mid s
this time you get a full screen of graphics that you can freely move in
no keyboard commands are needed everything is mouse driven
this is a big plus in the days of mastering several keys to play a good game
the graphics have been updated and they are gorgeous
you can now look at the side of a building or behind something you never got to see
the sounds have also been updated to an extent
much of the music is updated but many sounds remain which is ok the videos inside the books with the missing pages are the same and the message to catherine is really not as good graphics wise as the original
my only complaint is that all of the free movement is very slow
now i have a celeron  but i also have a voodoo mb graphics card and it screams on games like elite force
but realmyst is choppy and slow
however this can be overlooked because revisiting the sites of myst in real d is a joyim not sure what to think of this game every positive point the game tries to make is cancelled out by a negative
the missions are original but require long load times and are extremely difficult
the game is detailed yet the game runs choppy
multiplayer sucks period
better than the first but i wouldnt buy itwhen driver  was released that had to be one of the greatest driving games around in   although when infogrames released driver  i wasnt sure where they were heading
the first thing i noticed about driver  was the way the graphics looked and how slower the frame rate was
the graphics looked very dry and had a used type look in which i wasnt pleased about
theres also frame problems when your car gets smashed into a building
driver  has the same survival driving mode although not as exciting as in driver   theres something about this game that makes the value go down
in driver  you would just drive around los angeles in the downtown area just enjoying the traffic and the cops chasing you
driver  doesnt have that value  even though you can play las vegas at night  just doesnt make it
although its story does make up for the game and the semirealistic gameplay is present  smashing cars up
i just dont have the enthusiam to play this game because of its lack of action and realismi loved driver  and still play it today but i have driver  and its just under my other playstation gamesyoure going to be dissappointed with driver if you loved driver  in most casesa fast and fun game for older kidsdo to the violence i wouldnt recommend it for younger kidsdriver  is a semirealistic driving simulation game
it has an okay storyline but really wears down after so long
the gameplay becomes very limited as time wears on
running from police officers escaping from your car finding a new car and getting in trouble with the law again only can provide fun for a limited amount of time
this game is a good stress reliever when you are tired of constant thoughts and concerns
it does give you a quick fix to end your stress for a little while
it functions the same to briefly interrupt boredom
however the game doesnt have much lasting replay value
for this reason i only recommend it if you can buy it without hurting your wallet substantiallydriver  is a pretty good well designed game that fits the same sort of steoriotype that gta used
except driver  has many many flaws
first of all its just to darn hard some of these goals like stop the truck in havena were so nerve racking i didnt want to touch the game for months
another flaw is that you cannot have any weapons you cannot have any cheats to access all the cities and you cannot really go much of anywhere except the same area of a cityeven with its many flaws driver  is still better than those early gtas isnt it
with a very challening undercover mode a free ride mode and multiplayer games with split screens driver  is a decent game for ps that will keep you occupied for a whilenot as good as the first one but its still considered a classic in my eyes
love collecting these old games
one day they will be gone but i will keep mine safe no matter whatthis isnt a bad game
reminds me a lot of zelda
dungeon based game system
i found the leveling up of weapons to be very interesting and very fun
my biggest gripe is that this can often times take forever to do
plus you can evolve weapons into bigger better weapons but again this can take forever
in essence the game should only take about  hours from beginning to end but has taken me  hours to due levelingevolving weapons
graphics are fun but look like beefed up n graphicswhere to start with dark cloudfirstoff its available for eight  dollars  at most local gamestops in my areatax included so try there first
sure its used but you can save a load of cash that waythe ratingthe descriptors are violence and comic mischief but i wonder if the esrb missed a couple of thousand issues
though they are not spoken the words helluva and  the d word  appear in dialogue enough times to notice
the fortune teller  tells your fortune by leaping ontop of the main characters head and  grinding on it before screaming pumpkin panty fourtune telling
here we go
no exaggeration
luckily there are only a few  things she can tell you
it isnt to graphic but considering the implications i think they  shouldve added language and something else as a descriptorplotan ancient evil genie has been brought back to life via some bizzare dance
a human quickly steps forth and deems himself its master on the grounds that he brought it back to life
the genie agrees before realizing it hasnt  eaten in years and swallowing a nearby human whole
your character whom you get to name with the default being toan is having a celelbration  in his village  when the dark genie attacks seemingly destroying everything and everyone
you are rescued by the fairy king
he tells you that he rescued everyone by sealing them inside alta  which are basically metal ballshe gives your character a special glove so he can wander the world find the pieces of erach destroyed place and rebuild them
ebbventually youll have to defeat the dark genie with help from the friends you meet along the waygraphicsthis game tries a little hard to mimic legend of zelda minus flexible limbs or even slightly realistic swordplaywhen you attack your character literally just swings the weapon side to side
thats itweaponsguess what
theyre breakable
if you dont constantly repair your weapon it will break and disappear
the only exception is your very first
a dinky little dagger that  hardly does any damage
the fairy king blessed this one so it can only break
not break and disappear
you can also build them up to be really strong and cool looking
there are a numbver of  different kins  you can discover
youll also find glowing crystals called attatchments
these are very imprortant
only by leveling up your weapon via attatchmens can they be built up
its worth the work  but breakable weapons are  stupid to me especially with bosses to fightalliesimportantin this game you will meet and get to name your allies
just like you they have hp breakable weapons etc
no big deal right
i mean youre obviously the star and youre the only one who can collect alta so you dont need to worry about whether theyre in top form right
dead wrong
you must must must  must must level up the others
there are boss battles where the main character is completely useless
even in the very first you literally cannot win without help from your ally
so treat them like your main
its been the case in every boss battle ive fought so far
your allies are just as required as your main
it makes the game stand out and i found it to be both agonizing and awesome
when you meet flying monsters use the ally best suited for the job
it will pay offenemies  and bossesthe monsters often have pathetic names and cliche designs with the exception of the triceratops with a  huge spiked clubthere are skeleton guards  and  monsters named after the days of the week
so you wont be lookin forward to the weeekendfriday is just like the song annoying and hard to killfirst two  bosses are easyagain with help but heads up
for the third your main is useless so  when you get your first  three  allies  focus on leveling up their fire abilities and attack power via attatchments
youll see why
just do it
it is absolutely essential unkless youve got about four or five hours to spare
i speak from experience
again the fact you have to use the allies makes it uniquebiggest conyour lock on does little more than make the camera go wild
literally
its so frustrating
it rarely ever works or shows you the approaching enemies
its terribleoverall the game introduces new concepts and stands out  because it makes sure every person has  an equal role  in the defeat of enemies
typical fantasy adventure with a couple of issues
ity isnt for kids
too complex and the fortunetelling ugggh so its definitely a teen game
if it were anything too bad id have returned the game or thrown it away but im still playing
i will update this review once i finish
right now its simply okdark cloud would make a really fun rental  you might be tempted to buy it afterwards
however whatever you see in those first few hours is all youre ever gonna get because this game is very repetative
it is basically a dungeon crawl  you explore random dungeons and fight monsters in real time zeldastyle
sadly dark cloud cant hold a candle to zelda  its missing great puzzles great story and any sense of exploration
each new dungeon has different quotwallpaperquot but you will find that each random level has the same basic layout which gets old very very quickly
getting experience is fun because you level up your weapons not your characters and you can tranform weapons or even imbed their power in other weapons
the best reward is finding town pieces in the dungeon which you take to the surface and begin assembling almost like simcity
i actually had lots of fun with this part but there are only  towns total so not much to it
the graphics are nice and at times amazing especially in the towns but in the dungeons i felt they were merely quotokquot
the plot is basic and uninteresting
the the end just an average gamedark cloud is a game about toan who is given the power to stop evil
the story was great sound was great but their are no voiceovers and gameplay was great
the only thing that is a little frustratingannoying is the level up system for the weapons
i think it takes kind of long to level the weapons up
level  should have made the leveling up system better
still dark cloud should not be missedok so i bought this game on a whim my collection was getting boring
i put the game in played for a little while and thought the game was alright
i cant tell you too much of the story but the object of the game is to go into these dungons fight monsters get the items in the sphere things leave the dungon and rebuild the town that you are in
the first town and dungon is pretty fun
you are able to rebuild the town anyway youd like
however if you listen to the townspeople when ever you start to rebuild they will give you hints on where to put things
ok so i finished the first town and went on to the second
thats were it became repetitios
same old thing just in a different town
go into dungon fight monsters get items to rebuild town blah blah blahwhat makes it even worse is that when you are in the dungon you have to keep an eye on your water supply
when you run out of water you start to lose health
and your weapons only have a few attacks before breaking
keep an eye on your weapon also when its about to break you have to use a weapon recovery to fix it
if youre too late and it breaks your solthe characters in the game are rather annoying
especially the main guy whom you can name whatever youd like
he doesnt talk which i dont like
and has anyone else noticed he looks just like the main character from dragon quest viii
i know the two games are from the same company level  i believe but come on show some originalityanyway this is a game that kids will really enjoy
there is nothing complicated to it just really repetitiousoh one thing i forgot to mention
when you are in the dungons and you decide to leave with out killings all the monsters youll lose half your money
same thing happens when you die in the dungon
that really is lamestoryyou play as a character with the default name of toan a young boy who grows up in a small village living a relatively peaceful life were already off to a bad start with that statement but it gets worse
suddenly out of nowhere an evil dark genie is summoned up by a man with vague origins and even vaguer motives
well at the very least it looks like he wants to blow up some stuff
so toans village is attacked for no particular reason on the night of their annual festival and thrown into panickedvillager chaos
he attempts to save his childhood friend paige from a falling windmill 
and then everything whites out
when toan wakes up he meets the fairy king who explains that everything in his village was about to be destroyed but he miraculously managed to fit all the buildings people and landmarks in the village into small walnutshaped capsules called atla
furthermore he goes on to tell you that only you insertnamehere can save the world
the fairy king gives you a shiny blue stone called the atlamillia which can absorb and restore atla
being the nice guy he is toan doesnt object and somehow has become both responsible for and capable of saving the worldbattle systemtoan starts out with just one default weapon that cant be broken but thats it
this lack of artillery leaves one thing clear this aint no ratchet  clank
sadly the only way for you to get new weapons at this point in the game is to look for large treasure chests which hopefully contain something of value that can be equipped
weapons are upgraded once they reach a certain level of experience which is accumulated through defeating enemies
weapons also have certain items that can be attached so that they will have a certain elemental advantage or stat boost
its an interesting idea but the system isnt explained well enough at the beginning of the game and will no doubt leave new players confused
enemies can be locked onto and attacked and the realtime combat is executed quite well
however each attack causes your weapon to take damage
meaning that the more you strike the enemy the more likely it is that your weapon will break
and although you cant break your default dagger weapons you earn later on can
breaking a weapon doesnt just render it unusable for a period of time it makes it disappear entirely
despite the fact that this game tries to act real by forcing you to drink water and consume bread this is perhaps the most ironic fault ive spotted in dark cloud so far
yes you must eat and drink
but weapons magically vanish when they break and cannot be repaired
somehow a certain type of powder can make a weapon as good as new yet it has no effect on a broken weapon
what did all the blacksmiths go out of business
this system of constantly having to repair weapons means that unfortunate accidents can occur when a weapon is used by mistake and consequently vanishes
the feeling of frustration when a leveledup sword shatters in front of your eyes cant be compared to any other gaming experience ive gone through so farthere are other characters that can be played as you progress through the story but there can only be one person on the field at a time
switching back and forth can become tedious annoying and generally anything but fun
the allies you have are so unbalanced that youll end up playing simply as toan most of the time
really theres almost no use for the allies you gain over the course of the gamedark cloud ends up forcing you to use each new friend you gain anyway by making each consecutive boss battle suited just for one characters needs
so even if youd rather not use one of your allies the game laughs in your face and throws an enemy at you that can only be brought down with a slingshot hammer or some other weapon that toan doesnt possess
all in all the combat is smooth but fighting dozens of enemies with weapons that threaten to break is just too muchgameplaythere are basically two parts to toans quest
the former is trekking through hopelessly long dungeons to find atlaamong other items
the latter is the georama section where you can place the buildings structures rivers and people you have found back in their respective places
first ill go over the good news
laying out your town just the way you like it is a pleasant diversion from scrambling through floor after floor of dungeon
it actually feels rewarding to get someones house just right or to fix a building by making it exactly as it was before
along with placing things throughout the town you can also move around as toan and speak to the various inhabitants
this aspect of dark cloud is enjoyable and satisfying
if you cater to everyones needs you can gain special abilities or equipment for your charactersbut unfortunately that doesnt account for even half the gameplay in dark cloud
the other part of the game deals with entering a dungeon and fighting your way through levels and levels of monsters all of which leads up to a big boss at the end
there are several problems with this dungeon system first of which is toans neediness
he needs water he needs repair powder he needs escape powderis there anything in this game that doesnt put a burning hole in your wallet
dying because of thirst isnt exactly realistic or particularly fun to deal with
a real human can survive three days without water
that isnt very much time but you can bet its more than the few minutes that it takes toan to dry up
in each dungeon level there is a random assortment of monsters that will attack you upon sight
none of these are exactly original or interesting
youve got your bats your club wielding bashers your obligatory skeleton warriors etc
everything feels used as if its already been done before
and thats my point here dark cloud brings nothing new to the table in terms of the dungeon sequences
the developers dont seem to have bothered improving on anything and as a matter of fact it seems they took away some of the fun of dungeon trolling with their system of constantly drinking water repairing weapons and healing toanto advance in the dungeon levels you must find a certain key or talisman that will open a doorpassageway into a different area
unfortunately youre getting a raw deal with this system because you must defeat monsters to gain the key
it is entirely possible that you will have to go through every last enemy in the level to get a single key item
players low on health or items will find this a maddening experience as they try to implement a hitandrun strategywhat dark cloud lacks in quality it apparently tries to make up with quantity
there are well over fifteen levels in every dungeon and while none of them are particularly challenging they eat up time and are almost exactly the same regardless of which floor youre on
a feature that the fairy king tries to emphasize in the beginning of the game is mind connect ability in which he can instantly teleport you out of a floor and back aboveground
however youll have to defeat every single monster on the level to connect with him rendering it thoroughly useless
whats the point of escaping from a dungeon with nothing in it
it makes no sense when compared with escape powder which lets you get out instantaneously
yeah thanks a bunch fairy kingvisuals characters and charmamazoncoms review listed subpar graphics as a con for dark cloud
well they couldnt be more right
with an average story and average gameplay id at least hope to have stunning visuals to make up for it
unfortunately this isnt the case
toan may look charming at first but his facial expressions rarely change
the same goes for every other character in this game
the townsfolk look like wooden dolls that cant do anything but walk around and stand dumbly outside their house until the sun sets
there are no voiceovers in dark cloud merely speech bubbles
peoples mouths appeared to be glued to their faces and in general it looks like a sloppily designed game that could have been done much much better
if the story and characters had been more engaging id be willing to overlook the dated graphics such as i did with okage shadow king
but theres no excuse for a game filled with plot devices and unimaginative storylines as well as archaic character models
not only that but spelling errors and messed up text bubbles appear in the game as well
couple that with the allies who dont do anything plus bland townsfolk who dont distinguish themselves in any way and youve got yourself something that is sorely lacking in a variety of departmentsoveralldark cloud would be a decent dungeon crawler with a solid base if it werent for the ridiculous amount of items that need to be used on toan along with dozens of similar floors for each dungeon and weapons that threaten to break after five minutes of use
the georama and town segments are entertaining but unfortunately they dont make up for the long hours wasted scouring dungeons
no this is not the second coming of zelda
at best it is something to rent to pass the timehow many of you remember the snes slasher soulblazer
well add improved graphics weapons upgrades and more control over the placement of town parts and thats what you got
i will give the game its certain due though
it borrowed the fishing minigame found in the breath of fire series
a very fun distraction
the repetative dungeon crawl does become addictive as you attempt to gather gems stones and experience to convert your weapons though i actually dozed off in shipwreck and when i shook myself awake i had completed another couple of levels however the game does have redeeming factors
one the graphics are okay
game control is very good
i do like the need to repair weapons as well as upgrade and transmute them
dc is the next best thing after onimusha to come out on ps
dont get me wrong im a die hard sony guy but they really needed a hit prior to the upcoming dark angel
due to its length dark cloud is not a rental unless you get one of those  day specials and have  hours each day to dedicate
and this game does eat up time
personally i would wait for a friend to buy it get bored with it and then borrow it from him
oh
darn
i own itback in the day when ps disc where ruled by their dark underbellies a game called dark cloud emerged
the game that is considered to be like a zelda game
yes indeed it did infact star a young main male character who is mute opens chest dungeoncrawls and has the gameplay of an action rpg
but unlike zelda franchise dark cloud has no over world map to travel upon and a cast of other playable character which wouldnt be in a zelda game
not to mention the multiple variety of swords that can be found inside dungeons or brought at stores while zelda has a few selected traditional weapons
with that in mind let us considered this a zeldaknock off with a sprinkle of final fantasy and kingdom hearts genrethe gameplay is standard in this game
basically slash your way through the levels while searching for the missing pieces of the villages and solve key items and puzzles to move onto the next level
nothing too interesting about the combat
as for the sims part of the game your just moving buildings around
take a building and place it where you want it to go
certain buildings may have additional keys or storyline available if you are able to obtain them inside of the dungeons
there are tons and tons of monsters in this game more than there are npcs
this is a heavy dungeoncrawler enemies will reappear if you leave the area or wait around too long
there also is a levelingup factor
the more enemies that are defeated the stronger the characters will become
certain characters can form certain attacks which is key for advancing in the later stageson the otherhand the storyline isnt that much indepth and grabbing
prince needed power for kingdom seeks a way to gain that power and in the result is cursed
prince ends up killing the girl hes interested in
prince vows to put an end to the evil inside of him and goes into the future
main hero must go back in time to stop the evil in the prince
fat darkgenie was an imitation and a mouse
this game is also loaded with some cuteness factorits a nice game with some good ideas but there are other games out there now that go beyond what dark cloud was during its peak in the gaming worldthis is a fun and original game
although after playing for a while it got sorta old
the weapons you carry gain levels instead of you which was neat but your character has to get items to become more powerful instead of gaining xp from creatures
also there was no armor to wear which was disappointing
the rebuilding of cities was easy and time consuming
fun but repetitivei recently bought a lot of classic ps games and wanted to complete it by buying the gameshark adapter i once had
it works great still has plenty of cheat codes in there for the ole classic games
a little pricey though but worth in my mindthe great graphics and sound have been covered before so i will only cover what i didnt likeno porsche
i like the s etc and it seems a pity that they are not there
i would also have liked to have seen some lamborginisbut my greatest disappointment is that there are no racing colours for all the cars
only the pure race cars have the racing colours
what i loved so much about gt was taking an everyday car customising it and having the option of giving it the colours
sponsors and a number
it was really alot of fun to take a mirage or civic and turn it into a race car
you can still do alot of customising to the cars
but they will always be in the same colours and look the same as you when buy it
you can change the wheels which is cool
it was for me a great appeal to get each car to the race colours and added alot of depath to the gameit hasnt really improved that much
if you take away the great graphics then it is pretty much the same as gt amp  but with less cars options and featuresit is still a great game and it is still alot of fun to play
but they could have done more and it could have been better
it is worth the money
but in many ways gran turismo  is my favourite
it blew me away and kept me captivated for weeks on end
i dont think gt is going to keep me as hookedgran turismo was truly something phenomenal when it began on the original playstation
now on the playstation  i think its time to end the gran turismo series
the game isnt bad at all
its just ordinary racingi think too much emphasis was put on realism and not enough on simply having fun
every car looks spectacular but they all feel exactly the same
i find myself daydreaming while racing because honestly looking at good graphics all the time can only be interesting until the next updated racing title comes out and then all eyes are focused on that gamei think i know why so many people are selling gran turismo for such a cheap price
its averageyo
ive been gaming since i was in my teens
and i didnt get a playstation until  when the ps was super hard to getso i didnt get gt  or  until around   i loved those games
they really rocked
i actually remember gt  being the funnestwell we have another version of this game in gt   i have to say this game is getting a bit wooden and boring
a sim it is but without some crashes or other effects it just falls flat as far as im concernedi would not recommend buying this unless it is the first gt youve played
than you may as well get gt  righti would say buy it as a first gt owned other than that nothing new here
move onmc white said its aiight but nothing new hereyou have a ton of cars to choose from which is awesome
but they made it way to difficult to get them
you find yourself just running the same races over and over and over and over for hours just to build your cash up so you can move on
extremely boringafter playing need for speed underground the action in this game seems so slow like the cars are barelly crawling alongi also didnt like that in the game you had to do little drivers exam courses to move up to the next class of drivers license
i thought it was pretty lame boring and a waste of time
they tried to make this game as realistic as possible which is good to a point but somewhere along the lines they forgot it was a gamethis game does have one of the best soundtracks out there for a ps gameif you are a racing game and car fan but casual gamers may find this game a tad boring after a while
its just wham bam thank you mam
you can unlock different fancy racing cars along the way but the races get repetitive after a while
this game should have more rally tracks and cars coz rally rocksgt the follow up to gt is a great simulation racingdriving video game
a myriad of cars are available for you to try out and to drive during your time behind the wheel
if there is a knock on this game they limited the number of used cars available in gt i loved to deck out old  rxs and other priceless cars from the mids
still this game has the cars the tracks and the excitement needed to keep you driving for hours and hoursfor a racing game it is actually pretty cool i dont like cars but if i did this game would get a  the licences are a little hard to get on it though but overall this is a fun gamewhile not trying to belittle certain small aspects of this game i feel that all in all it is a bit overrated
the one main reason for this is the difficult driving mechanics
you may say wel thats great it jst adds to the realism but ive never played a videogame for the reality quite the opposite actually
the whole reason we play videogames is to escape from reality an hour or so at a time
this game all but throws reality right in to your home away from homein this games favor i do have to say that the selection of cars is incredible and all the detail in being able to change things on your car more engine than cosmetic are a very nice change from the normal  or so stock cars
in conclusion there is fun to be had here just dont think your going to look like the king of racing in the processif what you think your getting is a quick adrenaline rush from this game your wrong
i found this game to be the lenghtiest racing sim
some races can take  hours to complete thats just one race nto a tournament which makes tension and adrenaline difficult to findin conclusion if what you want is a powerhouse game that requires many hours to complete absorb all the content this is just the ticket
however if what your looking for is a quick and fun racing game to play with your friends i suggest need for speed hot pursuit  or underground depending on if your in the mood for tuners or exotics cuz i know i love bothbetter graphics than ps but still not worth
gran turismo  starts with high interest but you easely get bored of ittheres really no difference between this game and the other gran turismo games
the differences graphics tracks and cars
the handling can be troubling sometimes
there are no porsches and ferraris which make the game worse
if your a new comer to the gran turismo series then this would be a great game but if you have the other two then dont waist your time on this oneits no secret that sonic  and sonic  knuckles were supposed to be one gigantic game but developing time and cartridge ability forced the project to be split into two halves
back in the s i only ever played sonic and sonic  on my mega drive
i remember when sonic  came out in about june  it was out of my price range at the time and by the time i had enough money to invest the mega drive was already losing ground to the nextgeneration consoles so i never botherednow that im trying to catch up with all the games i missed i am a little bit disappointed with sonic  the first sequel was released to unprecedented hype in the run up to xmas in  while sonic  seemed to just appear in shops with little to no fanfarethe gameplay is nearly no different from the previous games
sonic jumps dashes spins accelerates and smashes as usual
the special stages have been changed again
the rotating labyrinths and speedway chases are gone and in their place there is the cruelest hardest level ive ever played in any video game
sonic runs around on a giant sphere collecting blue spheres and avoiding red spheres all in giddy disorientating fauxd
its the kind of thing that provokes seizures
and unless you have the reflexes of a superhuman gunslinger and have a control pad with responses far beyond what the mega drive was capable of youll never ever manage to succeed at them allthe music is also a bit of stepdown from sonic  and  those tunes were catchy and fun while the tunes in this game are just kinda middling and mediocre
a bit of a missed opportunityand dont get too excited about the ending
the game juststops
theres no epic climax no eyecandy no credits recap
it just ends
i do realize that this is because the game is really only halfway finished but the developers still could have put in somethinganything
a cliffhanger perhapsdespite the disappointment im still looking forward to sonic  knuckles
its got a lot to make up for
afterwards ill revisit sonic  with the lockon and see if it makes for a better experiencegraphics asound bgameplay blasting appeal bwhy did the people at sega have to copy sonic  to make money
i was really hoping for a great game when i played this right after finishing sonic  but to my dismay i found almost no difference between it and sonic the mini games are okay but insanely difficult and pointless and the regular game play makes it seem to be just an expansion on to sonic   while it featured some new power ups these were not enough to make sonic  a great game over its predicessor which i found to be one of the best d platform games everi found this game to be a complete waste of my time since after all id already just finished its twin sonic sonic the hedgehog  is an average game
first off this game does keep the same winning formula fans of sonic lovecool level designa sense of speedand tons of secrets
i have to say my favorite sonic game is sonic cd a sega cd exclusive and sonic the hedgehog  is my second favorite
sonic  isnt bad its just not as good as the sonic titles i mentioned aboveif you have ever had the experience of forcing yourself through a book that you werent particularly enjoying but felt compelled to finish you know how i feel at this moment having just completed the longest game  err journey
well it was not really the longest game  about  hours total  it just seemed that wayif you have played any of the classic adventure games kings quest monkey island etc
 you know the drill
slowly move your cursor over every scene looking for the stuff you can click on
talk to everyone you meet as long as there is new dialogue to hear
run back and forth through the same screens over and over again so you can use object a on person b to get object c
try combining every item in your inventory with every other item no matter how silly it seems in the hope of producing a new object that you can use on person d to get object e
this is the same dull i mean fun stuff to be expected from any adventure game and this one rarely breaks with traditionone nice difference it adds is that you can never die and even better yet you can never get into a situation in which there is no way to progress from your current save game and are forced to restore to earlier saves looking for the point where you took the wrong path
you may get stumped by a couple of the very illogical puzzles but you can rest assured that all of the pieces to the solution are available
this very linear game will never let you into another area of the game unless you have everything you need or  still have access to the areas you need to gather them
big plushowever the game manages to create a brand new flaw that will no doubt serve as a warning to future game designers
it has endless dialogue
eyes glaze over endless dialogue
shout at the characters to just shut up already endless dialogue
and you will need to listen to all of it or hit escape repeatedly to fast forward through it to solve the game because repeatedly you will be required to elicit a certain line from a character before you can access another part of the game or get needed information from another character
this single flaw destroyed most of my enjoyment of the game and drives it down to the level of just okbottom line
if you love adventure games you will probably be willing to overlook the endless talk and appreciate the games many virtues nice graphics wonderful voice acting strong storyline varied locals and well defined characters
if you dont like adventure games dont be fooled by all of the rave reviews
its charms are unlikely to appeal to those who dont like the genreim an avid adventure game lover and i hooked my wife
shes gone through myst and sequels and we try to never look at the walkthroughs
weve been disappointed at the forgotten as too simple an unfinished
the crystal key was also disappointing technically it crashed our mac so we couldnt finish it the legend of lotus spring on the other hand was a very nice game if not too difficult
our favorite so far in that genre are riven and beyond atlantis for the stories and puzzles and safecracker for the puzzles onlyi personally love the games that try to set up an atmosphere and make the intrigue interesting and i feel that tlj scores well on that point the intrigue starts very well
but the ending is so disappointing
they could have done something much better beyond atlantis wins way high on that point
by the end i was skipping the dialogues just read subtitles and cut the chase to the core
it boiled down on using one of the ten items left at the end to move on
too simple and not rewarding enoughanother flaw of the game is its linearity you can only do what will advance in the game a chicken could run the game by haphazardly pecking at the mouse until something happens
there isnt too much thinking involved and april gives away many clues
i guess the intention is that anyone even kids can play but then why the offensive language
there are five or six a little more involved puzzles in there all of them have a rather debatable logic to itin any case they dont really build up like in riven where the pieces would add up until the last formidable puzzle
the last three puzzles in the guardians realm are a joke and that was the biggest disappointment for what should have been the culmination of the gameon the good side the story is very engaging and at least in the first four chapters it felt like we were there
for that i recommend the game highly
it would be very worthwhile to have the same engine a d character walking in a scene and abuy this game if you like a good story and want to live a nice adventure the depiction and level of detail of the balance arcadia is nice and has a mythologic ring not unlike the best games of the genre
but youre likely to be disappointed if you like challenging puzzles and rewarding endingsdont get me wrong
i love adventurepuzzle games and have played so many that i have a bookshelf collection
this game is one fantastic storyline and the puzzles were great
i guess i just wish that she didnt take so long to run from one place to the otherexamplewhen she is off the subway and headed to talk to the guy in the garage
and the talkingomgcould we have done without so much useless information
i got so tired of listening to things that didnt matter to the game that i kept skipping over some of the characters talkingyou can read what is being said and see if its neccessary to know
i thinkthis game would of been rated better in my bookif and only ifi didnt spend  hour playing and  hours listening to the characters hold useless conversationsi just finished playing quotthe longest journeyquot and i liked it
i didnt love it and heres why theres way way way too much talk
i love to read and a certain amount of conversation doesnt bother me at all in a game
this was just over the edge though
there were conversations that lasted more than  minutes and ultimately werent really very interesting theres no good way to skip animation
april the main character walks from place to place and you have to sit and watch her walk
you can make her run which is a little better
you can also hit the escape key to skip the animation but it only skips it ahead a little  so to get her from one place to another fast you have to keep hitting quotescapequot it would have been nice  and pretty darned easy  to make it possible to click from one location to another once theyve already been visited some of the puzzles are entirely based on quothunt the pixelquot  success hinges on finding the one tiny pixel thats hidden behind something else
i want puzzles to require intelligence and flexibility on my part not keen eyesight and infinite patience in moving the mouse over the screenthe game was good
the voice acting was excellent the graphics were pretty and the characters were engaging
the story was also very good though some threads never got resolved which was annoyingquotthe longest journeyquot has very little replay potential  it would be too tedious to watch april walk around and talk to people once you know how the story turns outif you buy this one just be ready for a lot of chitchat on the way to a satisfying storythis game is nice good puzzles and problem solving skills
the problemtoo much talkingalot of what some of the characters have to say is purely boring
keep the dialoge direct and to the point the game would have been much better
not one of their better gamesits awesome to have a collection of all these mario games but dude why does it struggle save sometimes
wtfif you can angle your gba to avoid the massive glare this light gives off then youll be ok  the worm doesnt drain much power which is nice compared to some external ones requiring batteries gamester floodlight which suck down batteries at  per day
its basically a squeezetype led flashlight plugged into the gbas rear port
not a bad design but be aware you cannot move the spiral neck around much it snaps back to its original position and you almost need to break it for any real position changefor seven bucks it isnt badthe good lower power drain no need for external batteries very small doesnt get in your way brightness is more than enough in pitch black conditions only seven bucks powers down when the gba is turned offthe bad cannot move the arm much to obtain a better position bad glare the plastic packaging it comes in is sealed like the boy in the bubble so youll need a knife to get in which might make returning it awkward if you cannot stand the glareok to start off a memory card is needed to save and enjoy your games without it you will have to restart at the beginning of the game each time you play it
at first galnce this is a cheap and nice memory card and it seems like it has no flaws right
well no below i have listed all the pros and cons to this memory cardprossame amount of memory as a sony cardincludes magic gate tecnologycheaper than other memory cardsconswill not fit into the slot in a game caserequires a good quotquottugquot to remove it from your systemslower than sonys memory cardisnt as reliableso i guess it is really up to you
do you want a brand name memory card or another rd party memory card
i would highly recomend sonys memory card becasue of its reliabilty but the choice is yoursthis is just a commentreview as to why xbox charges for online access and why if you think your not going to have to pay for ps access your crazyxboxs online games are all tied into  network
this is cool for several reasonsyou can see friends that are on other games
yes if your buddy is over playing nfl and your on ghost recon you can see that reset your xbox pop in nfl and join him for a game
how cool is thatother reason is that most games will not charge you since microsoft is already charging you an annual fee  bucks a year or roughly  per month and the first year is free
there are some exceptions however
one would be a massively multiplayer online type game like everquest
the ps version of everquest is charging month with  days free to get you started so its fair to assume that xbox would do the same if they came out with a similar gamesince its all one network it might even help latency
that is to say since the servers wont be solely dependent on the game maker and more on microsoft the network might have more support and less down time
i can only guess on this point but it seems to make sense
also smaller game companies could do online versions of their game and not have to worry about maintaining expensive servers etcvoice over netthe voice mic that comes with xbox is nice its a good microphone and works well but honestly its hardly used unless you wanna plug it in and say good game talking over the net is silly no matter how you look at itps does have some games with a mic socom or you can buy a third party usb mic but thats an added cost
of course nice thing about ps is the usb port you can just plug in your pc keyboard if you want
most games support it including phantasy star online which btw is a really fun game
anyone that says pso is ok hasnt played it too long i still play it on my dreamcast
pso works on all  consoles but only has voice over net on xbox as far as i knowhardwareits about the same you either pay  for the ps adapter or you pay  for the xbox microphone with a year of service
in the long run youll probably pay about the samehard drive
woohoo xbox has a hard drive downloading content and game updates is automatic
you can update a lot with very little storage space and thank god that the ps has those memory cards that hold megs of data which imo is more than enough for most patches
everquest alone takes almost megs on a meg card so when you pick up this adapter you better get a couple more memory cards  each later youll have to get the hd who knows but guessing  so keep that in mindsummaryi have both the ps and xbox network stuff but i hate football games and fpss and im not willing to start another everquest game but i do have twisted metal black online on my ps
i have ghost recon and i play that motorcycle racing game on my xbox and thats about itinternet console gaming is in its infancy so its fair to say that weve got a ways to go before good stuff comes out that makes it really worth it to the main stream
i think ps has the advantage right now becuase they support a modem and really thats about it
if you wanna go online just to see what all the hubbub is about cool do it i encourage itfutureeverquest  is coming out to pcxboxpsgamecube all at the same time sometime next year thisll probably be the one game that brings all the platforms together in harmony and online commrodery ugg terrible spelling should be interesting and probably expensive but what the hell if you read this far youre probably as nuts as i am
btw i dont own a gamecube but as i understand it you can get either a network or a modem adapter for that system as well so if your a nintendo nut check it outive been looking for the network adapter for sometime and purchased used one on amazon
it was delivered within about a week by vendor
i havent used it yet because im waiting for the wireless bridge to drop down
i stopped by a local gamestop store and they had at least  for sale
way cheaper than listed on amazon
i mean by i bought this item thinking it would open up a whole new world of gameplay and breathe new life into some old games in my collectionafter having issues with the installation of this adapter to my desktop and ps with a router i pitched the router to the side and went straight from modem to my ps
success
well sort of
sure it worked like it was supposed to but i didnt really enjoy playing online too much
i tried out a couple pro skater games but failed to really see any real difference in gameplay
lots of games were full and the ones that werent well i didnt stick around too long
after maybe  or  minutes i popped in vice city and realized the adapter was a waste of time and moneyof the two consoles currently participating in online gaming microsoft has done a much better job than sony in my view
first off how can you have a good gaming expirience with dial up
i was a beta tester for xbox and have played on ps online
as a beta tester i found out quickly that this is one of the greatest things that has happened to the gaming system
for  bucks the xbox kit is well worth the price
not only does it include the headset which fits well and works great but it also includes a whole year subscription to xbox live
you can also mute and adjust the volume on the communicator
for the price of a single game this is a great deal
i also think that the ps adapter is a great value but cmon you have to pay subscriptions to select games
so if you cant make that final decision i would reccomend xbox live but if you only have a ps then go with ps onlinealthough i must admitt that i broke down and bought one of these there really isnt a point to having it
the only online game at the moment worth playing is timesplitters  and i am getting that for xbox not ps
so it will probably sit there for at least another month or so collecting dustwhen i bought this game i was really hoping for it to be the morrowind of the high seas
i was dissapointedthats not to say the game isnt cool  it is
being a pirate is always awesome
however the plot isnt what i would call revolutionary or unpredictable
in addition the contact with npcs is not what i expected  you cant really develop any relationships
also be aware that you can only play as a man and that the character is not customizable
on the positive side the graphics are stellar
the ship to ship combat is awesome once you get a hang of it
which is also one of the biggest weaknesses of the game
there is no tutorial no guide and the manual is really insuficient when it comes to teaching you the game
in order to get the most out of sea dogs you will need to go find an online guide or walkthrough
when you start off you will find the game to be difficult very challenging
leveling up your character is quite hard and time consuming
yet once you get the hang of it all the game is quite entertaining and funthe other day while going through some old papers i came across this cryptic scrawl on a postit note  iktal buy only wine from him at 
i was instantly transported back to this game and how much i got into playing it at the time
its really absorbing and very atmospheric
so promising was it that people waited with baited breath for the sequel sea dogs ii which unfortunately was scuttled when disney took it over at the last minute and had everything redone to match the themes of their latest film
that may have worked but the real problem was that it was released way before it was ready and that game now has the reputation as being one of the most bugfilled pieces of software ever released
yeah what a shamewhich leaves us with this game
ive been on the lookout for years for a great pirate game but the definitive job has always eluded me
sid meirs pirates was a dud as were a few others
for my money this is the best allaround pirate game theyve released yet at least as of my writing
certainly with respect to recreating what it must have been like to physically sail big wooden ships which is really what i was looking for
i also remember it had a logical fair system of duelsmind you there are many problems with it
the chief problem in my view is that the economy is so out of whack that the choose your own adventure sandboxstyle mode of play is scuttled
getting a huge ship becomes so expensive you basically cant do anything else than turn yourself into a legitimate merchant
i also seem to remember having serious problems recruiting a crew
theres a bar you can go to to hire a doctor a carpenter a navigator and so forth but once you do they disappear and you cant hire them anymoreit was frustration over these elements that eventually stopped me from going much further with this game
but man what promise
some day
some daythis games biggest flaw is its difficulty
its too hard but really fun once you get the hang of it
you will have to spend some quality time with this game if you want to be successful
yes the game has some bugs but they probably wont bother you too much
the dialogue can be awkward due to this being a russian game so be prepared for that
also youll probably need a walkthrough at some point because youll probably have a hard time figuring out where youre supposed to go next in order to continue along the storyline
youll also have to be very good at balancing your budget because its no easy task and youll hang from the yardarm if you fail to keep enough doubloons on handthat said this is an extremely beautiful game and the battles are awesome
i recommend buying this game first and then getting the sequel sea dogs iii just bought the component av cable from a rd party company and already has the svideo cables rd party too 
ive read that av component its much better than s video and thas why i bought it
but is not
av component seems to be a little better than standard av cables rca
s video gives an extraordinary brilliance to images
video component looks opaque maybe monster cables works better
in summary svideo av component standar av cables rcacould it be cause they are rd partyi got the vertical stand with my ps and i like the idea that you can save tons of space by standing it in an upright position
for the amount of time i used it i enjoyed it
the only problem was getting used to putting the game cds in sideways which might seem a bit strange at first
sadly i have my ps dvd unit and sterep reciever stacked so i no longer have my ps standing as a tower
but i kept the stand
you never knowif youll notice on your ps the little playstation logo on the disc drawer can be turned sideways so it can be properly viewed in the upright position
it is a little thing but a cool thing nonethelessas for the complaint about how standing the system upright causes it to scartch the games i disagree
i played many hours on several different games while the console was standing up and i got not one scartch on any of the game discs
maybe this was a problem with the first generation ps consoles i am speculating but not on minejust one word of warning
be careful not to place the upright ps in an area where it can be easily knocked over such as the corner of a table or out in the open where your cat can bruch up against it
there is nothing to protect the console from being knocked over so make sure you put it a safe place
otherwise this is a practical and functional item
it serves only one purpose so i see it pointless to give it  starsmany reviewers are right on the money with their sense of bafflement at the existence of this shiny blue and black contraption
i bought it when i had to stick my working ps my first one rolled over and died when space in my office was at a premium and since i am rather klutzy at times anything that kept it safer could only be a good thing
except for making a vertical playstation  harder to tip over it does nothing
it looks good its standyness cannot be denied
i cant wait for the playstation  wall mount adapter or the ceiling mobile adapter or maybe an attractive ps hat ensemble
sony is obviously preceding with the concept of if you make it theyll buy it
 which leads me to the horizontal stand a beveled piece of blue and black plastic which sits under your ps now that makes no sense who would buy such a thing
oh rightthis is a bonus  a way overpriced but still a bonus
basically this turns your ps into a tower making it sleeker and easier to place somewhere so that the ps takes up less room
surprisingly enough it looks less stable than what it is
mine has been through hell and the ps has never toppledis it worth it
the verdict is  yes but not at that price
since this is a monopoly item for the ps then you will just have to splash out if you want it
you do not get value for money but you do get a great addition to your psmoto gp was to me a disappointing motorcycle racing experience
the graphics are fantastic but aside from this i didnt find too much to be impressed by
this game focuses too much on simulation than the arcade style gameplay
there are only  tracks which limits the replay valuealthough there are plenty of switchable options such as a large amount of motorcyles and helmets this just doesnt enhance the gameplayi believe a true motorcycle rider and fans of these types of simulations will get a lot of enjoyment out of this title however to the average gamer who is looking for a great arcade style motorcycle racing experience would be better served by motoracer for the playstationthe graphics good
better than the older games by far
the sound again much better than the older versions of the game
the gameplay the same as in the other versions but with one exception the timer
you run out of time too quickly
since i never actually play to win the race by racing thats what other racing games are for i was disappointed to find out that you get almost nothing for knocking down pedestrians or bowling over other drivers
what a ripoff
but once i downloaded a timer cheat the game became fun againok to start with i have owned every carmageddon game and the first is still the best
however it just doesnt run on any of my computers any more and its two successors have each had flawstdr comes close to the feel of the original in terms of random time wasting and frustration but several things detract from the fun
first you must actually race ick to complete the levels as peds are annoyingly hard to kill
yes its more realistic but that isnt really the point
is it
no i dont think so
all of the really fun stuff has been removed presumably for political correctness wheres the turbo nutter bd nitrous
why no points style or artistry
but its not all bad
unlike carma ii it doesnt have completely impossible missions and like the original you have to drive like a demon to keep the timer from running outdiverting but disappointing
it should get  stars because it doesnt have the completely impossible missions of carma ii and it does relieve your road rage in the absence of an original carmageddoncapable computer
im rounding down because i know my judgement is skewedi hated the missions in carma ii so very muchjust look at that cover
its so  shiny
and those company logos treasure game arts and working designs
omgthe silpheed series is known for adding a bit of cinematic flair to the shmup genre
i wont blame anyone for not knowing this is a sequel as the first silpheed game was released on pc and sega cd
that cinematic flair continues here with briefings between levels and lots of interactive backgrounds and story elements happening midgamethe most interesting part about the gameplay is the weapon system
you can equip different weapons to the left and right side of the ship
ship positioning can be important if you equip them differentlyscoring is based on enemy proximity
the closer you are the more points you get
so basically optimal scoring is like a kitten act nice and snuggle up close then unleash your clawslevel and weapon design is unfortunately where the game becomes less interesting
pacing needs work as there are several long boring stretches that just arent exciting enough
weapons while varied in execution are weak and limited in usefulness
this could have been a fun game with a bit of extra firepower and more enemies
i find it difficult to play all the way to the final level not because its too hard but because there game just isnt all that fun
speaking of the final level thats the best part by far though and offers good amount of challenge
so the question is is the journey worth itthe ps has a lot of really good shmups
silpheed the lost planet is decent however id only suggest it to someone who already has the better ones and is looking for morei was interested when i first saw incredible crisis
it looked so funny i was imediatly hooked
after playing it on a demo disk i was ready to laugh and fall down while playing
was i satisfied
wellkinda
incredible crisis is a fun but flawed game that needs some serious tinkering before they come out withi wont spoil it for those of you who have reached the ending
let me say the good points first
first off this is the funniest game i have ever played i fell down laughing many times laughing untill my lungs hurt
the fmv sequences are well done and often the funniest parts of the game
the music is the best part of the game
it is incredibly addictive and you will find yourself humming the music hours after you stopped playing
well thats all the good parts
now for the bad parts
incredible crisis has  serious flaws that seriously inhabited my enjoyment of the game
the first flaw is that there is little replay value except if you want to see all the fmvs again which you cant watch once you finish the game unlike the minigames
the second isint that serious but whenever you want to load a game it seems that the game dosent want you to because it always places the cursur on the cancel button
the third flaw is that your fingers will be mush after you finish this gameon the positive side your fingers will be really strong
and finally the biggest flaw of all
this is way too hard
some of these games are just insane in terms of difficulty
the elevator of doom the back rubbing game and shudder the pound for pound and the golden pig games
these can be so frusturating you will scream and rip your hair out
im talking throwyourcontrollersmashthetvobliteratethegamedisk frusterating
still this is a ok game that is more worthy of a rental then a purchasethe goodlots of funny moments interesting graphics good music some entertaining gamesthe bad really puts a strain on fingersand the
ugly incredibly difficultthe good  fun minigames good graphics and sound very weird but in a good waythe bad the games are fun if you can beat them having lives makes things even harderif you love warioware then youll love incredible crisis
ic pits players in minigames where they have to help the main characters escape weird situations
one such situation is when you have to shoot down missiles so the navy and air force dont shoot down the mother ship you do all this because youre chasing a hottie then you get blown up and land in a leaky boat and have to scoop the water out as fast as possible
while all this sounds fun its harder than it should be
scooping the water out sounds easy enough hit the x button until the bucket fills up and then dump it
well you have things falling on your head and if you dont put your umbrella up fast enough you face god awfully long animations that take forever to end and for you to recover
if you mess up just twice youll have to start the set of  minigames all over again and you have lives as wellsome games are just impossible to pass
one such minigame is when a bunch of wolf thieves make you decode their piggy bank they made you steal with a tune
you have to remember the tune like simon says but the dots get mixed up on the board and you have to end up memorizing very long tunes
if you can handle this then ic is a super fun game
it has great graphics and sound and you can pick it up fairly cheap on ebaymickeys speedway usa is a kart racing game in the vein of mario kart
it was developed by rare who had already produced their own mario kart clone for the n in the form of diddy kong racingthis is an okay game
i picked it up mainly because rareware made it but because it deals heavily in the disney license you wont find much of the companys distinct sense of humour and style in the package
the game doesnt feel as deep as diddy kong racing  its more of a straight multiplayer game and lacks the interesting adventure mode the former had
the graphics and track layout arent really spectacular and the music is forgettable
on the plus side there are various soundbytes of the disney characters to listen totheres nothing broken about the gameplay the controls are tight and you get your assorted powerups and vehicles with different handling speed and weight classes
but if youve played mario kart diddy kong racing crash bandicoot lego racers and just about all the other racers out there mickeys speedway wont offer anything new
not really worth tracking down now that the n is deadlet me start by saying that monster cable makes fine products
their av cables are the best in the business period as far as im concerned
that said it is really a waste of money to get this kind of cabling for composite video
if your tv accepts svideo or component video then i would definetly opt for the gl  and  respectively
but at this level the performance doesnt justify the costi have been playing this game for  days i have a level  omnitek soldier and its pretty cool
usually you kill things for xp and do missions for money
the whole game is about character developement and its really fun
however this game has some major flaws for instance the lag
the lag in the game is lag i have never seen before
i am talking about  ping just when there is a group of people huddled together its horrible
usually you dont see that many people in the game and in fact the game is so huge you dont see that many people
and when you do see a person in the game all they do is run by you like you are not even there
people in this game to not care that other people are in the game they just go on doing what they want to do and never care about talking or doing anything with others
but if you are bored with the mmorpgs we have out now and have a very good modem or dont care about doing stuff with people either get this game
or else wait a couple months for the lag to get betternote you must enjoy the art of d fighters before purchasing this game
please do not buy this game if you think tekken is the best fighter ever
you will be sadly disappointed
now on with the reviewwell im a huge capcom fan
i own just about every game from re to marvel vs capcom  heck i own a saturn just to play the meg vs titles from japan
im also a huge snk fan
mostly metal slug and shodown but ive played a lot of kof so imagine my excitement when capcom announced capcom vs snk
a vs title plus capcom characters and snk characters
omg
this would be the end all of d fighterssadly its not
i miss that tagteam mode
sure you can select up to  fighters based on fighter quotlevelquot but not being able to tagteam is a major disappointment for me
also there are no capcom characters just street fighter
same goes for snk characters just kof
would have been nice to have megaman and metal slug  or even some characters from ss  or  tam tam anyone
now the graphics arent as good as say street fighter alpha  the menu system isnt the best for a vs title and the game just doesnt have the same feeling as other vs titles for me
the groove select select either capcom or snk power metering amp super combo button selections and real time metering is very cool however
its fun watching your score go up or down on each successful hit or block
plus when you get beat your score drops down quite a bit
makes you want to fight even better and more cleanly
very interesting concept i hope capcom will adopt for future titlesin closing the game should have been titled quotstreet fighter meets kofquot
that would have been a much more truthful title and i probably would have given it a better reviewthe overrated system looks good on the outside but in the inside its a differnt story
sony clams many things about the system
they say that it has a dvd drive but its super slow
like at x
if you have friends over only  can play at a time plus there the same coll
has playstation one
dreamcast has better graphics but playstation two has faster frames
sony did have a good idea about making it so you playstation one gamesnow to go indepth the systems is alot faster than playstation one
sony clams that the system can do you to  million polygons per second
the games do  million polygons per sec
at its best
the speed rather slow at  mhz with a  system buz
it goes on and on
it never comes up to gamecube and xboxthe overview is dont waste your money
its  like a half of a computer and its impossable to get it
buy dreamcast or your save moneyi like this game but this game is mainly for those of you that like racing games as well as rpgsafter jak and daxter jak  and jak  i have no idea where this game came from
a racing game thrown into an rpg series
unlike me most rpgjak players at least everyone that i know dont like racing games all that much so jak x seemed a little strange to me
the story doesnt suit the type of game very well racing with a cutscene thrown in here and there
 but overall it is a good gameone thing i like is the weapons
i prefer combat racing over regular racing so guns and weapons make this game more enjoyable
there is also a large range of games aside from circuit races
games such as sport hunt artifact race like in jak  deathrace deathmatch and rush hour can be played as wellthe onlinemultiplayer is fun but when you play multiplayer the stats of the cars go down to what they were when you first got them
all that upgrading is useless for online play
not the best online game but still funall in all jak x is a good game but not my favorite or what i would expect from the jak seriesjak x combat racing is a very fun racing game that i enjoyed very much
not only does the game have entertaining gameplay but fun cut scenes as well
as the title suggests as you race you pick up items you can use such as weapons and shields
this makes the game more fun because you arent just racing but are trying to shoot your opponents and cause them as much trouble as you can
and there arent just races in this game
there are other challenges too such as where you try to get more artifacts than the other players or you try to ram as many drones as you can or a race where you try to get through in as little time as possible by collecting tokens to freeze timethere are also extras in this game
you can get different drivers including some you can get if there is save data from other games on the memory card artwork some videos some are funny and different things you can use to customize your vehicle
there is also mulitplayer as youd expectbut there is one issue with this game i dont like
there is apparently a glitch in the game that can corrupt the save data or even corrupt the entire memory card
it sounds like its not just the old copies of the game either but even the new ones
i was lucky enough to play the entire game twice before i heard about this issue but im not likely going to play again
its not worth corrupting my memory cardso to summarize this is a very fun game with a lot of variety but because of the memory card issue you play at your own riskrainbow six is a first person stealth shooter from red strom entertainment
rainbow six is the codename for a team of special force who deal in missions like hostage rescue
there is not much of a plot it is mostly dealing with the terrorists in different places and situations
before the game starts you need to pick your team member chalk out a plan select weapons and then go terrorists hunting
r gameplay is not like other fps games one gun shot is fatal and can kill you this make it very challenging and intresting
one shot kills also also makes r very hard and almost impossible to finish in the single player gameplay it does not have a save game option either
the multiplayer games are the best things in r and they are very challenging and a lot of fun
rainbow six is bad as a single player game but very good as a multiplayer gamethis game while better than the delta force games by far still lacks a good bit in being a good game
the ai is horrible as you will spend half the game backtracking to find your teammates who have great difficulty even following you through a doorway
also half the time the other teams just stand at the beginning of the map and never do anything
it is cool though to be able to plan your missions even if you do need to be a military strategist to do it properly in this game
it seems the creators of the r game and its add ons has sacrificed quality and detail for depth of play
the interface is poor and you have no way during a mission to check your objectives to see what has been done and what still needs to be done
the gameplay is very lacking in many areas but the graphics though not perfect are still  times better than the delta force games at least
overall its a decent game at best but still fun to mess with as long as you can find a cheap copy of it somewhere as i didi played this game a couple of years ago and beat it
i enjoyed it the best i could but i couldnt help feeling that is wasnt that fun
it was basically an updated version of rogue squadron with better graphics and new campaigns
if you have an n these graphics will amaze you as they are better than any other n game except for mario 
in the end this is a decent game just not the bestmy cousin love this game because he can beat in a day and love it to death because playing the game with his brothersthis was actually the last atv offroad fury game i have boughthaving already played atv   and  i can honestly say i am not very impressed with this game
when i bought it i figured it would be just like atv offroad fury  but it was notthe worst thing about this game is that there is no freeride
i was extremely disappointed when i realized it didnt have my favorite featurethis game is a little fun but if you can buy just the other atv offroad fury games
they are all way betterthis game should have beenan expansion pack to sim theme park  and priced as such  as itshardly a sequel
if there are any major differences or improvementsi havent found them yet
you have three themed areas to choose fromsim theme park had five and you climb the corporate ladder bydeveloping your park with various rides managing your staff andcompleting challenges that will ultimately allow you to progress tothe next themed area
the system requirements are steeper in thisgame and the load times are excruciating
dont listen to the box youll need at least a p and even then only if you have afast video card or youll be struggling
if you do decide to changethe screen resolution the game shuts down without giving you theoption to save your park first  a very irritatingannoyanceanother annoyance is the constantly yapping announceryou think bullfrog wouldve listened to all the complaints peoplewere making in sim theme park
for instance one of the challengesinvolves increasing the attendance by a certain percentage
to dothis you may decide to lower the entry price hey maybe im notmichael eisner and i dont want to gouge my customers
unfortunatelythis will cause the announcer to annoy you over and over that yourentry price is too low
or maybe youve researched all the rides andattractions you can build
doesnt matter itll yap incessantly thatyou need to put your scientists to work to the point where you want toslap its little blue facethe rides dont differ much from onearea to the next another consistent complaint about sim theme parki dont find fault in this as most amusement park rides really arentmuch different from one another but it wouldve been nice to seebullfrog step up to the plate and offer unique rides that violate thelaws of physics in the real world
one problem i ran into in thisquotsequelquot involves the potential of rides interfering withone another
in the first park i built a rollercoaster next to alarge rock formation
unbenownest to me i found out this rockformation later became a ride i needed to build
unfortunately therewas no way of making this happen without completely destroying myexisting rollercoaster at considerable expensethe last major gripefor some involves the gameplay itself
its very evident thedevelopers did not want to make this complex to the point where youfelt like a harvard business grad by the time you finish
instead thefocus is more on putting out fires minute to minute while still havingtime to enjoy the fruits of your labor
you can adjust the speed ofthe gameplay so it can be as slowpaced or as frantic as you want andthis function works well
many people will be put off by the lack ofquotsimquot in sim coaster but now you cant complain because iwarned you in advance right
also the ai of your staff seems tohave improved considerably  puke doesnt dry for four hours on thesidewalk like it did in the last gamethe area where this gameshines is simple  camcorder mode
with a click of the mouse you getto see the park and ride your coasters in firstperson view as if youwere a visitor instead of the overhead quotgod modequot viewafter spending an hour carefully designing every twist and loopriding your creation is a nice reward for your efforts and a lot offun
you even get to see the other shops and rides youve built fromthe view of the front car as well as hear the kids screaming as you dothe triple corkscrew
again this was in sim theme park and nothingmuch has changed
it wouldve been nice if they added the ability toactually go into the shops or play the sideshow games
a niceimprovement to this game is you can design the coasters in advancethen place them fully formed in your park lateri still think simtheme park was revolutionary for its time but the lack of significantimprovements make me a little more critical this time around
hope myreview helpedpros  a spooky mansion with neat monsters  great graphics and fun spells that have to be used interactively
 tons of rooms and objectives cons  too often a simple thing like jumping up on something is so hard you will either be bored to death or abandon that part of the game altogether
in one place we estimated that about  of the entire mouse area resulted in a productive hit
boring
 weapons changes can be slow and cumbersome even on a gig p system with  ram and a geforce ultra mb
 too much loading everytime you went to a new room
 given the problems with weapons reloading and  jumping if you hit a complex puzzle it was very difficult to figure out exactly what you were doing wrongto best enjoy this gameget the hint book and use it frequentlyit will at least tell you whether spending an hour trying to jump on something is worth ittake a great game engine and a master of horror put them together along with some inspired soundeffects and graphics and youve got a hit right
rightmaybe not
this game had lots going for it but in the end neither the story nor the gameplay are strong enough to be worthy of the  youre considering plunking down on itthe best part of the game are the ingame cinematics that do a great job of driving the story along and giving you a carrot to chase after you get the stick too
the weapons are pretty cool and its fun having spells
unfortunately you quickly realize that only one or two of the weapons are really worth developing your skills at and most of the spells are not worth the time it takes to switch to themi give the developers kudos for an inventive ui and a good atmosphere but in the end i think i would have enjoyed a shorter game with more excitementthe good lots of gore
great story cool weapons and spells creepy atmospherethe bad extremely slow pace flat boring and lifeless visuals unforgiving difficultyi came into undying with high expectations from what ive heard of the game and they were easily brought down fast
while the game creates a scary atmosphere and the story is originalit takes forever for it to pick up and the shooting is the same thing over and over
you have plenty of neat weapons and magical powers but most of them are rendered useless
the story goes along the lines of a man named patrick who has to help and old friend out who released a curse when he was a child
you have to investigate this curse and find out what was really releasedwhile this is good and all the game takes forever to tell the story and makes you just want to stop playing for good
the graphics are bad for todays standards
using the unreal engine  the game tries to create a creepy and scary atmosphere which it pulls off but in the end brought down due to its poor graphics
while there are older games that have good graphics even for today undyings are just lifeless flat and boring
the game is ultra gory with skeletons ripping your heart out and eating it howlers ripping your head off and eating itits a bloody sight indeed
also with the extreme difficulty it makes you want to hate this game even more
ammo and health are scarce even on the easy settingthis was of course when ea had balls and released games such as thrill kill american mcgees alice and this game
if you can stomach the poor graphics and slow pace then undying is for you
if you played this game back in  then it would have been wonderfuli wanted to like this game because i am a huge campc fan but this games quothousesquot are not well balanced
the harkonen are pretty cool and have fast units at a decent price but their turrets which is typically a flame thrower are not very good and get picked off by the simplest ranged attack units
the atreis have much stronger units and cost more but they are so slow that smaller quicker units run circles around them before they can target
the ordos have the best balance but since the harkonen can build up faster the ordos get run over
and the air units for any of the houses stinkthe landscape is bland also
theres nothing to the landscape at all
just a bunch orangish colored ground with a darker orange color that is the spice you have to harvest and a bunch  of brown areas where you can build
not very pretty at allbut not all is bad
in those orange areas where you cant build are sand worms that attack from time although it seems like they spent alot of time destroying my spice harvesters all of the time to time
plus you have tornadoes that do some damage to your buildings but can sweep away your infantry units rather quickly
the tornadoes look pretty cool
and the units and buildings have decent detail
and last the cut scenes are very well done though the story and your mission dont make alot of sense
plus you get dune  with this though this wasnt rated very well and rightfully sothis game definitley needed more work as evident by the poor sales
this was first and probably last its hard to pass up on a westwood game trip to the dune universecampcgenerals anyonedont let the title fool you
yes i liked this game
it just seemed like it was missing something
it doesnt have a very good story to go with it
also the battles seem somehow detatched
no real emotion to them
before you seemed to be a part of it
now you can scroll out to see more of the battlefield but its more like scrolling away from drama
i just didnt feel like part of the game anymorewould i still buy it again
yes
i still love all of these types of games
the graphics are great but i am usually looking at the map from so high up just so i can see the battlefield that i dont really get the benift of them
could have used some more types of units
you play on the same maps again and again
that gets a little annoying
i cant wait until more come outafter having read this description and seeing a gameplay video i am very disappointed at this game
it calls itself dune but so much is incorrect about it
the actual game itself is a prettier version of red alert  which was excellent
i guess if you want that cozy feeling that you are playing a dune game not pretending you are than you should get this game
i find the faster paced strategy games to get rather obsolete faster how ironic
spice takes a long time to get a full load as demonstrated in dune ii but the faster the mining is the more unrealistic it gets
your best bet is to find another strategy game but if you want dune than you can get thisi like a lot of westwoods work especially dunethemed stuff but i wish theyd focus a bit more on ai for once
with decent ai this game could easily have been worth  or  stars
ai
in rts games in general really needs a breakthrough soon but in emperor its just too lacking
come onits  lets start seeing some intelligent computer opposition westwooda decent game but could and should have been so much moreobviously i havent played the expansion yet
i just want to let ea know that im more than a bit upset that theyre bundling the original game with the expansion and charging us shogun fans full price
i love the original but im offended by them trying to make me buy it twicelet me start out by saying the graphics in this game are really incredible but the thing that haunts this myst and the other mysts are that fact that they are to hard
i bought riven or myst ii and quit after a few days
the puzzles just get to weird
the same applies for myst iii
there is so much stuff you could do with each puzzle and they are so weird that you can spend an eternity doing one puzzle
they made the myst games so they can make people buy game guides for them so both companies are happy
i would have never beat myst if i did not buy a book for it
myst iii screams out buy a book because its so difficultexile was a lot of fun and is better than most other adventure games but doesnt live up to the standards set by myst or riventhe good the interface
much better than myst or riven
much more imersive
fun to look around localized puzzles
dont have to trek back and forth endlessly between locations to solve puzzles acting the bad guy is good graphics and animations
not all good but some very cool looking stuffthe bad to easy
this game seems to have been dumbed down quite a bit
maybe i am just getting better at myst type games but i think the puzzles were too easy acting atrus  bad short and small the game as a whole and the ages levels felt smallthe ugly costumes and props
some were ok but a lot looked pretty cheesey especially the clearly plastic fred flinstonesque hammer wielded by saavedro in the last level  his outfit was pretty bad on that level also graphics
ok some graphics were great all the cg animations were impressive but there was some pretty ugly stuff toofinal thoughtsbuy this game anyway especially if you played previous games  just manage your expectations and have fun with it
if there was no myst or riven i would give this game  stars because it is clearly superior to any other adventure game out there todayeight years after the original masterpiece in  but it just didnt have enough to hold my interest for very longit starts out well with the quicktime integrated movies and beautiful artwork compelling storyline revolving around a man whos novels are actually mystic links to other quotagesquot just as the previous two games
but myst iii is nothing new albeit probably an improvement over rivenwhich isnt saying a whole lot
riven was too lengthy and cryptic regarding the puzzles to enjoy in my opinionexile did a good job of adding to the myst series it actually is an enjoyable adventure game
dont listen to the pretentious people out there who call themselves quotgamersquot and steer you away from it if you liked the original
its just that the awe of myst has worn off after so many new steps in technologyand newer d games that blow it away in terms of its engineering and multimedia immersion since but i commend ubi soft for not putting out a complete piece of garbage just to make some money off of the franchise name which they couldve easily done
instead theyve made an enjoyable adventure game thats very fantastical and immersivei have a dell system with mhz celeron mb of ram an ati rage mb graphics accellerator integrated on the motherboard and win  st ed
i did the full install of myst  to my hard drivei had no problems with the installation and the game runs fine
i did notice however that the game runs pathetically slow in directd mode hardware accelleration on
the graphics are beautiful but the panning creeps along at a snails pace  too slowly to really be able to play the gameswitching to software rendering mode speeds things up significantly but at the expense of graphics quality
it seems the software mode leaves out a lot of textures and details that really help with the graphics clarity
i found i had a hard time navigating in the software rendered mode
its kind of like walking around without your glasses on if youre near sighted
the images are a bit blurry and i tended to lose my orientation easily did i already go up this hill
the response is good enough in software mode to play the game but you miss out on too many visual details to really enjoy it especially after seeing what things could look like while running in directd modeso unfortunately if you have a quotlower endquot system like mine you have to choose between game speed and graphics quality
i imagine if you have a faster processor gt mhz and a decent graphics card the game is probably outstanding
im enjoying the game but feel like im missing out on the full experience by not being able to run with the hardware graphics accellerationthis game is an old dos based game the graphics are terrible the charechters are flat and the resolution is stuck in x
i dont know how the sound is because it wont work with my windows me sound card driver
the game play is not that bad and the levels are interesting but the lousy graphics serve to somewhat ruin this
this isnt a bad game its just not as good as some of the other fpss out theredark forces or as fans say df was the prequel to star wars jedi knight jk the game which lucasarts and raven software expect to follow up this spring with star wars jedi outcast
though all of these games fit the socalled first person shooter category the difference in time is marked by the relative advances in graphics sound and overall gameplay
unfortunately because df is the oldest these weaknesses are most obvious in that game
df introduces the character of kyle katarn a former imperial commando who went solo rather than torture captured rebel spy jan ors
not entirely won over by the rebel cause katarn nevertheless carries out certain highpriority lowprofile missions that require him to sneak and shoot actually run and blast his way into highly fortified areas
in the opening mission kyle breaks into an imperial fortress to steal plans for the first death star allowing princess leia to obtain them on her way home to alderaan
the meat of the story that forms the rest of the game has kyle tracking down a new imperial weapon  the dark trooper a sort of souped up version of the regular stromtroopers whove been dropping like flies since may of   when a rebel outpost is mysteriously wiped out kyle goes in to investigate
further levels send kyle to other planets  ice planets completely urbanized planets coruscsant is a stop planets that appear to be all cliffs and one planet where you spend a lot of time floating in a sewer anoat which i think was the planet that han and leia decided not to go to in empire despite what happened in bespin it was still a wise choice
you also travel to nar shadaa the floating city get captured by jaba the hutt you escape but not with your weapons and slink around various spaceships
the story doesnt carry that well into the game  if not for cutscenes and mission briefs you wouldnt know what the point of all the shooting was
the missions themselves seem hodgepodge you go to various planets to get clues about the new weapon and where it can be located but little else links one level to another but come together to form a more cohesive story by the end the final levels are more closely linked hinting of the climax
though a shooter df is also a puzzle game requiring you to drop your blaster and think for a moment the power to destroy a wave of stormtrooper is nothing compared to the power youll need to reach the center of the maze they were guardingtime hasnt been kind to this game and anybody raised on the likes of quake  or dfs own sequel jk will likely be appalled by its lowend graphics this game is circa  and has a minimum hardware req
of a 
and midi sound which is similarly unkind to john williams famous music
what really kills it is how the game simulate the firstperson perspective  there are separate controls for turning kyles head sideways and for looking up and down
that is problematic enough when having to deal with dangers above probe droids and mindprobe droids and below the sewer monsters
combine that with the artificial feeling of kyles movements and youll feel like youre seeing the world less through his eyes and more through the windshield of a car hes driving sustained gameplay reportedly induces nausea
nevertheless the thinkingshooters aspect of the game is more than enough to warrant a shot at this premodern game
those who complete the game and tire of its levels can download thirdparty levels designed by fans as well as mods you can play boba fett
if you are stuck with something lower than a  mhz pentium and will do anything short of buying one to get the star wars experience this may be the game for youa fun version of the star wars saga
a great side story you are involved in when you find yourself in the middle of a secret base from the dark side of the force
all around fun game to playi enjoyed this game quite a bit  good story line and characters mostly logical puzzles with a bit of action thown in for good measure
figure on no more than two or three evenings though  it goes very fast good thing its inexpensivehowever the game was made back in  and in computer software years thats the stone age
despite the fact that the game now boasts that its for windows its really just the old dosbased game with clunky graphics and outdated interface
i ran it on my windows me and it ran okay except for some intermittant sound card problems
lt play it and if nothing else youll really appreciate todays gaming technologytie fighter was a great space simulator when it was released  cool graphics descent missions great controls and lots of vehicles to choose from
the story line that connected missions is also goodhowever it is an old game
the high res mode is x
if you are not buying this game for its nostagia value i think that you will be disappointed by the dated graphics and sound if you compare it to other more recent releasesif you are looking for a star wars themed game at discount prices you may find rogue squadron or starfighter naboo as little more upto date optionsi know im going to garner some criticism with this review but hey reviews are for giving your opinion
first off this stick is a snap to install taking no time at all
id recommend leaving out the gaming extensions stuff though i havent found it very useful
its relatively easy to configure the buttons although sometimes ive found the new setups failed to load up when i started a game small problem the sticks default settings are pretty standard
saitek hit on a good idea to make this stick customizable especially because im a lefty and its pretty cool to fly with my left hand although i still stick to the right ive been doing it for so long
its also convenient to be able to adjust the stick so it fits into my hand
i find most controllers to be too small but with a twist of the allen wrench and a little adjustement this thing fit like a glove
the only problem with the stick is the quality of construction
the thing just feels cheap
the small rubber pads on the base allow the stick to slip and the base isnt heavy enough to withstand violent changes of direction without tilting
the trigger feels cheap and its pretty easy to fire without meaning to so keep your finger off it unless youre ready to blast away
well i think i covered just about everything i wanted to
all in all its a pretty good stick for under  but if youre a little more active in your gaming id go for a little heavier hardwarei wont deny it i had pretty low expectations coming into this game
lets face it there hasnt been a good teamfightingaction adventure game since games like river city ransom double dragon and even streets of rage but i have to admit this game wasnt all that badthe graphics were decent
nothing really jumps out and goes dang thats cool
the gameplay is pretty straight forward you pick your character you fight bad guys and the fights are pretty simple
none of the enemies i faced were astoundingly difficult or completely dead weight opponents that you could give a love tap with your index finger and their head would explodethe only thing that really bothered me about this game is that it was too vast in its story and i couldnt follow it
either i was bored with the story or i was just interested in handing out the smackdowns
but anyway fair game
give it a shot
have funthis is a weird game
i bought it even though i heard it really wasnt worth buying and i am still on the fence with that in my own headthe graphics are just amazing but its squaresoft so that is expected
its definitely the best graphics yet on the ps that i have seen
the storyline is pretty good the more i play it the more i get into itthe reason though it only gets  stars from me is that there is a lack of gameplay in it
its a lot of movies and very little fighting
and when you do fight the controls are extremely easy but the camera blows
there are quite a few times that the camera is facing you and the enemies are behind the camera you have to stumble blindly into them at timesif and when the game goes down in price i recommend it but if you are looking for a fighter with a lot of replay value get doa or tekken tag if not just for the bowling gamebouncer is and old concepted boxed up in newer graphics
if you like side scrolling fightingaction games this one is for you
its got good graphics but they can be a little fuzzy at times
the fmvs are great but that is what the game mostly is
you fight for a little while and then a long fmv comes on then you fight a little bit more
usually no more than  characters at a time
one cool effect is the quottrinity rushquot which allows all three characters to jump one enemy
each character has their own trinity rush and theyre all pretty devestating
good game to borrow from a friend or rent
not a must buywhen i first picked up a copy of bouncer i was astounded by its graphics
unlike most games that i have played for any system save wing commander the games are designed around an intensive combination of button mashing and timing
the bouncer on the other hand relies on plot and superb graphics
this game could easily have been released as an anime with no playability to speak of
as it is it is almost this without any real changes
the game plot is a single linear plot starting three main characters that are pulled into a search to try and rescue a mutual friend
as the game continues you are able to select between which of the three you wish to play
each character has their own fighting style power levels and story lines
dont discount one because they are weaker than the other it is easy to purchase increased abilities and new techniques to level the playing fieldas for control and playability this game is developed around a threebutton attack system with the strength that you press the button down determining the force that your character puts behind each attack
it takes a while to get used to and doesnt serve any real purpose but is fun to play with
also remember to use the analogue controller to move around otherwise you wont be able to runi would recommend this game for anyone that is interested in watching a movie and would suggest that others be hesitant
there is very little playability to the game and reacts very similarly to double dragon for the nintendo but with better graphics
a great game to play but with such a short time line to follow and few tracks to follow the game could only keep me interested for a day so its probably best to rent itmy kids ordeded this off my page dont know what it is so dont no wat to tell you about itlet me start off by saying this games story in my opinion is kind of stupid
the graphics are great just like every other ps game but theres not to much to this game
i mean i understand that its a fighting game and all but all you do is fight
it loads up the next level and you beat up about five or six guys and then it loads up the next level
meanwhile your character stats are increasing
the only real challenge i got was from the boss of the game duragon and that was because hes cheap
the game did however have a pretty decent multiplayer mode
when my friends and i got together and played we had a lot of fun and that is why i gave it three stars instead of one
the fact that is extremely short doesnt help either
personally i wouldnt reccomend buying this game with out first renting itits fun beating people and robots up but there are only about ten different enemies total
some of the bosses seemed hard to me but im not used to this kind of game
even though i was slow it only took me a couple hours to beat this
i was surprised when it ended because it was so short
not much of a world to explore either
nice scenes and there are cool moves but i dont know if you have time to learn them all
read the manual too
it gives no explanations in the game although youll still figure it out
this is definitely a game to rent and not buy unless you can buy it for very cheapthe graphics controls characters sound effects  the whole plot and way of beating the game and fighting all the people is excellent fun
the  stars missing are for me beating it in  hoursmaybe  
you cannot spend  bucks on a game and beat it in  hours and get you moneys worth of playing
you can keep improving the grade of your  guys and get them to and s grade which adds on playing time but is very boring
when you go through the second time it is always the exact same thing accept for a different path and story for each characteroverall not worth  bucks to buynot even close but worth a  rental
i have to end this review by calling it a good game
thats all i got to saythis product like the others is great as a plug in and play device
but how it is tightened to a surface is not perfect
it still allows the device to slip around forward or back and does not sit level on a level table
overall though it works for what i need it forthis yoke works great with microsoft flight simulator and other flight simulators
installation is painlessjust plug in the usb connector and install the driver
the buttons and switches on the yoke are automatically mapped to various functions in ms flight simulator no configuration necessary such as changing the view
without pressing a key you can change the view from inside the aircraft cabin to a d chase view or looking up at you aircraft from the tower which a flick of your thumbthis yoke even has a small plastic wheel that even acts like a trim wheelhowever it feels like what it is a plastic yoke
the thickness of my desk wasnt thick enough so i had to use a book or two to get the clamps to firmly grip my desk and even then it wasnt totally stable
also unlike a real airplane yoke you can pull back or push forward and it wont totally return to neutral
this may be a problem with the software but i was disappointed
i had high expectations because of the high price that simply werent metwhen i first hear about megaman extreme i ordered it i get the game a friday in i played about  hours the saturday i did play  hour and the sunday  hour and guess what
well the game was finished i dont really think it is as dificult as too many people says cuz i get everything in the game  including the street fighter moves  and it wasnt dificult at all
well  the game is cool and good graphics good sound but personally i would like games more dificult or at least long enought to play them for more than a simple weekend
if u like the megaman series get the game but dont expect a game dificult just expect another megaman
an easy one and with some stages that u played  before in other megaman titlesyou will need hours and hours to have fun in this game
do not make the mistake of thinking you will play and do well from the get go
this game is wicked hard
the concept is great
yahoo an offroad wheeler game with jumps and tricks
unfortunately the execution is tough
it is good
truly it is
but most gamers will never make it over the learning curve
by that time they will have given up in disgust thinking the developer of this game just made the game too hard
rightfully so
we play games to have fun
not spend our entire life learning to play a game the right way
note to developer start fun and move to hard and rewardingbottom line  is this game fun
yes after you have given up on having any good relationships in your life due to over playing offroad
will i keep this game nope
this game is for losers that want to spent too much time on games
will this game retain its resale value
you bet
everyone will fall for the idea of a fun extreme racer with tricks and jumps
everyone will think they are just a better gamer so they can handle it
good luck
ill be playing a game that is fun from the starti really have mixed feelings on that game
first i tried the training mode
it took a while to do a good preload but i finally got it
then i had to do tricks and i decided that the training was over and that i would try my chance at the championship
surprisingly on the easy setting i won almost all the races and got the gold cup on all the tournamentsi really liked the various kind of vehicles that i could drive
for me the best race setting was the rally mode
however it was annoying when i got off the track and then i had a three seconds warning to get back on the track and when i did so the game restarted me anywayso i realized that to get the snowmobile tournament i had to win some tournaments on pro level
maybe it is just me but i found out that it was too much aggravation
so i had about  hours of fun with that gamethe graphics were very good and the music is also excellent
you can add or delete songs in the options menu
also cards are awarded after some winnings and you use those to get extra partsi did not use the track editor but i can see how that adds to the replay valueif you see that game in a bargain bin somewhere below  you could buy it and have some fun for your moneywhen it comes down to it heart of winter is just a bit more of the same of icewind dale
it is about  as long as the original icewind dale
a lot of reviewers are saying that is too short
however seeing as how the plots of icewind dale and heart of winter are kind of weak anyway i dont see that as a big losswhat few new features there are supposed to be didnt really add much in my opinion
the new weapons and new spells dont seem to do much that the weapons and spells in icewind dale didnt do
the best part about the game i thought was the final battle
i found it to be more challenging than anything in the original icewind dalewhether to buy this game depends upon whether you think that the price is low enough to pay for ityes as most reviewers have noted heart of winter isnt a very long game though its not as brief as some would make it out to be
and yes for those who bought this title when it first came out and paid the full sticker price  bucks i can understand the frustration voiced by so many gamersnow however about a year after heart of winter first appeared the price has dropped to bargain bin status i bought how at my local mall for ten bucks
for this price how doesnt disappoint
the game is on the shorter side but id say its the equivalent of   levels from the original icewind dale
or for those who prefer to measure their games in hours how took me exactly one week to finish approximately  hours
those who have already played baldurs gate ii will be familiar to the additions found in how higher resolution dropaway interface gem bags potion bags scroll cases
there are some new enemies new spells and a final battle that is fairly challenginglastly most icewind dale fans know that for those who own heart of winter there is a free downloadable expansion trials of the luremaster which adds another  hours of gameplay
in other words the time to buy the icewind dale expansion is now youll essentially receive  hours of gameplay for in my case ten dollars or so
you cant beat thatas for the game itself how is mostly enjoyable
the enemies overall are much tougher so you wont be able to mow through them like you did throughout icewind dale
also although you need th level characters or higher to play the expansion i recommend not playing how until your characters have hit the maximum hit point level allowed by the original 
my only complaint about how is that its really linear
sure icewind dale was linear too but how forces you to literally trudge forward along say an icy cave path and smite the hordes of baddies that pop up and there are a lot of them
and because the enemies are significantly tougher than most of the creatures in id the expansion at times can seem tedious you feel as if youre logging in tiresome hours at the keyboard rather than enjoyable hoursstill for those who didnt satisfy their crave at the end of icewind dale heart of winter and trials of the luremaster should provide a decent fixif this expansion were  cheaper i would go up a star
the fixes to the original engine were outstanding
if you havent already played icewind dale and are playing it for the first time with the expansion youll get a lot more for your money
for those who already completed id
and are hungry for more i dont think this will calm your hunger
its more like a snack than a meal
the bonus missions were a lot of fun but were brief and simple
at least one extra long term quest would have been appreciated after shelling out my money
my advice wait for the price to go downthe expansion was really fun icewind dale was great heart of winter was interesting except that it was incredibly short
they set the experience caps to level  and playing on hard mode i took my level s and s imported to level  i beat the game in  hours
it would take ages to get to 
 expits good but extremely short
if you want something more satisfing baldurs gate  is pretty good
pretty longsometimes you get what you hope for and sometimes you dont
this addon to icewind dale from interplay is simply too little too late
the story line is extremely short
as barbarians mass to attack the tiny town of lonelywood our heroes are approached by a barbarian shaman to intervene somehow and save both sides from disaster
a short investigation in lonelywood and a meeting with the barbarian chief leave you basically clueless and in severe disfavor
the rest of the story is primarily composed of hacking your way across one desolate scene or another in your effort to resolve the mystery
which after several not quite titanic battles you finally do
all in all about  hours of gameplay at the mostperhaps the best parts of the addin are the improvements it makes to icewind dale overall
the x resolution and improved d acceleration are beneficial
there are  new spells to master and a bunch of new items
best of all you can take your characters up to the th levelthe short storyline i found singularly dissatisfying
not so much due to weakness but due to the fact that there was material in it for a full sized game with perhaps a more uplifting ending
for to tell the truth the villain of the piece is by far the most interesting character
it was with some regret that i won the final battle  if you havent played icewind dale i suggest waiting to see what kind of combination deal interplay offers
if you have already played the original game and dont want to replay it then you may find heart of winter a disappointmentthe game is good if you wanna play pokemon goldsilver on the tv and the battles are ok but they get very repetitivemany years ago i played a cool demo called die by the sword
it had an awesome interface where your mouse would control your right arm
which mean in order to swing your sword you would have to swing the mouse
it was very accurate
i remeber gettign caught up in a leg snare and having to swing it up towards the ceiling to cut the rope
well i few times i was off and cut my own leg offabout  years ago i bought this game because it was rumoured to be similiar to die by the sword
but i returned the game because my computer then was a bit to slow and i didnt like the frame rate for the level of graphics i wanted
but i bult a new computer and asked for the game for xmasso now the game runs smooth and has very nice graphics
a little dated but very crisp
no complaints with the sound either
mood music is very affectivebut my dissapointment is that the mouse interface is removed and its down by pressing a direction key and attack
sadnonethless the battles are still won by skill not button mashing which saves this game some starsa huge variety of weapons to use makes it very entertaining
plus as people said before the enviroment is very interactive
beat someone up with a chair an arm anything you can pick upa careless  overlook though is when you swing a club it temporary turns into a sword through the swing  well that sucks it doesnt cut like a sword though thank goodnessanyway after i get more fight experience and become more skilled in the art of combat i will write the second part and see if my disapointment for the mouse interface is overcome
dont get my wrong you can still accurately cut off an arm or leg but never as accurate as the mouse controlanyway for now its a   stay tooned for part with four characters to choose from and many levels to explore blade of darkness is graphically one of the best games out right now with lighting effect the torch shadows are amazing interactive environments and water reflections
also its got good sound and everything sounds like quotreal lifequot  butit falls flat on its face when it comes to controlling your character
in some levels there is a lot of catwalks andor platforms to jump onto and having an extremely tight control makes it so the character changes direction with the slightest touch of the mouse or keyboard which makes precise movements all but impossible
plus if your foot misses a ledge by  pixels you will slip and fall to your deathin blade of darkness you melee opponents with swords axes etc
this is the heart of the game and the idea is great and the attacks look great but it will frustrate you at some point in the game
here are some of the biggest annoyances  if you push the attack button too many times youll just stand there swinging at air while the opponent steps to the side and slashes your back
if you move your mouse too fast your character will not turn with an intellimouse explorer at least
if you dodge too many times youll actually go back in front of your opponent
there are combo swings and attacks but those are not worth the aggravation because of the precise timing required to pull them off and even if you can the opponents block the attacks anyway
if you swing when youre next to or even near a wall you will hit the wall and the rest of the swing does no damage which can be especially annoying in narrow corridors
and sometimes even when you are out of the opponents range or swing it will still hit you
must be a shockwave or something
another thing is that at later levels the opponents will have rediculously high amounts of hit points and it takes a very long time to wear them down
of course when they do  damage to you with each swing and you have only around  hit points it can get especially frustrating
i very nearly uninstalled the game when i kept getting killed because this one opponent i was fighting apparently had an extendable sword because no matter how much i dodge or blocked it always hit mefor graphics and sound i give this game five stars but the extremely frustrating controls earn it a one star for that part of the game so overall i give blade of darkness three starsthis is exactly the type of game that i enjoy playing
and for the first couple of weeks i really did enjoy it
but after that the amount of fighting necessary to do anything started to grate
essentially you have to fight huge groups of ridiculously powerful enemies every time you go anywhere
in all playing several hours every day it took me almost two months to finish the game
on one hand thats just too much effort
on the other hand i certainly got my moneys worth out of the game
fighting might not have been that bad if the game didnt constantly examine your partys stats and up the level of the attackers so that they were always better
i also became frustrated with the leveling aspect of the game
like most games like this every level takes more points to get to than the previous level
but this game is ridiculous
by the end my people were something like level  after two months remember
it was taking tens of millions of points to level up
sure you can practice to up your performance
but theres more satisfaction to going through a level
also theres no way anyone can get through this game without reading hints around the internet
some of the things necessary to solve some of the situations are in no way obvious even after reading the hints
for the most part i did enjoy the game
but it was extremely frustrating tooi think wiz  is a good game if you are a fan of the wiz series and have played the other games
if you are new you will indeed not get what all the fuss is abouti can understand that it would be hard to jump into wiz  and be excited by it
it does on the surface interact a whole lot like mampm the graphics are ok but nothing special or new
the story line is ok but you appreciate it much more if you played bane savantetcthis game will be loved by wiz fans like me that waited years for the next and sadly final chapter in this series
but if you are new to the wizardry story line werent even alive when wiz i came out or think that games like final fantasy are examples of an rpgyou are too young and spoiled by technological advances to appreciate this game and the rest of us are too old and reflected to see its flawsi am a huge fan of the baldurs gate series and i have to say while the game is a very fitting conclusion to the series it is probably my least favorite of the games
the game lacks much more in character development and it became more of a hack n slash type game than the previous ones
i guess in some regards there isnt much left to develop at this point though
i also think the character interactions nose dive in this game
part of the fun of bgii was the huge amount of dialouge your party had between themselves and the little stories that take place while the main story goes on
the game is also very tedious at the end
the final battle is extremely difficult and in itself can take forever to beat
the watchers keep dungeon quest idea was kind of redundant and it was just the durlags tower of the second game in my opinion
once inside it it is an interesting story by itself but it kind of has to be done randomly in the middle of the big rush to find the five which kind of takes the whole urgency out of it
if you have the platform game installed you can do watchers keep before the expansion story starts but it is practically suicide until the very end of the game at least the second half of it anyway
even then it would probably be too over the top for most partiesoverall it was a great closing to the story but i felt like i worked way too hard to get what i sort of knew was coming
i would still consider it money well spent and the entire series together gives countless hours of funlet me start off by saying that baldurs gate ii shadows of amn is the best game ive played in  years
perhaps that is why this expansion pack is a little disappointing
it was a good expansion pack but is a let down after bgsoa
the limitations of the dampd system can be seen in this game
there really isnt much to get you excited about when your characters are already of near godlike status level 
you just keep getting more and more magic abilities and magic items  making them seem almost boring and commonplace when they should be amazing and wondorous
if you loved bg then you should get this game it is fun and worth the money  but dont expect the level of fun that bg gavethrone of bhaal is the conclusion of the story begun in baldurs gate
a lot of gamers have high expectations for it unfortunately the expansion pack to baldurs gate  doesnt really satisfy those
the initial concern is that its nowhere near the  hours of gameplay discussed before the releaseid estimate i finished it in less than   its also heavily combat oriented where nonexpansion bg had a lot of opportunity for dialog and character interaction
that lack of character interation is probably the most disappointing aspect of the expansion
a large part of bgs charm was the personality shown by party members jan interjecting an absurd story viconia spewing venom or minsc talking about his hamster
these are present to some degreethere are new npcinitiated discussionsbut some of the best dialog occurred when the npc interrupted a discussion between the player and someone else in the game
there is so little dialog of that sort in the expansion that it feels empty somehow
it feels much more like tales of the sword coast the expansion to the first bg than bgprobably in large part due to the lack of dialog the story isnt fully fleshed out
it seems hurried especially the last encounter before the endgame begins
the expansion begins with all the spawn of bhaal being gathered according to prophecy and being slaughtered by their most powerful members
the conclusion is fitting but it seems undernourished
more dialog and with it more story would have made this a  star expansionthe high level character mechanics work pretty well but are much more favorable to mages and clerics than fighters
some of the new spells are devastatingly powerful but the new fighter abilities are almost unnoticeable
if you like heavy combat this should satisfy you but be warned the game sometimes slowed to a crawl in combat when i never had any trouble with bgfirst off id like to say that i honestly do like this game and i think it was worth my money
i have encountered a few bugs but nothing that would make me fling this back to the store but i know how games can be especially from interplay so i pity those who experience more severe problems
i like the semi real time mode the best
i think its the best way to go from now on in the fallout series
but if thats not your thing you can go back to the classic fallout mode or even turn based squad mode from the description it sounds like xcom though i havent actually tried it
yes enemy ai can be pretty dumb
if you just lie still for a while a lot of times the enemy will just merrily go back to their little patrol path begging to be shot down
but hey enemies werent terribly bright in the previous fallouts either
and yes they do seem to have awful hearing problems in regard to full automatic gunshots
storys a bit dry to me from what ive seen so far
maybe itll kick up a notch later on but the previous fallouts grabbed me from the getgo
not this one
also i wish there was a bit more flexibility in the missions
while there are various shades of success in each mission youre not allowed to fail
its either win or lose and losing means the end of the game even if you live
that i dont like
that said i do enjoy the game
i like the huge variety of weapons the fact that i can actually sneak up on a guy and can actually take him out with one well placed gunshot theres something deeply satisfying in getting close behind to a prone raider and blasting him with a double barrel but thats just me
the combat is great
there are all sorts of options to deal with the various situations thrown your way
do you sneak in behind your enemy and gut him with your knife
do you just rush up guns blazing
do you snipe from afar
do you toss grenades over the cover the enemys behind
should you crawl away from enemy fire or just run for it
the flexibility in combat is unsurpassed
basically it boils down to whether you like a good yarn or a good round of war
for a good yarn play the previous fallouts
for a good strategic fight this could be good for a few late nightswell i also was quite worried what this new fallout would be like when i heard about it
it definitely is not a true fallout sequel but it is a nice little diversion in the fallout universe
there are many different settings that will appeal to either the turnbased or realtime players
perks and skill points are also used when upgrading your character so fans of the first two will feel right at home here
if you enjoyed the first two fallout games you should at least give this a chance
you may find that you will enjoy it more than you thought you wouldafter having played megaman x i really had high expectation for this game megaman x
while most of the gameplay is intact the presentation of the game is not
one of the most entertaining aspects of the previous x game was watching the animated clips  even the voices that were in the game itself
in this release the only voice that you hear is the one that says ready as you begin
beyond that theres no voices from zero or x in the last game when the characters would jump get hit die or be close to death theyd either grunt say something when they were close to dying or make some kind of sound while attacking or jumping
those voices are completely missingone of the more annoying aspects of the game are the cutscenes  when alia talks to you in midstage
again there are no voices so you have to alwyas read everything  the scrolling of the text was too slow
in some instances theres no music during those sceneson the up side this game is fun
i like the fact that after so many years they finally give zero  x the ability to duck  perform ducking attacks
you can also choose your character between stages instead of having to pick just one character for the entire game
they also included different types of armor that you can selectoverall this is a fun game but if youve played megaman x dont set your expectation quite as high for this game
if youre a fan of the megaman series youll still enjoy it
i give it  stars for fun   stars as an overall ratingafter playing the great x i was expecting another great addition to the series but sadly i didnt get it
dont get me wrong its a decent game but not up to par with many of the others in the seriesgameplay the control is basically the same as x read my review  of that one if you want the whole deal with that part of the game
it does add in a few things like zeros gun the ability to duck and a few other minor upgradesthe levels here are what really disappointed me
i mean you get some quality megaman ones here but then you get some pretty lame ones too
ive never been a fan of the ones you have to ride a carlike vehicle through and then theres the water one which i dont like either
add in a couple of other boring levels and overall its not so good
there are a few bright spots here though like the train and volcano levels
with a couple of other pretty good ones as wellthe bosses have always been a favorite part of the megaman games for me
x has some of the best looking ones ive seen in the series but they invole no strategy to beat whatsoever
they basically just have you jumping around hacking and slashing at them until they die
no challenger here either they die pretty easily with a couple of exceptions
atleast in x like slash beast for example you had to slide or jump to avoid the green waves slide under his lunging attacks jump on the walls when he charges you but most if not all of the bosses here in x contain none of that sort of thingabilities are nice in this game
you get the usual stuff seen in past games and the chance to boost up your life and weapon power up
depending on the level of the boss you just defeated
overall i like the way they handled this and it helps make the game overcome the bad parts a littlei take off the  points for the pooraverage levels but its not really low because theres still four good fun levels
i took off a little more because of alia
she is the most annoying character ever interrupting you a couple times a level with the annoying stuff
bad idea on putting her blabber mouth in the game capcom
she does have some useful advice but id rather discover it on my own since when does the experienced xzero need advice
then theres the weak unimaginitive bosses
just very poorly done in this game but they do look really cool
im being a little generous here i could have easily taken off even more pointsreplay value the replay value takes a big drop off from x
theres no different scenarios for each character since you select whatever one you want for whatever level the levels themselves are lacking and overall its just not up to par in the fun department
making it not very good in the replay value either
hardcore megaman fans will probably play it more than once thats the reason for the decent score but its not very good for the average fan
i will play through it a couple times thats just because i am becoming a pretty big fan of these gamesmusic this is a strong point in the game
the introduction is just brilliant a slow melody starts and then it roars into a speedy guitarish song
i love it
the level music is well done as well
good stuff all around
not much to really say here but you should enjoy itgraphics the usual megaman stuff is here
very nice looking d graphics
the level that impressed me the most was the jungle level
it was very cool
really just some great graphics through out the whole game
if you played a psx megaman game before you know what to expect
if youre a fan of the d look like me you will love itoverallnot an average from reading this review it might seem that i dont like this game that much but really it has some good things going for it
i was disappointed by the weak unimaginite bosses and some really lame levels the most but if you can look past the bad then you will find some really good stuff here and some new stuff that hasnt been seen in the series
you might even like the levels i hated making it an even better game for you
dont pass this up if youre a megman fan or just a fan of good action games
at this price you cant pass it upnote if i could i would give the game  and  stars but amazon doesnt allow thatafter mega man x debuted for the psx back in  well there is a sega saturn version too haha i though i had played the best installment the x series had to offer
so when the sequel came out a mere two to three years later in  i had high expectations
unfortunately the game only delivered an above average experencegameplay wise all the elements that make up a mega man game are present select a stage beat boss gain weapon take on the next boss rinse lather and repeat
while this is all well and good and what us mega man fans crave x includes is share of problems
most of the boss enemies are extreme pushovers as most dont even require any specific strategy hence you dont even really need to use the weapon they are weak against
add to this fact zero can almost crush the entire game with a single attack makes for somewhat shallow gameplay
the boss enemies also have really dumb names if you know your music youll realize each maverick takes its name from the original members oncegreat band guns n roses
why capcom ditched the tired and true abilityanimal names and went with this stupid band member theme is beyond mexs story is the games highlight
still i dont know why capcom didnt choose make use of fmvs like in x to tell the story obviously money was an issue here
instead we get lame still shots and text telling the story
as far as xs story climbs there are some serious holes that hold it back
add to this that mega man x ends up ruining any successful logical and believable continuation of xs story and you realize things are not so well in mega man landoverall x is good game and a worthy addition to the series
still the fact that this game marks the point where capcom got sloppy with the series will ultimately put mega man x near the end of most mega man fan favorite games listsits too easy
the game was designed with younger players in mind
doesnt follow the x series format and goes for more of a  regular mega man game look
its fun and all but it puts mega man games to shame
ive been playing mega man for  years and this is the first time i have ever wanted to complain to capcom about a mega man game
oh yeah and the plot is stupid and pointless
no cool cut scenes
in short big let down for hardcore mega man fans
dont waste your money
but you probably wount listen to me anyway
wait for x to come out soon it should be totally coolmega man x
part five of seven
note i appologize for writing such a long review but i must address the features for both casual and hardcore mm fans
in a new millenia of gaming its very hard to come by any new oldschool sidescrolling action games
few companies pay attention to the gaming roots and even fewer companies actually still make oldschool games
but alas capcom has heeded our desperate calls in the form of a sequel to x
first of all look at the year  yikes
it took four long years for capcom to release x
i remember it seeming like eternity waiting for this anticipated sequel
just after i gave up hope this game came right out of nowhere
does it live up to the previous x games
lets seeprosthe ability to switch between characters at the stage select screen
this is a great addition because the gameplay never gets monotonous from using one character too muchthere are now  different armors to collect
probably the best new feature on here because it gives you more secrets to find and the two falcon and gaea armors vary in gameplay abilities
for instance you can move easier and fly around with the falcon armor but you sacrifice firepower
and with the gaea armor you can walk on spikes but your weapons and easy mobility are taken away from youthe secret heart tanks and armor capsule locations are well hidden this time not like x where they are all laying out in front of you
you actually have to look around and use a bit of strategy to obtain some itemsthe action is still pretty intense in some places especially when the difficulty is set on extreme
the one boss i actually found original was duff mcwhalen where you had to go around his ice blocks to get to him
cool ideaof all the x games i like the final stages of x the most
theyre probably the best part of x because not only are the background graphics superb and the music good here but the levels are tough and the gameplay is never interrupted at allsee belowthe ability to duck adds a little bit of defense strategy in dodging
also now you cannot shoot through wallsconsokay i must address this issue there was no need for alia to constantly stop the gameplay to tell you what to do
she does this every ten feet or so that you walk
this feature comes across as extremely annoying and alone nearly ruins the game
and the worst part
you cant even turn the feature off
this is inexcusable
it really only caters to beginners who have never even played a video game before
if i come across a minipuzzle or a tough section i want to figure it out myself
honestly capcom how many people dont know that spikes can kill you in one hitno anime cutscenes
why
i know the voice acting would be horrible but its better than constantly scrolling through text
shame on you capcom for introducing that in x and then taking it away
also the music takes a downgrade
now most of it is poptechno instead of the incredible rock found in x
nothing really stands out except for a couple of stage tunesthe countdown feature pretty much eliminates the take your time beating the stages strategy
getting the good ending requires you to play through stages in an exact order so that a certain  of hours are left for the rocket to detonate the stationalthough there are more armors here you cant use any part of them until they are completecompared to the bosses in earlier x games these bosses are complete pushovers
you dont even need any of the other weapons to beat them
some bosses like grizzly slash are just pitiful
also there was no need to give the bosses guns n roses nicknames
stay with the series here capcomthe story here seems consistent at first with the idea of x and zero battling finally brought to life after being talked about for several x games but then it falls apart toward the end
zero is supposed to die and does and then bringing him back in x really screwed things up but the battle between x and zero seemed a little
anticlimaticthe stage ideas themselves although a less linear were recycled from x such as the moving cars lava stage space stage etc
fighting the whale miniboss repeateatly everytime you return to the stage gets annoyingdynamo was really a waste of time hereabove all the game as a whole is way too easyalthough x is perhaps the worst of the six x games it ends up being a fair game that is overshadowed with many flaws
dont skip this game but dont let this be the first one you play either as it could leave a bad first impression of the series
 stars for being a decent game but  star is docked for inexcusable flaws
not a terrible game but a disappointment after waiting so long for it to come out
will the next game improve over this one

 this is a good way to keep the relationship between you and your friendsthese objects are really fun but i definately prefer livin large and hot date to house party
if you really want these objects i would suggest downloading variations from the netstick to pcs
it was a nice try but this game just fell short way short
the level graphics themselves and the guns appearences were pretty good but the shots hitting the walls and or people looked like something out of the original duke nukem
gameplay was a bit too fast for my liking and the game was but a shadow of its original self
i was used to the guy w the railgun running maps but now w the difficult controls and speed its the guy who can pump the most lead into a room
this game was just short
i liked fighting that annoying guy who says quotexcellentquot during the game and the levelgun graphics brought it up a little
dont bother renting it just stick w the pc versioni do agree this game is very fun
but i hate the controlls
trying to straf becomes a art of finger flixablity
the level of difficulty is very nice and the multiplayer modes kick behind
this game is probably the second best shooter on ps the fisrt duh red factionobviously the loading times are quite long and it is very annoying but thats not this games only flawfirst person shooters have always been my favorite genre of games but this one just doesnt get me going
the graphics really arent what they should be especially the differant charactors and there is just nothing there to keep you and your friends there for long
one of its better qualities is its speed
it does move pretty fast and its easy to learn the controls
however with other fps games out there that do a better job of this same type of thingunrealtimesplitters there is no reason to buy this game or even rent it for that matterafter playing dracula the ressurection i was excited to see that there was gonna be another one
dracula  didnt quite live up to what i was expecting
the graphics for the most part were still solid but some of them were pretty crappyhere are some of the pros for me this game was harder and more challenging
a good story
cool cut scenes
much cooler puzzlesnow the cons in the first game most all of the puzzles were like things you could do in real life
in this one alot of them mad no sense at all
tedious gameplay
you had to do many of these puzzles over and over
the sound
the monsters sounded the same
and the sound they had they sounded like a cat with a hairball
very badbut the overall play was very good and there are many places to explore and many fun puzzles to solve
if you got the first dracula game then this is a musti gotta say there are some things i miss about k after playing k
while the addition of defense improves the game immensely and overall the game plays better than k did this new version has many hallmarks of a game that was rushed into productionfirst off where are the amazing graphics
the graphics are definitely a step backward from wsbk while the pitchers and batters have somewhat realistic stances the faces and bodies are nowhere near as distinct from one another as they were in the previous version
since the graphics were in large part the only good thing about k it wouldve been nice if they couldve held on to themsecond wheres brian daubach
the red sox first baseman is nowhere to be seen replaced by some mysterious stranger named novak
im not sure if this is because of contract problems or simple carelessness but itd sure be nice to have the actual players on the field
ive only been playing the sox so i cant say whether this is a problem with other teams as well but its disappointingand in the same vein the game is missing an awful lot of headshotsbret saberhagen for instance isnt exactly a nonentity but youll find his photo nowhere in the gamethird the announcer while marginally better than ks is still pretty stinkin bad
when hes calling pitches he gets inside and outside mixed up with regularity balls pitched anywhere from head to toe from the brushback to the way way way outside pitch are often described as right through the center of the wheelhouse and at one point last night a out k was described as an inningending double playfourthand maybe this is just because i suckunless the ball is hit directly to an infielder it can be very very hard to get them to make the play
the way the fielding works is as the balls hit the fielder takes a step or two toward it before being relinquished to your control unless youve already got the stick moving in the right direction magically knowing of course which fielder is going to be under your control the fielder then stops and watches the ball roll into the outfield
maybe ill get better at timing this i dont know
i had at least one annoying play last night where the ball went back up the middle to the right of the pitcher the cpu gave me control of the pitcher long enough for me to shift the stick to the right and then it switched me to control of the nd baseman who would have been in a perfect position to make the play had he not taken off running to the right as soon as i got control of him and before i could shift the stick back to centerfifth the documentation sucks  onscreen prompts are generally unhelpfulin one screen there are two buttons thatre marked simulate but that do entirely different things
the manual is not much help beyond the basics although they did have the foresight to put in a pedro centerfold for which a multitude of sins may be forgivensixth who the hell is the cpu to tell me i cant make a trade
i wanted to pick up ugueth urbina who the sox snagged from montreal just before the trading deadline for tomokazu ohka and a couple of noname minor leaguers
so i put up ohka for urbina and the cpu rejected the trade
 if i want to pack my team with godlike pitchers and the best sluggers in both leagues i ought to be allowed to do just thatall that aside im enjoying this game more than i did k
there are fewer enjoymentdestroying bonehead moves especially in baserunning than in the predecessor the addition of a farm system and free agents is supercool createaplayer is great the homerun derby while incredibly simplistic is kinda fun the batterpitcher interface is almost as good as the one in k the pitches though slow break realistically and boy is it fun to watch the knucklers wiggle all over creation as they float in
ill be holding onto this one until something better comes along which since segas said buhbye to the dreamcast is likely to be neverthe chao angle of this was a horrible addition that takes up space
it takes eons to make them halfway powerful and it mostly makes you not want to take the time while they hoped it would make people obsessed
some things are done very right and are fun in chao gardens though
the internet aspect never came close to its potential it felt more like promises
knuckles and amy have such boring game quests and tails just shoots in a dry adventure of his own
i dont even care about shadow or the evil version of the good guys which comes off as agimmick
i only want to play as sonic
and when youre doing that its loads of fun just dont expect to do that much
overall i think the first one was better though they are both worth itsonic adventure  is all around a decent although somewhat disappointing game
it had a lot of potential and got surprisingly good reviews but it did not live up to the hype
dont get me wrong sonicshadow levels are awesome and really fun despite being easy
i would even have to say that sonic levels by themselves would nab a   the games major fault however is the different levels for different characters
it would be fine to play with knuckles or tails in levels similar to sonic ones
they are cool characters
but instead tails as well as eggman are put into inane shooter levels
they are bearable but detract from the games essence
the knucklesrouge levels on the other hand are downright horrible and possess almost no redeeming value other than you get to be knuckles and glide punch and climb on thingsthe storyline is surprisingly good and well thought out as well as noncliched for a simple action game
having a hero and dark sides of the storyline is really cool and they help color each other in
the cut scenes are plentiful and well done though the english voice acting is terrible japanese voices with english subtitles is preferable
the bosses and boss fights are interesting and added a special flare at least the ones that werent other playable characters
the graphics are nice
a little outdated but good enough that it doesnt detract from the game
though the camera is bad enough for it to be impossible to see any of the graphics anyway
on a side note i think that is exactly how sonic and eggman look
i dont know what the other reviewers are talking about
the music is amusing at first but seemingly not very well done the menu screen music if left running for ten minutes is enough to drive one insaneone last thing to mention chao world
it is a nice adorable well programmed fun little diversion but is ultimately pointless especially without a working vmuall in all sonic adventure  was cool but with some infuriating flaws like nonsonicshadow levels which pulled it down from  to  stars
still i would suggest buying it if youre looking for a little action or adventure
have funthis game almost as good as the original
i loved it in arcades and picked it up as soon as it was available on the dc
this game recreates the feeling perfectly but definitely doesnt add much to the experience
the graphics are anything but improved and few additions have been made
the ability to jump the car and pick up up to four all looking exactly the same and get in at the same time cutomers at once
the new city is highly uninspired
it is just a bland city with a few new franchises like burger king and the gap placed in
most of the time you are just looking at tall bland skyskrapers zipping by unlike the original arcade racer
i didnt like the second level added to the dc version and the new one isny any better
it just relys on speeding through a city and there arent many sparce section like in ct
i thought the first one owes a lot of its credit to the very well thought out city
the one part of this game that impressed me was the mini games where you were on a road high above the city and you could see buildings in the horizon as far as the eye could see
its too bad the game didnt use these obvoius abilities of the dc and the engine to add to the real game
it was gorgeous and surprised me
i didnt think the dc was capable of it
overall it keeps the mayhem of the original and you should definitely pick it up if you are still addicted to the first
drive oncrazy taxi two is know better than the first onethe only thing different about crazy taxi  than the original is you can make your car jump and you can also pick  people up instead of oneand last but not least this crazy taxi takes place in new york not san fransiscobut for people who have never played crazy taxi and whant to play you will have a load of fun with the original or the second onepretty much both crazy taxi plots is just picking up as many people in a certain time limit and seeing how much cash you can getand like i said its fun but you will soon get bored of picking up people and trying to earn cashthe graphics are spectacular
thats it
nothing else is going for this game
youll enjoy it for maybe  minutes then youll regret having bought it
the game has no story little extras and is incredibly repetitive
oh and the same offspring song is played over and over nonstop
yeah thats not annoyingvisualaudiofuni loved the first crazy taxi to death
it had some problems the worst offender being its somewhat low replay value but i still really enjoyed it and played it more frequently then i thought i would
since crazy taxi sold like hotcakes herebut sold poorly in japan a sequel was in order
but enough history
heres crazy taxi  im pretty disappointed with the results of this sequel
ill start with the bad
the st problem is the controls
the setup is fine and the same as the first game but it doesnt feel like the original game
it was always hard to do but i cant pull off crazy drifts anymore
it was imperitive to know this to do well in the first game and now theyre almost impossible to pull off
i do like the fact you can jump now and youll need to do it a lot
the new drift hop is absolutely worthless
you never need to use it in the game except in a few minigames and its too hard to pull offthe next problem is the accuracy of the city its portraying
its meant to be nyc but its not accurate to the city at all
i mean when was the metropolitan museum of art next to an inner city basketball court
almost nothing is portrayed correctly save the fao shwartz in the city
its just like the fao shwartz in nyc on th and th
third the feature of picking up many people at a time just doesnt work
it screws up your radar arrow and you cant tell where youre going
lastly the characters arent as funny or as loveable as the cast from the first
you can unlock the old cabbies but its so hard its almost a waste of time
ive gotten pretty negitive here but i just needed to get that off my back so heres the good the graphics are improved over the first crazy taxi although popup is a bigger problem this time the sounds are nice and the idea of the game is great
but sadly this sequel doesnt deliver on the same level as the first
its not horrible but that cant help make it a safe buy
pick up the first crazy taxiits on dreamcast and ps if you havent already and leave this one as a rentalnote to parents this games content is worse then the first crazy taxi
although there was strong language in the first most of the really bad stuff wasnt audible
in this one the language is stronger and almost perfectly audible
im just warning you here but this one earns its teen ages  and up ratingcrazy taxi  is fun for a while but when you either beat the pyramid or become upset because its too hard to beat then the game will slowly make its way to the bottom of your collectionit has great graphics and tight control but the music is a letdown and my arent those cab drivers crude
the game is a welcome addition to any dreamcast library even if it will eventually get oldfor those readers is it really nyc
or something like it
because in crazy taxi people said it was in san francisco but when i checked midtown madness  and flight simulator and real life pictures they did not match with this game so obviously these guys are liars
i only hope this time it is really new york or elsegrrr
i hate one thing and thats the unrealistic road but other than that i like the car realism the real stores and restaurants and the citizens themselves
another thing when is this coming out on pscrazy taxi  is the sequal to the sega hit crazy taxi
now i usually make bigger reviews to be honest ill just make this myshort and sweet reviewnow the st crazy taxi was dc game but lost its exclusitivityyeah that sounds dumb but it just came up my head and can be found onxboxgamecube and ps
though the best version is the dreamcast you can probably spend it on the ps version or the other systems since dc games seem to be a pain to find nowthe graphics are solid and the gameplay loses its touch later onok maybe just for me man
i didnt think the game was that great but like i said beforegraphics goodgameplayehhh gets old
this is must for any die hard dreamcast owner but for people who want more then just another sequal with some stuff stay clear away from thisim not saying the game is bad
i just think the st it betteri really enjoyed the game over all and though it was an aok dreamcast gamei give crazy taxi for the sega dreamcast a out   starsnoteother then crazy taxi the sega dreamcastrip has some really awesome amazing games some for example sonic adventure marval vs capcomand yes the dc version is the best mainly cause it was the original version and it was dc exclusive at one pointand yeahwelllatesrecord of lodoss war looks and plays similar to diablo iii and blood omen
this means no annoying random encounters like most rpgs
there are two very cool aspects to this game
for starters you are given your own castle from which you can explore the island of lodoss
using a spell you can return to this castle at any time similar to the town portals used in diablo ii
by activating portals you can transport to different locations throughout the island without having to walk the whole way every time you want to traverse marmo
the second great aspect of this game is the weaponsarmor system
after rescuing wart a blacksmith you can have him forge weapons for you and emboss magic runes onto your weapons and armor that will become necessary for completing the game
my only complaints about this game are the graphics and sound
the sound of your boots clanking againt the floor can get repetitive at best and aggravating at worst
the graphics and sound are what keep this otherwise great game from earning  stars in my estimationstory this was a what if they had mechs instead of tanks and plains in the cold war scenario
ok it seems a tad silly and dumb
i dont see why they couldnt incorperate air combat into a mech scenario retro or otherwise
so you take your slow moving mech out to fight other mechs
which leads us to gameplaygameplay the game if you can call it that is more like watching fmv or cut scenes
did you like kessen from koei
this might be something you can dig
to me it fealt like a minigame from some other better franchise
you go back or forward order your side troops back or forward  accompanying infantry would have been sweet in frot mission and use special attacks and shells
then you repeat this
its like watching every single unit fight to the death in every battle of an entire war
this is konami so you at least get blood when your infantry eat it
watching them poor foot soldiers eat it for  hours gave me post traumatic realtime cut scene boredom
some sort of auto combat or maybe even actual gameplay would have been nice to cut some of the tediumincentive to play there is none here
konami wants for nothing from capcom squareenix sega or even nintendo when it comes to pay off for playing
theres nothing like that here
makes me wish i was playing suikoden  this whole time
you dont buy anything invest in new skills upgrade weapons or your mech
the only thing you do is unlock differant foot soldier units
this is like playing gran turismo and only unlocking various car air freshners
no point to listen to monotanous dialogue since its not like you are going to miss the hoshun mk for missing some line of text scroll like on front mission overall this is fun for a short while but like a coma patient i always remember how i arrived at the terrible inevitable conclusion of why this was sitting in my storage bin and not in my ps
playing this for one battle to show your friends is kind of fun but playing this alone for an entire day can be sad and unfullfilling endeavor
you have now been warned
i would give this a great and terrible mark but everything seems to end up  out of  anyways
what should have been great is now unremarkableheres the plot wwii happened totally diferently and lasted longer
japan is the battleground and center of the world even though it is in ruins and split much like the korean penninsulatanks are replaced by akward walking tanks that are totally unpractical and inferior to those used in wwii
we are given the excuse that since they can walk they can get over obstacles and thus they are better than tanks yet the only terrain we ever see them on is a colloection of wide roads and open fieldsthe fun part is just the ability to control your soldiers around your walking abomination of machineryespecially the old mans junk walking robot like its that easy to slap one together
your troops allow you to employ all kinds of fun strategies
my favorite get  troop units with chain mines and plant them as you walk towards an enemy close range unit
they will try to attack you step on the mines get their legs bustedas well as their troops killed and then you can go in for the killit will take a good while to beat it say  hours but after that youll never put it in your ps again and it will just take up spaceon the plus side it is cool to see videos clips of old fotage with walking machines insertedwell into the battlesi have been enjoying this game quite alot
it is disappointing that the graphics are in some ways very lacking
but the fielding is very east which is a huge plus and batting isnt too difficult
it leaves the player able to concentrate on the game rather than on the mechanics
i like to do a full draft and the game doesnt appear to have to do it but it does have a trade feature
if do can keep the playability of this game and improve the graphics and options then they could have a real winner
ea sports has had a very poor outing this time with its baseball game and there is an opening for do to fill the void
its not a great game but it is good
very good for ps not as good for the power of the psthe story line is somewhat interesting but the graphics are not that great compared to other ps games
it is not too difficult to figure out what you are supposed to do but it is difficult to accomplish each thing that you are supposed to dooverall this is a much better game to rent than to buy
if you keep at it you can make it through the entire game in  or  rental periods and once you have gone through the game once you will probably not want to play it againof all the games ive played only few have stories that are incredibly well written
these plots could be made as movies but are a little too complex to be profitable so i am glad to see them pop up in gamesshadow of destiny has a plot to kill for
the characters are very well personified and the voice acting is very well done which is gladly seen in a video game
the entire town you explore has a great overall attitude which changes depending on the time period you are in
the story takes fantastic turns and twists as you discover the backgrounds of mysterious and interesting characters
its enough for any science fiction fan to salivate overthe gameplay however is very unimpressive
imagine the old point and click adventures such as the sierra classics kings quest and police quest only with a behind view third person perspective
all you really have to do is get the right object to the rigt person or talk to the right person at the right time
there is not much puzzle solving involved but the payback in plot lines is greatthis game can be completed once in about  to  hours but the drive to see all the endings is great
each ending is very unique and range from your usual good to bad finales
so overall i strongly suggest that you rent this one and complete it in a few days instead of owning it seeing all the endings and have it gather dust in the cornermind you this game is somewhat older now and can be found in most bargain bins
however not all games in the bargain bin are worth picking up
this game was anice break from traditional role playing and adventure games
it looks a lot like silent hill just much simpler and easier
also not as gory or scary
the game has an eerie tone to it but thats mostly cause you get killed like every  minutes
the graphics are soso
the town which is the only environment you play in just through different time periods is well done but pretty bland
nothing spectacular
the characters are nicly represented and fit in their time frames
the voice acting was pretty bland though and as many adventure games your character is just a babbling moron who cant even make sense of the obvious
the game itself does not really require any skill just some minor thinking
a few puzzles can be tricky but the game will mostly point out most options you can take
there arent many different routes you can take either to finish a chapter but there are  different endings
i beat the game in under  hours and potentially i could have gotten it done in under  but i wandered around a lot
the game is pretty weak in free raoming
there are only a handful of random people to talk to and if you dont need to go somewhere to progress the story then you cant so raomeing is pretty useless just go where you need to go
i did find though that i didnt complete as much of the story as i had thought
the  challenge factor is also very light as none of the puzzles are very hard
in fact the game pretty much solves them for you you just have to find certain things
the big drawback is that if you fail during a chapter you have to do the entire chapter over
this can be tedious at times
for the most part this game was enjoyable but nothing over the top
the best feature of the game is the story
it is pretty much why i liked it even though the game itself was pretty weak
the graphics particularly the characters during the cut scenes are pretty good
the game seems more like a mildly interactive movie where you get to dictate the flow and maybe make a few decisions but it pretty much is just going from cut scene to cut scene until the end
i would recomened this title but i would consider renting it or maybe picking it out of a bargain bin because it wont take you more than a couple hours to beat it
even if you want to see all the endings you still only need a couple days
it is worth it but hardcore gamers will hate this titlethe whole idea of this game is just amazing
i find the story captivating
really the only complaints i have is  the voice acting is terrible to the point of funny and  most of the game is just a movie
i mean when i buy a game i want to play not sit and watch
would i buy this gameprobaly not would i rent this game or borrow it from a friend definatlyi got into this game when it first released for the nintendo  but always knew that it never reached its full potential
koei was gracious enough to remake this game for sonys thennew console but they didnt take enough time in some spotsstoryits not like this really matters as is the case with most of koeis games but basically the terrorist crying lions take over a base that controls a weaponssatellite and its up to the scat team to take them out
in the right hands theres a good story buried here somewhere but you could argue that about any plot
as jeanluc cougar you are separated from your team after a helicopter crash and take out an infinite number of enemies while reuniting with them
the presentation also loses a few points because even after the cutscenes with multiple characters you will embark on the missions alone  theres no team combat whatsoever
its almost as if the story was injected after the levels were donegraphicsthankfully much better
the models arent very crisp but the bolder and darker colors make this game look better than the ns faded appearance
the character models move believeably enough such as when jeanluc takes cover and aims with that tactical hotshot accuracy
there couldve been more animations plus the level design isnt much to brag about
also during cutscenes the characters mouths dont move
better than the n version but a somewhat incomplete  minimal looksoundthe music is fitting even though its a little repetitive
none of the game is going to invoke an emotional response but there are some cool techno beats that get the job done
the weapons all sound fine but feel arcadey as opposed to realistic
then again medal of honor had just broken the audio barriers a year before the n version was released
the voiceacting however is absolutely pitiful
do i prefer this terrible acting over the ns silent substitles
wellyeah  but only because its so horrible that i laugh uncontrollable every time i hear it
the emphasis is on all the wrong words and resembles a firstyear foreign language course
still for pure camp value i forgive the shortcomings
what can i sayits a koei gamegameplaythis is where the games strengths lie
you will engage in a ridiculous amount of shootouts with smart ai and backtrackingand you will probably enjoy all of it
somehow this repetitive  simple gameplay manages to keep the fun level high
also winback follows a timeless cliche  if there are bad guys youre going the right way
because the game has a few weapons each with its own strategic purpose and ai that will not mess around with you the intensity rarely lets up
there are some tough bosses but the difficulty is challenging as opposed to annoying
there are some control issues that were never resolved
in fact i think the game is harder to play on the ps controller versus the n controller
the n had that genius ztrigger button but there is a tutorial that helps you play along with more of that horrible voiceover work
what never worked out fine though was the closeup combat
its clunky unresponsive and an absolute mess
thankfully youll only be fighting handtohand if you cant shoot fast enough so take the cqc as your punishment for not avoiding it
there are a couple of multiplayer options but none of them are truly great
still a solid singleplayer experience with some nice multiplayer fun thrown inoverallwinback has always been a solid and fun experience
koei fixed the look of the game as well as the sound quality except for the voicework
but it still doesnt feel refined enough to recommend a purchase
the game is too rough around the edges and the gameplay doesnt have enough variety in it
theres simply no reason to buy it if you have any doubts whatsoever
worth a rental maybe even a purchase of  dollars or less but dont rush to play it
winback isnt a great game but its slightly more fun than it looksthe truth is out there
and the mixed reviews for this baseball game are certainly out there too
so i based on those reviews opted to purchase asbb  as i thought i could deal with the games alleged problems
ill get to those in a minute but first let me say this
i think most of us that enjoy sports video games like to play as the teams we follow in real life
dont we
and do we also like the ability to quottweakquot our chosen teams and improve their chances on the video playing field
especially if you happen to be a chicago cubs chicago bulls or chicago bears fan
like me
so i like a video game to allow me to do what i want to do
its my game isnt it
if that means creating a player trading a player editing a player releasing a player or whatever i want the ability to do that
asbb i think is lacking in this option
you can create a player and the number of options to do so while truly incredible lacks in one aspect
you cant create a quotsuperstarquot
the best you can do is turn out an quotabove averagequot player which is fine but also limits your power
but even more importantly than that you cannot trade players in the season mode if the other team rejects the deal
as a cub fan i tried to get greg maddux and mark grace back but the braves and the diamondbacks would not accept my offer
not that i blame them but like i said before this is my game
i found out later there is a way around this you can make the trades in the exhibition mode but i still dont care for the limitations
now as i said before all of the criticisms you may have read in other reviews of asbb  are valid
the ai base running is pathetic the camera angles are limited instant replays are cpu controlled only the ball coming off the bat camera angles make fielding awkward and there is no drama when someone hits a homerun
however none of the above ruin the gameplay for me
after all we should know by now there is no such thing as a perfect sports video game
one has to deal with the imperfections and just enjoy the virtual reality as it is
but i cant do that with asbb  because of the glitch that my game now returned and refunded came up with in the rd game i played in season mode with the cubs
it was in the th inning and the cubs and expos were tied  i was letting the cpu play the game as i was occupied elsewhere and ron coomer spelling
came in as a pinch hitter
then to my utter dismay he was then pitching for the cubs in the top of the next inning
hes an infielder
so quickly i jumped in to intervene yanked him and put in an actual relief pitcher thinking that maybe what i had seen was just a fly in the ointment
then i let the game continue on its own while i went on with my other business
when i returned the game was displaying the box score
the cubs had won  in  innings and the winning pitcher for thenorthsiders was joe girardi
joe is the cubs reserve catcher
i like to play full seasons i like to see realistic statistics i do not want to see my reserve catcherand my pinch hitting infielder leading the league in saves
and ill be  danged if i keep a game that allows that to happen
i will be real interested in seeing if this happens to anybody else
maybe i got a lemon but what with the return policy for most stores regarding video games i will be real reluctant to buy another onei was hoping this would be the end all of all baseball games but it isnt
pitcher hitter graphics would rate a  it looks decent not as good as madden graphics though
i would recommmend you rent this game and wait until next year to see if the end all of all games comes out
i would hope for a game like baseball stars playability but ps type graphicscool feature controller rumbles when out of strike zone for pitchingbad stuff i cant find a franchise mode does it exist
graphics bad for fielding balls guys small and dont move realistically players look ugly when they throw not realistic player move so slow when fielding and sometimes they are far from the ball but it miraculously gets scooped up  bad camera changes for fielding sometimes when ball goes down a baselinei have to say i am a huge fan of fighting robots
i dont care if it is anime style or comedy central zanniness
there is something sweet about fighting robots
this game does an admirable job of fitting the bill
the controls and graphics are both superb
it is fun to play
there are two problems st it is repetitive and second the story is pretty bad
i mean cheese
not a nice cheddar either smelly rocquefort spelling
i think you will enjoy playing the game and it might even be a buy if you love the genre like me otherwise you would do best to rent
also it comes with a demo for metal gear solid that is awesome
in fact it might be better than the main game  i dont know what that says
you will definitely want to try this out
i have spent almost as much time with the demo as the actual gamethis game has it all
the grapics are great the gameplay is fantastic and it had a good storyline
i like the vs mode and the bosses were hard
they were a nightmare to get through
however the game is short
i beat it in  hours
and this took me  weeks
the final boss you cant kill him and you run away
thats it
this is begging for a sequel
it was good but it shouldve had more time
it shouldve had  discs or something
well it was good but i am impatiently waiting for a sequelyou can beat this game in about four to four and a half hours
great graphics and plot
good voice acting
hard
the main character leo is the worst character for this game
a wimpy little vengeful child
the music is awesome and so is the level design
very fun to dive around and flip and use that to destroy enemies
there are quite a few subweapons but the game is too short to enjoy them
rent it and you can beat itwell when i first loaded up the game it seems good
i really got it for the metal gear solid  demo but i figured i would be playing the actual game too
what can you expect from konami
great games
suikoden and mgs
however why did konami do it
why did they sell us out
mgs  is really short and this game proves to be even shorterthe combat is great
you got slash and attack
you get a second mech but its just fun
moving around feels fluid you will see your legs leave burn marks on the ground if u glide on them and it also feels great to just traverse around
however the arenas are usually really small so you wont have much to explore
anyways at first i had no clue what to do on any place but i soon figured it out
the real problem is how they did it
you do stupid little tasks with your ship thingy all the while hearing about how this enormous battle on mars is going to take place at the same time you are stuck with a robot who is learning to be human
which part sounds familiar to you
practically every robot story is about how the robot in the end usually grows to feel emotions
it is really cheesy
then it starts to get boring and oldso you finally meet up with the big bad guy
you cant beat him
you cannot beat the last bad guy
how terrible is that
its like your fighting him then you cant do anyting against him
so you go to this place
get ready for the battle of mars wrong
they just end it
it is terrible
the game lasted about  hours mabye  if i sped through
almost as horrible as the ending is the bonuses
theres basically nothing you will get after acomplishing the game
no upgraded mech weapons or anything so i fail to see any point in replaying it
where the game does good in graphics and fighting it fails miserably in every other possible aspectthe games a complete ripoff of the storyline of mobile suit gundam with a whiny little amaro rei clone named leo stenbuck whats with these ender guys and animal themed names
are they descended from native americans
fighting in a sidelike colony atmosphere against the pseudozeon forces of bahram clashing repeatedly with the even more feminine though thats reasonable since shes a womanversion of char the red comet
it even abruptly ends like msgthats mobile suit gundam not metal gear solid or mono sodium glutemate
to be resolved in a movie or in this case the sequels
thats fine though as gundam games are more akin to what the gundam leaves in its wake after a battle with zakusgarbage
konami almost captures the thrills of giant mech games with fast paced dynamic combat thats so easy to control think action games like dynasty warriors  combined with segas virtual on series with a bit of segas nights thrown in for good measurethat any squashed flyboy can feel like the red baron when they pilot jehutythe difficulty is a little imbalanced at times being a total breeze one moment and tongue biting hard at other times entirely due to mission objectives but then even the difficult missions become easy once the player figures out what to do such as defusing bombs while fighting high level enemies at the end so it never gets to be too tough
thats not the biggest problem with the game
the seemingly endless repetition though the game can be handily completed in  hours is by which i dont mean fighting the same  types of enemies besides the occassional fantastic boss battle but the horrid scavenger hunts for items and the constant backtracking to previous areas of the alreadysmallincomparisontojehuty colony levels
the games a blast to play for a while but i suggest that you buy it with the sequel especially if the now useless demo of metal gear solid  isnt packaged with it
so the ending doesnt cheese you off like it did to some people
i bought both at the same time so i dont carethe game is ok  starsbut the voice acting is so bad the demo of mgs is what you should spend the  on if you like mechs this gfame is for you but beware the voice acting is badi have stop playing this game for awhile and moved on to something else
you get to have a civilation and you must collect materials such as gold food and silver to expand your civilzation
the game is similar age of empire which you get to build great wonders military army farm and hunt animals for extra food
you get to team up with other allies at the before you start the game and they do come to help when you getting you butt kick by the your enemyprosyou get to advance to future weapon  such as cybersyou dont have to wait you turn on the game i guess that is call real time playit is fun for awhile and you do get bored but it is a game you will go back in playthe game does start with a tutorial game even though it not the greatestconsthe graphic to me are not as good as age of empireit doesnt come with a book manual
i do believe it has a manual on the disksometimes it hard to determine your enemy soldiers from you allies because of the colorsonce you advance to future tech it is very hard for me to beat the enemythe game does have scerenios but i perfer playing freestyle after trying to play the first one i gave up just like that
i dont like games where the first couple of scerenios are too hardi really wanted to like this game
i have played aoe and aoeii including the expansion packs and liked them very much
so when this game came out i bought it immediately if for no other reason than the fact that it was designed by the producer of aoeon surface the breadth and complexity of the game is just mindboggling
just imagine being able to play through epochs spanning from the caveman days to cyborgs and everything in between
but once i started playing the game there were too many things that detracted from me getting the most out of this gamefirst of all this game is the buggiest game i have ever played
i have a pentium  ghz with mb of video purchased last christmas
this game has caused more crashes on my computer in the past  months than all of my other programs in the last  years combined
if you dont believe me just go and see how many help me messages on our inernet sites ee forumby the way i havent made it passed the first few epochs
my goal is to start from the earliest and progress to the latest but the game is so difficult even on the easiest settings
now before some of you think i am a weenie for complaining about the difficulty think for a second
there is no way a nonhardcore gamer can fully enjoy this game if it is this difficult on the easiest settings
as soon as i think i have the upperhand the computer prophet comes and unleashes this perfectly placed plague on me wiping out all of my men that i worked so hard to produce
also the resource gathering is slower than a three legged turtle walking in a pool of peanut butter which makes losing men that much more painful and frustratingi dont know maybe this game is perfect for those who thought the aoe series was limited in scope but for me it is too buggy and difficult
still i am glad i bought it since i payed money for it at a local store
i am just waiting for microsoft to produce a better running game on their operating system with the vision of empire earthlike anyone else i looked at the back of the box and was stunned by the graphics
allnall this game does has its perks but to me the game goes way too quick and changes civilizations way too soon
i know you can adjust the settings and all but it just seems that the computer will be all over you if you decide to upgrade your fighters buildings and what not
a little too complex if youd ask me
what disappointed me the most was the fact that your characterfighters could be upgraded with better armor or weapons
sounds good but this takes a lot of time away and you must remember to do so
its just like warcraft comand and conquer and age of empires
i guess if you like these types of games and can play them without getting too bored too quick it could be a good buy
im just glad it was given to me as a gift and not from my pocket
what a girlfriend i havebeen playing diablo since the original game came out and of course very addicted
not to happy with the expansion though
price tag pretty high for what you get but as usual blizzard has out done themselves on graphics much slower than before
also one day as an amazon i could use  arrows to kill a bad guy next day after patch upgrade on battlenet took six to kill the same bad guy
dont know what there doing to the software but i have found it generally dissapointing except for graphicsi dont think this is much different from the original with the emphasis on clickingbut still its worth gettingthis expansion adds two new classes and one new chapter
of the two classes the assassin is ridiculously overpowered but consequently a lot of fun to play as long as youre not looking for a challenge
the druid is good but almost seems as if three different incomplete xcharacter ideas were taken and smooshed together to make one complete one
the new chapter has some interesting new quests but in the end it just boils down to a new background to click your mouse on over and over and over and overill preface this by stating that im not one of those hardcore diablo players who has to play the game until my character is level  and has a gazillion experience points and the best of every item
perhaps in an mmorpg this is a great goal
but in a game like diablo it seems that once youve beat it youve beat it
experience weapons levels abilities and everything else are scaled so that while beating diablo at each higher level normal nightmare hell is slightly tougher its not much different than beating it the first time
and since the cinematics levels areas and acts are all the same it gets boring after the first time
at least when you have a thousand other things to do during the day once youve beat diablo the excitement just isnt there to do it again though for some people it obviously is
that having been said i did preorder the expansion pack and eagerly awaited its arrival
diablo is a fun game in general and more diablo had to be a good thing
i figured it would keep me busy for a long time and give me something to do with my time between projectsso i put the game in at noon
by five o clock that evening i had beat the game
as much as i hate to say this about a blizzard game it just wasnt worth the price
im not even sure it was worth half the retail pricethere are two new cinematics
the first one is enjoyable but nonspectacular
the final one is a letdown not exciting and completely anticlimactic
i dont expect to play it again and gave it to a friendif youre a hardcore diablo fan who plays your characters past level  youll probably enjoy this
if nothing else youll enjoy the new monsters items classes and the x resolution
otherwise you might find a completely seperate game more worth your money and more rewarding in the long termi got this game and loved it
lots of new extras and two new charecters
but the problem is how the game ends
its a big let down
i had hoped for more
all in all not a bad game and worth the price but it could have been betteri think its a great game but after your level  or have good stuff the game is no fun at all
i got a sors to levle  with good stuff and it was bad there was no chalangeit is a hard game and cool game till you are unstopable and its easy to beat diablo ball mefisto extbut im just pointing out the bad things about is it has many new cool things such as new guys such as a drude or assasin and the new items so ill give it  stars becase it gets stuped after a bit but for the fist time it rocksgood effort on socom  although it is not zipper 
yeah it seemed that after fireteam bravo  it was demanded from the management an immediate continuation that zipper was not able to deliver and so was delivered to someone else who tried their best and in some points achieved it but in general lack of old zipper genius as well this bravo  was so short which shows the urgency to deliver asap after loving fireteam bravo  so much i found this one to be a little disappointing
the single player was fun while it lasted a few hours  but after beating it once it got kind of old
one thing i found cool was that you could earn medals this games version of playstation trophies for completing certain goals which does add some value to the campaign after beating it
the main reason to buy this game though would be multiplayer
however as i previously stated it was a little disappointing
the maps seem to be smaller and the customization options for your character are pretty boring especially compared to what fireteam bravo  had
the game modes arent as fun to play either like in captive it takes longer to revive your player
gameplay does seem to run smoother though and the graphics have been improved
the sound in the game is also excellent
another negative thing about this game is that there arent a whole lot people online a few hundred is the most ive ever seen so it can be difficult to find variety in games
i guess that can be expected with most psp games now but otherwise if youre looking for a fun tps to play on psp to help pass the time this  would be a good optionthe game is an entertaining rd person shooter
no question about that
you control wraith a member of a seals squad
your mission is to save a president or something
the controls take a little getting used to but overall feel really good
you move forward back and also turn left and right with the nub
you can strafe left and right by holding down l whilst using the nub leftright
you can also freeaim with the nub by tapping up on the dpad although i found the lock on with r to be infinitely more effective unless i was snipingwhen you lock on to your target you will automatically strafe around the battlefield
you have an inventory brought up by holding left on the dpad where you can select a specific piece of equipment or you can tap left to swap weapons
you must proceed through stages executing mission objectives strategically eliminating targets to reach said objectives
you can easily dispatch your squad to a location by looking there and tapping circle
if you are a mind to you can hold circle which brings up a more extensive squad control menu with actions like follow cover fire at will stealth
weapons can be purchased and unlocked throughout the course of the game which can then be extensively customized to fit your playstyle
attachments range from scopes and reflex sights to suppressors grips laser sighting and underbarrel attachments
all of which are purchased ingame using credits of some kind the player acquires upon successful completion of a mission
the graphics are good the sound is a bit lackingsometimes i had to turn up the volume to like  of the max
output just to hear the dialogue in the cutscenes
my only real complaint is that the campaign is easily played through in a very short amount of time
there are only  full story missions to complete and then the game ends rather abruptly in my opinion
there is some replay value due to detailed combat statistics and awards the player has received and the fact that you cant possibly unlock all the weapons in a single playthrough
wait for the price to be reduced a bit or get it used and you should be satisfied with your purchase
at full price however i would pass this one by if i could do it overthis game is alright but after playing the japanese ones it is more than a bit disappointing
there are too few songs and the selection is okay but not great
they are all bemani songs but they left out some of the best ones that had appeared in the japanese versions
smiledk songs kung fu fighting shook captain jack songs konami majorly messed up the marketing on this one also
not enough people found out about it in the us for it to spread like it did in japan
i got bored with this game very fast
however if you have never played ddr you will be able to appreciate it morethe perfect compilation on one disc
compilation discs or games are nothing new
however sometimes the games selection is meh
not so here sega picked some real winners and classics here
theres rpgs puzzle games sonic and action games
one fatal flaw ruins the whole experience
the sound emulation is horrible
this ruins what would of been a retro gamers dream on one disc
therees metallic boings and pings and the whole thing has a metallic harsh sound to it
the impressive list of games is the only reason why i give it a  star reviewno doubt about it these sega games are classics
it will keep you entertained for hours and hours specially if youre playing with a friend
the only thing i didnt like was the sound
it sounds weird and nothing like the classic games
other than that a must haveabout half of the games contained on this smash pack are still fun games to play today the rest feel too dated to be of much fun and makes me wonder why certain titles were picked
streets of rage  sonic the hedgehog golden ax and vectorman stand out as the best games on the pack
theyre still fun not too difficult and havent grown boring with age
virtua cop  should also be up on that list but since i dont have a gun its not as fun as it could be
shining force and phantasy star  are two decent rpg which could probably be enjoyed by a fan of the genre
the two puzzle games columns and sega swirl arent too special but arent really bad either
revenge of shinobi seems like it would be fun if it werent so insanely hard
finally altered beast and wrestle war are the only two games on here that id classify as being terrible
i guess my only two problems with the set were that i wish some different games had been on here in place of some of the ones i didnt particularly enjoy and that maybe a few more games should have been included to sweeten the smash pack
overall it really depends on how many of the games you like and what you want to pay for the ones that you do likeeven when this was released it was kind of unnecessary
the games are great but in  there are far superior compilations out there stars for the games  for the compsega still rulz thoughfirst of all the gameplay
the game is definitely difficult and some of the puzzles are potentially real stumpers
some degree of mathematical insight is certainly required to solve themone problem i have with the puzzles is that they are not logically arranged
for instance after progressing some distance through the game you reach a point where you have to return one and perhaps both characters to the point where they started the game to obtain something necessary to continue the game that cannot be obtained at the beginning
there is also an object that can be obtained from the beginning that is not essential to progress beyond the start of the game but becomes vital later on and it would be easy to leave the beginning without obtaining it
problems like that add to the difficulty of the game
things are made easier however by a limited number of inventory items and the fact that if you hold the right inventory item for performing a task the computer automatically selects it for youseveral of the puzzles are mathematically oriented
while i can usually work out mathematically related puzzles i still cant determine the logic behind one of them translating the old to new coordinates as it seems that in the alien number system you carry numbers between some columns but not others
another difficult mathematical puzzle the triangle puzzle was rendered impossible in my game by the graphics not being good enough to show the readings on the relevant instruments
this forced me to revert to a walkthrough to solve these puzzles which was unsatisfyingthe rest of the puzzles generally were solvable although a lot of logic needs to be applied including drawing up lookup tables to determine patterns etc but often lacked a real logic to them in terms of game story like the houses which you must enter twice but leave once
this is in contrast to the puzzles in the myst series which are closely ingrained with the storyline and make good sense in the context of the universes created
the puzzles in schizm seem to be there purely for the sake of vexing and perplexing the visitor which is unsatisfying in terms of storyline
the storyline also doesnt make an awful lot of sense there is a very contrived explanation as to why your two characters cant see one another even when standing next to each other but what the hecki also had a real problem with the acting which is appalling
if you think the acting in most computer games is bad youll think it is oscar material compared to that in schizm
i understand that the actors are not natural english speakers but the game makers could at least have cheaply hired a voice actor to overdub their linesnow some technical pointsi bought the cd version of this game
as many of the reviews below indicate this game was initially designed for dvd and has suffered in the translation to cdthe biggest problem is the graphics
the game has a lavish production design but the compression required to convert the game to cd has resulted in blurry and indistinct graphics at some points
mostly this is merely an aesthetic problem but when you cant read numbers on dials or key sets of coordinates its a much bigger issue
were it not for walkthroughs i simply wouldnt have been able to solve one of the puzzles purely due to bad graphics
there are also some objects which were very hard to distinguish for the same reasonunless you do a full install of all  cds which i would highly recommend although you will need lots of disk space you will need to change cds frequently
one thing adding to the problem of swapping cds is that you control two characters who must be moved independently  so when moving both characters from location a to location b you need to walk each character along the path one at a time
it would have assisted if the programmers had enabled you to move both characters together and included a zip mode as there is a lot of pacing back and forth through familiar territoryfinally there are more quicktime movies containing hints that are on the dvd version but are not on the cd version
the dvd also has an additional puzzleall in all  its a difficult adventure but if you want to be able to solve it yourself you may have big problems using the cd version due to graphical problemsas good as other adventure games just be sure you get a walkthrough because the puzzles and plot are in no way intuitive
graphics could be better but are still very original and at times excellent at times blurry
still if you like adventure games you will not be disappointedthe story line is nice
the design concept is really great
the video resolution isnt all that high so there isnt as much detail as youd like to see in all of the cool visuals
one other factor that sets this game apart is that you play  characters and you have to play to both to win the gamethe puzzles in this game are difficult
if you are good at patterns and linguistic type puzzles then youll have a good time
if you are better suited to the physical object puzzles youre not not going to have as good of a timemy taste is that i want the puzzles easy enough to allow me to make progress but hard enough that i dont finish the game in an hour
as a beginnner gamer the puzzles in this game were just too hard to keep my interest and i gave up half way throughif i had played this in dvd perhaps my experience would have been a better one
not that the puzzles would have made any sense they wouldnt
not that the ending would have wrapped things up more satisfactorily it wouldnt
but at least the ride would have been betterafter years of devotedly playing adventure games ive become discouraged
seems that designers think that the harder the puzzles the better the game and the less sense it makes the better the puzzle
i suppose there are gamers who like that sort of thing but not mefor the opportunity to wander in gorgeous otherworlds immersed in graphics that takes my breath away i am willing to put up with nonsensical puzzlesprovided i have a walkthrough and did not pay a lot for the gameschizm being an older game still has beautiful graphics
there is no snow my personal favorite or rain however there are some lovely if limited vistas with excellent detailthankfully the designers used video for the few people you encounter and not computer rendered characters
the voicework is done very well and the music and sound effects go excellently with the areas you move about in
however the differentiation between sounds for two puzzles should have been better
there are no captions for the sound puzzlesthere are a couple of enjoyable puzzles the train tracks was fun but hard
it made sense and you had to think your way through to solve itthe rest were best left to the walkthrough
the markings on one puzzle were poorly rendered and difficult to see
another made no sense at all for your actions there was no reason given for what you had to do
to make it worse you can complete only part of the solution before having to go hunt down a tiny missing partwith no clue as to where to find it
a note from one website it seems that there should have been a character asking for this item however the cdrom did not show this requestas noted the cdrom version has too many problems to make it worth buying
overall unless you are playing the dvd version i would recommend you find something else to playi usually love these kinds of game but this one was hamstrung by the use of a plethora of actors with thick accents that made it essential for me to turn on the subtitleslost a star therethe scenery was beautiful in places not so much in others
i saw none of the artifacts others are complaining of possibly because my setup isnt the latest and greatest
no flatscreen or widescreen to create problemsi dont recall getting frustrated over the navigation other than the usual i wish theyd done more with that feeling i got with myst in the stoneship and starship titanic in the grand corridor at the gates to the garden a couple of other placesi did spend a lot of time cursing the need for algebra
i spent hours recapitulating thirty years dead and buried similar triangles figuring out from first principles on one puzzle i could remember what it was but not how it worked
once i had solved that one i turned around and there on the wall behind me was an explanation of similar triangles
op thrrpanother puzzle the one that gets you out of the ballon and into the adventure proper would have left me marooned at the games start had i not seen the episode of columbo wherein the penny weight puzzle was explained
dont get me started on the three games of fox and geese i was forced to play
another star comes off for thatthe sound puzzles gave me little trouble but the payoff was a bit low for the effort involvedi finished this one but ended up not really caring to repeat the experience mostly because i dont want to do math for fun and i couldnt understand those accentsoh well
i hope you have a better time with itfor those who love adventure games myself included it was hard not to get excited about this game when it debuted
i was amped for a great adventure with puzzles that were not too difficult or too easy
well what i got was a game that was virtually unplayable due to the insane amount of difficulty with the puzzles
this game is so difficult which makes for a miserable experience at times the continuity and flow of the game is disrupted in favor of incrediblydetailed problemsolving situations
i finally got so frustrated that i decided to print off a walkthrough so i could get through the game and give myself the illusion that i earned a victory and got my moneys worth
well even with the walkthrough i somehow felt frustration and fatigue that compelled me to just forget about it altogether as the game is so long and complex
perhaps i was feeling guilty
or was it that even with potentially getting through the game this way i wouldnt exactly understand the things i was doing
whatever the case one should avoid this game if incrediblydifficult timeconsuming puzzles arent your thing
i will say that the graphics are beautiful in this game and that is the reason why i give the game the benefit of the doubt and not give  stars or lower
this game couldve been great if it wasnt so hardpi started out liking this game a lot but as it progressed i liked it less and less
what i really look for in a game is a firstperson perspective a plot or story that you have to uncover by solving a variety of puzzles not getting killed good graphics and decent sound pretty much in that order
while i found all these things in schizm and they were enough to keep me interested the game had problems enough that i became increasingly angry and frustrated with itschizm was designed for dvd and it shows
the cdrom version not only has less of a game but also does not run particularly well
panning is slow
sound halts and stutters
sometimes the game freezes altogether
allegedly you can correct this by using the full install but about every time i tried this the install procedure crashed my computer
the one time i managed to get it fully installed the game ran in hungarian or some other eastern european language so i had to go back to swapping discs anywaythis game is complex
sometimes it seems arbitrarily complex  that is the complexity really interfers with enjoyment of the game
the two character perspective starts out as intriguing but just becomes a pain as you cant ever move them at the same time but have to keep going back and forth between them even when theyre supposed to be together
several times this involved swapping discs half a dozen times in the space of thirty seconds of gameplay
they come up with a lame plot element to explain this but its still a drag especially since there is no zip feature to speed you past places youve already been
a zip feature would have been very helpfulthe puzzles range from somewhat hard to extremely difficult
often the difficulty stems less from mental capacity needed to solve them than from some arbitrary complexity that just seems put there to make the puzzle hard
for example several puzzles contained so many variables that even when you knew the logic involved you still had to spend an inordinate amount of time going through the variables to find the one that worked
some indication of the correct path would have been helpful
spoilerthe sound puzzles in general were illconceived
i really think if youre going to have sound based puzzles in a game you should make the sounds thins like tones or bells or rhythms or even snatches of music  things that are easily recognizable
trying to understand an alien language that sounded like badly recorded backwards masking  was just too muchthere were a lot of inconsistencies in the alien culture as well
why should you use one set of number symbols in one place and a completely different set in another
because things were often so different from place to place i at least had the feeling that i never really learned anything and was making no progressthere were a lot of things in the game i got that just didnt function
mission logs that were supposed to be accessible were not accessible characters who were supposed to appear did not appear
fortunately everything that was absolutely necessary to the progression of the game happened but i was in a constant state of anxiety that i would miss something vitali was interested enough in schizm not to quit but i spent a lot of time in what seemed to be pointless busywork and i never really felt like i knew quite what was going on or how to proceed
i like nonlinear games but at times schizm seemed so nonlinear as to be incoherentprobably this is not a game that is going to keep you completely absorbed far past your bedtime but it is a good game to play for a couple hours then put away and come back to laterdecent graphics for the huge number of units
moderate variety among nations
very playable
enjoyable endgamewhereas many games become tedious once victory is a foregone conclusionthis one makes razing the enemies town epic and fun
the computer player is too easily outsmarted by any serious gamer although this is a problem common to many gamesalphacent is an okay game that answers the question of what happened to the colony ship sent to alpha centuari in the civ series
the back story is well done  different fations from the ship with differing political views decide to seperate upon arrival at the planet and start their own civilisationsthe game is similar to the civ games but if offers numerous improvements upon civ
the controls are far more streamlined and the computer interacts with you far more than in previous civ games
if you want you can automate every unit and just manage city production or vice versa which saves times for those players with littlethe entire story and details of the game are a little weird to get your head around this game starts off from a very high technology level so naturally higher levels are hard to understandone thing i had a problem with in the game was that one of the political factions was a religious fundamnetalist group called the believers whos religion was christianity
so if you went to war with them you were effectively fighting christianity by destroying cities with names like the hand of god and new eden
as a christian i had a problem with this and it was one of the reasons i only gave this game  stars
it was my understanding that game designers tended to steer away from involving christianity heavily in their work particularly in opposing it simply out of respect for the religion
overall though the game isnt too bad but its simply too complex and full on for a newcomer to the civ universe to understand
only for the die hard civ fanatics if youre a casual strategy player leave this one bethis does have great graphics and a very good feel to it but at times its just too hard
hardly any of the cars supplied with the game are worth using you just dont have a hope in hell
yes its slick
yes its great for multiplayer
yes if you download new cars of the net then its good fun
but with most cars its far too hard and theres no sensation of speed
one mistake and theres no point in playing on
its the same story with hot pursuit
the idea that a bath tub like a corvette can possibly catch up with and arrest a counthash is ridiculous  yet thats what you have to do when youre a cop
i also think that the options are sometimes limiting
you can only play hot pursuit for a single race  you cant have cops in competitions
oh and the graphics may generally be excellent but the trees dust and smoke look awful and the crome is cool but overexaggerattednow that updated sequels to this game have been made i think its worth forgetting about
really good fun at times but  stars is all it deserves because of sloppy programming concerning the difficulty
i shouldnt have to download stuff just to enjoy a game
if you have someone to play  player with though or you can be bothered to download a load of cars from the net then its worth getting if you see it cheap coz then it is a really good game
plus it has some of the best racecourses ive ever played on
i just think that if ea had spent more time on the feel of the game and the gameplay plus a lot more testing for the difficulty level instead of leaves and snow flying up on the windscreen then this could have been a better gamethis game is now very old and simply cannot be compared to modern driving games
however need for speed v porsche unleashed is an excellent modern game at a cheap price
put your money there insteadthe above is what i wrote a year ago
recently i reinstalled the game just for kicks and was impressed by how fun the game remains
so i giving it one more star up to three now though i stand by the evaluation that it is completely outshown by porsche unleashed which can be had for only a few dollars moreas someone who was addicted to pokemon in my early teens i occasionally feel drawn to monster collection and fighting games like this
invizimals mixes the classic catchemall gameplay with the relatively new technology of augmented reality ar to move the story and battles away from imaginary far off places
instead the story takes place in the real world and the battles are on the table desk or floor in front of youive been playing with ar demos for some time so when this finally came out in the us almost a year after it released in eu and japan i picked it upinvizimals is clearly aimed at a much younger audience
the acting is a bit cheesy and the interface is rather simplisticunfortunately the developers didnt think to add subtitles to the videos
my brother is the only other adult i know with a psp who would be likely to enjoy this game but he is deaf which prevents him from hearing any of the story and important information on capturing the invizimals
so a word of warning to deaf gamers and the parents of deaf children this game is not deaf friendlyas a hearing person i also would have greatly appreciated subtitles due to the fact that all of the actors have prominent accents and are occasionally difficult to understandinvizimals are unlocked for capture by completing the main story
unfortunately you must also capture one of each unlocked invizimal in order to continue the story
if you have difficulty capturing an invizimal for any reason you will be stuck until you are successfulthe battles are presented in realtime rather than being turn based
as long as your invizimal has enough stamina you can attack or block repeatedly and so can your opponent which makes for some interesting changes in strategyoverall this game is fun but it has some limitations that could reduce its lasting appeali must admit that while dr marios medical background is shady and unoriginal his procedural methods can be fun
its a love or hate affair
those whove never had an appointment with the doctor may take to it but others who in the past made regular visits might feel that he hasnt kept up with the timesmario  im onto you
think you can run around playing doctor while hocking your sugar pills
you might be offering your services for a seemingly affordable  but didnt we already try this medicine
better get lawyer luigi on the phoneever since the introduction of the playstation to the world of video gaming ive been searching for a console golf game that would rival the fun and satisfaction i had playing pga golf ii and iii for the old sega genesis
sad to say ive been greatly disappointed thus fartiger woods golf for the ps is pretty solid
this was my first foray into the tiger woods series of golf and i have to say i was somewhat surprised
i enjoyed the new swing meter you use the analog stick to control the meter and the graphics are very good
however i felt like the accuracy of the shots ie
distance relative to club selection and weather situations was somewhat questionable
i was also very disappointed in the fact that there are so few courses and players to select fromin all this was an enjoyable game but not as enjoyable as say links  for the pc
hopefully ea will rectify these problems for darkstalkers chronicle is a perfect port of this underated fighter from the big boys at capcom
with  characters to choose from you should have no problem finding the fighter thats just right  for you
the controls are a bit sluggish making fireballs unusually difficult to perform but once you get the hang of it you should have no problem fighting your way through this button smashing fighter
the graphics are superb and the animations is flawless
you would never believe that a game like this would be ported to a handheld with nothing lost along the way
their are better games out there especially if you want to see the d power of the system
but its worth checking out once youve already gotten a few games
easy to pick up when youre on the go and thats the best part of this gamefrogger for pc used to be one of my favorites several years ago but i quickly lost interest when newer updated game came aroundthe game itself is fun with comical graphicsi play it just to see frogger get smooshed by a vehicleand is also tough in later levels
a hint in the dark areas is to always croak not only does it brighten up the floor around you for a split second but you can also hear the little froggies near byfinding the golden frog in the first  area cubes is pretty easy then it gets a whole lot harder latermultiplayer is fun but it gets really cramped on the keyboard if more than  people are playing at onceup to  players may competejust because this is an old game does not mean anything i recommend this if you want addicting computer gamesthis game is very true to the original monopoly with all the same spaces official rules and chance cards
if you want a budget version of the game this is a good choice
two things i did like was the fact that you can write your own ai scripts for opposing players and that the optional rules that many people use at home are included
you can play with the free parking bonus and make the game a little more or less challenging
i didnt like how repetetive the game was as far as graphics and sounds
delightful when you first install it but annoying as time goes on
i think as a budget title it gives you good value but monopoly fans may want to spend a few extra bucks to get a newer version with more bells and whistlesi started my zelda collection during the oracle series and own both ages and seasons
i have beaten seasons and have not even beaten ages but can already tell that it is not as goodthe gameplay is not as good as in seasons hinting to me that ages was released first tested and seasons was refined accordingly
one thing i noticed right away in the game is that compared to seasons many of the people you talk to are very rude
it almost made me not want to talk to any of the people but of course you cant beat it that way
many of the people in seasons on the other hand were pleasant to talk to and gave you useful informationi also thought that only providing two ages limited the perspective of the game as seasons lets you experience the landscape in four seasons making the gameplay more interestingi would suggest buying both games if you can afford it but my suggestion is to play seasons first if you want to start out with the better one and ages if you want to start out with the lesser onekid icarus became available in its original form with enhanced d graphics for the ds via download from the nintendo eshop about a couple of years ago and i immediately downloaded the classic for a cool  bucks
they also made a highly regarded new kid icarus kid icarus uprising for the ds with some breathtaking d visuals and brilliant graphics but i digress
although i still owned the original cartridge and could play it with relative ease  plug in the old nes via the rca style video cords  i was excited to play it via the comfort of my ds not to mention the convenience of the save point feature for all of the digital console games for the ds and dsi
when  i revisited the game i was astonished at the difficulty  and frustrated actually as i recalled loving this game
i think however the variable at hand is that throughout the many years i didnt continue playing actionarcade and platformers at least not challenging ones
i opted for turnbased and strategic rpgs as i got older and while i can still enjoy a game of galaga mario metroid or punchout i can still reach tyson or mr dream i have both versions kid icarus is just too hard for this old man
i gave the game more than a justified try too  but after several hours and over  revisits and barely making it to level  i had to hang up the gloves or in this case wings in favor of a different romantic visit to nostalgic video game past by downloading something like the original legend of zelda or perhaps blowing the dust off of my nes and playing a round of archon as much as i wanted to relive the days when i could blast through the difficult levels in kid icarusto be completely fair though even though my trip down memory lane left me a bit disillusioned and wishing for an easy setting this title was pretty fantastic
perhaps a bit too challenging right off the bat kid icarus was extremely creative
it offered both sidescrolling and vertical play a touch of roleplaying elements with regards to character development and purchased upgrades and a very vast playing environment  lots of levels varied enemies and bosses
the graphics are decent for nes and if you have a ds enjoy the added d effects only a handful of the original nes games available from the eshop have been amped up to d and these are therefore only available on the ds
other classics like smb metroid mega man etc
are also available on the dsion a final note if you enjoy challenging platformersaction games and arent stuck on firstperson this classic should not only be in your collection but is just as worthy playing today  the only thing new platform based games have on such a well developed classic is graphics which if youre a wellrounded gamer you can look pasti am not a big fan of pit but this game is fun
the object is to mostley fly up and defeat enemies with ur bow and wings
it is sort of addicting after a while but then it gets very boring
it gets very hard after u get pretty far
the more hearts u collect the more health u get
other than the extreme hardness and boringness it is a great gamethis game came just as it was advertised and worked perfectly
my husband loves it
i would recommend this to anyonecastlevania is a classic side scrolling action game in which you play a character by the name of belmont
armed with a whip and the occasional throwing cross dagger or axe you set off to fight the evil minions of dracula
your goal is to put an end to dracula but to do that you must beat countless levels which will test your jumping and whipping capabilities
at the end of each level you will square off against a boss character such as medusa frankenstein and death
the graphics are not that great but honestly its an nes game so you cant hold that against it
what matters is the gameplay which is very simple
you can jump duck and fire off your two weapons
you will have mastered belmont after the first mission
what you wont master right away though is the difficulty of this game
no passwords and difficult enemies especially bosses are waiting for you
this can make the game frustrating at times but once you memorize the patterns of the enemy you should do just fine
overall its worth checking out this title and seeing the roots of such a great seriescastlevania is one of those major franchises still active today that began life in the nes era
castlevania shows japanese developers offering their interpretation in glorious bit of the tropes of the horror genre featuring such disconnected monsters as mummies frankenstein and igor medusa the grim reaper and dracula himself
the game is scary brutally difficult and just plain fun
castlevania is the first title in the series
like other nes games there isnt much in the plot
you as simon belmont aimed initially with a whip must set out to slay dracula by entering his castle transvering six stages and then showing the count that the belmonts mean businessthe game is a typical platformer of the era and is on the short side at only six stages
however the atmosphere and setting is truly what makes castlevana special
at the start of the game simon walks to the gates of the counts castle enters the gate and prepares for an epic showdone
the eery setting is just fanstatic
you go through the delipated portions of the castle underwater passages outside sections etc
the enemies are spooky knights skeletons mermen skeleton snakes that breathe fire demented monkeys medusa heads you name it
whats really awesome is although the game is linear once you beat the first stage you get to see an overall map of the castle and the path that simon is trodding
this touch is quite unique for a game of its age
castlevania features several special weapons
you can get a whip upgrade a throwing star an axe and holy water which konami puts to infamous use in the vastly inferior sequel castlevania ii simons quest
unlike other games come to the era castlevania uses hearts as ammunition
each time you use a special weapon you spend one heart
roast beef or a pork chop also gives you healththe game is famous for two things its difficulty and its stiff controls
simon controls like a rock and a heavy one at that
there is no fluid fast movements like mario
simon moves slowly and is rather stiff to control
the biggest challenge about the controls is when simon gets hit by an enemy he jumps back several feet
often times you will get hit and then simon jumps backward falling a bottomless pit
this can get frustrating after a whilesome manuals dont give you much to go on as far as strategies or even information regarding the villains of the game
castlevanias manual only lists the points each boss is worth
here is the information
grim reaper  points the count
  points
the manual also states queen medusa is worth  points and frankenstein and igor are worth in addition to the settings control we then have the enemies and bosses
although simon has several health bars a lot of the enemies will take four of his bars at a time giving simon only a few hits
there are a lot of sections where the enemies are coming fast and furious especially the corridor leading up to the fight with the grim reaperthen we have the aforementioned bosses themselves
the first boss is a giant bat
not too difficult and a fairly simple battle
next up is medusas head
i remember seeing the medusa head in an early issue back in the s when i played through castlevania for the first time years and years later it instantly brought back memories of nintendo power
anyway that ones pretty easy too
third up is the dual mummies
slight increase in difficulty but still managable
be thankful
thats the last time youll get a fairly manageable bossthe next three bosses are nightmares
next up is frankenstein and igor
this is where the difficulty really gets ratched up
first you have to go through a narrow corridor with these skeleton snakes that shoot fire and move and wind around taking away precious life before the battle ahead
once you beat those and get to frankenstein and igor you then must content with igors rapid speed
without igor frankenstein isnt that difficult
however due to igors speed and how he jumps around here and there and everything he can be difficult to dodge given how sluggish simon movesand then we have the grim reaper
blue oyster cult lied to you
be afraid of the reaper
be very very afraid
forget dracula this guy is an absolute nightmare
for most players this will be the final boss because they wont get past him if they even get this farthe nes is home to some of the most difficult boss battles of any game system 
and this battle with the grim reaper is easily one of the most difficult boss battles on the nes
its utter horror
whats worst to get to the grim reaper you most navigate a long cooridor filled with knights throwing flying axes and medusa heads that weave in and out of simons path
this cooridor is hell to navigate without getting hit and believe me youll need all your health you can get to survive death
the grim reaper throws all these different scythes at you and disappears and reappears throughout the confined room making him difficult to hit
your best bet
as soon as he appears start spamming him with holy water
and if you dont have holy water
well good luck because in the words of han solo youre going to need it
only skill will keep you alivethen we have the count
the last stage has these spinning wheel platforms with giant eagles who are the bane of some many nes gamers especially for those playing ninja gaiden throw these enemies at you
once you get past the final stage you find yourself at the base of moss covered stairs
victory is within your grasp
perhapsthe time has come to face dracula
he has two forms a human form and then a giant demon form
he will kill you in four hits
with only four hits at your disposal your timing must be impeccable
he disappears and reappears causes fire columns to rise from the flood and shoots fire at you all the while teleporting
once you beat the first form then he turns into a giant bouncing demon who can be difficult to avoid
use all the holy water you can against the second formand there you have it
james roolf the angry video game nerd said it took him twenty years to beat castlevania and i believe it
just like life in the middle ages this game is short brutal and monstrous
but its also a lot of fun if you can get use to the quirky sluggish controls and the pardon the pun monstrous difficulty
however a lot of players may not put in the time required due to these issues
the original castlevania came out in   for those real masochists out there there was an arcade version that doubled the damage you took by enemies in order to eat as many the gamers quarters as possible
this arcade port was actually my first exposure to the original castlevania back in the s
the game came out in  on the famicom disk system
a sequel called vampire killer was released in  for the msx console home of the original and vastly different metal gear and metal gear  which is more rpg and exploration than a straight linear title similar to castlevania ii
this game has never been released outside of japan
for shame konamiheres the  debut of a now legendary series
unfortunately it was not without its flaws
read on for pros and consprosexcellent arcade style gameplaysecondary weapons add to the experienceconssometimes lacking varietymidair jump control extremely sluggishsome sections extremely difficultno passwords
gotta start over in every sittinga decent game overall but not a great one
only get it if youre a collector or just desperate to try it
the game itself isnt great but its got high nostalgia valuehaving played the firs two games in the quotmario partyquot series i decided to give this one a try
i hate the first one the second one was a little better and this one is the best of the bunch
the minigames are less sadisticmaking them more fun and thankfully those stupid outfits from the second edition were left out
the game boards are more complex making the game much more enjoyable and the game control is much more straight forwarddaisy and walugui have been thrown in there tooboth are only playable in the battle modes and seem to be an afterthought
neither one of them really shine and are not included in the opening sequence
the fun really lies in playing with your friends
the computer likes to cheat yelling at your console isnt nearly as fun as yelling at your friends
the game is worth a rental especially if you have kidsi enjoyed the first two mario parties with all my heart as i own them both
but then this game came along and i lost total faith in the need of mario party games for the use of the four player capability on the nintendo  why did i lose faith in a sequel i could have only expected to love
the game in it began to seem recycled from the first and second
the object of a sequel is to be better that the thing that preceeded it
this game does not accomplish it throwing the same overdone concept this game could actually make fun and throwing it out the window
the sound and the graphics were little to complain about as was the same graphics i had come to expect from the nintendo  but the playability and replay value are hardly worth the money you would spend on this game
the playability is lacking in the sense that the control seems off as well as the accessibility that gave the other two preqeuls such ease
im sorry but this game is truly average at best and that is being kind
if you want a party game to break out that old n buy the other two that came before this one those were actually worth the moneyi bought this game because i am a fan of star wars and i love multiplayer racing games
this game does not have the features required to stay entertaining long enough
sure it would be a great rental something different to enjoy for an evening but afterwards it becomes monotonousthere really isnt anything to work up to while playing this game
basically the tracks do not add enough entertainment and powerups become nearly pointless in this game
i truly think the animations and the look of the game is great
still it is too simplistic of a game concept without an innovative racing system to catch my interest long enough
i happened to enjoy star wars podracing for the nintendo a lot betteri shouldve known better not to buy this just because it was a star wars games
i guess star wars games can be poor too
game features seemed to be cut too short to even captivate interest long enoughpros  simple to understandgreat graphicsneat adaption of star wars character designcons  not fun for longway too genericid rather play mario kart  mario kart double dash or even star wars podracing before this gamegreat to try and play for a while
boring to play for longthis was the game that finally got me to break down and buy a ps
i like sort of wacky offbeat games and this fit the bill
it combines two things im pretty fanatical about kart racing and star wars
since super mario kart for snes kart racing has been my favorite genre
the problem is that no game has ever exceeded the greatness of the original smk
this one certainly doesnt
the presentation of the game is great
the characters all look strange and cool with superdeformed heads
they all make snide comments taunt look around and are very well animated
for all the criticism of the graphics i must disagree
i think the graphics are actually raelly pretty cool for what they are
the designers were going for a cartoony look
the characters all have different abilities and they actually do handle differently
plus each character has a special powerup only he or she can use
that does encourage players to at least try all the characters
the controls are smooth and easy to learn but of course are alittle quotfloatyquot and different from standard kart games because after all you are flying
its a little like fzerothere are some problems though
first the game is way too short
sure it packs a lot of two player fun especially in battle mode but the one player challenge is over way too fast
i beat all the circuits in about an hour and a half
after that theres a mirror modes a secret racer trying to score your best time etc
but the the thrill is over pretty quickly
one feature that the oiginal smk had that to my knowledge no kart racer has had since was the way that record times were saved for courses while you played the various cup races
in all kart games since the records are stored seperately and only are affected by what you do in time trial modes
that little feature added a alot in that it encouraged players to play the the circuits over and over again
stunt racer fx even saved an overall time for the circuit record
that would have helped here
as it is once you play the circuits and get first in everything which wont take long you are going to relegate this game to the shelf until some human challengers visit
the game is worth holding onto just for the multiplayer though
my second big gripe is that the game is a little buggy like most lucasarts pc games
the third track has frozen up on me several times and caused me to have to reset my ps
also there are places in the game where you can get stuck and have to restart the course
the fountain in the sheed city is a good example
theres no excuse for shoddy work like thatoverall the most important things is that this game is pretty fun and youll either love or hate the cute factor
i loved it
i even liked jar jar
it got me to actually like some of the silly episode one characters so it must be doing something rightas a final thought whats up with the obi wans quotsurfer dudequot makeover
some of the things he says and his new found valleyboy accent are really weird and dont make much sensewhat is better than a racing game with good characters like darth maul anakin jar jar binks etc
cool levels like podracer track lots of weapons and a fast and fun game
nothing just four controlers and four friends enjoying this cool game
well this game is funny cool and fantastic problably the best space ship racing gaming for the ps but there is a problem very confusing and too patheticly wierd
when you crash just a bit you ship starts spinning what the hell is that
and worst of all the graphics are messy so you cant se very well
what can i say like collecting star wars games
problably you will like this game but if you hate messy and star wars games dont buy this gamethe game isnt bad its just the same as the other  i didnt expect it to be groundbreaking
but some change some advancment in the concept of the adventure game genre would have been nice
but in the end there really wasnt
it follows the same format the same ideas and just didnt strike me as being very new
especially after all the hype lucas arts pumped before its release
all said and done it is still enjoyablebeing a huge fan of pointandclick adventuresback in my early days of gaming this game got me really excited when i saw the port from pc to ps
at the time i didnt have a pc powerful enoug to play the pc version being mainly a console gamer
so i picked up the game after reading some rave reviewsfirst of all if you have never played games like sierras kings quest space quest or any of the monkey island series then go purchase this game
it is hilarious if in a cheesy kind of way and contains joke after pun after slapstick
it is extremely well written and a good involving storythe graphics are impressive with cartoonstyle characters and painted backdrops
everything is fluid and load times arent bad at all
all characters seem like they are out of a disney movie and many are reappearing from the previous installments of the series on the pc
speaking of which your really do not need to have played the other games to understand what is going onthis game is good as a way to tell a story with a couple minigames thrown in
overall you will need a hint book or cheat site because as with most games of this type the puzzles are completely ludicrous
there are things you have to do that someone would never normally think of and with tons of items and characters to interact with it is next to impossible to merely stumble into doing the correct thing
there are many many hours of speech that has been put into the game for each character that you come accross keeping it not too tedious and the humor definitely helpsthe gameplay is strong tried and true and the humor
but overall if you have played this type from when it first started it gets very old very quickly
the jokes carry it still even after boredom so only play it a couple hours at a time and it wont become too tiringso in closing if you have never played any point and click adventures pick this up and get a quick few laughs
very well done graphics and sound
go pick it up if you canescape from monkey island is the th entry in a series of adventure games starring our favorite wannabe pirate guybrush threepwood
i grew up on these games developed by the lucasarts gaming company and consider myself a pretty good adventure gamer
however being well versed in all things monkey island i can confidently say that this is the weakest game in the series thus far
im not implying that its unplayable by any means but it just didnt quite have the spirit of the previous so once again guybrush finds himself on melee island the first island you visit from the original mi
the game picks up pretty much where the last one left off with guybrush and governor elaine marley newly wed and returning from their honey moon
elaine has been pronounced dead and must run for reelection against charles l charles a mysterious newcomer
theres also a new villain introduced the pirate hating ozzie mandrill from australia and what mi game would be complete without the ghost pirate captain lechuck
or the demon from heck pirate as hes now referred to
just like previous games youre after one goal
in efmi that goal is to discover the ultimate insult before ozzie mandrill canjust like any mi game there are familiar characters from previous games to interact with
the only problem is the project leaders on this one are new to the world of monkey island and instead of really creating anything new or original they spend most of the story rehashing old jokes
in fact there are so many inside jokes for fans of the old games it starts to become a little tedious after a while
i found myself rolling my eyes more often than laughing
it feels like they tried so hard to please former fans that they ignored the fact that most of these jokes would go right over the heads of newcomers but i guess they figured the target audience would only be fans of the previous gamesso once you leave melee island you explore a couple other islands before ending up on monkey island
if im not mistaken this installment features the fewest islands to explore out of any other game which is a shame because it makes it feel a lot shorter
when sailing around on your ship you can see phatt island and booty island previous islands from monkey island  but to my disappointment you never get to revisit them
insult sword fighting is replaced by monkey kombat which i found to be quite challenging
i believe it took me a whole night to solve this part of the game
overall the puzzles were pretty challenging and sometimes i dont know how an average gamer could solve them without the help of a walkthrough
unlike previous mi games there isnt an option for easy or difficult puzzlesescape from monkey island runs on the grime engine that was developed for the superior grim fandango
that makes it the second lucasarts adventure game not to run on the scumm engine and the first mi game to feature d graphics and atmospheres
thats not necessarily a problem it is necessary for games to take advantage of advancing technology but unfortunately the d graphics in this game just dont look that great
the only time they look acceptable is when the game pauses for a cut scene to further the plot
other than that they look rather primitive by todays standards and even by the standard set by grim fandango which was released only a year prior
i prefer the look of curse of monkey island which featured beautiful d graphics and backgroundsi was delighted that dominic armato and earl boen reprised their roles as guybrush and lechuck from curse of monkey island the first talkie mi
they do a great job voicing those characters and hopefully will continue to do so should a th mi go into production
the rest of the voice actors however were average to bad
every time otis opened his mouth i usually found myself hitting the button to skip his dialogue
i know this is only a computer game but i expect a little better voice acting
the music was decent but not as good as the music in curse
it usually got a little repetitive in some areas and there werent any new character themes or motifs introduced that stuck in my headoverall its a decent adventure game if you look at it from a standalone point of view but in comparison to the rest of the mi series it doesnt stand up to its predecessors
if youre a fan of mi i would recommend playing it just for nostalgias sake but dont expect it to blow you away
for newcomers to the series who still enjoy adventure games i would recommend playing the other games first or any of the other adventure games developed by lucasartsi was very excited to be picking up the newest thing in controlling one of my favorite video game characters  kirby
his n outing was a lot of fun so i couldnt wait to see another aboveaverage first party nintendo game
now i cant say that this game isnt unique or stateoftheart but i can say that the idea is not possible on the platform
as everyone knows well at least the  million of you who own a game boy in order to play any game there is always the tilting and moving of the system to be able to see the screen clearly to play the game accurratly
so visability in this game can be nonexistant very easily
its too bad because this game is chuck full of innovative mini games which nintendo has mastered and cool uses of the  degree movement
towards the harder levels the lack of precise controls creates an inability do do very well in the game
good graphics and welldone effects cant carry this game into the quotplayablequot category especially for smaller kids that this game is basically marketed to
worth a rental to experience the technology but not much morethis is a classic old game with a decent story
the graphics are dated but the game has heldup welleven by todays standards
it runs fine on my windows xp home sp computer
the game crashed a few times for me but as long as you save frequently youll be okaypositives story voice acting and dialogue ability to use many objects in the game world rpg style for some conversations greenred target so you can tell who is a friendenemy realistic environment with cats rats birds etc
 menu structure is well donenegatives too much running around the graphics are a bit stiff and square but that was standard when this game was made too much lock picking too many key codes too many locked panelskeypadsventsdoors enemies bounce around during fights the screen bounces around when some enemies hit you often direct hits to the head wont kill an enemysome control panels vents and doors blend into walls and this makes it hard to tell they existsometimes during a mission the game loads another section of the mission
the load is quick but sometimes you cant tell what direction youre facing ie forward or backward toward the prior sectionthe environment of some missions look very similar like inside the ship during the naval shipyard mission
this increases the likelihood that youll get lost or run around in circles
there is some signage in the game but its also missing signs that would normally exist in real life and that makes it difficult to know where to go nextthe environment is fairly open so you can roam around go into many different rooms etc
however this means there are lots of pig trails
it can be difficult to tell where you need to go next to accomplish an objective
there is a compass in the game but it only shows direction not direction to the next primary objectivesometimes characters get in front of you and they wont move out of the way in an open area thats okay but in close quarters it becomes a problem you have to backup until you get to an area that you can get around the characterotherif you get stuck then use a walkthrough
if you find parts of the game annoying then use the cheats especially for lock picking
avoid the killpawns cheat because it may remove a good guy and if you need to talk to that person to complete an objective then you will get stuckcant advance to the next missionthere is a visual walkthrough by mike mangold sometimes it was helpful but i found that it takes you through a lot of pig trails so if youre not interested in every nook and cranny in the game and if you dont need to pickup every object then skip ahead in the walkthrough to the real mission objectivei observed that all scenes either take place at night or indoors
that probably made it easier for graphics dont have to display too much detail especially for the landscapei enjoyed playing the game but i did use cheats frequently
because of the negatives mentioned above the game was tediousannoying at times
im not sure if i will play this game again if i do then it will definitely be with cheatsvisit my amazon collections to see my star and star pc gameshttpwwwamazoncomgpcustomersalhckqocollectionswell after reading the reviews here i thought this might be a great game that i somehow missed
now first off for the budget price i paid i wont ramble too long and yes i do realize that the graphics are dated so enough about the obviousone thing that i did not know about and my major gripe with the game it is absolutley linear in nature
yes you can go all out guns or stealth around but the premise is that you get your mission and start at point a and go to point b the mission ends then and there an you go back to headquarters for your next mission
ai is weak to say the least and stealthy approaches are laughable in how the computer handles itwhile it does offer you more approaches than say hl or other plain fps games it still boils down to pure linear missions
role playing amounts to leveling points in meleesmall gunslarge gunslockpickingelectronicsetc
nothing really special here and there is essentially no selling andor buying items a random walking npc will offer to sell  ammo clips here and there plain vanilla stuffi do feel as though this was a great game in its time but understand that this is no futuristic morrowind or kotrtrain simulator is an enjoyable game but i think train enthusiasts will really get the most out of it
others will probably find it interesting but wont find it worth the investmentthe game is nicely put together
the tutorials take you through learning how to drive each of the train types and give you enough information to get started without having to touch a manual
once you learn the basics of getting a train moving there are a variety of tasks you can perform such as moving freight or running a short distance passenger train
the tasks are pretty challenging and will challenge how well you handle a train and understand the processes surrounding train operationthe graphics are another selling point of this product and they dont disappoint
the scenary and external views of the trains are all very nice and well detailed
at first i found myself just watching the scenery some of which i actually recognized and listening to the sound effects
on the downside i found that the graphics in the quotpassenger car viewquot werent that great
some of the trains attempt to make this view look very elegant but the graphics are generally flat and unimpressiveas i said above overall train simulator is an interesting game
i think most people would enjoy going through some of the tutorials to learn about basic train operation but beyond that i think most people wouldnt find the game too captivatingyeah its not a bad gamebut it doesnt thrill ur spine eitheru ahve to maintain a schedule and after sometime it gets quite monotonous and boringkuju entertainment developed this game for microsoft and it lives up to its name
you can explore six different historical railroads including amtraks northeast corridor burlington northerns marias pass route and a section of the orient express in austria
two japanese lines and the flying scottsman are also available
the graphics are beautiful and the sounds are faithfully reproduced
microphones were mounted on various areas of each engine to capture the sounds of accelerating braking etc
the steam trains thunder and wheeze the diesels hum and the electrics quietly click along
the scenery includes trees bridges roads moving automobiles and tall mountains that actually look appropriately scaled  a rare feat with todays computer gameshowever make sure you have a midrange system or better if you want to be able to run this game
slower pcs such as those of mhz or under will probably not be able to display high levels of detail without slowing the system to unacceptable levels
also be sure you have a capable video card
if you dont have enough system or video horsepower you should upgrade your system before installing
also the full install requires  gigabytes of hard drive space  not exactly a small footprintdriving a train for the first time is thrilling
the game lets you look at the trains from an almost infinite number of angles and they certainly look good
learning to brake was also quite a challenge
trying to stop a car train on a steep grade in the rain gave me new respect for what engineers do on a daily basishowever after playing the game for two weeks i must relunctantly conclude that this game is only for hardcore train fans
once i had mastered braking and could get to stations on time the game quickly ceased to be interesting
im just not interested by backing my train into a siding at  mph to pick up some grain cars
i dont think its fun to have to drive a train at  mph in a reducedspeed zone for  minutes of real time
while this game faithfully simulates reallife railroading conditions im afraid that this doesnt translate to gaming excitementim not knocking railroad fans and im not saying that i didnt enjoy learning how to drive trains
but despite the excellent technological achievements showcased by this game unless you are a diehard train fan id advise against buying this product
it simply doesnt provide enough entertainment for your money especially since the replay value appears limited
there is an editor included with the game but at this writing it seems buggy and is not particularly easy to use
perhaps that will change in the future
additional usermade maps and scenarios would definitely help to make this game a better valuei enjoyed necronomiconat times it was hard to hear the dialogue because the people either mumbled or talked to fast or softthe graphics were good and the puzzles were not easythe only thing i had to have help with was the correct urni just guessed any urn would duei thought it was funny that in the town other than the fisherman nobody ever answered a door when i knockedit is creepy like the  dracula games i playednecronomicon is certainly harder than dracula resurrection and a little bit harder than draculathe last sanctuaryi thought the documents were complicatedif there is a negative to the game it is the overcomplicated documentsoverall a good gamein this dark horror game inspired by the writings of hp
lovecraft you take on the role of william stanton living in providence ri in  the adventure starts when your friend edgar wycherly hands you a strange object accompanied by a cryptic explanation
you then learn from dr egleton that edgar has been acting strangely and he implores you to discover the cause
from that point youre thrown into a dark mystery as you learn of and attempt to stop the horrors surrounding edgarnecronomicon features the bynow familiar game engine as other dreamcatcher interactive adventure titles such as dracula resurrection the messenger and dracula the last sanctuary
unfortunately it fails to deliver the gripping story line and enticing graphics seen in those other horror tales
while the animation scenes are interesting no subtitles or ingame notes are offered
in fact many of the objects in your inventory have no corresponding description leaving you to discover their meaning and usefulnessthe first noticeable obstacle is the darkness of the screens
even with brightness and contrast adjusted necronomicon can only be played in a very dark room
mazes can be especially frustrating due to the dark nature of the graphics and some consist of merely panning the mouse around to discover hotspots
puzzles range from very easy to difficult and are solved not only by picking up objects and using them in the correct place but also by reading text listening to other characters and keeping a sharp eye out for other cluesdialog with other characters can be difficult to hear and with no option for subtitles or replay this element is frustrating and unnecessary a product of poor game design
because of the lack of userfriendly help youll need to take copious notes to remember names dates and places the npcs mention in conversation
necronomicon features very linear gameplay and progress slows to a crawl when youre unable to find the next elusive clue to further the story linethe world of the game offers you the  rotation of most modern shooters
it has a very loosely related hp
lovecraft theme but no connection to any story i know
there are some tough hunt and peck pixel quests which can become tedious especially the one in total darkness
i did enjoy it but the box says that this is the first adventure game to be directly indpired by the writings of hp
lovecraft
this was annoying because there have been much better lovecraft ports such as the excellent adventure games shadow of the comet by chaosiuminfogames in  and my favorite text based hound of shadow  from eldritch games and the alone in the dark series from the early si didnt personally encounter any serious lockup bugs but it did drop out to windows sometimes
the cut scenes and movements played without any choppiness at all but sometimes the voices would stutter
the graphic detail of the towns and building was excellent especially the fishing village
riding the little antique motorcycle was fun
as one reviewer noted the main character sounded unnecessarily like a  year old good description
however the people were mispronouncing the guys name differently for a reason they were indicating or pretending they didnt know him of course
this was not a flaw by the game designersin sum the graphics were pretty but gameplay could have been better
worth a look in the bargain binnecronomicon is set in s rhode island
the hero william stanton is charged with sleuthing around to find the connection between providence rhode island and the world of the dead
stanton is an archaeologist by trade and he is very young fairly naive very polite and very determined
i liked playing from this characters perspective
and the idea that there is a dark underside to such a quaint and seemingly peaceful town is provocative and appeals to my everpresent suspicion that all is not as it seemsthe first half of the game is preoccupied with unraveling the mystery around stantons friend edgar wicherly
wicherly brings stanton a pyramidshaped stone and tells him to give it to no one quotnot even mequot this portion of the game is quite rivetingthe graphics in the town are quite nice with fairly involved detailing
stantons task is to explore what has happened to wicherly and what kind of research he has been doing to provoke such odd behavior
the eerieness is welldeveloped by the odd behavior and taciturnity of the towns folkthere is a stretch of game where i was literally terrifiedi confess to being so absorbed by the storyline and graphics that at times i could not bring myself to press the cursor on the hotspot for fear of what might happen next at one point i got up from my chair and stood behind it to press the cursorsomething about doing this made me break the hold the narrative had over me
really great work herethe designers have a good sense of what is really terrifying in a blair witch traditionthere are some moments of broken story logic it seems to me having to do with the central scene in the middle of the game
there is an implausible moment in the storyline which affects my relationship to the main character i refrain from revealing the details
nonetheless the story picks up from that moment and shifts into an entirely different world apart from the dreamy rhode island setting
i think i would have remained more engaged had the story stuck to the rhode island space a little more giving a more palpable sense that the other side is much more integrally connected to the world in which all the characters live and breathe
as it is the game is separated into quotthe rhode island segmentquot and quotthe other world segmentquot it loses some of its efficacy because of this for methe game is puzzleheavy to an astonishing degree particularly in the second half
rather than bog myself down in frustrating solutions i opted to find a good walkthrough for the puzzles
there are also several mazes which are slightly less frustrating and on which i usually did not cop out by going to the walkthrough
there is some interesting alchemical work as well as some fairly engaging library work stanton follows the path of many a researcher in just such a library
it seems to me that the facts and details of the storyline are fairly historically plausible if not accuratei give this game  stars because the first half is so engagingfor its narrative development voice acting the newspaper man at the gazette is a memorable delivery measured eerieness and logical sleuthing
it gets no more than  stars because the second half fails to sustain the enjoyment of the first halfthe story loses plausibility and connection to the first half it is almost all puzzles and mazes with no nonplayer character interaction and even though it takes place quoton the undersidequot it is slightly less eery than the disturbed world of rhode islandnecronomicon is a stunningly average game
like most games it has its good points and its bad points
unlike many however it has nothing that really sets it apart in either direction
the good parts are simply pretty good not thrilling
the bad parts arent unforgiveably bad  theyre merely annoying
as it is based on the works of hp
lovecraft and i feel the same way about those in this respect it turned out about as i expectedyou play william stanton a scholarly fellow who lives in the rhode island town of providence
the time is the late s although the character costumes make it look more like the late s
as the game opens you answer the door to your old school friend edgar
he tells you hes in danger and entrusts you with a mysterious artifact
soon after a man appears who introduces himself as edgars doctor
edgar he informs you is suffering paranoid delusions
his family is worried about him
can you find edgar and figure out whats going on
trying to accomplish this superficially simple task leads you into an unexpected realm of necromancy and black magicthe graphics are great as is the voice acting
i felt that in both look and character necronomicon really taped into the new england feel where things are both endearingly quirky and a little eerie especially to outsiders
the game relies heavily on the sense that theres something mysterious going on here that everyone knows about but no one is talking about
every nonplayer character is at least mildly eccentric and some are downright creepy
this gives you a sense that you dont know whom to trust
unfortunately this doesnt really go anywhere aside from creating atmosphere
i kept expecting to find hidden agendae or to uncover things that werent as they seemed on the surface but this was not the case
as a result the whole game lacked depth that could have made it more interestingthe puzzles are mainly inventorybased mechanical
they are neither particularly challenging nor particularly easy
any challenge comes from some external situation rather than the puzzle itself
for example a room might be so dark that its hard to see whats going on or a solution might depend on combining one or two of a large number of items where no indication is given which are correct or even what the result should be
this gives the game an annoying degree of randomness and makes it seem that every solution is a matter of chance rather than brainpower
youre just a likely to stumble on the answer by chance or luck as you are to figure it out
often failure to get it right means death so there were long periods of dying over and over again while trying different things out
i found this tryingneconomicon suffers from extraneous detail  things you can look at that have no purpose or things you can interact with that dont really have a function
i constantly found myself wondering is this a puzzle or isnt it
a lot of this stuff seemed to have been put in there just to extend gameplay but it left me feeling gypped
in general it seemed that there was too high a proportion of irrelavant material and the material that was relevant just didnt thrill enough or make up for the makework
there was too little of the satisfaction that comes from solving a really complex logical puzzle from carefully collected cluesnecronomicon is also one of the most linear games i have ever played
theres almost no sense of interacting with the game or doing things in an order that makes personal sense
once you start youre locked into a predetermined path
it may be a fairly interesting path but it just doesnt involve the player like a more nonlinear gamethere are two different endings to the game  a successful ending and a failure ending
which you get is contingent upon your success in figuring out the last puzzle
unfortunately once you start the last puzzle you can no longer escape and start over even if you figure out youre on the wrong track
this resulted in having to view the bad ending sequence about  times and you cant escape from that either
that was the singularly most annoying thing about the game in my opinion
by the time i had seen the bad ending  times i was ready to give up and go look for the answer just so i didnt have to see it again
after all that the good ending was distinctly anticlimacticon the whole i neither liked this game nor hated it
it was just something to do on several summer afternoons when it was too hot to do anything else
in that respect it was worth it
if you decide to play necronomicon dont expect too much and you should get along finebeing a big sf fan ive always wanted to get my hands on alpha  since people say its one of the best sf games
the sound graphics and gameplay are good but playing a fighting game like this with the psps control stick and even dpad can be a little difficult when trying to perform special moves combos and inputs
if you have a ps then just get the alpha anthologyi liked it good stuffi guess its worth a buy if it is like  bucks or so
not worth full retail but decent gamewell i finally got the third installment of the soap opera that is the legacy of kain
here raziel continues his pursuit of the enigmatic kain but begins to doubt the true intentions of his benefactor the elder god
finally we are introduced to the great vampire janos audron referenced heavily in the original blood omenhowever soul reaver  seems more intent on displaying the voice talents of their very impressive
cast and creating a cinematic work rather than a gaming tour de force
yes the cut scenes are quite amazing drawing the gamer more deeply into the story than ever before
however i would have liked more puzzles more dungeons and most certainly a greater variety of enemies
rather i am treated to an ominously eerie elder god making vague threats to his agent raziel or kain feeling sorry for himself again
 or raziel treating us to his observations of the everchanging world of nosgoth around him
yes it is nice and the voice actors do the characters a great justice but i bought the game to play not to watch
so fans of the action of soul reaver bewarei like the kain games but this one kind of irritates me
the graphics are gorgeous the story is compelling the voice acting is aboveaverage the combat is definitely better than the first soul reaver the design work is amazing etc
the problem i have is with saving
the level design is ok but the puzzles while wellconstructed take too darn long to complete
between figuring out what you need to do and backtracking as you do it it can take upwards of an hour to complete one of the levelsized puzzles during which the game will not allow you to save
i want to be able to save my progress as i go so if something interrupts my playing time like the need to sleep for example i can stop when i want to not a halfhour later when ive finally solved the puzzle
i think that unfortunately the game designers left out the ability to save at will so that players wouldnt realize how short their game really is
thats probably the same reason you cant skip the movies once youve seen them
but im telling you that short or not i would actually enjoy playing this game alot more if i knew that i didnt have to sit through those interminable cinemas or run around and turn those silly mirrors all over againcrystal dynamics must have read their message boards a little too closely when designing soul reaver  all the hardcore fans were so angry about the story and ending of soul reaver cd apparently over compensated and put nothing but plot in the sequel
tons and tons of elegant cutscenes and story elements are brought out through amazing voice talent and each one reveals something cool about the series history
everything in between however just felt like filler made of essentially the same bad combat as the first game
i thought we werent going to be able to just jump over bad guys anymore
seemed to work  percent of the time for me youve got no incentive to fight unless youre severely wounded and need to regain energy by feeding so why bother
instead you will spend countless hours just running from place to place trying to spot the one ledge or cavern that will allow you access to the next area
the only thing that will motivate you to send raziel loping across nosgoth is seeing this epic tale come to some kind of conclusion
the first games tedious block puzzles have been mercifully replaced by more creative mind benders which helps to offset the uninspired combat
the final battle is the only one that could even be consiedered a boss fight
though and raziel is invincible throughout the whole thing which would be cool if i was a dangerously uncoordinated  year oldpeople say that this game is too short whatever the problem with this game is puzzles that are dumb andor too hard to figure out on your own
look around entire rooms for something even the ceiling than screw up and not be able to solve the puzzle because of a game glitch thats always fun
dont buy this game unless youre interested in completing the entire series which i now dont see myself doingi love the blood omen series
this game plays almost exactly like the first soul reaver so the controls should be really firmilar
everything looks great and the sound and voiceover acting is topnotchif there was a criticism to be placed anywhere i thought the game was really on the shorter side
i honestly think it took me less then a week to wrap it upthis follow up of soul rever legacy of kain that apearred on the playstation is without a dought a must own for actionadventure fansthe story goesraziel emerges from the chronoplast time portal and returns to different eras of nosgoths past in his relentless pursuit of kainover the course of his journey he unearths the mysteries of nosgoths ancient races and exposes the secrets behind the corruption of the pillars and the vampire genocideconfronting the shadows of his unremembered past he discovers a web of destiny stretching eons into nosgoths dim unrecorded historyas his destiny comes full circle raziel finds his personal vendetta transformed into a heros journey with the fate of nosgoth hanging in the balancefirst let me point out the weak side of thing
this game lacks any real boss fights that made the st one so good and enjoyable
therere bosses in this game but few and far between and seem alot easier to kill making them feel just like fillers to hold in the action fanitics
next is the games length
the st one was around hrs for part  its more around hrs whitch is good or bad thingjust depends on how you look at it
the last problem with this game is the endwe get another tbc endingno conlusion whats so everwith that out of the way i must aprise the grapics desginer sound and gamplay that are all topnotch
the argitcuter of the game is a sight to behold and the fluid controls make for a game anyone can pick up and play
last but not lest the sound is the one of the best to come out of the games released so farso if the pluses out weight the negitives give this game a try you will be given a lot of anweners that came up with the st game but when its over a lot more will have risen to be left unawenseredi enjoyed this game more for its graphics and dialog more than its actual gameplay
and i must say it was far too short
soul reaver for psx was longer and you were more involved in the story
there was excitement and antcipation for a sequel that just confuses me and seems very rushed
they should maybe redo this came and call it a second edition or something
as it stands it was a bit of a disappointment
great voice acting thoughi got this game effectively for free when i traded in lego batman
it was cheap and got good reviews
its a well put together product but has some issues that hurt itthe biggest thing wrong with this game is the save points
you cannot save anywhere you like only at certain shrines
normally thats not a big deal but in a couple sections of the game youll literally go two to three hours without a save point
its less if you know what youre doing or use a guide but if youve done it before theres no way to fast forward the cut scenes so you just get frustrated watching them again and if you use a guide you lose out on the major purpose of the game puzzle solving
if you have a job a life a kid etc
then just stop reading and pass on this game
theres not much sadder than getting almost to a save point and having to stop because its time to walk the dogs or change the baby
i ended up having to finish it up over a three day weekend because i could never get time to play in one stretch during the weekcut scenes are both a plus and a minus
they tell a very compelling if confusing story and make you want to move forward so you can trigger the next one
they also sometimes give you hints your going the right way or how to solve a puzzle
where they fall flat is that theyre all in game and none of them can be skipped
if you have to quit before you reach a save point you will be sitting through the same dialog and clues
it gets very old very fastyou covering the same ground repeatedly
this may or may not be a concern of yours
if youve playedmetroid primeand didnt mind the backtracking youre probably ok  the only catch here is theres generally just one way to get from point a to point b  mostly this is a good thing because those weak hints could have you wondering around forever
it also helps you figure out when youve left an area you should be in
however at times it makes the world seem really smallit seems like you lose health constantly though at a slow rate
if you die though you go to the spectral plane and can recover health
there are usually different enemies there so you can still die and have to go back to a check point but generally theyre easy and you recover health there
a few enemies can also travel there to chase you so thats your real risk of dying for realcombat is ok but mostly just pressing weak or strong attack buttons
you can mix it up with weapons which youre really better off doing than hand to hand
you also have the soul reaver which you can call at will and attack enemies
its extremely powerful but more than a little use and you start to lose health
also kills made with the reaver wont allow you to eat the enemys soul to recover health
as you progress and solve forge puzzles you gain elemental powers that say with you until you go into the spectral plane or find another fount of energythe spectral plane is also used to solve some puzzles
you can push against most gates to pass through them when youre a spirit
also you cannot climb water has no effect on you so no swimming and sometimes the landscape changes
the puzzles range from pretty cool to annoying
there are some where youre just forced to run back and change reaver powers or go collect items and cover the same ground over and over
mostly though theyre fun and satisfying to actually figure them out
sometimes theyre tricky because the games training helpful hints are very much hit or miss to show you how you should approach a puzzle
id suggest having a guide available just in case
especially if you cant save it will help a lot in the frustration departmentoverall the game is really solid and fun
id easily give it at least four stars if it wasnt for the lack of saving
it just ruined the game for me because i dont have that much time to devote to a game in one sitting
oh well still had some fun with italthough this game has a considerable amount of flaws no bosses very few save points short game length it still retains much of its predecessors entertainment value although it would be better to rent
but it shares the essential five things included in all lok games
amazing scenery
plentiful gore
superb voice acting
intriguing storyline
the best character designs in historydont buy this game but its worth a rent
if you want to buy check out blood omen legacy of kainnote the plot is more connected to blood omen than soul reaver  except for the one thing about raziels past that im not going to spoil because people whove beaten soul reaver would know what im talking aboutwhile this game is very fun i enjoyed it when i owned it
i believe amazons price is far too steep
yes i know its the sellers that set the price but there should be some way to regulate this
over  bucks for a game even if it is an older game is far too expensive
it should be perhaps  and thats still pushing it
the price for used is more like what it should be for new and used should be even cheaper because it is usedi dont really mind the combining digimon bit to slowly raise your partner to get a higher level
its kinda gratifying in a way once you reach that level after spending so much time working on it
its just too bad like some others have said your partner doesnt digivolve in battlebut i do think this game is worth playing and i think the story is really cute tooothers who have reviewed this game have raved over it  with good reason
the graphics are excellent the sound is superb and the handling of the cars is wonderful
best of all load times are extremely quick for the amount of visual detail included in the gamehowever after about a week with this game i found my interest level dropping rapidly
less than a week later i sold off the game
part of this was due to the frustration of the wanderers when you encounter them and challenge them they will always turn you down but on their own schedule  and i have yet to see any information published on what determines this schedule  the wanderers will come to challenge you
i have also received emails from many other players frustrated over thisif your interest level stays high great
if not the investment will be rather disappointing
at least gran turismo  is about to be releasedthe idea for this game is good
the finshed product is not
first off even with upgrades your car goes at least half as fast as your rivals
another thing is that there really isnt enough track to race on and the ones they give you can also get boring
i liked the idea of upgrading my car but it just didnt work out very well
some nice graphics but this game is very good overall
try gran turismo  or midnight run insteadthis game was awesome in its time but comparing this game to the games offered today its something that an average gamer wouldnt want to jump intothis is a really good p cooperation game thats next to impossible to play by yourself
you may be better playing with someone whos the same or better experience with games as you otherwise it can turn into a yelling match quotno
pull the knob
watch out
jumpquotafter hearing how great this game is i bought it on the day of the release
yup i have to admit that it was fun driving anywhere around the city even subways and water to pick updrop off passengers
the computer comments were pretty funny and there was no slowdown when number of items were on the screen at the same timebut after about  hours of playing i realized how disappointed i was with this game
as others have eluded to it gets old driving around the same city
there was no drivers or cars to unlock
this makes longevity of the game questionable
also the fact that theres no  player mode made me cringe
im not sure if the  characters had any differences between them either though i heard theyre suppose tothough this was a fun game i ended up returning it after few days
if youre looking for a fun driving game you might want to pass on this one and try rumble racing instead
now theres an idea  incorporate rumble racings unlock trackcar feature on crazy taxi or have a new track addons or something to keep the game going after a week or sothis was the first ps game i ever played and i was impressed with the graphics and sound at first
this isnt a game to buy unless you can get it cheap
there are only so many things you can do in this game
basically you are a cab driver and you have a limited amount of time to drive people to their destinations
thats the game
as i said its fun for a limited timecrazy taxi is a good game
it really is
but just after  minutes it kind of starts to get boring and you just wish there was something else to do
the original game came out several years ago before the dreamcast came out
it is fun to playif you play it once and awhile than it seems pretty new everytime
this is not a game you play for hours and everyday
at least not all the time
the graphics are just pretty much like the dreamcasts
there is no real improvment which is disapointing since the ps has much better hardware and could have pulled off some pretty neat things
they could have at least added a new city or something
what is also lagging is a multiplayer
then the game would get interesting
its not really fun watching someone else play
the sound is great but for some reason the people you pick up have more of a vocabulary than the drivers which kind of  since your driver can defend himself when the people verbally attack himher when they say quotyouquot or something like that
the control is a little slugish and youll be slamming into walls and buildings at first
but i have to admit this game is addicting just not that addicting
its a good game to get better than most for the ps right now
note ive read that a lot of people got faulty disks and everything dissapers and freezes
i was one of those people
the problem is fixed now its just that the first shipment was probebly rushed
but everything is fine now
remember the same thing happened to the ps and now look everyone is happythis game is ok
i would suggest you go with crazy taxi  xbox though
i dont know if crazy taxi  is on ps but if it is get it instead of this one
you will not regret thatthis game is a pretty good game though
but still go with  and dont get me wrongi enjoyed this game
after playing it for a while though it became the same thing over and over again
two cities are not enough
rent it firstthis was a arcade game and when i played it i bought it and thought it would be great
it was not
the graphics r good but that is the only good thing about it
there is only three people to choose from and only a couple of towns to go to
the controls r hard to use so i changed them and there is only like fifteen different people to pick up but so many places to go to
they get mad if u crash or drive slow so it gets annoying
after awile one customer has u go somewhere that is impossible to get to so u lose
the faster u get to the drop off location and the closer u drive next to vechiles the more money the people give u there is arcade mode or regular mode that lets u choose from the original mode or the other lets u choose from five ten fifteen etc miniutes
there is also a crazy box that has missions for u to do and unlock things
it is a fun game but it gets old fasti tired of this game after only a few times playing it
its a great game for rental but i wouldnt buy it if i were you
the game gets very repetitive after only a few times playing itthis game has not so great graphics but its mario and you cant go wrong with this plumber
the game is actually  well good games on it
the real classic on it mario bros  is what practically ruins the game
its very boring and unmeaningfull
but the real super mario advanced is a blast
although you can pick from only  different characters to play with this still is a great game
toad who is fast and strong but has a problem jumping
then of course theres mario who is soso good
then my personal favorite luigi who jumps amazingly but is kind of weak and is not to fast
then theres peach whos jump is horid and is the weakest and xtra sllllloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwww peach fans
the only reason i gave this game  stars is because super mario bros  and the lack of charactersi can still remember playing super mario bros  for the first time
it was a huge change in gameplay from the first game where you collected coins jumped on goombas and koopas went down pipes and took out bowser at the end of each castle level
instead of doing any of that you now defeated enemies by picking them up and throwing them at each other or by throwing vegetables or bombs at them
there werent any pipes to go down but now there were odd vases that had treasures in them but didnt take you to a later part in the level
bowser and the koopas were replaced with little masked enemies snakes and eggspitting monsters
and rather than being stuck with mario or luigi you could also play as toad and princess toadstool
yep it sure didnt feel like a mario game thats because it really wasnt but man did people love this one back in the day
i loved the game both on the nes and snes where it was a part of the super mario allstars collection
now that my daughters gotten into gaming big time we played through the game on the mario allstars collection for the wii but i got her the gba version too so she could play it on the go
id missed out on this version when the gba first came out over  years ago and as soon as i started the first level i couldnt figure out what they were thinking when they made this portgameplay remains the same more or less and i talked a little bit about it above
the games still a platformer at heart and there are  levels in each world though the final world just has  to go through
most of the worlds are either grasslands or desert but theres also an ice world and one in the clouds
you run through the stage taking out any enemies in your way or avoiding them almost entirely
you can even roam through most of the levels in their entirety at your own leisure theres no time limit and the game lets you go back to the beginning as long as you have a way of getting there
in every level youll see little bits of red grass swaying in the wind
these can be picked up with the b button and will usually be a vegetable to throw at your enemies
sometimes youll get a bomb turtle shell or up mushroom and sometimes youll get a magical red potion
when you throw this it creates a door that when opened leads you to subspace where the red grass creates coins when you pull it up and giant mushrooms can be found that add one heart to your health
it all depends on where you throw these to get the health mushroom and its best to throw these in areas with lots of red grass so you can get lots of coins which are used in a slot machine minigame when you clear each stage and is a way to get extra lives
but the subspace can also lead to a warp zone in certain areas letting you travel to later worldsthen theres the whole character selection part which was really cool when the game first came out
you had mario who was the allaround average guy with a good running speed jumping height and strength for pulling up vegetables at a fast pace
luigi wasnt as strong as mario or fast but has the highest jump of anyone
princess toadstool was the slowest weakest and had a fairly average jump but her main skill was that she could float around in the air for a few seconds before falling as long as you held the a button
toad seemed like the worst character but when you figured out that there were differences in the strengths and speeds of the characters and not just the jumps he tended to be a favorite
he had has the lowest jumpbut is the fastest and strongest
whats the point in having a lot of strength for picking up the vegetables
well when you go into a subspace area with lots of coins that need to be pulled up toad is going to be cleaning house and theres a great chance that you can get  or more coins in one go
on top of all of this theres also a super jump ability where if you hold down on the dpad for a few seconds your character will glow and they can jump much higher than they normally can
this is only really used in a few situations but still fun to do every now and thenso if its a fun game with running around throwing veggies at the bad guys whats with the  star rating
this gba version has so many things added to it that it feels like they made it for people whove never played a game before
before if you lost a heart youd have to defeat a few enemies to make a little heart icon show up then youd have to chase after it and nab it in order to get your health back
here hearts are so common that youd think theyre going out of style
you get hearts from defeating two enemies or more in the same throw can pull them up from the ground and sometimes theyre just sitting there in the stage waiting for you to get them
its hard to not die in this game
whats weird is they seemed to try and add a tiny bit of challenge by starting you out with two hearts but one of them empty as opposed to two full hearts in the original but with it being so easy to get the second heart full whats the point
there are also giant versions of some of the enemies and vegetables making it even easier to take out big groups
i get the novelty of this and it is cool to see luigi pull up a massive turnip at first but the game was just fine the way it was before
and guess what the red coins that they seemingly crowbar into every other mario game since mario  are here too
they also included a point system and a score is displayed at the top of the screen to make it more marioish i guess
but the icing on the cake for horrible things is that the characters talk
and its not just a little bit either no
they say something every single time you pick up and throw an item
with how often youre plucking vegetables and coins this gets old very fast to the point where i turned the volume down all the way after the first stage
the changes i do like include a new robot boss and certain revisions to levels though there are very few of these
and as usual for the mario advance games the original mario bros arcade game is here to playif you have the option to play super mario allstars on your wii or snes still i recommend sticking with those and ignoring this version
a lot of the challenge is gone and those voices are so grating that it makes you wonder why they were put in
i hate to sound like one of those old darshes that go on and on about how the original was better or seems like they hate new takes on old things but man do i not care for this game
even if you cant get allstars but have a wii you can get the original nes game on the virtual console for a very low price
give it a go
the only difference between that and the sneswii versions is the visuals and audio
its still fun and very playablecommonly nintendo releases a mario game with each new console super mario bros  for the nes mario world for the snes mario land for the original gb mario  for n but instead of releasing a quotnewquot mario game for the gba they decided made another remake from an old game the thirdthis game is a remake of the snes version that came with the quotsuper mario all starsquot this was the remake of the original quotsuper mario bros quot for the nes and that was the remake of quotdoki doki panicquot that was only released in japan they just added the mario characters and violaacute
super mario bros the japanese super mario bros  was very similar to smb in graphics and sound but one of the hardest mario games outthere maybe the hardest of all i dont know if that game was quotto difficultquot for america or maybe because it used a peripheral that never arrive here famicom disk system but it never arrived for the old nes instead of that nintendo of america took doki doki and made some changes here and there and released the new game as smb in japan this game was released  years later with the name quotsuper mario usaquotdont get me wrong the original smb is a good game in the tradition of the mario franchise not as good as smb but certainly far superior to doki doki and the snes remake was very faithful to the original i mean the game is fun but the gba version is very modified from the original smb and the added voices are anoying but the challenge is almost the same than the original so i only recomend this game if and only if you lived in a cave the last two decades and never played this game but i doubt it so muchi recommend super mario advance  instead of this game is almost a carbon copy to the original yoshis island and less known than smb so maybe a lot of people never have played it or maybe sm advance  smb that is a much better game than thisok first of all this doesnt have enough new feautres  keep it intresting even tho it has  games in  i would rather have seen new levels and better items and more than just  options of multiplayer i think if they put enough time in it they could have probably made this game  the gbcgame boy color well atleast super mario bros i think ill just wait  super mario bros   gbagame boy advancesuper mario  is the stupid mario game but it does bring back alot of memorys
it is neat that games that i grew up with are now coming out on the gbai really was not able to enjoy this title as much as i thought
bosses are hard the whole game looks cartoony and it was not able to hold my interest for very long
definetely a weak titlei picked up the import of this game and am really enjoying it
super mario bros  is an all time favorite of mine and the gba version is pretty good
great graphics excellent sound lots of voices and some nice additional touches
but this game really is just smb with some very slight changes and made slightly easier
i was under the impression this was going to be an all new mario game based on the smb engine
this marks the first release of a nintendo system without a truly new mario game
which was disappointingbut as long as you know this is just a slightly enhanced smb you cant go wrongnintendo is taking all their mario games from the nintendo tweaking them ever so little and then repackaging them as new original games
i loved the mario games when i was a kid still do
 but all these games are much more difficult on the gba then the nintendo
ive beat all the original mario games but it was difficult for me to do with the gba
i wouldnt recommend this game for children as they may find it too difficult to controli was disappointed to see that nintendo chose super mario  the lamest of all the mario games for this fabulous new game boy
dont get me wrong the graphics are beautiful and the game play is true to the original but i do get tired of the little exclamations and comments the characters make in the game whenever they get hurt or die
as for the other mario game included on this game pak theres not much point to it unless you have another player to play it with
most people will probably like this game just fine especially the younger players but i just detest super mario  and i resent having it thrust upon me again it came with the game boy advancethis is a ac adapter not a battry packit works fine and i have had no problems from itthe rd definite step in the nintendo handheld systems was the game boy advance
not only was it the most sophisticated step in handheld systems yet it remains the most comfortable to use as well as being the only game boy system to be  backwards compatible both original color and advance games can be played on the game boy advancequite frankly the graphics capability of the gba was truly groundbreaking for a handheld system
it took the super nintendo approach to graphics and even improved it
a typical game boy advance game is pure eye candy clear and pleasing to watch with few visible limitations
animations are more alive than ever before and as such each game is pleasing to take in
the sound system is the most sophisticated yet for a bit machine  even old game boy games sound melodic on the gba and its the first bit console to deliver nearperfect voice tracksthe design of the gba is wonderful  and i dont just mean the beautiful semitransparent hardplastic casing with the dpad and the action buttons on separate sides of the screen like the sega game gear only much smoother it has never been more comfortable to play a game boy console
whats more batteries live a long life on this machine and even when the battery light turns red youre guaranteed a few more hours of uninterrupted play
to top it off the gba is light as a feather  youll laugh once you think of the chunk of pounds that was the original game boythe only minus i can give the gba is the terrible screen way too dark and overreliant oon backlight
my game boy color is better lit than the game boy advance  even a separately purchased light is of little help  and this means that youre restricted to playing in clear light
sure the gbas pros  the aesthetic and comfortable design great graphics and especially the enormous library of games open to play disposal  should more than make up for it but with the sp version of the machine already out this has simply become an obsolete purchaseits just a shame that the nintendo ds was released so shortly after advance and left it without as many crowning achievement games as it should have had though its still not to say that the game boy advance is without its host of good games far from it  just the mass of super mario games open to the machine is reason alone to buy it as well as a number of games whose calibre one expected in the past to wind up on the sega megadrive consolein overview the game boy advance is a gemstone in nintendos already nearspotless repertoire of userfriendly video game systems with much to offer
looking closer its downright embarrassing that something as meagre as the dark screen should seal its downfall
the advance sp fixes that and manages to be even more comfortable
if youre an oldskool gamer as well as a gba enthusiast by all means get the advance ps
if youre only interested in titles for gba and up get the nintendo ds
as for the original advance its simply not worth getting unless the beautiful design really does it for youprosbeautiful designcomfortablelightcheap on powerlarge library of gamesconscreen is way too dark which limits playing environmentsoverall but spend the extra money and pick up an sp
the gba sp puts the gba to shame
for the extra  dollars you get a lighted screen which helps tremendously
the rechargeable battery saves probably about that  dollars in a year just in battery costs
if you must buy this gba i recommend you pick up a light and magnifier combo
when i was a child i had the original gameboy and had no light or magnifier
i had  vision to that point and the next year after owning the game boy for a year i needed glasses
the light you need to get for this gba should be a light on the side with a magnifier
if you buy a worm light or the like it just reflects off the screenwe bought two of these for our children and were very dissapointed
how in the world can anybody play these things
the screens are so dark as to almost seem inopperable
i really thought there was something wrong with our units when we first tried them out
bought two lights two magnifying lights two ac adapters and game protectors
units  games plus assessories probably set us back around  and you still cannot see the screen
sure a light assessory helps a bit but be warned you must otherwise sit in bright light to play these thingswell my sister bought herself a game boy advance back in may
i at the time was also quite exited as i had been wanting a gba for over a year
well when she bought the system i myself bought an xbox instead and played it for a few hours she loved it
i persounally was easily bored
why
 games not too good
ive played dozens and i havent really found one that i enjoyed
for example mario kart advance for the gba
you can race as  characters in dozens of arenas
you try to get st place in any arena
sure this is fun but after a few hours it gets pretty dull
the screen is small and sitting there looking straight down at it hurts your neck the controls are limited with just four buttons
and the truth is  percent of the games are aimed at kids
your not going to find a really deep rpg or an awsome fighter or even a decent shooter
the graphics here are still handheld and the most this system can support is mariothe games are usually quick easy to beat and lose interest after a few hours of gameplay
i was not impressed by the games that i played the controls and the graphics
it it pretty fun on a road trip but around home it gets boringas for the few good games you do find they are quite fun
but is it something youre going to be playing for  even  hours
ask yourself before u make this investment as most of the games itself cost  even bucks each
are these games right for u the system itself very good system actually
it can play all current and past game boy games game boy game boy pocket game boy color etc
meaning u can probably find a few  game boy color games that will keep you entertained for hours
but u know your old game boy color can do that toothe game boy advance is very small and can easily be brought along on a road trip in a purse or back pack or even some big pockets
and for how small it is it can do a lot
you can connect up to  game boy advances together and race each other in mario kart or battle in a game of sonic
it can hook up to a tv or even link to a local gamecube and be used as an additional controller be used to visit special levels in games on via gc and gba animal crossing comes to mind and it even has headphones so u can enjoy your favorite mario game during a long bus ride or use them to not disturb others on a roadtrip
it can do a lot of things and is probably the greatest handheld ever made
thats why its sold millions thats why i enjoy playing iton the downside it cant support graphics like major consoles can for example madden tony hawk etcboth looked terrible as most of those games look decent at best and are in d
it only has  buttons so its hard to enjoy any games that require a lot of options sports games fighting games games that require tricks etc
and by far the systems worst problemthe lighting
 you can never see the screen
you have to turn a lamp on sitting next to your couch or carlight to play itin broad daylight
in roadtrips youll always find yourself aiming the screen right at the window for light and even then u cant read text or see much detail in color
the game boy advance cant be played half the time because in many places u just cant see
and even with those handy snake lights they take up  or  batteries every few hours and cause glareseven more seeing problems
this took a large part of my enjoyment and brought my rating of the gba down from a  out of five stars to  overall the gba is a very advanced system
it has a huge lineup of games not just for the gba but all of the old game boy game boy color game boy pocket etcit has a ton of features and while it cant support super mario sunshine its graphics look awsome in games like super mario advance   its small easy to use and very reliable
my sister treats hers like dirt but its still working like its brand newid reccomend the game boy advance for kids  and younger or older gamers who can afford it and not have to sacrifice getting an xbox gamecube or ps
its a great sturdy reliable and fun system and its always something to grab when youve got a long trip ahead of u  it kills the time tremendously trust me especially when playing through a great game like metroid fusionjust make sure u bring a lightand a few extra batteriesthxi wasnt a big fan of the game boy advance though it might be partly because im not a big handheld fan so i wont be too harsh
the graphics are better than the game boy color but theyre not great
there are more buttons than the gbc and the screen is bigger which is nice
you can also play gbc games on it and i think the original game boy games too and when playing the older games you can either have the screen the original size or you can press a button to make it fill the screen but this will stretch the images
there is a good variety of games like zelda mario kingdom hearts etcso overall the gba isnt a super exciting handheld but if you like handhelds its perfectly finethe graphics for the game boy advance are outstanding and there are a lot of really good games for it too but i do have a few problems with itthe major thing that really annoys me is the lack of backlighting
why havent the people at nintendo figured that one out yet
i know it would probably add about  to  to the price but the system is cheap right now and i would be more than happy to pay the extra money to be able to see what i am doing
and dont tell me to buy a worm light they arent the solutionmy second complaint is the configuration
i know the gba was designed with child sized hands in mind and not for me but that still doesnt exuse the fact that it is somewhat uncomfortable to try and play a game for any period of time especially when you have to hole it at a certain angle to be able to see anythingthe third and final complaint is that there are not enough buttons
a lot of the games for gba are adapted versions of old super nintendo games but that is just it they have to be adapted because there are not enough buttons on the gba
there is plenty of empty space to fit at least  more buttons but for some reason they are just not thereall in all gba is a great system with amazing games and graphics
so until sony comes out with their own handheld yeah right with final fantasy x on it in your dreams i guess well just have to settle for gba
maybe thats what they need is a little competition they havent had any since segas virtual flop that didnt last more than a year and is impossible to find anymorei bought this game because it was the cheapest game available and it looked pretty good and i had read good reviews
i started playing and it was pretty good then about three days later it started to get extremely boring
for one thing the races are five laps long and they take nearly  minutes sometimes which if youre sitting down playing a boring video game is a long time
then if you dont get at least rd place in that race you cant go on to the next unless you continue and you have just wasted a lot of time
and the racing isnt very exciting either after you get good even if its on hard mode
spend an extra ten dollars and get a game like tony hawk  it appeals to a much larger audience
this game just wasnt for me
rent it and play the hell out of this game then see how you feel about it
you will probabably get sick of it
plan on doing multiplayer in this game if you want it to keep entertaining youthis game is sooo cool for several reasonsthe graphics are cool and exactly the same as the super nes versionits fun to do multiplayer but you can only do one race with the same vehicles with different colors if you only have one game cartridge
you probably wont find someone else with the same game though
the game is fast which is exciting in d for gbathe down part is there are only  hovercars to choose from and only one the jb crystal has the best turning and speed
it is really frustrating to use all the other cars because none of them are nearly as good as jb crystaloverall you probably would want this game but consider what i saidthis expansion is good but there have been few changes from elite force
there are new models and new skins there is also a new option and some new maps but no major changes
the expansion add a great option to walk around and explore voyager
from the bridge to sick bay and the cargo bay to the holodeck you are able to enter new worlds on the holodeck including an episode of the holonovel capitan proton you can even launch the autodestruct on the bridge as for the maps these are good esp
for multiplayer games and deathmatches
there are also new skins and models but as with the maps if you play online for a while the maps and the skins will download from the server so you could get them for free to tell the truth the addition of the voyager option is a good reason to buy it but because of the lack of other additions i can only give this  starsif you can get it cheap definitely pick up this expansion pack for the first elite force  one of the best trek games ever made
the new disk is obviously tilted towards multiplayer having limited additions for dedicated singleplayer users
there are new holomatches  though they seem arguably as good as those you can find for free online
for the singleplayer this pack offers some nifty ifpointless missions on the holodeck and a nifty is comparably pointless scavenger hunt where you must search the voyager for actionfigures of your favorite voyager characters
theres also a wicked looking puzzle game pitting you against the borg
the pack is built around a virtualtour of the voyager  much like those of the original ef only without you having to be anywhere or meet anybody and being able to visit any deck rather than those related to a specific missionmapthe stuff here looks good and while its annoying to nitpick with quality the problem here is that the stuff that looks nice shows how much better this pack could have been
the holodeck maps are excellent  including one inside of a klingon base that boasts some of the best atmospherics of ef or even the jedi knight games also based on the quakeiii engine
theres also a holomap based on captain proton in black and white of course which looks niftier than it is you spend a lot of time just walking and dodging raygun blasts as you navigate the impressive looking canyons of dr chaotica
you finish the maps only to find yourself back on voyager with little to do wondering why the rest of the packs offerings werent as fun as the holodeck
the virtual tour is also a washout because theres a ton of detail and zero action  sort of descriptive of an episode of the showsome have sought and paid exorbitant sums for this pack thinking that rd party addons for elite force wont work without it
that may be true but most issues relating to addons can normally be solved adjusting hunkmegs settings in the base gamein short singleplayer users are better off just sticking with the base game
the pack comes with some interesting yet otherwise unrewarding additionsi bought this thinking it would play gameboy color games
i was wrong
it only plays gameboy titles compatible with the originalpocketmicro systems
that means i can only play pokemon yellow which is the oldest cart i gotmillionaire rd edition is fun and challenging but some stuff bugs me in this game
but first the prosproslots of questions and very challengingregis is always funnythe sounds make the game because you can be at the  level and feel nervous during the time they make you wait until you have gotten it right or not
the soundtrack makes it dramaticconsthe fatest finger
if you get it wrong many times regis leaves and the game starts overthe stupid phone a friend sucks
although the start questions the phone a friend helps in the later parts of the game it is useless
regis called this dufus and he had a fire and hung up
regis said that wasnt much help
what an idiot
the friend did not even attempt to answer the question
shame on buena vista interactivethis game is lots of fun and should be bought
but some of the other features like the lifelines will drive you insanei think i speak for everyone when i say thank goodness the millionaire phenomenon is over with
even though its been over with for about  years now for some reason the video games are still somewhat popular
no reason for it
let the games end and let the show be just a memory
hey i have nothing against this game its pretty good but the questions are challenging i just think overexposing regis played a big part in bringing the millionaire craze to a sudden end
buy the game if youre smartwho wants to be a millionaire third edition was one of the last editions for the pc
made with regis philbin
still he still has his zany and enduring way with handling people made him a very big hit with audiences all over the usa it is just a shame that he is no longer hosting millionaire anymore
instead one of the people from the view is taking over
unbelieveable isnt itwhat makes who wants to be a millionaire different the third time around is that the questions are a little bit more complex
not only that but if you go to a certain website you can download new question patches to play all about millionaire
unfortunately those patches that you can download contain only  questions anyway in the main seat but in the fast finger category there are more
i really enjoyed spending time with the game it is just a shame that it isnt fun anymore like it was in primetime on abcthe reason why im giving it a  is because the only way i couldve won the million is because i downloaded the patches from the net
if you want to be a millionaire i suggest you buy this game
youre not going to win a real million it is just a game
if youre also a fan of regis philbin i also suggest you get this too final answerthis game is setting a new idea that really makes it worth a try
after months of this game being pushed off further and further when it finally arrived on store shelves i was a bit hesitant on picking it up
thq tends to come up with a great idea and then makes a mistake in the implementation such cases being the game boy advance game gt advance and the playstation and dreamcast game evil dead
the idea of blowing through walls with a bazooka sounded great but it had to be seen to believedoverall the game is average
the selection of weapons is interesting and the enemies are your usual range of foot soldier to highly armored gunner
nothing spectacular there
the level design is pretty unique and once you get deeper into the game gets quite varied in textures and feelas a savior to the game the demolition ability is amazing
with a rocket launcher you can punch through walls allowing you to get to other areas or get a sneak surprise on your enemy
this is especially well done in the multiplayer levels  but in story mode there arent many walls you can punch a hole through and the availability of the guns ammo is few and far between
the other downfall to the ability to knock through a wall is that it wasnt too often that you came across a strategic time to use it
near the beginning there is a chance to knock out a bridge so a convoy of soldiers and a tank
it looks really well done and gets the player excited about the capabilities and then the game goes on to deliver nothing more than blowing up guys through walls
and even that is few and far betweenoverall the game is addictive and runs at a good and steady  or so frames per second and the multiplayer mode can be quite addictive
i think with a little more thought and a better plot a game in the future could use the geo mod technology to make an incredibly immersive environment that red faction failed to dored faction is probaly the best first person shooter ive played since  for n
i was pleasantly surprised w the game play and the weaponry the game provided
i definite purchaseps i cant wait for the  shooter to come out for the psif you liked bond and perfect dark for  then this game is right down your alleyright
nothis game is in the same genre but those games blow red faction out of the watersure the graphics in red are better but what kind of control scheme uses both analog stickshonestly
once you get the hang of it after hoursit still begins to bug youthis game is a good game dont get me wrong but it should have had the option to change the controlsrent this game first before buying it to see if it is right for youid write what i thought was wrong with this game here but  veillords come to mars view a load screen review on this page sums it up perfectly
so i wont waste my time typing all that because i agree completely with what he has already writtenhowever id like to add one more complaint against this game
later on in the game there is little to no health or armor whereas in the beginning of the game it was littered everywhere
i found myself having an abundance of health items left lying around when they did appear but during the battles with the mercs lo and behold health and armor werent too abundant which made for some numerous and very frustrating deaths and load sessionsmy friends raved about this game back in the day so i picked it up a couple of years ago expecting something great
in fact they still tell me its a great game
i wonder which game they were playing
no way could it have been this one
i am about  minutes from the final boss in this game and im going to find the ending to watch online because i cant suffer through anymore mediocrity and cheap deaths
youve been warned about this gamethis game was very good when it came out but it cant hold up to timesplitters  frontline nightfire or a lot of shooters for other systems
the graphics and a i arent very good
blowing everything up is just a gimmick
i rarely used it and there are a lot of limitations on what you can blow up
there is a good weapon selectiona good length and not much elseim just so disappointed in this game
i had such high hopes in the beginning
it was as good as all the reviews said reasonable graphics good controls fun weapons ok story and even though the terrain damage is only a gimmick and one quickly forgotten it was nice to see from time to time
a fun game
it also has great configuration options letting you remap buttons and play with either normal or inverted yaxis this is a deal breaker in a game as far as im concerned
i cannot play a game where up moves you down and down moves you upand then the mercenaries come and the rail gun manages to nearly ruin the game
whoever decided to add it is almost wholly responsible for turning the last half of the game into nothing more than a frustrating series of saves and loadsallow me to explain
see the rail gun sounds like a great idea
it can kill in one shot and it has an infrared scope that allows you to see enemies through doors thin walls etc
seems like a great cheap weapon to give people so if the game gets too tough they can rely on that crutch
however the problem is that the mercenaries can use them too
they will wait behind things and blast you because you have to move forward
more than one of them will sometimes have this gun at the same time
they will sit there and kill you instantly forcing you to reload just to get a crack at them again
the only way to get past some of these scenarios is if the mercenary misses
because of where i saved i had to play one segment ten times and  of those were due to impossible to avoid rail gun hits
thats just unacceptable i hate cheap deathswhile the first part of the game is truly great the second half of this game has you spending  seconds saving your game after every minor battle and then watching the reload screen for  seconds after you periodically die an unavoidable death
if you cant put up with this scenario avoid this game
otherwise it really is a decent title
without the rail gun the game is easily a  or maybe  staras a wrestling game simpsons doesnt really cut it but it does provide loads of fun
simpsons wrestling has all of the characters from the television show so everyone will be able to choose a player that they like
this game is more based around fun than serious playing so if you want to wrestle seriously i would recommend that you buy smackdown
i feel that  they have brought out a lighthearted version to entertain everyone and keep the younger end of the market happy although i play it and im rayman is a tough item to review
i dont have the gba version but i do have the pc version which is exactly the same
first off i recommend only people who have never played this game before to purchase itas far as the actual gameplay goes rayman is a mixed bag
rayman earns his moves banjokazooie style from a fairy and runs jumps and later swings and glides throughout many levels
the variety apparent in the levels is sometimes great
youll turn tiny to fit through gaps or using your spinning hair as blades cut ropes attached to giant stones and a huge stone slap while dodging obstacles to prevent yourself from drowning in the water below one of the games most intense scenarios
but alas this is where the problem in the game lies
this game is very very difficult
it will take countless tries to get past certain levels
this wouldnt normally be so bad
the catch is you have a limited number of continues to get through the game resulting in only about a total of  tries
this problem will not seem apparent in the first stages but  of the game will frustrate even seasoned gamers and infuriate anyone below a good skill levelthankfully the rest of rayman is a joy to play
aside from polygon powerhouses such as iridon d and tony hawk  you wont be seeing better graphics on the gba thus far
the music is surprisingly good also
and the huge hulking bosses are a great diversion from the regular game as are mr hats various minigames
if you feel the hunger for some platforming action castlevania is the way to go
if youre not into that series get this
but be warned  if anger management classes arent up your alley or youre getting this for a kid as their first game  get mario bros advance insteadi played this a couple days ago at a friends house
its the only halflife i dont own so i wanted to see what it was likeblue shift is a good enough game as are all the hls but i did have a few problems with it no new weapons kinda short the price thirty bucks is pretty steep for such a short expansion
i would like to buy a copy of this but ill wait for the cost to come down or pick it up used somewhereif this game were ten or fifteen dollars cheaper i would have given in  starswhen i heard that yet another expansion pack for halflife was about to be released i snaffled a copy as soon as i could
and as i thought halflife blue shift did not disappoint in terms of graphics gameplay excitement and fun
but the problem is that you can finish this expansion in  hours on the difficult setting
now i live in south africa and i payed r thats about  for it
then i discovered why it wasis so expensive  it includes the retail version of opposing force and  the halflife highdefinition pack
so of course i went and played the entire series with the new hd pack and it was great
so i suppose if you were buying blue shift by itself it wouldnt be worth it
but again i already had the retail version of opposing force and the return offer for opposing force was only open to canada and the usa so bummer for me for not being in the northern hemisphere yet again
well all that aside heres my take on blue shift
in this expansion pack you assume the role of barney calhoun a security guard at black mesa
just like gordon freeman you start your day normally with the usual drudge of the autotram and suiting up
however barney and the entire black mesa facility are soon inexplicably thrown into a world of bloodthirsty aliens and merciless and unforgiving soldiers
and of course the only way out is to fight  you cant really fault the storyline as it follows the same type of adventure as the previous  installments
and there are new places to explore and different objectives in some instances so i guess that blue shift gets a  for the story etcin terms of difficulty blue shift is actually very easy
even on the hardest setting its a cakewalk and for seasoned fps players and halflife fans this game will no doubt be a walk in the park
no new enemies or weapons either bummer
 so in terms of new weapons blue shift gets  because the mp changes to an m assault rifle when you apply the hd
pack so nothing really new im afraid
in terms of difficulty its  for easy  for normal and  for hard
just trust me the game is not very challenging and will most likely be a fragfest for most gamers and theres never a shortage of ammo unless youre a triggerhappy freak
so blue shift just aint a challenge my friendsthe characters you encounter include scientists soldiers and various aliens that youve probably seen a thousand times
so no points for blue shift on that level
as a security guard you will now need to use helmets and body armour to keep yourself safe instead of hev and pvc chargers like gordon freeman and adrian shephard
in this way theres a new approach to protecting yourself which is a refreshing change
you wont fight the more advanced powerful aliens as shephard did and you wont encounter any desert eagles sniper rifles saws or anything cool like that
in some ways blue shift is a regression but nonetheless its still fun as hell and action is fast realistic and furious
 for gameplayoverall halflife blue shift scores a comfortable  or  if you like
my personal advice is that if you want value for money this probably isnt worth it
if youre looking for a real challenge look elsewhere
if youre looking for a huge expansion pack well opposing force is bigger but thats it
if you just wanna kill s frag run jump and play with the allnew hd pack on all halflife games and are a halflife fan then you should already have this game
im reluctant to just say buy it
thats what ive found and what others have agreed upon so you be the judge
not bad at all but too short too easy and very few new featuresi was one of halflifes biggest fans when it first came out
it ran so poorly on my old p that i ran out and upgrade to an amd k  w a voodoo  card just to play it
half life im sorry to say almost brought a relationship to ruin before i learned to temper my interest
the plot the players involvement in whats going on around you the attention to detail and your immersion in a world thats just real enough that when the everything starts hitting the fan you begin to feel like its actually happening in your own worldto say nothing about the multiplayer capabilities
the previously mentioned relationship once again faced abandonment once i got dslquotblue shiftquot wants to be like half life was and it wants to really hard
but it fails in so many ways
for one its too short
for two it doesnt feel quite as connected to the first two games in this series half life and the other expansion pack opposing force another fine example of immersion and plot
if you play blue shift to the bitter end youll understand what i meanthere are plenty of scripted sequences and more interaction with the scientists
plus theres the muchvaunted quothidefinition packquot with plenty of new textures and skins so that not every scientist or soldier looks like a clone of the lastbut it aint enough
your character just isnt quite as compelling as adrian the solder from opfor or gordan freeman from half life
you jump you fight you die you replaymaybe im just getting tired of the same old black mesa or the world of xan
or maybe i was unhappy with the fact that blue shift didnt add much by way of multiplayer quotstuffquoton the plus side however blue shift comes with opfor
so if youve never played opfor and you have an old copy of half life lounging around and youve got a hankering to jump around flip some switches and hammer on some scientists with a crowbar buy this gameotherwise go play some quotcounterstrikequot or purchase quotreturn to castle wolfensteinquot
youll spend your money more wisely thenblue shift or bs as it is sometimes called affectionately i might add has remained a pretty controversial move by valve
did it pay for itself
did valve simply want to keep the fandom salivating
i think the real reason blue shift was released was to update the weapon models and keep the game looking halfway decent spotted a pun
i didnt
the game actually does very well for what its objective was
you get your professional quality extra missions and the idea of revisiting those infamous areas from another angle and time is simply fascinating if you take a moment to look around
the tradition put in place by gearbox software where you see gordon jump into the portal to the xen homeworld is one of the selling points behind this game series
of course blue shift lets you play as the barney as some people call him
hes not that barney or that other one
hes the one in the tram
what tram you say
well it doesnt really matter except to say that he is the one who escapes the disaster of black mesa
if opfor was the depressing chapter the empire strikes back where we find out that the gman iswell the low point of halflife blue shift is the relatively uplifting finale and the chronicle of one of halflifes individual victorieswhat you see is mostly new and the level geometry is vastly improved though the enemy ai is still that just postmetal gear solid scripted stuff as valve took pains not to break compatability with old mapping styles and old maps and mods are still quite playableif there is anything that i can say which you wont read anywhere else its this the music isnt anything new
the opposing force opfor in the jargon of our embedded game reporters music though i spent many hours playing it on a regular stereo under headphones is only suitable 
with noise inappropriate painfully solid and metallic reverb effects its not the base but rather the higher frequencies that are a killer bizzare and sometimes randomly constructed passages and generally too predictable advancement from the beginning to the end it seems at times as if a simple heart beat or gordons breathing would have been an appropriate replacement which wouldnt have occupied the larger portion of the diskthats not to say some of these sections frankly work the section where you are trapped inside behind a blast door as an osprey takes off works pretty well in conjunction with a rapid fire series of staccato drum beat and the very last sections music sets the melancholy introspective nature of the soldiers predestined fate in opposing force
that said blue shift appropriates this music of questionable aesthetic qualities and does not attempt to improve on it at all
i dont feel it was an appropriate way to constrain the cost of developing this standalone expansion and a selection of some of halflifes excellent original tracks would have been quite welcome here
after all one remembers tracks  and many of the others from halflife long after the pain and oppresion of the whole posthl game audio have faded from your mind
track  from the original halflife
one of the best game tracks in existance on any format
track  from blue shift
i have no clue what it is anymore and it may have been one of the better ones though i think  was more promisingthat said you dont have to suffer through that music playing the original halflife or any multiplayer mode with the improved weapons models
at this price you have little to complain about and another classic halflife box design sitting on your shelf with the barney on it is certainly not embarrasing for a gamer
give it a tryi installed blue shift and then won it within a couple hours
yes it was fun but it was way too small
there are only a few available weapons and most of the challenge is devoted to navigation puzzles and pushingbarrelscrates puzzles
it is not worth the money
as an optional free download it would have been excellentwhen a game sells  million copies and is still going strong nearly three years after its initial release one would think that a sequel would have already found its way to the shelves
however when the game in question is half life arguably the best selling and best reviewed game in modern computer history the rules that apply to other titles simply do not apply here
with a endless supply of fan made levels modifications dominating hard the world over and with a mod counter strike being the most popular online game one would wonder if valve is in no rush to release a follow up to the game
the highly anticipated team fortress  is over a year and a half past its anticipated release and has yet to make it onto the release radar for the near future
half life  is a top secret project that has a tighter lid of security around it than the next star wars film and the colonels secret recipe
so what is a half life fan to do with nothing on the horizon save for a few fan mods
well the folks at gearbox have created a follow up to their smash success half life opposing force and retuned to the black mesa facility with  half life blue shift
the original half life cats players in the role of scientist gordon freeman as he attempted to escape from the black mesa facility following a accident that saw the facility flooded with all manner of deadly creatures as well as ruthless government troops sent to silence anyone who saw to much
opposing force expanded the role by casting players as cpl sheppard and special forces soldier dispatched to black mesa to restore order
in blue shift players get to take on the role of security guard barney calhoun
the events in the game take place at the same time as the other two games as barney attempts to get out of the black mesa facility
along the way players will battle monsters soldiers solve puzzles and help stranded scientists along the way
while the game was fun it was far to short
i was able to complete the entire game in under five hours and found myself wanting more after i was done
the game does not offer any new weapons and while the graphics engine is updated and updates the graphics on half life and opposing force there really is little here to make it stand out from a fan made mod
there are no new weapons monsters or settings in the game and i was surprised to discover that the game did not feature a boss monster anywhere along the way as the previous games in the series did
a further piece of concern and yes it is nitpicking is that the character you play in blue shift often interacted with freeman and sheppard in the previous games but freeman is seen only briefly and has no real impact on the game
that being said it is important to know that blue shift was originally designed to be a console only game and it was decided to offer the game for pc users as a bridge to the upcoming half life   blue shift also comes with the full version of opposing force a utility to update the graphic resolution of half life and opposing force as well as a rebate for those players who have previously purchased opposing forces
the game also does not require any previous version of half life to play though understanding the half life story will greatly fill in the games storyline
in summary blue shift is a nice return to a classic game scenario but is far to short and fails when compared to the previous titles in the series
 out of  system requirements p mb ram mb hdd recommended system pii mb ram d acceleratorwhen i was looking at the reviews on this page i thought to myself quotoh come on they cant be all that badquot
curious i bought it off the bargin rack and then the adventure began
unfortunatly this adventure is probably the lamest in the halflife universe
its not that the game is all that made its just that there area
no new weaponsb
no new bossesbut then agian maybe i was just expecting too much when i bought this game
trust me this game is bad enough dont waste your timehalf life  was a fantastic first person shooting game released somewhere around  this blue shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for half life  to be blunt the first expansion opposing force is better because it offers more guns new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters
blue shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under  hours to complete the first time around
thankfully blue shift comes with the previous expansion opposing forceblue shift takes you through black mesa and xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade
you start the expansion riding the tram to work just like half life  after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from half life the gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways
the good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you barney calhoun a blue shift security guard at black mesa against hundreds of marines sent into the black mesa facility
usually you fight  marines at a time in wide open areas
the enemies will scatter when you throw grenades run away from you try to flank you and fan out so youre not shooting enemies like dominosthe negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn
it feels cheap compared to half life  and opposing forcethere are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists although its not much of a rescue because any of them can die and it doesnt matter
the expansion also dabbles in having an important character dr rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion
guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice actingin all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack without levels just one continuous game
chances are you can get this expansion with one of the deluxe half life  games so save some money and get blue shift there insteadhalf life  blue shift is a first person shooter it is the second expansion pack to half life created by gearbox the same company that did opposing force built on the quake half life engine
bs supports three video modes software rendering direct d open gl default and dfx mini
bs is a stand alone game meaning that you dont need the orginal half life for installation play half life before you play this game or else you would not understand the story and it might spoil you half life gameplay when you play later
here you play a security gaurd barney calhon in the black mesa research center when you are taking the tram ride to work in the first level of the orginal game half life you could see a security gaurd pounding on the door that is the charecter you play here
the graphics sound and charecter details are much better here there are even reflective surfaces you could see one when you are in the tram ride but still the graphics are nowhere by todays standards
blue shift has the same weapons from the orginal game no really orginal weapons and not all half life weapons either
the crowbar is here thats good it is the best weapon that needs no ammo but the crossbow is not available you could get all hl weapons only if you cheat
blue shift does not have many monstors no new monstors or tough ones
another surprise is that bs does not have the big boss climax either though it has a good ending i liked the half life ending but not many gamers did all gamers would love the bs ending if only it did not come very soon
though blue shift is very short with very few weapons few monstors and dated graphics it is a must if you are a half life fanbuying blue shift forces one to make a choicedo i care enough about the story line of halflife to shell out a few bucks for a continuationthe game itself is good
it is not an improvement of the previous versions halflife opposing force etc
however it is a continuation of the story
there are some cutecool tieins from the previous games like when you see gordon jumping through the portal to xenthere is also the high definition pack which improves the graphicslookfeel of the weaponshowever one note of warning if you play halflife in deathmatches the hd pack makes it difficult to use the crosshairs  why
well for instance the tip of the m covers up the crosshairs somewhat when it fires
in the game this is not an issue but in hldm it can be problemtatic
the solution to this is to change crosshairs to more visible onesbut i digressbasically the game is nice from a story continuity standpoint but if you dont care about the quotgordonquot story then it is probably not worth buyingi was really really exicted about blueshift when i heard in january  that it was coming out i always wondered what it would be like to fight as a security guard im dispionted iwasted my time and money for a game that wasnt nearly as goodas i was hoping it to be
i mean i like blueshift and all buti think sierragearbox and valve rushed and did a lousy jobon blueshift
i ran blueshift after installing the high definition content which came with the game itself and i was impressed with the more smoother impressive graphical changes withen the characters and weapons in halflifeblueshift
i ran blueshift on my mhz intel pentium mmx with the nvdia tntalong with  megabytes of sdram it ran great
yetyou see gordon freeman a few times experience the diasters at the facility save scientists fight aliens and go eventually to there world fight marines go to work whats new
oh andthe worst part of all isno multiplayer
how can any halflife game do thatblueshift is dying for multiplayer
besides the point i felt sorry for the game so i gave it  stars just to be niceas rpgs go this is fairly average
its different from the main final fantasy series or the final fantasy legends series
one thing that makes it different is that its realtime so you dont have to fight enemies and can just walk past them if you feel like it though you do still need to fight some if you want to levelup and advance through the gamethis game is not overly impressive or memorable
if youre a diehard final fantasy buff you may want to try this game once
it provides at least several hours of distraction and the storyline is okay
you get a total of eight spells throughout the game and the itemsweapons are also very limited
in the end you only have a few essential weapons that you cannot discard once you get them options are very limited so this is a game that you may only want to play once much like the first final fantasy game for the nesfinal fantasy legend iii part of the saga series in japan billed as final fantasy in the us to boost sales is actually a decent game despite dated mode graphics and cheesy pregba sounds
its a standard personparty rpg that requires some tedious leveling equipment upgrades and several quests across a variety of settings
the storyline had a lot of potential and while incomplete at parts should leave you satisfied at the endwhy the high rating for this ancient game
the game brings back a lot of memories of the old days
is it worth playing now
if you own the game but never managed to play it i suggest you do
if you can get a good used price pick it up
some of the tunes are catchy and the gameplay is pretty smooth
also if you cant be bothered to upgrade your portable system to a game boy advance this is one of the best rpgs available on the game boythis game is a blast but i must say its extremly shawdow
fans of the old dodge ball game from an older nintendo system will probly love this game i did but then i unlocked everything in a hour or so sure there is more matches to play but its just a bunch of the same i wore this game out in a day or two which is a shame because its a great gamejust not enough substance
get it if you pay  or less definatly think about it strongly otherwisethey did a cartoon based on it that was mediocre but amusing at times
i always wanted to give this game a try to see what it was based on
picking this up for around  i just needed not painful to play but it is quite enjoyable save a few issues the levels are pretty short
in some levels you fight maybe  enemies then the boss
dont misunderstand thats not  different types thats a total of  enemies
odd your gun is pathetic
you have k rounds because it takes like  shots to do any damage to the most minor of enemies
youll spend most of the game having the suit use jim as a whip around level  yes that is the level name it gets really cheap with platforms that are very difficult to discern from the background and missing one is an immediate lost life
fair warning play this level in a dark area with your back light on or dont bother playing itstill this is the first time ive ever had an earthworm in a mechanical suit ride a runaway giant hamster which could be cajoled into eating kittens
also hats off to the boss battle which is literally fighting a fish in a fish bowel
the fish has the same offensive capabilities as it would in real life ie
none
coolwell i cant lie
this game is not very good
if you like star fox this should hold you until a better space shooting game comes out
you only use the a button
thats it
now for the good part
the grafix rock
it is like playing a computer game
really detailed and d envirnments give this game another star
if you really need a space shooter game for your gba go for it
but if you could care less on what tipe of game it is and you are only looking for a good fun game steer away from this game if your controlls allow you tothis game looks extremely impressive at first glance however dont be fooled by beautiful graphics
most reviews of this game have shown that this game has horrible gameplay
this is one of those games that you should let your friends get first then test it and see if you like it
dont judge a book by its coverthis is an okay game because i bought it here online for 
if i paid full price for it then i would be a little upset
it does has its flaws and can very frustrating at timesthere will be two things that you will notice immediately it is a very dark game
not in the sense of genre but in the sense of literal darkness
the game is very hard to see
and there are no saves or passwordsto solve both of these problems you will need a game light and some cheat codes
once you overcome these two obsticles you will start to enjoy the game
one thing about using the cheat to get to different levels is that the area of the screen which shows you how many points you have accumulated will have its place taken by coordinate numbers
these numbers were probably used to debug the game by the programmers
so you will not have a total score when playing with the level cheat
thats really too bad because you wont know just how well you did on each levelas you play throught the levels you will encounter some pretty fun gameplay
the levels are thought out well and some of the levels are pretty challenging
if you do not have good eyehand coordination you probably should pass on this game as you will really need to time your moves wellthere are secret levels that you will unlock and it will take you a while to understand how to defeat some of the bosses but all in all i would say this is a pretty fun game
one word of caution
if you already have a penchant against platform type games you should steer away from this game as only those who like this sort of gameplay will enjoy itthis game looked interesting but its really kinda boring
although its not awful like metal bots or anything like that and this is why i gave it  stars
some may like this game
i do not hate it i just find it kinda boring and repetiousmiddle of the road is a term you could use for this game
its graphically ok with mediocre gameplay
not bad for the price but you can do betterconstruct a fortress from tetris puzzle pieces to protect it from the opponents firing weapons
select from four eras prehistoric medieval pirate and space
the weapons provided are dependent on the era choice
your weapons will defend your fortress while you build it with falling puzzle pieces
as the fortress gets bigger and more solid it becomes more difficult for the opposing weapons to destroyoccasionally you receive twerps cavemen knights or pirates
defensive twerps rebuild the damaged areas of the fortress while offensive twerps attack the enemy
three game modes keep it interesting battle blitz and tournament
battle is the original mode blitz has more weapons and tournament is four games using all four erasthough it has a cute cartoon look its not the most graphically rich game boy advance game
once a battle is over thats it
theres no new level or battle
the only option is to start a new game and play a more advanced level
its not much game for the pricethis would be a great game if super mario kart circuit did not exist
why
because the game konami krazy racers is a clone of super mario kart circuit only with different tracks a few new modes and less than famous konami characters
the weapons are less than stellar as you run through a bell and get a random weapon of a bomb snow crystals to freeze enemies behind you a mole to dig a hole a booster or three rockets to shoot ahead
the controls are even the same a to accelerate b to brake l to use a weapon and r to jump
there are four circuits of four tracks in this game and three levels of difficulty
the tracks are nothing special its more like an extension of super mario kart having courses on a beach moon road star road and a cabbage patch donut plains
the new modes are quite nice with two mini games like a game of chicken where you and  random racers race toward the end of the track then stop before falling off
then there is also the bomb track mini game where you and three random opponents chase each other trying to destroy one another
its quite tedious and boring
another feature to this game is you can collect coins while racing to buy better vehicle parts which is quite nice
there are cartoonish graphics konami is known for making dark graphics some bad music and to me personally buying this clone was an insult because of how similar it is to super mario kart circuitthis is the only game where the lack of a backlit screen on the gba causes serious problems
since castlevania games are gothic horror much of the action occurs at night
without a steady light source you are not likely to make it far
i seriously recommend this game only for people who have an attachable light
otherwise the game is frustrating because it is too darkbut if you get the light problem solved this is as solid as any other castlevania entry
it contains some of the magic and rpg elements of symphony of the night and is a treat for any longtime fan of the series
the control is easy to manage and the enemies are diverse
the same weapons attributes and items are available and the gameplay is classic castlevania
the backgrounds are nicely detailed and despite the fact that the animation is choppy at best the graphics stand out
this is gameboy lets not forgetif you can get past the obvious light problem this is an enjoyable game that will satisfy on every levil
but please to avoid disappointment get the lighthyperbole aside this game is ok
the graphics are ok
the gameplay is ok
are you getting the idea
rent it first before you shell out pricefor a game you may or may not like
personally i found the super mario cartridge to be much more interesting and addictivethe gameplay is very good
eventhough this could easily be a gbc game it has good animations
the game should be a little more colorfullreasons to buy this game good animation good gameplay very nice featuresreasons not to buy this game not exactly colorful bad graphicsi am not a medieval fan so i can not give this game five stars
graphics are very important to me and i know what the gba is capaple of
there is lots of room for improvement in this game but i did enjoy playing this
my suggestion is that you rent this game first and then decide wether you like it or notput in the following names and start a new game to get the indicated cheatscrossbow  shooter mode with more hearts more weapon damage and use of homing daggerdagger  get thief modegradius  make nathan strongerfireball  all trading cards with dss menuthis is still a great gamei hope that this review was helpful to youcastlevania circle of the moon is a game with which i have a checkered history
the first time i played circle of the moon the experience was not positive as i got to an antagonizing boss fight which is the polite way of putting it at the halfway point quit and sold off my cart
however since that point ive been making it a point to get all the castlevania releases dont ask me about putting down the massive amount of money dracula x costs and well i figured this was just one bridge that had to be crossed even if i had to use the cheapest tricks in the book to cross it
needless to say there were certain parts i still felt were incessantly cheap when i replayed it  and i replied in kind  but i did manage to finish it
however i can say right now its a game i will not be revisiting muchbut why
at first i couldnt really but my finger on why circle of the moon is such a chore but the closer i got to the end of the game the clearer it became
unlike symphony of the night which is good but is psychotically overrated by the series fandom circle of the moon wants to be more reminiscent of the presymphony titles mostly in the difficulty department while making use of symphonys gameplay
this odd concoction of old and new is simply bizarre and is reflected in nearly every aspect of the game from its somewhat depressing color palette to the fact that the story is barely existentimportant
additionally as trite as it may seem for an action game of this variety i think i might have cared more about the game if i actually cared about the games protagonist
i cant really point the finger square at nathan being a bad character due to lack of development as this is fairly commonplace in castlevania games  heres a castle go kill dracula  but the fact that nathan isnt a belmont is a pretty big blow to the setupthere are few other irritations to be encountered as well
personally i found the copyandpastefrompreviousgames soundtrack to be very disappointing as half the fun of metroidvania games is hearing the new tunes
then theres the fact that half the time i spent playing the game was dedicated to grinding for dds cards which just brings the game to a halt which the underground waterway does a good job of as well and the last two boss fights couldnt possibly be more night and day from one another  eg
you better be good at dodging draculas ultra damaging dash attack or you will never beat the gamein the end circle of the moon isnt a bad game but to me it just does all sorts of little irritating things there are unfortunately many more i didnt mention that add up to a massive migraine
personally the games only saving grace is the fact that it is inexpensive and easy to procure but if i was going to play castlevania on the gameboy advance id rather play aria of sorrow any day of the week
i cant hate on circle of the moon that much or suggest that people avoid it but the truth is konami has done much better than this  even if you exclude symphony of the nightnot as good as the original but this is only my personal opinion which may vary from another person review
the graphics are good and each level gets more challenging as you get further along in the gameunless it is a wwf game i usually do not play wrestling games
i find most wrestling games to be dulled down versions of fighting
fire pro wrestling is definitely an exception to my usualfpw offers a generic line up of wrestlers
you can pick from  different organizations including a free agent pool
the names on the wrestlers are pretty generic ranging from the bionic man to mauler
i was going to discount this as another bland roster until i discovered the createawrestler option
this game has the most detailed createawrestler i have ever seen
you are allocated  points which seems more than enough at first glance
everything you enhance on your wrestler takes points
you can customize everything from their recovery time to what attacks are their strongest
you can even customize their ai fighting style
this is definitely the best createacharacter yetthe feel of the game is not what i expected
fpw reverts to the old tag team wrestling nes style of play
pressing directions at certain times and tapping a button will determine your moves
it is a simplistic style but also annoying when you hit the wrong button
fpw lacks the ability to run straight
you can only run in a diagonal direction meaning that your charge moves must be very well placed
as for the graphics i was pleased with the smoothness of motionoverall i believe this is a should rent title
it is not the greatest but there is definitely some value to the game
i liked it but i can not see myself playing it four months from nowi havent had it long so i cant really judge but this is what i think of it right now
the graphics are ok the sound is kinda cheap its a really hard game to get used toothe controls hard to get used to let me tell you that right now its all about timing a good thing is theres alot of different things you can do in edit mode
this game will last you along time most likley i havent tryed out the multiplayer mode but it looks ok what it comes down too really is the edit mode cause you can do so much in there make guys make teams rename guys and a lot more the setup screen before the match is cool you can pick alot of different things but my guess is well since i havent had this game long is that it will be a challenge too get started and it will be fun
i give it a three cause it is fun and it takes awhile to beatlooking at what this game has to offer you can only stand back at the features and say wow until you play it
there are several modes exhibition matches normal cage death match ufc octagon gruesome and a battle royal tournaments up to  wrestlers leagues up to  man round robin survival which pits you in an endurance match audience match where you need to please the audience to a wrestling style and finally the edit mode
the edit mode is the most extensive edit mode in the us but not japan where you can create up to  of your own wrestlers with moves intelligence looks and attributes
one of the most astonishing things is that the game comes with  wrestlers from all over the world even wrestlers from wwf wcw ecw michinoku pro toryumon ajpw njpw however for copyright reasons the names and the looks of the wrestlers have been changed
after all of these amazing features then you play the game
ouch it takes us back to the days of the nes in terms of graphics sound and game play
the wrestlers are very small the controls are very laggy and the wrestlers end up doing the same moves constantly
please do not pay more than fifteen bucks for this gamenintendo really has put so much in the works with the triumph of their gamecube video game system
yet they definitely brought so many wonderful kinds of addons to this great system
unfortunately when i heard so much hype about their wireless controller i felt a little bit stoned
the wavebird controller for the nintendo gamecube fairs as a very accurate controller through many different channels
however there are a couple of downsides to owning a wavebird
one of them is that you lose the vibration feel that the corded version has in itself by nintendo
that remains unfortunate
another downside is that sometimes your controller doesnt work very well when you have another remote beam in the middle of the way from a different device like the vcr or television
all in all i honestly suggest you buy the wired version of the gamecube controller if you want a better time with the games you playits okay
it came with no back cover for the batteries which was not mentioned
it works just fine
the joystick works okaythis was a good game but i gotten board of it quickly but this was good
i dont care if the graphic was d it was still goodthis is definitely the best dbz game to come to the us so far
the graphics are perfect the voices are great the customization and various modes of play are fantastic
i just couldnt get a feel for the controls thoughthe fighting was fast and furious but it was also very repetitive and sometimes very frustrating when the controls didnt respond
they should make another one exactly like this with more of a dead or alive control scheme
and for chrissakes allow the characters to jumpthe special moves are activated by doing specific combo attacks
these attacks are cool for awhile but the more complicated ones are extremely difficult to pull off
i say wait for the next game and in the meantime pick up marvel vs capcom  or doa im a huge freakin fan of dragonball z and i do mean a huge fan
and when i got the first  games dragonball gt final bout dragonball z legends and dragonball z ultimate battle  i was overjoyed
ultimate battle  was pretty good even though there was no story with good graphics and pretty cool moves
legends was awesome the graphics and the fighting style used in this game were very unique and made each fight exciting just like the ones in the show
final bout was pretty awful despite the fact that it was the first game in d
but budokai has proven to be the best so far
the story mode is awesome this is the first fighting game ive seen that actually has a story built into it and its almost completely accurate to the showthe graphics are great and the fighting style well its not wonderful but its alright
id say it was like a mix between dragonball z legends and dead or alive
theres also a tournament mode you take part in the world martial arts tournament practice mode duel modevs
mode and edit skills where you customize the fighters with fighting moves and attacks by using the capsules you acquire in story modethis game goes from the saiyan saga to the cell games saga although it completely skips the garlic jr saga ill explain how the story mode goeswhen you first play the game youre goku and you fight raditz nappa vegeta fake vegetawhile training in the capsule corp spaceship recoome captain ginyu you even fight ginyu in his own body while ginyu is in gokus body frieza and android  then for a little while youre piccolo and you fight cell and android  after that youre goku again and you fight cell finally you fight the cell jrs
and cell as gohanthe second time you play the game youre piccolo and you fight raditz the saibamen and nappa
then youre vegeta and you fight zarbon frieza android  android  and cellalong the way you also do some special bad guy role playing levels
first youre vegeta and after you defeat goku krillin and gohan vegeta becomes a super saiyan in front of yajirobe
then youre frieza and after you defeat gohan piccolo vegeta and goku frieza wishes for immortality from porunga blows up namek and heads for earth on his spaceship
finally youre cell and after you defeat android  and android  cell absorbs android  and when trying to absorb android  he accidentally absorbs krillin
yeah he then becomes weaker short and orange
then after you defeat yamcha cell gets incinerated by tiens tribeam suddenly you see cell in his perfect form waking up from a nightmare in the middle of the cell games ring
it turns out it was all a dream
that was awesome
oh boy i typed too much
get this game byeit is good for being one of the very first dbz games that came out for the ps but the gameplay could have been a little bit betteras a standalone fighter dragonball z budokai is not that great
while you can fly your freedom of movement is some what restricted to d fighting style
sidestepping is available but there are no rolls or jumping commands
the special moves are also limited to  slots per fighter
these slots are used by capsules that enable you perform the various moves andor abilities
while you can customize your fighter you first need to unlock or purchase the extra abilities
another problem is that transformations and special abilities take up room you would otherwise use for movesabilities
for example in order for goku to become super you need king ki fist x x and x equipped allinall taking  of your  slots
this adds a challenge to an otherwise straightforward gamethe story mode covers the sayen saga through to the android saga
being that it covers such large ground dbzb skips certain episodes in order to get to the fights quicker
you will have a chance to be the heroes and some of the villains in the story mode
just about every fighter in the game can be unlocked for the other game modes duel tournament and practice
the skills shop allows you to get most any skill you need
but dont stay to long because you cloud purchase repeat items
in order to purchase items you need to win tournaments for money
the harder the tournament the more money you get
there is a first prize and a second prize only
features like these add replay value to a moderate gameto rapitup the graphics are a good d version of the show at a slightly less then frantic pace  of 
the sound is as good as one would hope for
the music is also good for the most part  of 
the game play suffers due to the button mashing that will get you through most of the game
there is how ever some strategy involved during certain segments of the game  of 
all said dragon ball z budokai is a must have for all dbz fans
to the casual gamer rent it firstdragon ball z budokai was a very fun game at first but after the three hours i played it i realized it was both repetitive and easy to play
i had a lot of fun getting all of the characters which there were many of but i quickly got bored with the stale fighting system which when you started had only punches kicks and kamehamehathe multiplayer on the other hand was great
fighting against friends who obviously spent too much time on it made it really challenging
of course if you spend too much time playing it you can become unbeatable with moves like cells spaceship which gives you an extra life while the other guy is half dead
while this was a fun game you wont get much play out of iti am a fan of dbz and i like this game but oh so much could have been improved and added as wellproshas  fighting modesnice voice actingi love big moves like the spirit bombstory mode is nice in many wayshyperfast battlestournament battles are greatif u r a dbz fan like me then this game is libal  have great gameplayget all  dragonballs and u can unlock all of someones skillsthe best dbz  dateconscant choose capsulesgraphics r so sonot so good musicshould be able to disable ring out on the tournament cuz i hate losing like datwish it had the boo saga as well the game would have been much bettertrying  git capsoles that u want are very frustrating as welland so are dragonballssome moves are the same thing just a diffrent namecomputers are very repetitivewell this is the dbz thus far if they make another bdz in the future i hope it will have the whole sagawhich it propably will a whole lot of extras and u can chose capsoles except theyre at a high price to make the game more enjoyable then just byin usless skills just  git to the big ones
if youre not a fan of dbz nor fighting games then i know ur not gonna like dis game if u are a fan of fightin and not dbz this might be worth a rent or a borrow but if u r a fan of dbz u should have this game by nowdragonball z budokai succeeds in capturing the likeness and personality of each character from the animated series perfectly
there are  characters to play as in allspanning from the beginning of dbz to the end of the cell series unfortunately that means no characters from the buu series
the button layout is simple but effective punch kick guard and energy and the action of the ingame fights match the frantic pace one would expect from dbz
the problem lies within that each of the characters moves vary little from each other
in other words each characters moves are almost identical with the exception of a few special techniques tagged onto the end of the combos
another bothersome feature is that you cant perform the large energy beam attacks outside of a combo
on the positive side however there are several different game modes to help add variety
while the average player can plow through the entire story mode within  hours there is still the world tournament and the legend of hercule modes to clear
the skill editing feature is really just a gimmick but is a welcome addition nonetheless
so if you are a dragonball fan thats looking for another way to enjoy the series budokai is definitely worth a look
those simply looking for a great fighter with lots of depth can afford to pass this one upi bought this because a couple of years ago i watched my boyfriend play grand theft auto and the fact that he could hijack a taxi in that and pick up passengers sounded quite entertaining to me
i got a gba for my birthday and ended up buying thisbig mistake
i shouldnt be allowed in shops alone to buy gba games cos i choose rubbishok the game was ok to start with
i figured out how to work it despite having no instructions and having my licence taken off me on my first go
i carried on and completed it within a couple of hours
actually i dont think theres any way you can complete it but once youre the number  taxi driver out there theres nowhere else for you to gothe graphics are also terrible on the gba and i dont know why
i crashed into walls  other drivers so many times simply because i couldnt work out where i was going
i had about a couple of inches away from my face most of the time just so i could work out where i was goingthe training sessions arent worth the hassle of playing
theyre pointless and the only one i half managed to do was crash into balloons and i still only managed  out of  its impossible to achieve what is expected of you during the trainingi quickly became tired of this game although ive kept going back to it simply because the other game ive got for the gba is getting on my nerves now
which funnily enough also has a training session but if you dont pass the training then you dont get to play the rest of the gamethe games also very repetitive
you pick up the same passengers at the same places and take them to the same destinations
if you change how much traffic there is on the roads in the options then you do take them to different places but i found i couldnt pick up as many passengers within the time limit
i managed to pick up nearly  but then it started repeating the destinationsoverall i would not recommend this game to anyone unless its very very cheap which mine was
i like the style of the game and would keep an eye out for similar styles of games but not thisthe gba conversion of the dreamcast classic jet grind radio was surprisingly transferred well onto the gba but this dc to gba port suffers more due to the memory constraints of the system
when you get past crazy taxis chunky graphics and almost nonexistant sound youll find the same addicting gameplay that made crazy taxi a hit in the arcades the dreamcast and the various other systems it has been released on since
the controls are as simple as they are on home systems and the taxi handles almost as good as it has on its other versions
the only major drawback of crazy taxi catch a ride and it is a big drawback is the chunky and sometimes misshapen graphics that are almost reminiscent of the original star fox for the super nintendo way back when
if you can get past the graphics though youll find a solid game that is worth giving a lookwhen i first saw this game i thought to myselfyes crazy taxi on the gba
you can now play crazy taxi on the run with this new portable version
i love all the crazy taxi games including this oneyet its not perfect by any means
when i first began playing it i had a blast and kept on playing and playing like their was no tommorowwell after awhile their was nothing left to the game
their isnt much depth to the game at all and after about  hours ive pretty much mastered the game which didnt take much effort at all
i still had fun playing with the game awhile after though but the flaws really killed the game this game in reality could have been way better
i myself am not picky but from graphics to controls and to the basic depth you can tell this game was just thrown together and mass produced to soonfirst of all the game has some pretty bad graphics
the visuals are all chopy and messed up always has you crashing into something i dont get it how could you go through part of a wall but crash into a stupid tree or sign
besides that the gameplay was fun and very addictive
the gameplay in fact is probably the only thing that saved the game along with the crazy taxi name
the controls took awhile to get used of too which wasnt a major problem for me but really using the l and r trigger to shift between reverse and forward goshanother problem was their are only two freakin maps in the entire game named city  and city  man thats original
yes the maps are pretty decent size pretty similar to all the other crazy taxi games in the past their wasnt anything to visually enjoy either
so im driving around the environment is crap the graphics suck but oddly enough i still enjoy this game
i guess its a gulity pleasure but if the game testers and the rest of the production staff did their jobs this coldve been a masterpiece but this is barely average and to alot of people a disgraceafter reading what i just said its most likely dicouraged you and pushed you away from buying this game
despite the faults the gameplay never fails to satisfy but it will get repetive
the game will be fun for crazy taxi fans and people who are open minded and are into some crazy action on the go
i liked the game but i feel that when i had to pay  at the time that i had really over payed for this game
if you find this game for around  in a bargain bin be sure to pick it upexcellent gameplay but horrible graphics along with alot less depth that the other crazy taxi games has but if you love crazy taxi cbut constantly on the go this is a perfect game for that
the music was annoying to so i ended up turning the volume down too the sound wasnt that impressive either
so if you arent picky and looking for something simple and new or love crazy taxi be free to get this game
yet its your call its no must buy but i saw this on sale at game stop for about  the other day which is a stealgame overviewgameplay  very fun and addictive
the gameplay is what save the game with the good old classic feel of the original now portable
crazy taxi fans will enjoy it
had blast despite downfallscontrols  a little different but nothing to complicated
easy to learn nothing special didnt like how the used the l and r trigger though besides that the same controls as most driving games on the gbagraphics  horrible and no excuse of why they are this bad
not pretty at allive personaly seen better graphics on the original nessound  not that realistic along with corny music but still acceptable
could have been better but ive herad worst
the music though will sometimes drive you nutsdepth  not much at all only  maps with  drivers
a very simple game but the mini games were pretty cool
gosh i was not impressed though
the maps were a decent size as welloverall  not the greatest game ever made but i had some serious fun
the game doesnt look that good though but some good action
nothing to go run out and buy only buy if the prices range from  or underrogue foxcriticmega gamer since agecheck out my other reviews if you need buying advice or more infothis is a good game
i find it hard though
but the graphics are amazing the streets are cool and the cars are great looking
the cheats dont work for the career mode
here are the pros and consprosamazing graphicsawesome carsgreat streetsconsthe charactersdifficultcheats dont work for the career modeif it were not for the addition of motorcycles to this second edition this game would be a waste of time
midnight club  does a pretty good job with the motorcycles as far as handling and what not
another good game if you like bikes is speed kings not very well known but the things you can do on the bikes in speed kings is too much fun wheelies stoppies and numerous others
im not sure why this game is still half a bill but whatevermidnight club  is a solid racer with great control and good graphics
the racing action is very fast and intensely exciting and many of the competitions are very challenging
also there seems to be some behindthescenes handicapping going on so that youre never really out of any race  ive had horrible multimishap runs where the difference between first and last was only a second or two
this keeps every run exciting to the finishunfortunately after a while all of the competitions get repetitive
career mode should have been so much better but it turns out to be very linear  trail competitorrace competitorwin competitors carrepeat
when racing for pink slips you put up nothing in the wager so the heats off you every time
if you lose the first time just keep trying until you take the poor guys car
it would have been better to have a dynamic wagering system where you build up a bank account and race primarily for agreedupon amounts of money
after all in the quotreal worldquot of underground racing no one would automatically accept the ultimate challenge so readily
the wager system would make a race for slips a real event rather than just another notch on your belt
but what good would the winnings be unless you could spend them on goodies for the car
the cars in the game are all stock  you cant upgrade them or trick them out at all
if you could use your money to do this this would have given the game much more lasting appeal
hustling other online drivers out of their money in an emu quietly souped up to perform like a veloci would keep me coming back night after nightall in all a fun game but not the surefire rave that many other reviewers are making it out to be
recommendation  rent first buy secondpros  exciting race action  good car control  online play capabilities broadband onlycons  lack of depth in career mode  inability to modify cars  some of the soundtrack whats the only thing worse than limp bizkit
a knockoff of limp bizkit made for a video game  if i have to hear that quotput ya top down playaquot track one more time
 conflict desert storm did not do well at all on the ps and xbox
however it tends to stand out a little better on gamecube
since there are no online squadbased game sfor gamecube the focus is on the single player mode which is actually good
the levels are varied but are fun to play through
you can get assault rifles and rocket launchers as well as handguns
splitscreen play supports  players but isnt all that exciting
if you want a multiplayer game try timesplitters as for problems there are a couple
first there is no online play
sega did it with phantasy star online so why cant anybody else
second the camera sometimes moves awkwardly which makes aiming harder
also the camera gets worse in splitscreen
if you are not willing to learn the levels conflict can be very difficult at timesthere is only one other squadbased battlefield game on gamecube ghost recon
it focuses more on taking cover in the bushes and giving your team directions
it is also a firstperson game while conflict is a third person game
conflict focuses more on action
the sum of all fears is a primarily indoor game so it is not really in the same genreso which game should you buy
conflict desert storm is really your best option with ghost recon a close second
however if you have a ps buy socom first even if you cant play online
if all you want is a gamecube shooter you should buy medal of honor firsti had looked forward to auto modelista
firstly as a gearhead as a second game to play online after socom navy seals
secondly the celshading style of graphics looked apealingthe single coolest thing about this racer is the graphics
it looks great
really great
checkout gamespotcom for screenshots to see what it offersthere is a pretty good selection of cars and the customization capabilities are very deep
perhaps too deep
it allows you to customize your cars styling through body kits and any combination of colors plus various stripe styles wheels and decalsarguably more focus has been put on customizing your car and even the garage that its displayed in than on the driving experience
and unfortunately i have yet to discover how to race your customized cars online
i mean isnt that the greater point of such an exercise to share your creationthe racing experience is well gran turismo it aintits pretty fun but dont expect great realism
i guess it kind of goes along with the semicartoonlike graphics
more abstract than lifelikeoh yeah and the biggest annoyance for me the goofy voice remarks that the annoucer makes that you apparently cant turn off
hearing him go quotyoure amazingquot after a descent turn gets old really quicklyall in all its kind of fun but for a serious racer i think its lees likely to keep your attentionbeing a lover of horrorsurvival games i thought this one would fit in really well
it was highly recommended by the guy at the video store better than the resident evils or silent hills
well dude youre wayyy off
it starts out nice dark and creepy but loses it once the game gets going
the two huge downfalls arefirst whats with the controls deviating from the standard directionalbutton combo that was used for all the horrorsurvival games
it took half the fun out of jumping in and playing having to refamiliarize myself with using the joysticks not a fan of joysticks
the second was no weapons
come on guys whats the fun in not being able to kill the bad guys
having to run and hide is a lame idea especially if hiding includes standing behind a rocking chair in full view and yet not being seen by the monster
weak
id rather blast my way through a mass of zombies than hide behind dustmotes from a ghost
i do have to give credit where credit is due though
the concept of having to help ghosts find peace was pretty cool and a nice challenge in addition to puzzle solving
if they work it in better with some firepower i think it would make a really cool game
also the way she was hard to control when she got scared was cool
it added more realism to the game
overall its worth a try but dont let the fact that its a capcom game in the same genre get your expectations up too highclock tower  is the only clock tower game i have played but this was recommended to me by a coworker so i thought i would give it a go
the game starts off really strong with alyssa battling sledgehammer and as you race around finding clues to a child prodigys murder and solving puzzles the hammerman killer is genuinely creepy
the game will make your pulse pound and your fingers ache
the next villain corroder is almost as intense as sledgehammer chasing you through an abandonded waterworks with hiding places more sparing again leads to great exciting game play
but then you get to level  and choppera very annoying feminine slasher that just gets on the nerves and doesnt do much to keep you jumping
the same goes for the bizarro ballerinas turned slashers on level  scissorman and scissorwoman
neither character produced chills and the high pitched taunts issued by both wouldbe killers get more annoying than frightening as the game progresses
the final boss lord borroughs is also a disappointment
after making your way through four pretty tough levels your left facing off againstan english gentleman
the gameplay is quite fun and i enjoyed the concept of running and hiding from killer spirits armed only with holy water but the fright factor drops considerably after the first two levels
the graphics and sound are really good and the eerie music rivals that of silent hill in setting the mood
i would recommend this game to fans of survival games but be sure to get the resident evil series firsti started to play this game and got bored with it
so i started another game and went back to it a couple of weeks later
still bored
overall the idea is great but i just cant get into it
i hope that this review does not discourage people it just isnt my cup of teacapcom should focus on the storyline of the original clock tower games clock tower the first fear snes japan and clock tower playstationim sure theyll make a clock tower u see a lil girl murdered and you think itll be scary but then the rest of the game is u trying to hide from an annoying freddy kruger wannabe with a beergut who says the same stupid alyssa were are u over and over every  seconds u dont fight u simply hide in places until he goes away if it was pulled off well it might work but the graphics are level after level of grey desolate wastelands and the sounds regrettable at best dont buy this heck resident evil on playstation  is better no joke playing this games about as fun as watching reruns of mork and mindy this pile of crap is best used as a frisbeecapcom survival horror games are not scary
they are tense they are actionpacked and they are fun but scary
no
if youre looking for chills as opposed to thrills seek out any of the fatal frame or silent hill seriesbut if youve played all of those and are looking for something to tide you over until the ps release of resident evil  then consider the oftenoverlooked clock tower 
set in england you play alyssa what is it about that name and the survival horror genre
 a fifteen yearold schoolgirl on the trail of her missing mother travelling through time and reality and evading the unwanted attacks of a number of ghosts and serial killersgraphics beautiful big characters gorgeous scenery and excellent design make this one a pleasure to watch
some of the lowlier ghosts are a bit chintzy but after all they can be dispersed with a sentimental item so what was i expecting
and the overall visual impression lacks a horrorstyle punch but what the game does it does very wellsound average music and average sound effects provide the backdrop for some of the most outlandishly bad voice acting in a video game
ever
remember resident evil 
its
a monster
run
this is worse
cheesy and ott with no effort given to atmosphere this really does drag the game atmosphere right downplayability there are no weapons and no means of killing your pursuers until the actual boss battle so running and hiding and using preset evade points is a very fun way of keeping alyssa alive
also this adds to the tension like nothing ive ever seen before
simplistic controls and a really good camera system kae this one good fun to play even if it does get a bit repetitive later on
nothing to upgrade and plenty of special items means that theres no real challenge thoughlasting factor this is a very short  hours and sixteen minutes first play subsequent plays are less very easy game
the final boss is a bstard to beat and you need to keep every single special arrow you find in the game to even be in with a chance  he is unfairly tough given the games remedial difficulty levels
replay value is low  though there is a replay mode but its not that different from the actual gameoverall fun flashy and tense this is a great deal if you can get it cheap
what it does it does very well and even though its a total onetrick pony the fact that its so short means it never becomes stale
recommended as a last resort when youve played all other survival horror games availablefirst of all i want to warn all those ct fans  dont take this game as a clock tower game think of it as of something separate actually that is also a good thing to do with resident evil it really goes better once you do that believe methe almighty resident evil master capcom took the game name to its new level  no more point  click controlsthough the gameplay idea is almost the same run run for your life and hideor attack with something that might come in handyno matter if you played any ct games before or not it will take some time to learn the curve and develop some tactics in those boss battles which i find the major turn off in this gamebut once you get used to it its not a problemthe juicy part of this game enemiesthey are nicely madeappearance story theme musicbut why they are oh so predictable
sometimes when they jump out all of a sudden and scare the main heroine its pretty coolbut when it happens over and over again added with some stupid repeating phrases or laughters from themor when they are just following you nonstop it doesnt seem so scary or intriguing anymore but more like annoyingit could be much better if the enemies were more intelligentthe story is promising and somewhat gory at least the first two partsbut unfortunately there is no replay value except for some alternate costumes higher difficulty level and bosses with other weaponsnow onto the conclusionsome might love this game some might hate some might just leave it in the middleif you arent a survival horror fan i highly doubt you will fit in the first categorybut if you are there is a big chance you will enjoy ct while waiting for that new resh to come outxenosaga was a good game but it took a long long time for me to get throughand not just because it offers a good sixty hours of gameplay
if youre looking for a jawdropping rpg that will leave you addicted get final fantasy x at the nice new rate of twenty bucks a pop
if youve already beaten that twice then get xenosagaall the good elements are there its a sort of ff style rpg with nice graphics
the main hook for me was the story
the cutscenes were incredibly long
but it didnt matter because most of them were riveting and sometimes frankly creepy ie
albedo ripping his own head off and laughing
presented in beautiful animestyle d cg graphics the story that begins to unfold is gripping and filled with many morethansubtle refrences to different religions and philosiphies
love itbut as for why it takes sixty long hoursthe gameplay is unbalanced
damage is dealt through special attacks but though they are asthetically different they all end up becoming shortrange attack for enemy on ground and longrange attack for enemy in air
this deceptively simple system would lend itself to fast battles but the solidly turnbased fight system drags itself along like a fallen tree sloth
magic called ether is used but rarely for anything other than healing making your magicuser essentially useless once you transfer her skills to someone with more hpin contrast to the battle system leveling up is hard timeconsuming and complex
seems that seperate points are required for each of three types of attribute and these are critical if you want to surviveareas
way too few way too big way too overused
you only get about seven or eight main areas during the game and over half can be summed up as gray ship walls with red spots or red ship walls with gray spotsenemies
too few types
stupid predictable and too easy to avoid giving rise to the temptation to not train at all
and they award so few points and gold that over half your time is spent killing the exact same enemies
blahzzzzzzzzzmusic
it rocks the first time you hear it
and the second and even the fifth
but when you hear the exact same seven tired tunes forty hours into the game you dont care that the london philharmonic performed themall in all the bad elements can be summed up in one word repitition
the boys and girls up at namco spent all their creativity on the plot
my personal suggestion  the game edit the cg sequences together and add in a few more and release it in theaters
itd be great
note  i saw this review now a few months after i first wrote it and decided that it was a little harsh
i like the oldschool world map with a huge variety of locations and quests baldurs gate and ff are high in my list of favorite games
i had a lot of fun with xenosaga
i just tend to really bash any characteristics of a game that get on my nervesxenosaga sure beats the heck out of that thing they dare call a sequel to ffxas screenshots and video clips and other xenosaga media began to circulate wouldbe fans all wiped the drool from their mouths in sync as if part of the same collective mind
it would be the blockbuster that set new standards not only in terms of story like its predecessor but visually as well with luscious animeesque character models rendered meticulously in realtime
oh it would be the second coming for sureand best of all it would only be part  of  scheduled games ensuring a longstanding euphoriabut was xenosaga worth all the media and fan hype
that depends on your expectations
if youre openminded to the idea of equal parts gameplay and cinema and can tolerate uninspired and sometimes aggravating play mechanics all for the sake of experiencing one of the greatest audiovisual presentations in gaming history then xenosaga is right up your alley
if graphics music and story are prioritized beneath the actual gameplay then you may want to find a friend like that first type of gamer and simply watch him or her play it
that way you reap all the benefits but suffer none of the annoyancesfirst off this game has the most cut scenes i have ever seen in one game
the good news is you can skip them if you like
other than the extremly long cutscenes the game is greatthis game is you basic turn based rpg which i rather enjoy
gives me time to figure out what my next move will be
the enemies appear on your map so you always know if youre going to run into one
the enemies dont just pop up when youre walking around
i like that
anyway the characters are wonderful along with the graphics
voice work couldnt have been betteryou learn cool techniques that you can even have your other team members learn
you can also transform into the really big machinesbeen a while since ive played it i dont remember what they are called but its awesomethe side quests in the game are really fun alsothis games is really a must for any rpg lover
if you can sit throught all the cutscenes and not get discouraged this game is really greatfirst of all i like cutscenesi even like long cutscenesi like storys and movies so i like cutscenesand i liked the cutscenes in this game but the thing that annoyed the hell outta me was the characters and designchaos the skinniest anerexic looking boy ud ever seenand he looks like a chickand his names chaosmomoa little robot girl that sometimes makes me wonder if she has the brain of an adult and wants to screw ziggyand all the other characters have their little annoyances and none of them would really match being lead characterthe only good characters were the ones on ur shipthe captain the geek and the one who hits on peoplethey were cool but if forgot their namesrpgs are all about story dialog and charactersdialog isidont remember the dialongits been awhilestory was  wat the hell is going on
why the hell am i doing this
why the hell is a scientist wearing a tight mini skirtcharacters was damn thats a mini mini skirtmaybe if i duck my head under i can see her pantieseven though shes not hot because i dont find women with eyes bigger than their head sexy but im just pervertedforgettableoh and gameplay suckedi hated the battlesthe thing that kept me intrested was the enviromentbut now star oceans outso screw this gameoh and did i mention the character jrhes a little boy with a cult following of women that call him little mastergahhh i hated this character most of allever want to gouge out a nonexistant persons big eyes outxenosaga how you broke my hearti picked up this game expecting really great things and i was quite disappointed by the time i finished this gameprosgreat graphicsgreat soundinteresting storyextremely good badguy albidoconsslooooowwww paceagws anti gnosis weapon system robots look crappysubpar characters except kosmos she rocksmusic is too bland and repetitivewho designed the enemies is this game
the gnosis suckedi love the final fantasy series ff is the best game ever and i seem to compare every rpg to that series which is probably a little unfair
however thats how it is and in my humble opinion xenosaga is just not in the same leaguegreat game for you big scifi fans but if youre like me and are waiting for the next final fantasy  look elsewherethis game has all the elements  that a rpgmecha anime lover would want but for some reason i just could not get in to it
i bought  but  while the cut scenes were pretty  the mecha battling cool i found myself bored stiff  by the story linei am so sorry i feel like i am betraying rpgers and anime fans everywherei actually did not get through the game
i set it down and started playing something else and that was like  years ago or something and i have still not played it or the second one shame on me
i will get to it thoughsoonthere comes a time in console gaming when we are between generations waiting for the next hardware to arrive so that new games can be released along with it
there currently are a limited number of new games in the pipeline for the current consoles as developers focus resources on games that will probably be released next year
i check daily for news of a new triace or mistwalker game with no news
this can be a good thing however as it gives us a chance to go back and play some of the games from the previous generations
as a result my ps has been pulled from the closet and placed next to the  and wii
i decided that it was a good time to pick up this trilogy
it may seem pointless to review a game that is  years old but the portable gaming systems and psn  xbox live  wii virtual console have given new life to old games
old games are often regarded as being among the best and many of them are new to younger gamers that never got to play them when they were originally releasedxenosaga was one of those games that i had always considered playing
i am a big fan of xenogears and i was blown away by the hype for this game when it was announced around  or so
but after seeing its direction and witnessing it firsthand at a friends house i decided that there were many other games that i should play instead
ive had  years to attempt to curb my initial disappointments with the game
i havent decided if its allowed me to warm up to the title or its strengthened my disappointments
i consider myself to be a veteran of console rpgs as ive been playing them for at least  years now across all manner of consoles
i still have my original nes dragon warrior and final fantasy carts as well as many snes genesis and turbografx  games
i love console rpgs and ive played games from virtually every major series at some pointand thats why i have a problem with xenosaga
it is apparent that it excels at absolutely nothing when compared to the rest of the games out there
positive reviews on this game seem to merely be from apologists that want to hold this game in the same high regard as xenogears or maybe even gamers that prefer to watch anime over playing an engaging or challenging gamesone of my biggest complaints is the audio
the audio is simply a disaster
ive come to the conclusion that mitsuda simply doesnt want to work anymore on anything
once one of my favorite composers he puts so little effort into his music these days that you could just as easily insert any thirdrate composer into a game and have it turn out all the same
there might be approximately three main tracks throughout the whole game
more often than not however the game is completely silent
the dungeon and battle music are so annoying an uninspired which is a shame because you will be listening to them for countless hours
this is one of the first times where ive ever played a game with the volume turned down so that i could listen to my own music collection while playing the game
only when you get to the final area are you actually treated with good music
the final boss battle and ending music are indeed good but its not worth playing for  hours to finally get to this
the same man that created the awesome music for xenogears  chrono trigger  chrono cross another junk game aside from the soundtrack offers virtually nothing to game music anymoreand it isnt even just the music
the voice acting is pretty disappointing as well
i know that many people have preferred shions voice actor in this game over episode ii but i simply cannot stand her
its not that she is a bad voice actor but she just seems wrong for the part
she sounds like a yearold woman playing a character in her s because thats exactly what she is
i would say that the only characters that i really found to be tolerable were kosmos jr and ziggythe battle system is terribly slow and boring
its like a watered down version of the xenogears battle system but you spend more time watching animations than actually playing
the progressions between actions are crude and lack any degree of fluidity
it literally takes  seconds to do even the most basic attack because you have to watch charging animations
to add to this the awgs are absolutely useless i never used them except for the parts where you are required to use them and there is hardly ever any real degree of challenge
there used to be a time when rpgs offered some real challenge and required actual strategy but someone decided that this should take a backseat in this games design
to give you an idea i beat the proto dora in less than  rounds and it never got a single chance to attack
i finished the last two bosses on similar terms
i think that there was only one battle that was remotely challenging early on but only because its the point in the game where it assumes that youve already learned the battle mechanics
a poor battle system like this is a problem since while enemies can be seen most paths are too thin to actually avoid battle
its very much a precursor to the disastrous final fantasy xiii in almost every respect
the games are so similar in terms of gameplay slow battle progression terrible music and sterile linear environments that the resemblance is uncanny graphics technology aside
dungeons literally take hours to complete because you are wandering about fighting enemies on linear paths
i wouldnt actually mind this if the story was at all captivating but it simply is notyou spend approximately  hours waiting for something interesting to happen in this games story
by the time you get to the end of the game it seems like it might actually turn around
instead you are left on a cliffhanger for the second game
there is absolutely nothing in this game that actually develops the series plot or characters
its just  hours of pointless scenarios in  hour dungeonsmenus are poorly designed
to apply the numerous types of points to your characters you have to navigate to no less than  different menus
the system lacks any degree of refinement and the point system is needlessly convoluted
in contrast a good game would have placed them all into a common menu to apply points to learn skills or enhance stats
generally there is no good reason to apply points to the strength of tech attacks early on because there is little payoff
it is however good practice to apply points to the tech attack speed and apply points directly to a characters ether defense and vitality
but the game does such a poor job of defining which things are useful and which are not that it is probably easy for some gamers to waste points on things that have very little return hp or useless spells
the vast majority of spells that are useful belong to a sole character but these can easily be transferred to everyone else completely negating anything that it unique about the character
as such you will probably stick with  characters throughout the entire game because the alternative may mean that you are going to spend time grinding for points to get everyones tech  skill ether points on par with the mostplayed characters
there is no incentive to use anyone elsevisually the game was dated even by s standards
environments are sterile futuristic grey corridors and characters are messy blobs with pss characteristic jaggy features
the lack of progressive scan even in  was unforgivable when even the lowly dreamcast supported it in nearly every game with the vga box in  as well as the gamecube with component cables
and while graphics are not the most important part of an rpg its annoying to have to be forced to watch  second animations for boring attacks
the only time that these can be skipped is when the game designers cheat by carefully inserting an mpeg video animation into the game
kosmos xbuster is one such exampleplaying through takahashi and soraya sagas games of the past two generations makes me realize something that many people do not consider
they simply cant do it without masato kato and many of the others that were involved in xenogears and chrono trigger
i am one of very few that also didnt really like xenoblade which i felt was artificially inflated with boring fetchquests in order to create a greater perceived value for the game
there simply was very little meat to the plot and the gameplay
interestingly enough i see that kato was involved in monoliths baten kaitos and ive read that it has superior writing
however i have not played it yetto close its simply unforgivable to create a hour linear rpg game that does absolutely so little with the plot or gameplay
this game literally serves no purpose but to introduce you to the next game which i hear also takes a turn to focus only on a few characters rather than the plot of the actual game
well see how it goes when i begin part ii today
i may be part of a minority that will actually like episode ii better than the firstthis game is literally the star wars episode  phantom menace of takahashis ambitious xenogears series and prequels
and while nobody will officially admit to the connections to squares properties for legal reasons all of the basic lore is there
it may be a reimaging of the series but it contains many of the core plot elements that were relevant for xenogears so much so that many of the terminology and the timeline is the same as what was proposed in perfect works and xenogearsfirst of all this isnt that bad of a game but its not worth   or even 
if you can find it for  or less perferably less then its worth getting
the voice acting is good despite the slight fuzziness the graphics have at times and no random saves the game is good especially the story line almost just like the movies
the main reason i give this game a  is because of the kraken not the kraken from the clash of the titans movie is a pain in the a literally i tried to beat him for an hour and gave up maybe after awhile ill go back to the game but im not in a hurry
the gates of neptune level is pretty annoying too the concept is cool but it can be frustrating
i recommend a strategy guide for this especially if youre not that good at solving puzzles
if youre a fan of the indiana jones series this is worth having just for thati bought this because the commercials had you think it was surreal in the original nam experience
it does have adult language and headshots of friends but it also is very repeatitive in gameplay
it just seems kind of standard
nothing you are going to ruch home to play kind of blahif youre looking for a true immersive experience in combatridden vietnam of the late s this mature title might fit the billyou work your way through the conflicts in vietnam starting as a green rookie and learning skills and techniques as you go
there are squad blasting missions sneaky missions missions where you need to slay a certain person and other missions where you just shoot everyone in sightthe graphics are reasonably good  trees have individual leaves the helmets have sayings scrawled on them bursts of blood come out from shots
the weapons and outfits are well donethe sound goes for realistic over arcady
you dont get fun bouncy soundtracks as you fight you rway through the jungle  instead youre surrounded by gunfire the shouting of your commanders orders and the cries of the wounded
it does get a little repetitive though as you hear destroy that tunnel
for the th time in a rowthere are booby traps and tunnels napalm and death
you shoot women in the head see hands blown off
in general this game really earns its mature rating
heads burst like a balloon and some of the mission situations are questionable
if i was a vietnam vet or a vietnamese person for that matter id be pretty annoyed at the portrayal of what an average soldier was likeif youre a shooter fan and are looking for lots of blood and can disconnect the game with the history its playing then you might enjoy this
but if youre really a fan of the military and of realistic shooters there are other games on the market that are better to spend your money onthis game is a third person shooterbut you only control your own man
its also not a very hard game 
it did feel like i was in the jungles with intense firefightswith bullets flying by me
  i had fun playing this game it made me feel like i was in the jungle but the freezes and the glitches are a big problem
as far a graphics goif you have a tv with an s cable input i strongly suggest you get a s cable for your xbox
it improves graphics on all your gamesas well as your dvd movies
if you have a component input even better its got a blueredyellowwhite input
the s input is usually black in color and has a funky look to it
i only suggested this cause i see some complaints about graphics on alot of games but with an s cable they actually look pretty good 
 it was fun up until it froze dont get me wrongthe game play is fine the navigators pace notes are fine but the menus and the setup are missing several features that were included in the ps version of colin mcrae rally chief among them the ability to pick and choose exactly which stages on any given course you want to race in time trial mode
second gone is the ability to tune your car between stagesyou cant tweak the suspension or change to a different tire type between stages like you could in cmcr not to mention changing the gear ratios and the brake balance to favor front or rear bias
cmcr menu navigation is weird as it wraps around to the same choices left to right and doesnt give you a list that flows logicallythe game is fun to play however if you like to just take the car how the program sets it up and the environmental effects are awesome but ive found vrally  to be much better for the ps and cmcr to be better on the ps
also missing from this version is the rally school qualification as in the ps version where once you got your expert license you could race any car on any stage and try to beat your best time and in that version you couldnt earn any new cars that you didnt have alreadyi unless i missed a cheat somewhere along the way
like i said this version is fun but i do miss the car customizing features of the older version but this version does have the older version beat as far as environmental effects and pace notes so i guess its a washthere is no colin mcrae rally  or cmcr for the ps in ntsc those awesome versions are only available on pal playstations and im disappointed for that because i think all of them are the best rally games ever made vrally  for the ps notwithstanding
vrally and vrally  which are only available on the ps are okay but they dont really compare to vrally  or the ps versionsthis game is just like the ps versionwhere is the use of the extra xbox powerwhen i first loaded this game it looked great
the graphics are extremly good
the feeling of speed is there and both the tracks and cars are very detail
it works alot to drag you into feeling like racingit has a really great feature
you get this run down metal shack
as you win races and do well this building changes
constant upgrades and soon you can have a complex
that coupled with personalities within
the builder the designer the pretty secretary and sales all goes towards adding that something extra
the cars themselves have  levels with the end one fully decked out in racing colors
you get to chose which cars are built
this made the game immensly funbut where it really counts the game falls short
the racing
yes the speed is there
but i found it very hard to win races and i am not a bad racer
the other cars do not spin out and anytime you connect with them they will get the better of it
you can hit thier front bumper with your rear and they will slide infront
it can be extremly hard to catch the leaders and you will always start in last place and have to race through the fieldi like to race clean
i like to race and not have to bang off other cars
but that is not possible in this game
i found more often than not that the only way to get in front was to wait till they were braking at a slow corner and ram them to brakefor all the good of this game it just keeps falling short
a tragedy really as this game was so close to being the most fun i have had in a car game since gran turismo this game is ok at best its not as good as i thought it would be the presentation of the game is lacking when compaired to world rally championship a much better game if i might add
the graphics are not as good as the back of the box claims although the car models are quite pleasing to look at the damage on them is realistic
so if you want a good rally game i recomend world rally championship for purchase and i recomend colin mcrae for rental at besti love wrc
that being said its hard not to compare the   this game almost hits the mark
damage is good and the stages are very well done but the car is a bit difficult to drive and i cant understand what  nicky grist is mumbling
the game was bought used but i honestly dont think anyone ever played it game case and inserts all like new
im going to give it some more time but ill be looking for other rally games to get my fixthis game was ok it served its purpose
me and my friend had fun trading off the controller and playing it togetherit was of course not as good at the movie
the graphics werent the best and i agree that it has no replay valuehowever it was very cool to be able to play all the different characters from the movie and use all their different powers to solve puzzlesall in all its worth a rentalthis game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious
you will need a lot of patience to play itive gotten through about half of the game and have decided that overall it is just okat first the webslinging and beating up bad guys was really cool
the graphics are amazing for this game and the physics are genuine
however after learning the basics of the game im sad to say there really isnt much more to itevery chapter requires you to complete a certain number of tasks
whether it be talking to jonah shooting picture or whatever
but you must always obtain hero points
the sad thing is there are only about  scenerios to earn hero points get a guy to a hospital stop a car chase catch a guy before he falls off a building and stop an armed robbery
ummafter  hours couldnt there be more to it than just this
the further you are in the game the more hero points you need to get the next chapter
im at a point now where you need  hero points well the actual encounters with the bad guys can earn you about  a clip
thats just too many trips to make this game funas i said earlier the graphics are great and the physics are good
the civilans are stupid you can not interact with anyone at anytimereally once youve seen every scenerio for hero points  times isnt that enoughlets get this straight as movie adaptations go this is no riddick
it has been a long time since activision made quality games
they tend to rely on a license to sell the game and save money on production
in many respects spiderman the movie  is typical
most of the game is incredibly shoddy
even on the xbox the graphics are terrible
clearly activision doesnt want to spend the money on anybody with real artistic talent character models are barely more than ps quality textures are ugly cut scenes are incredibly bad
writing except where taken directly from the movie is stupid
many of the missions are also poorly thought out and there are occasional bugs cropping up
in one scene where spidey is supposed to chase the black cat
i had the cat get stuck against a building running in place but spidey still couldnt catch her because she wasnt in the right place to be caught until eventually she managed to run through the solid brick wall
on another occasion the game hung and had to be reset save oftenall that being said they got the two most important things right it is a freeroaming game and they have managed to come up with a bland but recognizable model of manhattan for spidey to roam in
and they have finally gotten the web swinging right
weblines now have to have actual attachment points if you leap off the empire state building and you can you wont find any other web attachment points until you fall to the level of the surrounding buildings
you dont actually have to target specific buldings just point the joystick in the direction youll want and spidey will try to find something to web
web swinging is in realistic arcs
fortunately it doesnt hurt spidey to slam fulltilt into a building because  youll be doing that a lot at first
i cant convey how much these two factors redeem the game
as bad as everything else about the game is swinging around manhattan is an incredible blast tricky but exhilarating there is an easy web swinging mode for the kids i didnt try itthe basic game play is cribbed directly from titles like grand theft auto or some of the recent tony hawks games which is good if you are going to steal steal from the bestyou swing or walk if you prefer until one of the generic pedestrians flags you down with a mission with incredibly poor animationactivision is too cheap to spring for facial animation so they stand there blandfaced and wave their arms about
unfortunately there are only a dozen or so basic missions so youll basically be doing the same thing over and over
there are also race tokens scattered around the city where if you accept the optional challenge you have to hit certain tokens with a time limit
but the web swinging is so much fun that you probably wont mind
combat is ok basically cribbed from the capcom marvel fighting titles which is a good thing with lots of air combos
fancier web swinging and fighting techniques have to be purchased with hero points you earn from missions which provides a slight rpg element
every once in awhile youll get a scripted challenge some of which are boss fights generally with a higher difficulty level
unfortunately these mostly tend to be more annoying than entertainingthe frustrating thing about the game is that the webswinging dynamic is so great that you tend to resent activation for not building a decent game around it
dont get me wrong if you like spiderman even a little bit you will enjoy this game
but with a little more work and investment it could have been one of the greatest games of all timethe game supports p on the xbox
unfortunately it does not support  format nor does it have the ability to add sidebars
so if you have a widescreen tv that insists on filling the screen with a p signal as many do the game will be stretched horizontally and youll probably end up having to go into the xbox control panel and turn off p just to be able to play the game without distortionfor any fan of the comic book or the movies this is a great experience on the xbox
there are a good amount of positives about the game that make you want to play it but there are too many negatives about the game that dont make you want to buy it
one of the bright aspects of this game is how it molds the story into the movie and throws some comic book story in the middle of it
for some missions you are teamed up with black cat
you take on doc ock shocker and mysterio and for the most part the boss battles are the best parts about the game
another positive thing about the game is your web slinging is more than just pressing a button and you stick to the sky and swing forward
you have to attach to buildings and things like height and the angle you fling your web at reflect how you swing
at first this is extremely frustrated for even the biggest gamer but by the end the control you have makes you just want to swing a jump through new york forever
now comes the negatives and what makes this a lackluster title
i never felt challenged at all in this game
there was one part where you have to swing out to the statue of liberty to fight mysterio and that was the toughest part of the game
if i wasnt a spiderman fan i probably wouldnt have liked this game very much but being spiderman makes it fun
i finished the game in about  hours of playing time
if you are a decent gamer you could finish this in a saturday of playing the game
this is the one reason that this game is a solid rental
whenever you are not fighting the marquee villians you beat up thugs along the way by talking to people and they give you missions
there are really only  missions but they just keep happening in different places youll see what i mean when you play the game
i actually liked this game but it needed to be a little harder and a little longer and the side missions needed a little more varietyi was bowled over by the physics loved the action and amazed at the fact that the entire island of manhattan has been recreatedsure i loathed the story and detested the endoflevel bosses you have to endure to gain everything the game has to offer
thankfully these parts are short and mostly easy
some of the fights are so out of keeping with the rest of the game placed obviously in there to coincide with the movie but once the story part of the game is completed new york is open for you
youre then free to do the sub missions and time trials and seek hidden packages to your hearts contentpersonally i could have lived without the story mode completely but it didnt detract too much from a great game with good graphics and fabulous controlsleaping off a skyscraper for the first time is a rush
recommended harmless funi love the way you can go anywhere in this game but the mini missions are repetativegraphicaly this game is not so bad but i have a s video cable for my xbox which improves resolution
that is if you have a compatable tv
i think some younger kids might like this game better
all in all a good concept game but couldve been better
like more diverse side missions and maybe you could talk to people on the street instead of the same cutscenes in the mini missions
this game is fun to swing around the city and see the day change into night with all the city lights is pretty koolitd be nice to play some of the other characters toogot it to quench my own nostalgia
i have a ds lite which i borrow from my  year old son
i love the whole originality of it it hasnt changed in graphics
the problem is that the game only appears in the lower half of the console and the upper half always remains black
thus with one screen active everything from pac to spaceships appear quite small
im used to playing this in arcades big screen vertical
my nostalgia is quenched but im not fully satisfiedi am a avid game collector when i bought this i was expecting the real pacman not ms pacman overall its okms pacman and galaga are the reasons to own this
digdug is ok
but gets boring quickly
fun for nostalgia reasons
i wish the games were more customizable
i would like to speed up ms pacman like i could on the old sega genesis release
but ill take portable pac just about any way it comeswhy the creator of this game or nintendo decided to save a few cents per unit on the production run to make the game  less playable is beyond me
the point of these old games was high score
there was no story just the score and level
to not save the high scores for the games reduces the need to play these again as theres no record of accomplishment or score to challenge
this was very disappointing for me which is probably why i play mario bros classic on the super mario bros  advance a lot moreas a y old gamer i have played mspacman a lot on the coinops and for this reason alone i bought the game for euro
problem however is where is the point in playing any one of these games if the hiscore is erased every time you poweroff the consolethis is a very serious game spoiler for me because the only fun left is the sensation of actually moving around in a maze and that is boring after an hour or sothe other games galaga and galaxian have the problem that the slowly moving stars in the background tend to blend in with the fast moving missiles coming at you with the result that you lose lifes just because you didnt see em coming
i played those gala games on the msx when i was  and never had that problem then
essentially it boils down to this the gba screen size is too small in cm to enjoy the game
rent itnamcos reputation for developing great and influential games is deserved but some older games have survived the passage of time better than others
the evolutionary dead ends  fantastic ideas that simply didnt influence successive generations of games in obvious ways joust warlords missile command marble madness  are the really lively part of classic video gaming
namcos blessing and curse is that it successfully predicted or perhaps determined
the future path of video gaming
this collection is hurt by both that and the stinginess reflected in the short game listto address the first pole position is included on release after release of namcomuseum
its a racing game very modern by classic standards that fails to be fun
why
it was a good game  so influential that almost any sixteenbitandearlier racing game was its child this includes segas great virtua racing series
unfortunately the games that follow in its footsteps outdo it by miles
therefore nostalgia is the only real reason to play itthe other games make out better ms pacman is a blast even though the whole franchise is overrated and overexposed digdug is the gem of this collection providing plenty of bizarro rockdropping airpumping digdugging action among the pookas and fygar and galaga and its surprisingly fun forbear galaxian round out the shooter niche nicely though again they inspired so many copycats after copying space invaders first that they feel rather dilutedwhy only three stars
well to get to the second point theres only five games
even konami whose classic arcade games are criminally underrated and who cant have expected decent sales managed to get six games on their gba cart
i refuse to believe that any of these ports no matter how accurate took up very much space
xevious mappy toy pop bosconian even rallyx all but the first evolutionary deadends at least a couple of these could and should have been shoehorned onto the cartridge somehow
theres also no museum at all not even release dates but thats expected on the gbaall in all the ports are faithful though turning corners in ms pacman and digdug is slower than i remember the games are fun and most importantly its cheap
if you want a more fulfilling classic experience though look to konami arcade advanced and activision anthologyso i ordered this game and it came pretty quickly but when i opened the package the cartrage was filthy
so i cleaned it and put it in my genesis
nothing
tried it again
nothing
tested another game i owned
worked fine
so i cleaned the inside of the cartrage and i coaxed the game into working
it works perfectly nowgraphics  graphics are good but they are not in true d but i will at least accept the way the graphics are due to the fact that the system is not powerful enough to generate true d graphicsgameplay  what is the point of this
where is the real action
you just defeat robots collect rings defeat robotnik give it a breakplot  ok plot
robotnik turned all the flickes into robots very basic plotmusic   very good soundtracksound  good sound
same effects as the other games but i will accept itoverall  it is ok but i will reccommend sonic    and the sonic adventure series but not this gamethis is one of the worste fighting games of snes
actually mk in general is the worste type of snes fighting gamesmortal kombat  wasnt a junk game but it really seemed like garbage compared to the original mk and mk
ultimate mortal kombat  was a shot at trying to make things right for fans and also tried to expand mortal kombat  even further
in fact when this game came out everyone i know forgot mk existed and jumped straight for this one
i found out also this year you can buy a special controller set up for newer systems like ps that is a direct copy of the old arcadestyle controller for the original mk arcade games
and in the package it has mk   and this game regular mk just got completely dropped
anyways this games isnt junk either like mk but it missing a lot and it could have been much betterfor one thing the music sounds way worse than the genesis version
it also has a different sound a together
it has more of an industrial sound where the genesis version has more of a metalelectronica sound to it
the graphics are also not as good either
probably the biggest difference between the genesis and this version was the sound the sound is terrible in this version of umk
the gameplay has got a few glitches here and there as well
this is odd because usually snes ports of arcade games are generally really great but this one fell very short
for the most part the gameplay is alright not as nearly bad as mk that game was puking out glitches and other issues
this game also has kind of a funny glitch instead of saying brutality it says fatality after completing one that was pretty funny in a really bad sense
this isnt a terrible game but i would just recommend getting the genesis version insteadumk for the snes is a hard game to make out
on one hand the gameplay options are all intact and work like they should
punches kicks preprogrammed combos and projectiles are here
the tournament modes vs matches and kombat kodes are present
graphics are pretty spiffy too
from a pure gameplay perspective umk is what fans of the series expectbut presentationwise things are looking very incomplete
while this game was essentially a full upgrade to the original mortal kombat  in arcades here it feels like an expansion pack that cant interact with the original product
missing are all the original backgrounds and most of the announcer voices like character names
sheeva is no longer available though a ghost version of her remains in the code that causes the game to crash if used
rain and noob saibot have no finishing moves and many of the paletteswapped ninjas have recycled or modified animation to account for the sness limited memory
some of the cuts are forgivable some arent but in the end it feels like you bought  of a game instead of a full onetheres really no reason to pick this up if you own mk trilogy for playstation or nintendo  for super nintendo id actually recommend the original mk over this one as it feels like a more complete experiencebetter than mk but still nowhere near as good or exciting as mk   mkthis game like ff legend   three is typical in graphics and typical game play
but what make it fun is the story line and the elements in the game
these things are not typical it make you think and use alot of skill
if you like final fantasy series pick this game up if you like rpgs pick this one up but keep in mind it was made for the game boy so expect alot of typical things with it as wellthe storyline to final fantasy legend ii second installment of the saga series in japan billed as final fantasy in the us to boost sales is interesting but the characters in the game are impersonal and the games bland linear nature will leave modern games yearning for the depth control and immersion that todays rpgs give
also the game is incredibly easy until the very end when it becomes frustratingly difficult
youll have the ability to customize your part in the beginning my suggestion is  mutants and  humans but after that your wiggle room for customization is very smalldo i recommend this game
for regular nonadvance game boy owners it is a must have  the ffl series is the pinnacle of oldtime portable rpg titles
however there are much better games out there today it might be worth saving your money
if you have this game lying around and havent played it though it might provide quite a few hours of enjoymentthe popular contra series returns to the video game scene but now it debuts on a bit system for the first time
there are only  levels here instead of the usual  but its still an action packed shooter featuring new weapons different techniques and even enemies
there is nothing too ground breaking but it was still a wild ride that takes a lot of skill to mastermortal kombat  for sega genesis is a good game but far from perfect
mk on the super nintendo blows this one away
on this game the music and sound fx are a bit bland
the graphics arent so bad
the fatalities look fairly good but compared to the ones on the snes version they seem a bit lame
like whenever you blow your opponent up instead of their bones  body parts splattering all over the ground they simply disappear whenever landing on the ground
that really stinks
the only reason i give this game  stars instead of  is because the game features a secret cheat option which is pretty cool
the snes version of mk doesnt have a darn cheat option
the bottom line if you want an enjoyable version mortal kombat  buy it on the super nintendo snesokay heres a video game series that im sure everyone is familiar with by now
in some way or another mortal kombat has graced your life with its presence
youve either experienced the game for all its brutality in the arcades the saturated versions we got on home consoles heard about it in some angry parents consortium pushing to have the game banned from stores or heard about the games two famous creators
mortal kombat  spares nothing in terms of making the series stronger and bringing to life the concept of the almighty fatalitythe one thing that really confused me about mk was that there were two versions of this game
there was mk and then there was mk ultimate
now ive personally never played mk ultimate having owned the original mk since it was released in stores but the only real discernible difference between the two from what ive been able to gather is the addition of some characters and some new moves for some of the original lineup from mk
why they couldnt have released mk just once baffles me because the thing thats really annoying is when youre trying to find things for mk like manuals or box art no ones ever heard of anything other than mk ultimateanyway the guy in the antagonists seat this time is shao khan lord of the outworld
basically shao khan attempts to take control of the earth realm by having queen sindel born in the earth realm
this allowed khan to step into earth realm and once that happened naturally he killed everyone on earth except for those who were chosen to protect earth the only way they know how to do it mortal kombat styleone thing you have to talk about with any mortal kombat game is the moves and the fatalities the symbolic trait that brought the game to starlight status
mk introduced a combo system which could be performed by pressing the right combination of buttons while in close range to your opponent
following behind that was the ability to run and the run gauge
this allowed you to close the distance between you and your opponent and keep the pressure on them
you have your classic fatalities that each character can perform when the famous finish him
appears after your second victory
in addition to the fatalities we have our beginning dosage of animalities babalities and friendships
there are also stageexclusive fatalities such as the pit where you can uppercut your opponent off the bridge and down to their ultimate deathall of the special moves you can perform with the characters are usually no more than four to five consecutive button presses
these usually consist firstly of a series of directional buttons followed by a series of lettered buttons
unfortunately some of the characters have special moves and even fatalities that require you to press up on the directional pad
ordinarily pressing up makes your character jump
so when youre trying to do a fatality with a character that requires you to press up nine times out of ten you wont be able to perform the fatality because youll jump instead and this can become very irritating
another irritating aspect about the controls is the blockrun buttons
any mk veteran playing mk  and  on the snes knows that the l and r buttons are the block buttons
with the introduction of the run ability r became the run button and l was designated as the block button
so naturally im trying to block an enemy attack by pressing r instinctively thinking that its going to block when instead im trying to block an attack by running
that makes a whole lot of sense
the only other really irritating thing about the controls is the difficulty when it comes to trying to perform a melee combo
to this day i still cant figure out how to pull off a combo
ive read on it numerous times and practiced and practiced but still cant figure it outone thing that might drive a lot of people away from this game is the difficulty
mk games have been known to drive quite a few gamers to launch controllers at walls but this one will give you nightmares of shattered controllers
as a testament i put the game on very easy raised my handicap all the way to the max and played on the master selection to fight as many opponents as possible
i couldnt get past the third opponent no matter how hard i tried
its like the game picks up on everything you possibly do
either that or some characters just naturally hate others
sometimes you cant even lay a finger on your opponent because they just rip into you and theres nothing you can do about it
you can block everything you want to because then youll get stuck in what i call a throwtrap where they just throw you around
you cant block throws so theres no way around itgraphically the game looks great
the motioncapture technology used to generate the sprites for each combatant and the environments and the interactivity are superb
levels are sometimes comprised of one or more floors and if you start your battle on the lower floor you can uppercut your opponent through the ceiling into the second floor and continue the fight up there
it brings a whole new level of depth to the battles making it appear as if the battles are extremely intense
the detail on the character sprites is great for the snes
if you ever get a chance to or use the enable pause cheat get a really good look at shao khan
his sprite is nothing short of awesomethe music becomes a little repetitive at times
i understand when it comes to fighting games that background music usually isnt the most important aspect but when you compare the music of this game to the music of say street fighter  id much rather listen to sf simply because of its vast musical variety
the music in mk is just somewhere around a few tracks and theyre recycled over and over and over againoverall mk is a great game to play if you have the patience for it or are a fan of fighting games
it acted as a benchmark for the series and displayed a whole new world of brutality for the genre
it also gave plenty of people something to talk aboutmortal kombat  was one of the best snes games ever made
it has amazing sound graphics and challenging gameplay
now when mk came out it was kind of a disappointment but it was an even bigger disappointment on the snes
what made the nd mortal kombat so great was its amazing soundtrack digitilized speech and sound effects
this game has terrible music even when compared with the genesis version the sound effects are also horrible in this game
the graphics could have been way better
the animalities were cool but you couls say that about the genesis version as well
there really isnt any reason to get this game if you have an snes or like snes games get umk that was good but like this game it has a lot of the same flawswow this was a rather large disappointment
the graphics music and sound effects have all fallen short of mkii on this console which is very odd
the controls are the same but the additions to the gameplay have made things a bit easier once you get accustomed to themthere are a total of  playable characters not counting the hidden ones but there is still no save feature
you might want to play ultimate mk instead of this as it adds much more replay value unless you are a mortal kombat collectorcant really review this since i bought this to use on my gen mobile only to find out gen mobile does not use lock on technology
concept is great but disappointing i cant use it on my mobile like i plannedsega saturn a system that possessed a unique charm of demonstrating great d capabilities housed two processors
one of them powered d while the other one had the sole purpose of unleashing its d powers at a great  mhz
now here is where the problems begin
because the system used two separate processors it made it very difficult for developers to create games for the system because both processors must be worked with simultaneously causing the system to not have a great variety of titles like it should haveunfortunately you know as well as i do that the best game for the system panzer dragoon saga has the unfortunate disadvantage of being one of the most expensive games to obtain due to its very limited print run
please do not misunderstand the system is not terrible it just has a somewhat limited selection
while there does exist good games such as hexen tomb raider or gex which can be obtained at fair prices i can get those for other systems and the reason i would want a sega saturn is to play d fighting games which i am not exactly a fan of or rpgs such as magic knight rayearth which cost a fortune to buy as these games had very obviously  suffered from limited print runs
on the playstation i can purchase similar titles for a fraction of the cost with the same gameplay value as their saturn counterpartsdespite not being a fan of d fighting games however i can still see that they are a great strength for the saturn as there are a good sum of d fighting games to go around and they can mostly be obtained at a decent price so that is certainly a plus but i cannot see myself thoroughly enjoying this system if i must spend more than  to play some of the games i would enjoy such as the rpg i have mentioned above and some other rpgs for the system
overall i would recommend this system if you are a d fighting or platforming fan but if you prefer rpgs i would recommend steering towards the playstation since they are far better priced with a greater variety than the saturn itselfbefore i get all kinds of hate messages let me start by saying i love sega
the genesis and dreamcast were great systems
the saturn however is not the same caliber of those two systemsif youve done your research on the system you know the saturn had problems from day one
sega decided to put two processors in the saturn as a response to the sonys announcement of the playstation specs
this made development difficult as a result many saturn games were inferior ports
furthermore they made a surprise launch before the internet was popularand no one was ready except for sega
this simultaneously angered retailers developers publishers and consumers simply put the strategy backfired
in a nutshell that is the problem with the saturn
the system spent its entire life trying to prove its superiority to its competition when in fact the ps and n went on to be very successful systemsthat is not to say that the saturn is a bad system
i would never go that far
i do believe it has some redeeming qualities that make it attractive to the right kind of gamer
i am simply saying it lacks the universal appeal that its competition has
so if you want to see if the system is right for you continue reading first party titles
much like the n the best games on the system were developed or at very least published in house
its really a sight to behold vituta fighter  running at xfps and then seeing the saturn buckle under trying to run some of the third party titles like symphony of the night
but even sega had trouble with the saturn for a good example look at the original releases of daytona and viruta fighter  they were re released later and look like someone put a new video card in the system
in general the first party titles run the best on the system
im not saying third party titles cant look good too just not as much fighters
for whatever reason fighters run particularly well on the saturn
and of all the capcom fighters in particular seem to run best of all
darkstalkers and xmen children of the atom are very well suited for the platform
the fludiity of the animation and the controls just flow in games like this
if you invest  in a mb action replay think expansion pack for the n you can run games like marvel super heroes vs street fighter and metal slug and it really shows that the saturn was mean to be a d powerhouse
it also helps that the controller is practically made for fighters imports
the action replay also allows you to run japanese games
the saturn was much more successful in japan than it was here in the states thus a lot more games were released in that region
as long as the japanese text isnt an issue you can get a lot of the games that never came here or get the games that did come here significantly cheaperthe real problem i have with recommending the saturn is that they are not only hard to come by but surprisingly expensive to collect for
think of it this way
the ps is not only cheaper to collect for but is also easier to get games for in general it has some expensiverare games but there is more than enough quality software that is common
the saturn has about the same size library that the n does but the expense and the difficulty finding games can be very prohibitive
dont get me wrong there are some gems to be had but with digital distribution and services like xbla and psn re releasing older content
its a hard system to reccomendthe sega saturn could have easily beaten the playstation if sega had spent more time on it
the graphics are equilvant if not better and the idea for a d controller was neat
the problem with this system is games
nights into dreams a port of d blast and a few others
they didnt even make a full sonic game on it
sonic d blast and sonic r dont count
they were developing a d sonic game called sonic xtreme but it was a disaster
it had already been moved from genesis to x and then the saturn
the directors of the game were being switched constantly the final one almost died from stress
at one point xtreme was using the nights into dreams d engine but then they got in trouble for it and had to start from scratch
so sega made a console and never had an actual sonic game on it
pure sadness
i recommend the console because some games are not that bad but i wouldnt want to spend more then  on itsure the graphics and gameplay in nba street vol
 are good but youll play this game maybe a week before it ends up gather dust in your collection
there really is no replay value to it
as the game is only  i wouldnt call it a waste of money
mark my words however youll quickly tire of this titleno doubt there will be more daredevil fans worldwide with the release of the mega budgeted film starring ben affleck so let the marketing ploys begin
when playing daredevil for the gba one will wonder how much more great this game could have been had dds abilities namely his super radar senses been better implemented
aside from that the game is standard side scrolling beat em up fare that was seen so much in the bit era thanks acclaim with look alike enemies and backgrounds
however daredevil does have some good going for it
if you beat the game it doesnt take long to get through the  levels you can play again to collect all the dd icons throughout the game which will allow you to view images from the film comic illustrations alternate costumes and a level select among a bombardment of other secrets
the movie versions of elektra and bullseye are here as is the kingpin plus foes from the comic series such as sewer king turk and echo
the graphics are really nothing spectacular and dont show off any of the gbas capabilities like it could have
the cinematicesque soundtrack is unusually good and the controls are mindnumbingly simple
all in all daredevil isnt necessarily a bad game for the gba and fans of the comic or film should check it out but it just annoys me a bit and other long time daredevil fans as well of how great this game could have been if some more polish and thought went into itea sports usually bring great sporting games out and they havent disappointed with this title its just that they have added the usual unnecessary fillers that bring the game down later on
rumble racing is much like a hot wheels game infact apart from the backgrounds being more a realistic setting rather than a childs bedroom both games are identical in many ways
you choose your vehicle and enter either a single race exhibition or a championship usually consists of  to  races and your goal is to come first place
in the midst of the racing action you can also obtain powerups some may be useful some needed to be thought out a bit better
you can obtain speed boosts invincibility better traction shields and a not too thought out very well oil slick that would have been better if it had have been a smoke screen there are a couple of other powerups a few projectiles and bombs etc  the coolest is when you are coming in last or so you can obtain a tornado that sweeps through the tracks and blows everyone away
you can also preform stunts in your car when you jump over ramps and hills a successful stunt will give you nitro boosts when you land and you can preform multiple stunts in one gothere is also some stunt challenges and other modes of  player
options allow you to turn power ups on or off but one thing i found there is no option for is turning the controller vibrations off as my controller freezes up sometimes when the vibrations go off and it was annoying having to turn the controller on and off again during a race to gain control again
it may not apply to everyone or anyone else but how hard it an option to turn that on and off to be put in the gamebut i wont list that as a con ill be more fair to the games actual universal cons graphics
its a shame some cars have some nice details but they are not the cars you want to race as inclusion of too many filler cars
these are cars you can choose or unlock but their profiles are slow and boring hence you would never use them letting them fill up unneeded space
there is maybe  or  cars you would use in this game so why include about  you will never use no upgrades
it wouldnt be as annoying to have so many filler cars if you could upgrade them but an upgrade in this game means  levels of looks but the stats of the cars performance all stay the same
pointless not enough details in backgrounds
sometimes i thought too much effort went into the design of one concept of the game but the backgrounds and roads are what needed to be focused more on as sometimes blurry graphics make you make a misjudgment in turns because you couldnt see what you where doing some say its ps graphics but thats crap other games managed to perfect it
ea should have considered something as simple as which colors to have next to each other and which ones blend in together too much
imagine is super mario was running along a sky background that matched the same color of his cloths not many unlockables worth unlocking
there is maybe  cars worthy of being unlocked in this game only because there stats are almost flawless however there is no flawless car to unlock which is a shame
however the interceptor cop car is just about flawless in everything but stunts it still manages to be behind the computer opponents in elite mode
do the stats of these cars in this game even mean anything or are they just there for show
get it right next time eathe game is fast paced and does give off a feeling of tight action and its not simply a matter of driving as fast as you can power ups and shortcuts are something you really have to know how to use well to achieve first position so the racing is tough sometimes which is a good thing
but the reuse of the same tracks over and over again really brought the game down a notch
it seems a bit unfair you have to race the same  tracks in the first  championships before you get a new one to try
overall i think there is only about  tracks
if thatwhat the game could have used to spark it up would be a custom car builder or paint jobs
as some of the faster cars you would most likely pick dont have the nice decals that a few of the slower cars have
and why on earth someone would think unlocking a big slow rv would be fun to drive is beyond me
its not like you can get the thing to go fast enough to use a weight advantage
someone wasnt thinking too straight when they designed some of these elementsoverallgraphics sound   controls options  extras   replay v if you come by the small chance of finding this game to rent then check it out its worthy of a day or twos play but after that i doubt you will be lingering around to keep on playing it again and again
however i did not play this on  player so maybe ask someone else what its like on those modes
i am only reviewing it on a  player and championship mode scale for the most part of this reviewgraphics  good enough i suppose but not the best
they are a little on the grainy side especially during the introduction movie
which doesnt make sense because it uses shots from the game
how is it that playing the game looks better than the intro
the tracks arent really anything special
though i have to admit i have yet to see another car racing game with tracks full of places to do stuntscontrols  very smooth
no problems heresound  excellent
cars have slightly different motor sounds which you probably wont be paying attention to while youre racing though
the announcer never seems to get annoying even though after a while youve heard everything he says at least once
the music is okay but once again you wont be paying much attention to it eithergameplay  the main area where the game falls apart
for several reasons
for one you have to have a friend to play this game with you while doing the championships and try to get the top two or three spots every race
because the computer cheats even on the easiest setting forgiving and especially when you start hitting the elite class races
you need to get the top spots so the cpu cant win the gold because if one of you doesnt doesnt get gold you cant advance to the next championshiphow does the cpu cheat
it seems to have unlimited turbos and unlimited traction power ups that it can seem to activate at will to counter the effects of other power ups and zoom ahead of you
freeze the ice power up that affect a cars handling ability will sometimes have no effect on them if they get hit with it while it can end up getting you completely turned around and crashed into a wall
plus the cpu seems to be able to take all the corners turns and shortcuts perfectly
at the beginning it doesnt even use the shortcuts but later it uses all of them and knows which ones to use to get better lap timesonce you do manage to get gold in the championships you will unlock one new car and one new track
however this unlocks only half the cars as you will have to find a hidden egg on each track to unlock the other cars
had i known this when i first played it i wouldnt have been so pissed off the first time i played through the game
because when i had finished nearly all the championships i still hadnt unlocked all the cars
plus to begin with most of the cars you do unlock are worthless
the only cars that have decent handling are tiberius and silver streak
dont even bother touching the other cars not even the cataclysm though it has the same stats as the two i mentioned since you will notice a difference in how the car handles
which makes this games cheating more evident as it can seem to propel cars that have sublimely awful stats and handling to the top spots since ive seen cars like the banger place secondreplay value  almost nonexistent
for one the game is a pain in the ass to play through because of the cheapness and cheating of the computer
youll never get the best lap times so being able to race the tracks with your friend for fun to see who can get the best records has been ruined
the top scores for total race time and lap time for each track are impossible to break
so are the scores on the stunt mode
who the hell set these records they have to be manufactured meaning i think they were just typed in because you dont have a hope in hell of ever touching them
so once youve unlocked all the cars and all the tracks there isnt much to do
like i mentioned before  of the cars arent even worth unlocking in the first place
you could play through the whole thing over again from scratch but whats the pointthe commentary is embarrasing
fortunately you can turn it off in the options sectionstep  you must not be a graphics hound parts of the game look like a n game
it has very poor texturing in some parts and yet other parts of the game look great
what a mysterystep  you must like racing games that would be considered arcade
you must love powerups and short cutsstep  if you dont like tough games you wont like this game
the ai is determined to drive you off the road and also often speed by you and takes the powerup you were meant to havestep  you dont need a memory card this game has that capability of coarse but also gives you passwords for progressionstep  since this is like ssx with cars worse graphics and limited tricks youd be better off buying that game instead unless you have it alreadythis game is good but not awesome
it has replay value but its no rpg
i personally like it better for nintendo because you get more into the game as the rider
i skate so i know the whole physics deal and its really very close to actual life skating cept for the places of course
pros  making money to buy thing like stats and better decks
great charcters with different characteristics
much much replay value i havent gotten bored yet
as of many months god mode is awesome and works very well with this game
god mode is where you are looking over the person or persons cons  easy enough to beat and once you get it down its easy to do huge tricks
specials dont do much
yes the specials dont do much if anythings because you get tons of points for normal moves
areas could be more complex but its not exactly a bad thing to memorize themgreat game great buyi think the main thing thats saving this game from being bad is great graphics and good control
the password save feature gets kind of annoying takes a minute and a half each time to type it in and the music is just terrible you would think it came from a regular nintendo if you heard it on speakers
it is all this highpitch electronic music and there arent many music tracks
i guess the sound effects are okay except for that annoying squeal of the tires
but the good things about this game are the great graphics and above average control definitely better than gbc
also i like how it is so easy to upgrade your car without having to handle money and manage it
sometimes after you finish a lap you are awarded a new muffler or better springs and you dont have to mess around with figuring out what to spend money on you have only one choicepros great graphics looks like gran turismo except the track is completely flat
there are cool night tracks daytime tracks and sunset tracks
 tracks totalgameplay is pretty good although if you have it on automatic transmission the only buttons you use are a and bthe cars are neat too although i would like to see some ferraris etc there is a nice list of  cars and they all look like they do in real lifea good thing about password save you can get codes from someone else and use them on your own game just like using cheatsconsmusic is really highpitched and repeats over and over again
only a few music tracks too
sound effects arent that great eitherpassword save feature is annoying despite the fact that you can use other peoples codes
i timed myself once and it took me  minutes to type in  characters
plus you need a pen and paper handy
if youre looking forward to just doing a quick race youre going to have to type in your password just for that one race if you want all the tracks
thats not very convenient considering youre spending more time doing the password than playingi dont know if you should really buy this game i bought it from a store with store credit that i had you may want to do that if you can instead of paying for it
or at least rent this game first
buying video games is risky some of them are bad
rent this first to see if you like itthis is one of the best racing games ive ever playedit provides a good challenge but even the youngest players can master this pickupampplay game
i gave the game the poor rating of three stars because it has a selection of wellknown car dealerships but is missing some of the more popular oneswell id say i was a little disappointed when i booted up operation flashpoint for the first time and saw its weak graphics and low detail
i have a very fast system with an nvidia tnt card and on the highest settings it doesnt look so hot
trees foliage are just opaque clumps when you get up close to them
you can hide in the bushes but cant see through them unless your head is sticking all the way out
my point is for all the hype and excitement the developers should have spent much more time on the terrains and renditions of objects soldiers etc
the voices are very poor sounds like a couple of high school kids worked on this
games like deadly dozen even though the gameplay is much more basic will be much more fun for most people because of the excellent ambient sounds amazing lighting and textures and even the grass sways in the wind
in my opinion operation flashpoint could have been much more than it is
id say save your money for medal of honorallied assault or try deadly dozen at half the price
another game that surpasses operation flashpoint is hidden and dangerous which is  years older the game play and enviornments squash that of operation flashpointthis game could have been so much more but i beat it in the first three days and unlocked every possible secret that the game had thus the game is limited to a players freedom in which you could only do so many things for only such an amount of time
everything in this game is limited and i now sold it to my friend for a half quarter
this game would have been better if it had the followingcreate a wrestler modechampionship titles or beltsoption on changing rulesthen this game would be great but i guess we will have to wait for the sequal for these certain things to come
anyways i really love the fact that the one and only company with the best controls for any wrestling game ever aki made this game and that is a big positive but the only one i can think of
its definitely a rent in my opinion and only good playing with some friends or familydef jam vendetta was a fresh idea from the developers but since its first generation some mods are definitely in order
its wrestling right
wheres the chairs bells etc to smack your opponents with
the game could also benefit from more artists
wheres ll cool j beastie boys and run dmcand what the hell is funk master flex doing there
anyway the grab and hold game engine is good the quotblazinquot finishers are a sight for sore eyes and will make you say whoa the tracks are hot but like the fighters they need more classic tracks
my advice is get this at a bargain basement when value goes downits not worth ur  plus tax hell amazon has is for  bucksthe game is too dark and unless your in a very dark room its hard to see what is going on
ill play it because its still good fun
tm is still the best version made i think despite the crappy graphics ps download available nowfor the most part this game keeps you amused has some killer combat options and has decent graphics but one thing i did not like was how repetitive the atmosphere and dark enviornments were
at first the atmosphere of the game seemed big and impressive but as you continue to play and after so many times of banging your truck against the exact same wall over and over the game got lamethis is my first twisted metal game out of the series and even though it has its strong points i dont think i will check out another twisted metal game in the series
long time fans should definately not be let down with this oneill say it right now if you dont have a full multiplayer game going this game will not be fun
the single player story missions are fine but theyre only for the story
four player mayhem unloading arsenals upon each other is the fun stuff
the single player is just frustrating all the other cars aim for you and the ai is unfair
they have an infinite number of their special weapons meaning the second they cross you its gonna be hard to see where youre going in a second
the graphics are very good and the physics engine is fantastic the environments are fun although the collecting hidden tokens for unlockables is lame and the characters are diverse and all are fun to use in their own way
but again absolutely not for single playerpros  great graphics similar to gran turismo  just a little more hazy and gritty
much better than psone twisted metal titles great multiplayer mode  like quake  with cars would be phenomenal online which will happen around xmascons  too dark there is really no reason for it its just to add to the shock value of the game because thats what gamemakers think people like sicktwisted games dumb stories these stories are what gives the game its mature rating filled with murderous tales profanity ect
the purpose of playing the game is to unlock these stories which seems comical to me way too hard  its beatable but just not fun
the computer cars just attack you and not each other so it is  vs  instead of everyone for themselves
health is scarce and when you get it it hardly gives you enough to survive a direct hit
repair stations are inconvienently located and are always surrounded by several ememies
this turns the game from what it should be a fun shooter into a frustrating survival gameoverall  buy it what the heck its good  just not greatgenerally nothing new here
same game as carmagedon but less fun
if you liked carmagedon  you will be disappointed by this gamewhats good about itframe rate is way up there for a larger terrain map
game is very responsivemenu art work and interface nicely donemusic is goodweaponary is funwhats not good about itscenary is dark and foggy
partially because the story calls for it but probably to cull most of the terrain awaydynamics are not as good as carmagedon
when cars crash or flip over the physics are not quite right
considering carmagedon came out probably over  years ago i am disappointed by the dynamics in this gamecars do not deform as well as in carmagedon so you have to look at the quothealthquot meter to figure out when your car will blow upextremely difficult even on easy levelgame has less personality than carmagedon
you dont get screaming pedestrians tourists and cowsdont get me wrong tm b is a fun game but only for a while
nothing noteworthy has really been added to make it different from others in the series and i got bored of it after about a month
the graphics are excellent and the gameplay is very good but the replay value is poor
i think they shouldve just waited and put out only the online version
that way it wouldve added some depth to the series and they wouldnt have isolated people like me who bought this version from buying itthe graphics have improved
the weapons have improved
sadly the story line is still more of the same
with these types of games now including great story modes and various types of activities this dated dimension of gaming just isnt as appealing as it once was
once youve admitted that to yourself this is still a night of fun with friends
as cheap as it is now go ahead and buy itworks great and is fine with my games
it has been a pleasure to usewhy did nintendo make it so you had to have more than one
oh thats right its nintendo they love to force you to pay for more if they canthe title explains my problem with this cable
it occasionally disconnects in the middle of linking activity
of course that happens when the cable is stiff from lack of use
ill have to remember to buy used the next timecrawlpunchand swing your way to the top in the newest superherorumble spiderman the sinister six for gbc
as spidey you are called upon to save a kidnapped auntie m aunt may for those of you who arent familiar from the manytentacled clucthes of doc ock
all of spideys powers are yours to use including the ability to cling to walls super strength speed and webslinging and more
spiderman  contains game play similar to its ps cousin with suberb graphics and sound rounding out and impressive titlebuys you an arcade port of a three level shooter
yes i was one of the people with high hopes when i bought the gun and house of the dead  that there would be many shooters for the dreamcast but all there is is the aforementioned and the saturn virtua cop  that was included in the smash pack
just because sega is the only one still making shooting games but not making an official gun
doesnt make this one a great game
the voice acting is some of the worst ive ever heard and the main character is a james bond wannabe
this game can be completely finished in  hours including the training missions
it seems to use the exact same engine as hod with no enhancements but a lot less gore
this game is at most worth a rent not a purchase
but it is significantly better than those  titles on playstation so if you need an impulse purchase do get this onei like the weapons involved in the game
i like the games plot
i like the games graphics sounds  characters  even the enemy no kidding
but i dont reccoment it because like one of the guys who wrote a review about this said that he beat it on the hardest difficulty the first night
he is so right
it only has  missions
its major boring after awhile its a rent not a buy
after you return it you wont want to even think of playing it agian
but its neat just wish it was longer
you can do the cmf training but dont even expect in a year to finish all the training
some of the training sessions are impossible
but if you some how get a miracle of beating them you can do another world which is just the game all over agian except that its much harder and the enemys move in different directions
rent dont buy please dont you wont be ashamed you rented it
 if you wanna know a good light gun try the mad catz
its the most accurate cool and comfortable gun out on the market
now the starfire buy interact  read my review on the starfire lightgun by interact whenever you get a chance if you want to
i never wrote a review on mad catzhow many times are they going to update the graphics and then sell civ as a new game
granted there were some minor changes and the civspecific advantages were nicebut its the same game microprose published way back when
try something new sidbut it sure is hard
on the easiest setting youll more then likely spend the majority of the time at war with  other societies who have an alliance against you
and if you want to keep up scientifically you wont have any gold until you run out of achievements to learnill warn you before i give my two cents i played both previous versions of civilization religiously when they were first released so sid meiers classic strategy game is not new ground for my pc gaming tastes
as a matter of fact that might be my biggest complaint about the second sequel
except for improved graphics there really wasnt much of a change between parts two and three
sure the trading and espionage system was altered the wonders changed a little and diplomacy was improved but if you played civ  as much as i did you should have no problem diving right into civ   i might have used the ingame civilopedia for a grand total of fifteen minutes otherwise it was as if i hadnt even left civ   i still had some classic civ fun but it didnt last long
i spent more time with strategy games that were nowhere near as good as civ  only because they offered something fresh
now if youve never had the pleasure to play a civilization game quickly pick the latest edition up because it might be the most addictive strategy game ever
even to this day i occasionally find myself reinstalling the game and spending an entire saturday conquering the world
if youre a civ fanatic or civ rookie im sure youll enjoy the newest addition but for the rest of the pc gaming community you might want to wait until civ  and all its expansions are packaged together into an economy deluxe edition only so youll get a chance to play more new content in the sequel
one warning for all gamers on giant maps with the max amount of civilizations this game can go slow especially in later years when the continent is saturated with cities
civ  boasts the best ai of the entire series but im not sure a smarter computer opponent was worth the grueling decision making time for the cpu
the game still captures the classic civ magic we all love but ive played the first two games so often id rather see a remake of alpha centauri or colonization which have yet to see a sequelmost notably quotrise of nationsquot
which is why i wanted to briefly jump in and offer a quick piece of advice if youre seriously considering buying this game consider rise of nations first its more complex less buggy it has quotrealquot multiplayer that works excellent and the graphics are considerably betterhope this was a helpi like this game
but its just the same civilization just with better graphics
i got bored with it very quickly
probably because ive already played it
great concept they just need to find a way to make turns go faster
i would play my turn then go do dishes or something while the computer took its turn
thats how long it could lastfirst let me say that i hate turn based gamesthis is mainly because i play single player most of the timeif i had a friend to play against instead of just the ai maybe i would change my mind but i doubt iti bought this game hoping it would change my mind but alas nowith all the hype and glorious attributes touted for this game it should have knocked my socks offat first it does intriguebut then the flaws begin to appearthe ai is much too agressive and takes unfair advantagethe resources you need to build certain units are controlled by the very same unfair ai making diplomacy almost useless by the outrageous demands it makes and refuses to budge fromcheats would be the only way i see to get on balance with the ai unless sidampco deem to release a patch to level this outlike many others i would like to see some personalization of ones own characters instead of everything sidi gave it an extra star for the historical content and teaching potential the game posseses but i would not recomend it as a quotfunquot game unless youre a big fan of the serieslook elsewhere for the quotjust  more clikquot feelingsuch as age of empires or empire earthi had no problems with crashes or lockups on my machinepiii ghzgfcode is goodampno graphical glitches seendoesnt live up to its potentialcivilization
the name should conjure forth in a players memory countless hours of one more turn how much coffee the human body can consume and the true meaning of the word addictioni poured more time into civ than i have ever put into any other game hands down
to this day i find myself playing it for hours at a timethe game is perfect has seemingly infinite replayability and is a blast in multiplayer
so when civilization iii was slated to come out i was beside myself with joy
i was an almost daily visitor to the games website inputting my own questions alongside the other thousands of fansbut how do you explain this game
to really understand the problem one must look at both the inherent pros and cons of the game itself
in my humble opinion sid got some things dead right things that really do add to a game like this
and others its like he forgot god forgive me for saying this about a computer gaming legend like this and got completely backwardsin its favor civ  is very pretty to look at for a game of its type
animated units run across the landscape and terrain has a fresh and real feel to it
another plus to the game is the addition of borders
i love it when i can take over a rival city bloodlessly and intact
and it offers incentive to throw production into buildings that otherwise might be sidelined in favor of military applications libraries and the like
the research tree makes a little more sense than it did in civ  but ill be the first to tell ya that i miss the old one a lot more
i keep hitting philosophy and expecting to get a free advance and when nothing happens i cant hide my disappointment
the animated battles are nice to watch and i like the addition of levels of experience for your troops ie veteran and elite
the end of the game as i watch my civlizations borders expand on the overview area i cant help but think back to that turn and say i remember that
 when certain events happen or wonders are built
these are all great things about this game to me and its one of the reasons that i continue to try to win at itbut the whole effort is hamstrung by some rather critical problems ones that im surprised the gaming community doesnt seem to want to acknowledge and those that do do it reluctantly
heres some examples units are horribly unbalanced
this has gotten a little better with the latest patches but the fact remains that a guy wielding a sword should be no match for a guy firing a rifle
its frustrating to see advanced units fall before medieval weaponsit makes no sense
i could forgive the game every single fault it had if not for this single problem i have played and played and played
and yet i cannot seem to advance beyond industrial age despite the outrageous amount of time and effort i put into expansion and science research
i do not know what the american f special unit looks or plays like
nor the german panzer
these will probably remain mysteries to me for as long as i play the game and that bothers me
civ  rewarded the player who put the most time and effort into science by giving them technological edge over rivals and enemies
this along with the unit imbalances mentioned above seriously hamper the entire experience for me
someone write me and tell me theyve at least seen a spaceship without cheating
i want to know if its possible diplomacy is a mixed bag
it starts out civil enough when dealing with other civs but i cannot see the sense in hiawatha demanding that i give him world maps money and my latest scientific discovery just so i can get useless world maps in return
world maps   gold  printing press does not equal world maps no matter how much of the globe he possesses the corruption thing is a little out of whack
what incentive do i have to expand my empire when i know that my fringe colonies will never be able to build anything because theyll always have just one production shield
and yes im a democracy with a police station courthouse roads and a harbor
it makes me not want to expand because its almost too much troubleas i said i could let the game slide by with  stars if the unit imbalance issue was corrected but even after all these patches i still cant get over the fact that a veteran swordman can take down an elite rifle unit while only taking  hitstar control  master of orion  civilization  bad things come from infogrames in shaving not played this game in at least  years obviously to the exclusion of civ
ii my expectations were fairly high
surely in that time and this being the third installment there would be a great many renovations and innovations
well there isnt and some would no doubt be quick to point out that one can not improve on perfection so i will be quick to point out that one should at least try when its my money they want
this is pretty much exactly the same game i played all those many years ago and i can see almost naught a single change what so ever
that is my major gripe and why it earns not but   stars at least from me
i cant however ignore the highly addictive quality this game still retains
maybe its because it takes forever to play only to be cruelly ridiculed by your cpu for not being better at it
more than a few times was my clinched fist hammered on the table when a stupid move on my part had cost me dearly
such emotions can only be wrought by a program of quality and good writing or perhaps just plain stupidity on my part
who cares the game is challenging and has its moments
beware though ye consumer this is naught but leftovers reheated and repackaged for all us suckers out there with a few extra bucks a computer and no girlfriend  or boyfriendthis game really had no point
i didnt even understand the point
one thing i really didnt like about this game was the fact that there was no levels
at first the game looked greatand i thought it was going to be my favorite game of all time
it was a big letdown
the cheats for this game really  i dont really reccomend this game but it is not bad as some games ive playeda strategy game without decent battles are not my type of fun
make no mistake this is a great game but i rather go for medieval total warmy opinion of civlization iii is based on the fact that i have played its predecessors
if you havent played any of the civilization games by all means purchase this game as quick as possible because you have no idea what youre missing
a time encompassing game primarily about world conquest you control a civilization from caveman times to the present day and expand world borders attempting to win the game in different ways
the third version of this popular series still follows the same gameplay format that made it a universal favorite and thats why i had problems with it it didnt change muchi suppose its difficult for a software company to live up to a famous titles reputation when its already one of the classic strategy games of alltime but i didnt feel like i got my moneys worth after playing this game for a week
frankly im already bored with the gamethere are some new and interesting changes to the game
one of the most obvious new features is a system that relies on specific resources oil rubber etc
rather than allowing you the ability to build anything you choose
another great new feature is the expanded diplomacy option with just about anything in the game available for trading with other countries
the game is much smarter now and computer opponents make better decisions
this may have led to what i find one of the biggest problems in the game the incredibly slow running speed
the more computer controlled civilizations you allow in your game the slower it runs from turn to turn
even with low amounts of civilizations when the game has progressed to a later point in time and the world is heavily populated it can take at least a minute for the computer to decide its moves in one turn
i have a decent system and would recommend that anyone with a slow processor be prepared to practice their patience as you will be playing games that will take a long time
i have no problem with strategy games that take a while before completing the objectives but civilization iii loses its appeal when i make decisions in a few quick seconds and then wait a minute or two for the computer to complete its turnif this is your first time to play the civilization series the instruction manual is phenomenal and it is equipped with an ingame encylopedia that describes all units buildings wonders etc
to you
i was disappointed that the game didnt come with enough new aspects to force me to read the instructions much
i jumped right in to civilization iii as though i didnt miss anything from the previous versionthe provided scenariosmaps arent near as good as the other versions and civilizations do not start in their historically correct positions on a simulated world map
i would check the internet as there are bound to be plenty of interesting maps and modifications created by players
also the game does not come with a multiplayer internet format
knowing the recent history of pc games the company will probably release a costly expansion pack in later months that will allow you to play this on the internet with other playersa great game for anyone that is new to the civilization series but in my opinion only a fair game for returning playersthere are some things to like and some not to likethe new graphics are not all that better  in fact i think it makes it harder to see whats going on
the game tries to do a lot of stuff quotautomaticallyquot for you and actually makes it more difficult for you to do what you want
on the plus side  the game does make some good choices most of the timethe diplomacy is much better and the computer is a much smarter player than in the pastits a good game  but i think they could have done a lot better by keeping what was good with civ ii and adding in just the diplomacy and the improved aiwhen i first got the game i really liked it but after playing it for awhile i got tired of it rather quickly
one of the worst things about the game was later in the game when the computer moves its armies
it can take a long while
the interface is much improved over civ  but the game does tire quickly
only for a real fan of the civ gamesi feel kinda let down by this game
yeah it has some ok graphics would kinda have to considering its the st century
but its really the least fun of any of the civilizations for me at least
i highly reccomend quotalpha centauriquot
its better in every way imoill start out by saying this is a great game
its very well done the graphics and sound are good and the gameplay is great
the music is definitely not as good as the civ music its just kind of background music with very very repetitive themes
gameplay is the same build cities train units colonize negotiate etc
here comes the annoying part
diplomacy is incredibly annoying
the computers will seem to gang up on you even on low level ai
you will have to struggle to keep up with the computers as they race through the tech tree
and there are moments when you just want to bash your monitor in
moments like when a longbowman defeats an infantryman or a cavalry destroys a tank
and there are no cheat codes
espionage also has been made very expensive and risky
in addition to all this naval combat and artillery have been rendered almost worthlessthis game doesnt seem to have been designed with the intentions of making a fun game
it seems like it was made to follow up civilization  i think this is its mortal flaw
its historically inaccurate and incredibly frustratingive been a huge fan of civilization since the very first dos version  and enjoy this one as well
theyve really improved the graphics as well as the gameplay
i love that theyve included culture and have increased your diplomacy options
beware though that this version of the game is much more difficult to win than civ  ever was and there is no cheat mode to make sure you cant lose
the computer opponents are much smarter this time and even on the easiest game setting dont hesitate to form alliances against you both military and economictheyve also done away with spys diplomats and caravans  though im not quite sure why
you have to set up trade with other kingdoms via the foreign advisor screen and isnt the easiest thing to manage
as far as spys go i dont understand why theyve done away with them
theyre functions are all part of a new wonder quotintelligence agencyquot
no more buying your opponents citieson the negative side though  gameplay has certainly slowed down
in one complex game i played i would literally have to wait almost a minute every time the computer moved
this was the biggest detriment to the new version
and while i love the new foreign advisor screen if youre playing with more than  other civs  theres no way to check intelligence on them
they dont show up on the foreign advisor screen at all
another nice function they could have built in would have been an automatic file manager for saved games
the saved files can reach over  mb each and have to be manually deletedi was and still am a big fan of sid meiers games and i was anxiously awaiting civ iii
how can i describe it without being so partial
ill do my best and try to focus on a few itemsthe overall impression is that the complexity of the game has increased tremendously
you have to play the game several and several times to catch the essence of some functions because you cant grasp them all in just two or three timesgood things culture i love to acquire cities just for building libraries and temples diplomacy you can bargain and exchange almost everything and if you keep yourself a loyal guy the possibilities of being in peace all the time are big upgrade good thing when you lacked leonardosbad things resources i was well advanced of my competitors and couldnt build railroads due to my lack of coal
 wonders they take longer to build and have lesser effects complexity you need plenty of time to get the basicsoverall opinion more or less good it could have been different and the graphics which are more complex suck most of the resources the editor might help you customize a bit the gamefirst of all take the system requirements to heart
if you are on the low end dont bother
i would literally sit for  to  minutes between turns waiting for the computer sims to finish their turns
on the other hand my friend who has a top of the line computer could finish an entire game in one nightsecondly there isnt that much different
to me it just felt like a prettier version of  its still fun but i needed something moreand i wonder why if you can go up against  other civilizations why they all dont appear in your diplomacy advisor screen
only the first  or is it 
will show up
the downside of this is that you cant see who theyre allied with or who theyre at war with
am i missing something
this game is still fun but if youre expecting anything radically different youll be disappointed
if youre new to the series youll love this gameif youve played nightfire on any of the other home systems than youll be pleased to know that for the most part that the objectives locations and maps are nearly identical albeit more simplistic in this gba conversion
the only problem is youll be lucky if you can see what your doing half the time
the first thing youll notice when you pop in nightfire are the surprisingly blurry graphics
the enemies move around so stiff and the graphics are so blurry that sometimes youll have a hard time telling if your shooting an enemy or a coffee table but the enemies shout out annoying one liners at you so this doesnt become that big a drawback then again
the clumsy item access interface that is found on any of the other nightfire versions is here as well but thanks to the gbas limited control scheme it is harder to navigate items and while moving and aiming your weapon at the same time
this becomes even more of a pain during the stealth missions
however nightfire is not without its charm the music and sound effects are excellent and some of the best to be heard on the gba and there is a surprising amount of depth to be found thanks to getting to use all sorts of bond gadgets like the laser wristwatch and tons more all of which you have access to
that alone is nightfires saving grace and the games surprising depth makes it worth a rental but i strongly suggest trying the game before you buywhile i found beyond atlantis ii to be very pretty the plot was somewhat unsatisfying because it didnt seem fully developedi really enjoyed several of the worlds presented here and some of the contraptions are simply stunning however some of the puzzles are very frustrating
many of them initially difficult but once attacked from the right angle they become clear
there are others though that i just couldnt figure out without the assistance of a walkthrough
perhaps im a complete moron but they just werent intuitive to methe animation is very pretty and the cutscenes of good quality
i wouldnt say the graphics approach myst exile but theyre close to riven
this game does suffer from the usual dreamcatcher navigational shortcomings though  one is not allowed free movement rather there are only certain areas to click on and then the game walks you to them automatically
i prefer being able to freely navigate the environments but this does result in a lot more overhead on the game
further there was one area of the game that was nighimpossible to navigate at all  it was intentionally disorienting but i feel they went overboard and made it too frustrating
this is a pity because this world an underwater one that largely resembles a giant jellyfish is very lovelyas i mentioned previously the plot had some interesting ideas that just didnt get fleshed out too well the overall storyline could have been made much more interesting and exciting and the characters could have been better developed
still despite its shortcomings its an enjoyable game that really doesnt take too long to play at all even with the difficulties i had with a few of the puzzles id imagine it took me less than  hours to play start to finishfor fans of fpss i definitely recommend waiting
trust me
the game way exceeded the sales the production company thought
this means you must download a mb  file from online to update it
so if you use a k modem hopefully you know someone with dsl and a burner
 it is not your standard fps
the gameplay is more like everquest than quake or hl
 it costs  a month to play
the first month is free
this i actually think is a good thing
it will at the very least weed out the idiots who ruin online gaming by being idiots
 the registration serve went down because of the overload and an quotincompatibilityquot issue
 the game server is down and at the present moment  pm estthe most people that have played so far is  again the servers had an quotincompatibilityquot issueso wait till they fix all the bugs
wait wait wait
be patient
i am as excited to play a working title as much as you and i already own itfirst some good things absolutely no npcs quotquestsquot which are in actuality missions are  different everytime
why
because a real person is always behind it the ability to play as infantry a pilot driver or captain of a ship the innovation of an mmorpg that is a real time first person strategyshooter in a persistant world
folks this is like a huge mmorpg version of games like halflifes internet play the detail and accuracy is some of the bestunfortunately there are several problems with this game bugs
what can i say about them
they are all over tho not as bad as it was and its getting better i may be wrong but it seems that while ive played it i have had the option to play either the axis or allies basically you can play either side 
or am i just special
this would reduce a lot of strategy if it were true enormous load times and very slow fps for even a minimum requirement met for the game each strategic location only allows you to enter with certain units and if you want to be infantry you may have to run a long way to find a battle unless there is a battle currently in a zone where infantry can enter thru the enter screen
you might be lucky and catch a ride from a driver though  which should be on the plus sideeither way you look at it this game is a brilliant concept that is still beautiful despite its problems and any world war ii fans should love and buy this gamemechcommander  is a lot like its predecessor drawing on the rich battletech universe to make an rts that brings the feel of the board game to the pc
those of you who havent played the first installment yet should go out and buy the original i recommend mc gold which added some missions and fixed some bugs not because its necessary but its better
for the rest of you ill put this review in terms of differences from mc goldfirst off the graphics are much better and are true d not isometric
whether you like this or not is simply your aesthetic taste because its never really necessary to rotate the camera
mech customization is more realistic and costs money which adds another layer of force management but simple shootandsmash players will find annoyingspeaking of shootandsmash one of the great things about the original was that there was no golden path even though your mission log was linear you could beat any given mission in a number of ways leading to some decent replay value
mcs missions seem to lose this which is a huge loss because every now and then i still crack out mechcommander  almost a decade latermc does make three big improvements over the original
salvage is now much more realistic
in mc youd be lucky to get one in every  you shot
now you get about  or  out of every ten but you have to pay to salvage them dont worry its not mandatory to salvage everything
rather than the fogofwarblackness in mcs maps which made no sense because you could see them in the mission briefing but not the mission itself mc lets you see the entire map but utilizes lineofsight to spot the enemy
finally rather than giving players a fixed number of fire support and counting support vehicles against the players drop weight all these are grouped under a new support tab
since the new salvage system made the resource warehouses and container stacks of mc obsolete the new incarnations of the above give players resource points which they can use to call in several forms of air support
mostly these correspond to what we saw in the original with the minesweeper being replaced by the karnov salvage craft which allows inmission salvage of mechs
i found losing the minesweeper a curious choice because unlike the mc there are missions where it would actually be useful herein summary mc brought in a lot of cool new features not all of which i listed here but did so at the expense of mission depth
so unfortunately mc is not as good as mcok first go read some of the bad reviews which talk about problems with getting the game to run
they are right
i have  computers and for reasons that escape me one of them will not run this game
as a result you may want to borrow it from a friend and see if you can get it to work properly before you buy itthe goodthe battle system is very intuitive and gives a nice ammount of control over your units
you can tell them to aim for different mech parts concerve ammo or engage at a specific range
you can almost pick the game right up and start playing it though you may want to go through the training missions just to be sure you know about some of the finer pointsthe mechs are also very well done though i dont like the customization freedom with them sure with the clan mechs it is ok since they are all omni but last i checked most is mechs were not
they do look a little blocky however it does not end up detracting from the gamethe actors hired for this did a very good job
cut sceens are convincing and you actually get to the point where you feel like you know them
the plot is fairly transparent however it is more than enough to hold the game together and avoids the pitfall of making things too complicatedthe badthe game is much too short and much too easy
first time i played through i played on normal and it took me  days
second time i decided to play on the hardest difficulty and i am sad to say i didnt notice any difference
very few of the missions are truely hard most that are belong to house leio and even they are just what i feel the average difficulty should be
this means there is also very little replay valueadding to the little replay value is the fact that the plot is  liner
nothing you do ever effects what you are going to do next or where you are going
once you have played through once you have seen it all
this also makes it feel like you arnt really a merc commander
you dont get to chose your jobs or to weigh risk and proffit at all
the game just strings you along and no matter what your proformance in the mission if you complete it then you move on in the plotmechs come out feeling a little flimsy with few exceptions
this is mostly due to the fact that later on the head is much too easy to hit
my standard tactic became pulling along a few mechs with long range weapons and just targeting the head of the mech
it would kill the mech with little to no dammage to the rest of the mech making it ready to salvage and giving me that much larger of a force for that missionanother thing that this game would have benifited immensly from would be some type of campaignmission editor to allow players to make thier own games
this simple addition would have pushed this game up to  stars overall raiting and a  star fun raiting since the problems with the campaign could be overlooked with the addition of player maps and campaigns that would cater to differetn interestsif you consider yourself a fan of mw i would give this a try but dont expect the world from it
the campaign is good enough that you wont be appaled by it and the multiplayer is good though nothing too terrably special as far as i could see if you can find someone to play with
if you are just a fan of rts games you should look someplace else as this will leave you with a wanting feelingdungeon siege unlike most rpgs is primarily a hacknslash mindless combat game in the vein of the diablo and gauntlet series of games
if youre looking to purchase the game and didnt like either of those series turn around now
the game is great if you enjoy the killendlesshordesofmonstersandgetbetterstufftokillbiggermonstersverylittlethinkinginvolved style of gaming
if however youre looking for something more along the lines of a final fantasy heavily plot driven character based immersive rpg or baldurs gate heavily strategy based plot driven rpg youre looking in the wrong placeif however you enjoy the first type of game then continue readingdungeon siege is basically diablo  that is its diablo ii made better
the graphics are greatly improved with both the characters and environment rendered beautifully in d
unlike diablo ii you dont have to rapidly click your mouse button for hours  you can click the target once and your character will continue attacking it until its dead
you can also set your character to have intelligent ai to have it move freely to have it attack specific kinds of monsters or to have to have it defend specific characters in your party
potions are consumed in the amounts you need to consume them instead of wasting an entire big health potion on a few scratches
the game provides innumerable other playerfriendly devices including pack mules healing rings variable difficulty settings and the likethe variable difficulty settings are a mixed bag
i began playing the game on easy to try and get a feel for it and the game is a joke on this difficulty setting my main character could rush into a room of  or more enemies and take them all down without having to use a health potion
i was wondering why so many health potions were dropping until i switched into normal difficulty
it proved far far more difficult and i learned the value of the quicksave button
the difficulty settings are quite steep given that there are only three and provide a unique level of challenge to every player
it does however take the fun out of the game when you can dumb down the difficulty for a boss that you have trouble withthe one aspect where this game will pale in comparison to diablo ii is the multiplayer
unlike diablo ii dungeon sieges multiplayer characters can be imported from single player
it is therefore possible to use cheat codes and hacks to create a massively overpowered single player character and then use it in multiplayer
the online internet zonematch based version of the game will end up like that of diablo i where everyone has the highest level character possible with the best equipment possible and pvp is a joke
character advancement will be nonexistant and several key aspects of a massive multiplayer community will be missing like an economy and a learning curve
if gpg  ms had taken the time to create an onlineonly database for online characters the multiplayer version of the game might stand a chancebecause the netbased multiplayer will be so incredibly poor compared to d dont buy the game expecting to jump into a better version of d
buy it because of its fun single player campaign and to play it with your friendsthis game is very fun to playfor awhile
the graphics are stellarbut the basic plot of the game kill monsters get experiance points and new weapons so you can kill even bigger monsters gets a little old
there is absolutly no role playing involved in this game
its a beautifully rendered hack and slash
there really isnt even any strategy involved in the fighting
you just point click and watch the mayhem
in fact the screen can get way too busy with all the fighting going on
after awhile i found myself losing interestbut its a very nice pc game for the price its currently being offered atdungeon siegecons fixed amount of opportunites monsters  gold blocky magic wanted more terrain interaction poor camera shots in close quarters monsters that ambush or pop out of mid air is cheesyand most important reason i gave it a  multiplayer games anytime anyone joins the entire game takes about a minute to stop and load people up
super annoying unless you lock the game down before startingpros pauseability projectiles stop in midair projectiles do not disappear on impact american company for now microsoft support autodesk support excellent lighting good creators support dungeon siege does not have buggy codeneverwinter nights is limited by your system and video card memory
neverwinters backwards compatibility doesnt work with games or addon modules
the french own dd and neverwinter
when the french absorbed bioware recently it killed it
the wizards of the coast stores dd are closing nation wide
they made have blizzard interplay atari and shook up some of the best american artists in the business but not dungeon siege
did i mention hes canadianlets cut to the chase
youve undoubtedly heard that dungeon siege is a game brimming with awesome graphics seamless gameplay and heralded sound
and thats all true
but dungeon siege lacks the one thing that it claims itself to be roleplaying
dont get me wrong its still a fun game to play
but if youre a gamer who likes strong plots and powerful character development as i am then dungeon siege may not be the game for you
however if you were enthralled with diablo iis hackandslash mayhem then this might be just your thing
still dungeon siege lacks any type of userchosen skill development
rather microsoft has taken the opportunity to present us with a new kind of rpg that makes your character excel in different areas whether it be magic bow or weapon depending on how much you use them
although i understand this thinking and feel its a novel approach to a game i would rather decide myself where my characters strengths are
in addition much of dungeon siege is run by smart ai meaning that your party of adventurers will do what theyre told letting you sit back and watch the melee until its time to heal with a potion or change somebodys attack scheme
this is all fine until you realize that the whole game can seemingly play itselfi liked dungeon siege for its simplicity as it presents a nice break to real timestealers like baldurs gate 
but i cant help to feel a little let down by its elementary nature
the eye candy and sound are awesome but everything else simply feels rushed
quests are limited as are social interactions with nonplayer characters
too much of the game is simply walking into a field and leftclicking until everything is dead with a random award of treasureif youre a diablo fan i have no doubt that dungeon siege will suit your taste
its actually less of an rpg than diablo ii but its hackandslash nature will delight
its hard to put down once you stop
for those into the epic storylines of biowares rpgs then i urge you to play a copy of dungeon siege before making the full purchase
its simplistic unassuming tone will offend true rpgers so youve been warnedall in all dungeon siege is a fun game to play regardless of its faults
and isnt that what gaming is all aboutthis is graphically quite impressive in that d excelerated kind of blocky figures and unbelievable scenery kind of way
you can also control up to eight characters which is nice
unfortunately there is a total absence of plot or meaningful npc interaction and there are no subquests worth speaking of
all very diabloesque true and not necessarily a bad thing but whereas the blizzard title has a lot of collectible sets configurable weapons etc this has none seriously denting its replayability
this brings me to my biggest gripe with the game the much vaunted play as you want to system of character development which does away with classes and develops your characters around the skills they use
sounds great on paper but in reality it means that the game is not particularly well balanced particularly with regards to the nature school of magic
it also further dents its replayability as the conscious effort to play the game through in a different way with the same characters makes no sense when youve already worked out how to defeat particular foes
make no bones about it this game has set itself up to be a diablo ii beater even going so far as to use the same color letters for different levels of rare  magic and unique items but fails to address either of the issues that make that title so popular excellent replayability and extremely simple but effective online play
last time i checked dungeon siege was unplayably laggy online and only time will tell if microsoft will put in the necessary ongoing support that this title needsin a world where swirly d visuals are rated more highly than gameplay ie the games mags etc this title will review very wellbut i wont go deleteing diablo ii lords of destruction from my hard drive just yeti bought this game for a bargain  dollars it is a good timewaster but it isnt for me
i like rpgs with depth this one might be good for newbies but not mehaving battled my way through about  hours of gameplay over the last few days all i can say is im rather disappointed
the graphics are great as most people have pointed out but there is just no gameplay at all
rather than giving us a living breathing world to explore the actualy ingame world is completely linear
rather than giving us a variety of quests we just click on monsters kill them and get treasure
sure there are four different ways to kill them melee ranged combat magic and nature magic but a rpg that does not make
many comparisons have been made to diablo  but in terms of gameplay his is almost a step backward
there are fewer skills and spells than diablo  and unlimited ammo for bows makes the game oddly unbalanced
there are several other minor issues but i wont go into detail
these include restricted camera movement the overhead map being too small strange behaviour at levelup meaning that your character suddenly cant cast spells dodgy ai etc but i guess most of these will be fixed in a patch sooner or later
as per most modern games you can create mods and dungeon seige uses the seige editor and the gmax d system from discreet a cut down version of the popular d studio max system
although i havent played around with the editor yet it sounds promising and i hope that rd party mods will be available to make the single player experience the game that dungeon seige should have beenfor the real hardcore rpg party micromanagers out there this game will provide hours of diversion
however if we step past the beautiful graphics and dynamic music we stumble into a game of linear boredom
the problem with rpgs like this is that the myriad of level upgrades and weaponspell choices completely overwhelm the majority of gamers
yes the environments are lovely and the pack mule is a good idea but ultimately the click attack and constant checking of health bars becomes really tiresome
its a pity because dungeon seige does attempt to appeal to the more casual rpgeroverall a solid and commendable attempt at appealijg to the nonrpger
at a budget price its well worth a lookthis game feels a lot like an older and very good game called darkstone which came out in between diablo and diablo and was in a d environmentlets you change camera angles download different skins for your character etc probably in the bargin bins if you want to try itanyway dss character models are rendered nicely you can choose from different faces bodies tec but its really the environments that stands out outdoors can snowing have fog etc
in the dungeon you can light the torches and look for levers on the wall  all done with enough detail so its not distracting from the gameplay but very discernablethe game seems mostly bug free and the pathing ai is ok aiming isnt the best especially since the screen centers on the character you have have up to  in a party you have selected  the screen jumps a bit when you want to micro manage a big confrontation
you can set different reactions like an abbrevated version of baldurs gates combat scriptingthe advancement of skill level and attribute is strictly tied into how you use your characters
have someone always use a bow and their dex and ranged skill level will advance quicker
use prodominently spells there are  schools nature and combat magic that you can choose between and the intelligence and magic nature or combat levels will advance faster
so there are no points you need to manually distribute once a character gains enough experiencethe plot itself is very linear not necessarily a bad thing with some subplots and very little in puzzle solving up to chapter four where i am at the momentall in all a good game i know that  stars looks low but excepting for the multicharacter party if youve played darkstone youd probably see this as a progressively better game but not revoluntionary nor a big leap over diabloi got this because i thought it would be kinda like spellforce fate or maybe even the witcher but no its completely boring
gameplay to move you have to click everywhere
you cant hold it down it doesnt work
but that didnt bother me im kinda used to that
i did like that when you have the map up you can click where you want to go and even attack creatures
and i loved that you can control up to  other characters besides your character and that it wasnt like an rts in that waygraphics theyre ok i mean for a game made in  theyre pretty good and it will run on bit and bit versions of vistastory this is the wierdest part as is said before the game was actually made into a movie with jason statham and it was kinda good but nothing like the game
if you saw the movie dont expect the same out of the game
the games story is very boring
to me a game without a good story sucks
and this didnt even have an ok storyreplay value its ok i guess but i wouldnt really know i only played it once but i did have a few problems with bugs but not to seriousmusic the music is kinda ok not really good but for backround music its alrightso overall its an ok game if you look past the terrible story wierd gameplay and the few bugs
some games are so good id buy them again full price but this game isnt even worth the shiny plastic it came in
if you want adventure dont get this
id recommend getting something like devil may cry titan quest or maybe even fear
if your into firstperson shootersi see for what ive played that the one can he be not very original hummm let me see at my game rack ah i see patience my friends all will be said oh i see here age of empire age of kings and starcraftthis game is the exact copy of those game all together with positive and negatives sideslucas lucas on your movies explosions are great but in the games that intensity falls down a liitle
wake up and smell the coffeelook at other gane around you like starcraft and homeworld were the explosion are a blast rejeuvenize your team and get someinfografists and programers around  years oldjust one more thing if i ever see you create game like force commander or rebel assault  i am personnaly demonstrate my jedi powers to yaok you know how companies will take a well known game like chess or monopoly and use a trademark characters to create special editions
well galactic battlegrounds should be titledage of empires star wars editionthis is the age of empires ii core engine down to the t all they have done is swap out the graphics sounds and menu itemsits that bad and it works about as well as starwars chess or starwars monopoly in the end
still it seems the best star wars titles from lucus arts are developed off some other companies successful game engines and this game is much better than force commanderbuy if you muststar wars galactic battlegrounds swgb is a real time strategy game based onage of empires  age of kingsaok engine
typical for the genre you gather resources so can you can build structures and units and research upgrades
swgb for single player you have  campaigns  total missions and one tutorial campaign
the game is straightforward enough that after playing the tutorial you should be able get right into the game
the campaigns are inspired by events from star wars movie episodes i iv v and vi
the campaigns are as followstrade federation attacking naboo and gungansgungan civil war and later battling trade federationdarth vader and the empire attacking the rebelsprincess leia and the rebels battling the empirechewbacca and han liberating kashyyykthe graphics and sound are not good
the best looking units are the empires
i like the atat and walkers
i played all the campaigns on hard difficulty and found the game challenging
there were several missions that i was defeated usually by losing hero character and replayed
generally speaking the ai is very aggressive at the beginning but if you weather the initial assault you can slowly wear down the enemy
the objectives of the missions are a bit varied but they still felt somewhat redundant
there are six civilizations that you can play but they are mostly the same except the units look differently
i think this is more of a nostalgia pick for fans of aok or star wars
definitely not the best star wars or strategy game i have playedstarwars galatic battlegrounds is a great pc game however not the best starwars game on the pc not by a longshot
however the game is very easy to get into
you can play the scenarios or create your own where you can add characters from the movie
the sound effects are straight from the movie there are a lot of characters from the expanded universe of starwars which you may have to reference from the starwars website for more background info on them
the cons of the game come from the feeling of been there done that especially if youve played age of empires or age of kings to death
the gameplay becomes too repetitive and the replay value goes straight to hell
but its a good game just realize that one day its going to end up on the shelf with the rest of the games youve long since stopped playingi was expecting a lot more of jedi outcast before i played it
the single player is decent and challenging
however the multiplayer was very disappointing
graphics wise it does not disappoint
the sound is also excellentthe problem for me
the multiplayer is not very impressive
it basically comes down to a bunch of players running around either wildly waving their lightsabors jumping through the air or theres the players who sit around and as snipers and take you out while your fighting with another player
it just gets old after awhile
the reason this was a disappointment was the game was built on the same engine as return to castle wolfenstein and the multiplayer in that game is astounding
i truly was expecting more of the same in this title but i was very disappointedjedi knight   jedi outcast is a very good gamestraight out of the box this game kicks some serious 
with some nailbiting missions and astounding detailed levels
it is no doubt this game will be a hit among the star wars universe fans
the best feature of this game is the multiplayer support
it is really something to be in the middle of  jedis all locked in saber battles
lets take a look at this game as it does have its downsthe story  you return as kyle to help the old republic defend itself from a new evil
a evil called dessan and his army of dark jedis
a misson you are on reveals this new threat to the old republic and the death of kyles partner jan fuels the fire of kyle to find and stop dessan
dessan ultimate purpose is to create a army of invincible dark jedis to rid the universe of the jedis sworn to protect the secrets of the force
dessan feels that the force is not something you proctect people from but something you rule people by
get ready for a excellent storyline in this new star wars adventurethe graphics  are some of the best i have seen
bearing in mind you have a excellent computer with a high calibur video card
i am currently running a ati radeon  and the game looks spectacular
i personally dont like crisp clear pefect graphics
i like the graphics to have a little noise in it for example the graphics in return to castle wolfenstien
but if you enjoy this then by all means praise the graphics
storm troopers will look nice and crisp as they attempt to blast you throughout the levelsthe gameplay is very smooth with the in game cutscenes
controls can be hotkeyed to your preference with enable you to have force powers ready at your fingertips
you have a wide variety of weapons including a stun baton rocket launcher thermal detonators rocket launcher sniper rifle and the popular nonaccurate blaster rifle
and of course you already know about the light saber
the is the ultimate weapon that allows block weapons fire and slice your enemys at close range at at a distance
and dont worry about losing your saber you can always get it back with the flick of your wristthe ai
 oh man there are some ups and downs in the ai
in this game
there was only one time i have seen storm troopers run in a movie and that was when han solo was chasing them in the death star
storm troopers move like they are on some type of drug when you attempt to shoot them which is kinda of annoying
if you come accross imperial officers shoot them fast because they are extremely accurate
other jedis fight you on a level that is distrubing
the lesser jedis are nothing compared to some of the jedis you will face off with in the later levels
dessan is one bad mother when you fight him
many of his blows will knock you down
and not to mention some saber battles involve more than  jedis at one timein conclusion there are some great aspects of this game mainly the action sequences
in my opinion there are way too many puzzle and space waster missions
i can understand having puzzles in games to take a break from the actions but for this type of game it should have been more action based
in the last levels making your way to the jedi academy will really drive you up the wall because of the environment
the best aspect of this game is hands down the multiplayer
it is what makes this game really shineunlike wines jedi outcast was probably better appreciated when it first came out back in  i played it for the first time this year and while it was fun i cant say i love it
if anything i enjoyed it mostly because it gave me a nostalgia trip for the original dark forces game which was one of my first computer games back in jedi outcast looks and feels dated even though its been less than a decade
yes games age but even games like kotor and rogue squadron which came out around the same time still look and feel great
by contrast the graphics in jedi outcast just look blocky and flat
the locations are generic
there are even some familiar locales like bespin but youre pretty much stuck in a bunch of rooms that look no different from the imperial ship later in the game compare that to the bespin in the force unleashed wii games which actually does look like bespinhowever what really frustrated me was the gameplay
the lightsaber combat is uneven and unwieldy
jumping isnt very precise which is a big problem because jedi outcast thinks its a platforming game
you often have to make precise jumps onto narrow ledges
this led to no small amount of frustrationim not sure why some people rave about the story
the story is pretty rote  the princess jan ors gets captured and the hero kyle katarn has to go find his sword lightsaber track down the evil king dark lord desann and rescue her
you dont have any choice in the story or outcomes
even worse some of the movie characters act out of character
luke skywalker seemingly has no problem with kyle going out looking for revenge against desann
landoperhaps ive just been spoilt by recent games like the force unleashed and kotor and rogue squadron which have great graphics controls and stories
im glad i tried jedi outcast just to see what ever happened to kyle
i loved shooting stormtroopers dark forces style
but with so many great star wars games out there this one should probably be pretty low on your list enjolrasthe saga continues
we have finally received a sequel to jk
jk is a good game
it has the features of jk and brings them up to the maxto start jks graphics are extremely improved
it uses the quake  graphics engines to utilize the best graphics in games today
it has beautiful landscapes and character details are amazing
kyle katarn has never looked so goodthe gameplay is nothing to scream about
it is exactly like jks
thats probably a good thing
i found a few probs with gameplay tho
i realized that the aiming mechanism is somewhat inaccurate at times
because the aimer always stays in the same position you should always have the same accurate aiming
although this game doesnt have that
this is definetely not a game for tactical shooters fansi also found that replay value is ok there are  difficulty levels at which you can beat the game at but i dont think that is enough
i mean cant we atleast get a few alternative paths or something
its the same game played over and over again but at harder levels
some people may find this cheap but i think its ok if you just start at the medium or hardest difficulty level
i started at padawan the first difficulty and its still pretty challenging
expect to be infront of you computer a lot frusterated about a puzzle you must solvein general this is a must for all jk fans
tactical shooters fans may find this game a bit annoying and people that are not fans of the first person shooter genre should not think about getting this game
fps fans should consider buying the game and may want to play the demo before purchasing
all in all this is a game for the jk fans and fps fans
im out now so peace
hope this helps have you played jedi knight  there isnt much deference in the game play  use lightsaber and jedi powers enemies are the samebut the adding of puzzles and the video enhancement have made it a plus
but the puzzles sometimes puzzle you so much that you have  use cheat codes  have the walkthroughthis game kinda a reminds me off riven the sequel to mystgood graphics but puzzles kinda hard sokmetimesbut yes it worth your money if you are a star wars fanget up there and get the gamein  lucasarts humbled the gaming world with the release of dark forces ii jedi knight a firstperson action shooter that let players direct kyle katarns quest to avenge the death of his father morgan and become a jedi
the game flattened the competition with its near total immersion in the star wars environment that had been sorely lacking even in the original dark forces in  for twenty levels you became kyle the quirky smartmouthed mercenary aiding the fledgling new republic on a mission against jerec and his cabal of dark jedi bent on locating and consuming the power of the valley of the jedi
a thousand years ago a great battle between the forces of light and dark saw thousands of jedi spirits trapped within the valley
as kyle you progressed in your powers until eventually having to make a choice between light and dark
to stop jerec in order to keep the valley safe or take the power for your own and rule the galaxyjedi knight ii jedi outcast is set nine years after jedi knight making it  years after the fall of the empire at endor and kyle has abandoned his jedi heritage after nearly killing mara jade at the sith temple on dromund kaas when he fell to the dark side
still working for new republic intelligence he and jan stumble across an imperial remnant base that appears to be growing gemlike crystals similar to the ones found in lightsabers
it turns out that a fallen jedi and the remnant are attempting create a forceusing army by combining the crystals and the force
the first couple of levels are also painfully dull and the goals are often poorly defined
after encountering the fallen jedi desann jan is murdered by desanns apprentice tavion
secretly kyle flies to rusaan the secret location of the valley of the jedi
there is reasserts his connection to the force
reluctantly kyle must reclaim that which he abandoned traveling back to yavin iv he meets with luke skywalker in order to retrieve his lightsaber
at the yavin academy kyle relearns his basic force abilities in a test devised by luke before traveling to nar shadda to begin his search desann and the reborngame play is much improved over jedi knight in many areas not least of which is lightsaber combat which is now handled almost exclusively in the thirdperson view
i had misgivings about this but having tried it out i see that its much better allowing for greater control and freedom of action during duels
graphics are not through the roof awesome but very clean and exceptionally well detailed
i have a ati radeon  pro video card so i guess i expect all new games to be earthshattering in their visual appeal
raven did pay close attention to lightsaber duels from the phantom menace giving the ones in the game a distinct cinematic feel especially when view from a distance in multiplayer
mostly the game is fluid the visuals flow nicely and raven manages to overcome one of the quake iii arena engines short comings by producing attractive vistas whether indoors or out everything has the right star warszy feel and look to itweapons range from kyles bryar pistol e blaster rifle bowcaster and repeater rifle plus new additions like the tenloss disrupter which can disintegrate distant targets in sniper mode an emp gun for dispatching droids and other electronic devices a flechette cannon which is just a knockoff of the flack cannon from unreal tournament plus a rocket launcher
kyle also has access to munitions like thermal detonators laser trip mines a la duke nukem and detpacks that can be blown by remote control
all three explosives and the rocket launcher do far more damage than their small wimpy explosions would indicate
an additional weapon that kyle carries that i really liked are the portable sentry gun a cannister that once dropped deploys a blaster turret and begins shooting enemies within its range
players also get macrobinoculars bacta canisters for healing and light amplification goggles
plus you will find no end of shield and health powerups through out the levels
one of the games down sides is that it is difficult to tell when youre being shot there are no accompanying green flashes or sizzling sound effects as your personal shields take a beatingthe game ships with  multiplayer maps customizable force powers to finetune your character
you can even play games without the force though it tends to favor the dark side powers
multiplayer games include standard death matches capture the flag king of the hill where only one play has a lightsaber and force powers and its up to everyone else to deal with it capture the ysalamiri the jedi kryptonite creatures care of mr zahn
one of the down sides in singleplayer missions is raven split kyles force powers between the light and dark side
he can throw lightning and choke someone but no longer has force seeing and protection two powers that were in my opinion instrumental in the first game
i didnt like the addition of dark side powers that seemed to be there just to satisfy those players who think the dark side is kewl
raven also has the outcast version of its q radiant level builder and other tools like script managers etc
for creating single and multiplayer levelsthis is an okay game
it didnt completely suck me in like jedi knight did but it is a worthy successor
it lacks the impact of kyles momentous decision between light and dark nor is the story as epic
and strangely the feel is closer to that of the original dark forces than it is to jedi knight
plus it suffers a little too much from console hell like dino crisis where on some levels you must find the key to open the door in order to get to the next key to open the next door
it has some nice animated fullmotion video but nothing like the live action scenes that added so much to jedi knight
it is also a hard game get used to not completing later maps on the first try even on easy padawan setting plus some of the jumping can be a little frustrating
i waited a long time for this game and im glad i wasnt completely disappointedjedi knight ii underscores just how rich the technological and graphical capabilities of topoftheline pc games are while also calling attention to how unimaginative many game designers have becomethe game is a major success but i think some designers will continue to learn the wrong lessons from that success
its a success because the games graphical engine creates a remarkably engaging sense of being a part of the star wars universesomething that many of us crave
it uses music and visuals perfectly to this end
the core storyline is engaging enough kyle katarn is a likeable believable protagonist and the game makes use of other star wars story elements very well
so on one hand the game works very hard to achieve immersionon the other hand the games level design makes it almost impossible to achieve immersion
when travelling through a level you are not kyle katarn youre just a guy sitting in front of your terminal trying to figure out what the game designer wants you to do next
puzzles are not intuitive and the solution is usually a rigid artificial and sometimes nonsensical sequence of actions
you have to run a gauntlet of enemies who have somehow positioned themselves in places that your own character could not get toin many cases places which are actively impossible for any living creature to have travelled to given the design of the level
at one point you have to protect a droid from a host of enemies while also disarming trip mines
you can push the droid back using your force powers but only so far push him back far enough and he spontaneously explodes
why
because the designer wants you to beat the level the way he wants you to beat itit doesnt have to be this way
medal of honor allied assault has demonstrated that an fps can have good immersive level design without having to resort to this kind of straightjacketjks multiplayer is decent enough but it becomes boring fairly quickly
when force powers are enabled the game is dominated by the boring overuse of force push and force choke
when weapons other than lightsabers are enabled snipers and explosive weapons rule the day but in no more interesting a fashion than any other multiplayer fps on the marketone of the most distinctive feature about pokemon crystal vs pokemon silver and gold is the female character
that i think is my favorite part as well
also there is a new battle tower available however i dont like it very much
there are more pokemon than gold and silver but that is basically it
otherwise they are almost the same game
if you already own gold and silver note that the only advantage to pokemon crystal is that you can create a female character
there isnt much of a point of getting it other than that
in my opinion the game could have been better if nintendo made a few more changes to crystal to give a better reason for many customers to buy itpros female character new battle tower some maps are different than gold and silver ability to breed pokemon dayweektime settings day and night effectscons too similar to gold and silverby the way for those who are curious when you want to battle someone who has pokemon gold or silver and you have crystal with the female character the female character simply turns into a male character
gtgt strangei bought this game since i thought the last  in the series were good and worth buyingi played them on a emulator which i no longer have
so i went to toys r us and bought this game right away
boy was i wrong
this is a better game then the ones before but spending  dollars on replica of the old game just with a new plot and a few more features
gimme a break
this game is extremely annoying
if you thought one battle after another in the first few games was annoying wait till you get a load of thisevery where you go a pokemon wants to fight
and sure this game has the new pokemon but they are all dull
just more quotpowerfulquot in the imaginary world but hey this is real life
dont waste your cash on this game or any other gameboy game
get gameboy advance or psx and start buying games for them
thats what i have donei would not recommend getting a used copy of this version and i should have bought a new copy of this when it first came out
the used copy has serious problems keeping the saved data just like its gold and silver counterpartsbloody roar out of all the d fighters out there was a favorite of minelike street fighter ex
ill admit the series has always been a favorite of mine
dont get me wrong bloody roar  is a good game
definitely
but i had higher hopes for the series debut on the ps
the graphics are lush detailed
gameplay is topnotch
but it just seemed something was lacking from the game to mewould i recommend it for ps fans
definitelyfor full price
eh i dunno
i supposejust because i had higher hopes for it doesnt mean it is poor
it is a good game just not quite what i expected it to be on the ps
one i recommend to all fighting game fans for surei liked the first two bloody roars because of the ability to change into beasts in the middle of the battle and the second one had a pretty good storyline for a d fighter
truth be told this game is one of the chief reasons i bought a playstation  that and the soontobereleased final fantasy xthe graphics are incredible
they are so detailed that you can see the facial features on the characters such as recessed and blinking eyes and moving mouths
they arent like the flat polygons used in the other bloody roarsin fact youll be hardpressed to find sharp edges anywhere on the bodies
the arenas are also composed of polygons and they look as good as the characters
too bad that you can only blow out a wall on the final roundi miss being able to knock the opponent out of bounds
all these graphics and the game doesnt slow down at all
amazingunfortunately now we get into an area that bloody roar  lacksnew ideas
there is an arcade mode a multiplayer mode practice mode and a survival mode
in other words its like all the other d fighters
and all of the characters from the second bloody roar are back with only one new initial character who looks like a cross between alucard from castlevania and sephiroth from ff and two other characters that are unlockable for a total of fourteen characters
sure i like the original characters but most of them have been around since the first bloody roar and their moves have remained largely unchangedtime for something new
as for the inbattle differences the only new things are an extra beastdrive move and a hyperbeast mode which makes you do tremendous damage but when ten seconds elapses you turn back to human and you cant become a beast for the rest of the fight
weeeeethe gameplay as i said before was very fast and smooth on the playstation maybe too fast
since the first br ive noticed an increased focus on combos
im not a hardcore d fighter so my when im going up against an opponent that wont even let me move because hes pulling off a  hit combo which tosses me in the air so that he gets off another  hits quotjugglingquot me in the air and then gets off another  hits while im down on the ground needless to say i get frustrated very quickly
sure there is a way to block these things but as i said the thing moves fast so most of the time i dont have a chance to pull it off
and dont bother doing combos of your own most of the time the cpu blocks it all in the later stages
im having problems on the final levels on a dificulty setting of one
well as i said im not hardcore
  after about two hours it got rather boringunfortunately the good storyline of the second br is gone in br
all you get is a slideshow at the start and the end all of which makes no sense unlike br where there is a slideshow in between each battle and some storylines cross each other and make sense
if i have to suffer five hundred gillion hit combos then i at least want it to be worth somethingbeing a d fighter br has a multiplayer mode
well my friend just happens to be nonhardcore just like me except his temper is even shorter than mine when it comes to being juggled in the air with a multihit combo
his favorite fighter is super smash brothersgo figure  needless to say he got intensly frustrated and trust me it is no fun playing with someone that is ready to throw the controller through the tvoverall bloody roar  is a game that looks absolutely incredible but a lack of a good storyline and an insufficient number of new features makes br a weekendrental title unless you are a fan of the seriesthe good looks great responsive controls beast form is funthe bad shallow fight system only  characters lack of modes lame storythe ps wasnt without its fighting games and most were solid
the bloody roar series started on the ps but has seen rocky acclaim ever since its first entry
competing with games such as street fighter tekken and virtua fighter at the time people didnt see the need for another japanese fighter
bloody roar features some interesting characters that can turn into beast form which unlocks a new set of moves and some devastating attacks
bloody roar  has great visuals and solid controls but lacks a large roster and modes that fighters are known forfirst off the game only has  fighters
thats tiny even compared to other fighters with small rosters
the characters however are unique but there is a serious lack of female fighters only 
the stages are busy and well designed plus the game looks great even for today
the fight system is simple compared to most japanese fighters but i preferred this
there is just punch kick and beast form as well as a dodge and block button
the game has no move list so this is for button mashers which is just fine here
the controls are smooth and responsive and there is a lot of visual flair
the characters beast forms look really cool and it is fun to see them allanother main disappointment are the lack of modes
just arcade survival and versus really
theres not even a main story mode but the arcade mode does go through all the characters stories
i found the story to be pretty boring and unexciting like most fighting game stories
most japanese fighting fans will mainly dislike the lack of depth in the fight system but i really didnt mind itoverall bloody roar  is a solid fight game but just feels bare bones
the fight system lacks depth the character roster is small and theres only  modes
the game look great and the controls respond well so this is a love it or hate it type of gamewhat do you get when you take great atari arcade games from the late s and early s and bring them into the year 
you shall know when you play atari anniversary edition
the only games that are really playable are crystal castles missle command and battle zone
other than that everything else plays so horribly with the standard dc control pad that youll wonder why these games had such an impact on a young game industry
the archive is really cool but like every other classic collection it feels pretty sparse
in the end aae is a neat little collection of games for people who wondered what it was like before mario and the likes just dont expect to spend a lot of time with iti bought this game mainly for asteroids centipide and black widowi played the other games but those  where the ones i liked morei am ussing the ps g usb port and a p lcd tv to play this games and i cant get to see the laser shots in both asteroids and asteroids deluxe this is frustrating because you can hear the sound of the shots but not see themalso try playing pong with the ps control 
its nearly imposible to control the sliding bar and rebound the ball same aplies to super breakoutone more thing in the description and on the cd it  says you get a free atari sticker this is not truei looked everywhere and i couldnt find itok in response to what one reviewer said
the gameshark and the ps can be real glitchy
sometimes it says there is no disk or it will say no hardware detected
if it says no disk just hit the reset button
if it says no hardware detected turn of the ps and remove and replace the gameshark
it has to be in there just right or the ps wont read it
in my opinion the gameshark pro for the playstation was the best gs because of the code generator and the fewest problems
why they could not duplicate this for the ps is beyond me
on the right games the gs for ps is great
on the other hand it uses a memory card slot and some games wont save on slot  which means you cant use the codes on a saved file
you will have to start a new game
interact needs to upgrade the gs so you can use slot  for both the memory card and the gs just like some rd party remote sensors for the ps
overall a worty item but expect some glityches and some incompatable games
and one last note
the gs will not erase your info
i know several people who use the gs all the time with many different games and never had this problem
if you lose data it might be because of third party memory cards which are proned to that
hope this info is helpfulgame shark  for ps is okay but not anything to write home about
if it were not for the game shark website then gs would basically be kind of useless
i was hoping for somekind of device to just attach to the back of the ps but instead we have a an attachment in a memory card slot and two discs which are a bit cumbersome to switch out everytime you want to play a gamenamco has brought their classic arcade game pacman to the gba and it seems to be a bit lost in translationpacman the classic arcade game with the originol graphics
it breaks my heart to rate this game  stars but it was intended for a larger screen originalpacman arrangement the game by itself would deseve four stars again there is no saving but it is almost identical to the originol pacman game
the only real difference is that it has brighter graphics and better music and these aspects dont really add any enjoyment to the gamepacmania like pacman arrangement this is extremely simalir to the originol arcade game only with better sounds and graphics
you can use the a and b buttons to jump over the ghosts which makes the game easier than it all ready is
again i am puzzled by the fact you cant save your scorespacattack this is definately the best game in the collection
like tetris there are blocks falling from the sky that need to be arranged but here some of the blocks contain a ghost
if you arrange the ghosts in the right order you are allowed to eat them
the gameplay is addictive and challenging
in fact the game is so much fun i would buy pac man collection just to have it in my gba libraryoverall this is a flawed but enjoyable collection of gamespac man proved something to me with this collection which was that the developers could take the same concept and make it interesting with four different versions of pac man
first there is the original hit game pac man where you are a little man with a huge mouth going through a maze gobbling up pellets being chased by ghosts in a neverending quest
the next game is pac man arrangement which is essentially the same game only with fun new features such as a dash and the graphics are a bit better
when pac man runs over a dash he will zip from one side of the maze to the other past all ghosts that chase him
the third game is pac attack which is a clone of tetris falling blocks some with ghosts in them and eventually a falling pac man to eat the ghosts
you score points by stacking a line of bars or by having a pac man eat the ghosts
the fourth game is a great pac man game for the present day called pac mania
it features crisp graphics a d maze d pac man and d ghosts each with their own personalities
the point of it is to still eat all of the pellets in the maze but now there are more ghosts and you cannot see the entire maze in just one screen
the mazes even have different themes to them such as one maze will be made of legos another will be on the top of a roof
one more thing now pac man can jump over the ghosts
its a very nice addition to the pac family
the only unfortunate part to all of these games is that it does not save your high scores when you turn the game off
there is some nice variety to this game pack but its not for everyonethis is a great game i play it all the time i love the recruiting aspect
there are a few problems first a six minute game takes forever upwards near an hour and if you play  minute quarters your stats will never compete with other teams that are simming a  minute game ea should address this also
ea still has not addressed the pass defense or the run defense theres no way the unlv rebels can only allow  rushing yards a game and then be torched for  through the air
all and all i gave this game  stars because these are the issues and complaints people have been making for over  years now they need to be fixed for next years version
i will continue playing until then thoughi bought this mainly for the chrono trigger game as its impossible to get it anywhere else
sadly both shipments had a nonfunctioning chronotrigger disk
amazon was unable to replace itboth of these games are some of the greatest rpgs ever released
but unfortunately squareenix released this game with the same horrendous loading times that killed the psx release of final fantasy  i know it sounds ridiculous that im complaining about petty loading times but believe me once you play the ps version of chrono trigger you will be going nuts from impatience with these load times
if youre fast you might be able to prepare dinner or even take a shower while the menu loads up
and when you enter the next screen you might as well leave to use the bathroom
okay maybe i am overemphasizing it a bit
i found myself looking for the snes version after i got this just so i could take advantage of quick loading time
which to me was a collosul waste of money since i paid for the chronicles already
but now that the game is on greatest hits it is worth it just for the ff disk alone
this version of ff is just as good probably even better than the snes version
as far as i know it has more monsters and items too since this version is the japanese one translated into american and not the watered down american version
and since its only  bucks now its a great deal for these classic games
final fantasy  has very fast loading time on this and it really makes me wonder why square couldnt have made chrono trigger faster
it seems as though every time square releases a doublerpg set one of the games always has horrible loading
but truth be told the loading times on chrono trigger are not as horrible as final fantasy s which were by all means the worst loading times ive ever experienced and id rather pay for a super nintendo and the game itself so i could avoid them and the snes version is much better for that game anyway
i guess after all it is worth it to pay  for these two classic games despite the horrendous patience problems you will endure
unless you can find it on greatest hits i wouldnt buy it thoughoverallabout but  was too good so i rounded down to i owned the cartridges for ff and ct way back in the day and thought they were excellent
buying up the new versions to see what had changed ended in disappointment
while the dialogue of ff has thankfully been improved and flows better the rest of the game has not improved
what used to be an easy fight for me resulted in several restored games
having all the deleted items restored to the game only served to muddle it up
additional abilities were not all that useful
i found myself doing what i have always done used what was familiar
the game took much longer to complete and i was getting rather bored before i reached the underground
to add to disappointment there are a multitude of opportunities for new cg scenes to help with the tangled skein of the story and every one of them is wastedas for chrono not much has changed about this either
the animated scenes are a nice touch but there are too few of them
their insertion is rather sloppy as well
they look cobbled on and dont really contribute anything
we should see the trio enter the dome and find robo and lucca gets to work on him not enter the dome approach robo and see the scene repeat in a way that we know did not happen because we just saw it not happen that way
we should see crono killed by lavos only once not twice
we should see aylas approach and fighting reptites only once not twice
it exists in two different versions and having both options was a bad choicethe galleries of both games are a good addition but i think theres not enough of it
at least its something to do when the game bores youthese games are all right if youve never played them before
to longtime fans like myself you might get why i feel a little cheated by the setas a sidenote months before the release of ff on nintendo ds i wrote to square and suggested that ff be paired up with one of the game boy ffs such as ff legend in similar fashion to chronicles and anthology
they said no  it was already in production for another platformfirst let me say this is a solid game
i think i had my hopes up pretty high since all the reviews i read were really strong
to be fair it is a good game but people made it sound really original
quotthe best title no one boughtquot i figured
well let me tell you there is a reason to rent before you buy
the tone of the game is sickly sweet
beyond anything i had ever seen  although a solid rental id probably hold back on a purchase unless you are a big platform fan
play it first to test you intestinal fortitude
it is that sweet
i felt like a  year oldgameplay pretty solid a lot like the recent gameboy advance mario or the super nes title it was based on
essentially you jump and pick up baddies to either use them or throw them
not especially breakthrough but classic
there is also a little variety in some levels where you sort of ride a variety of things those of you who played crash bandicoot have seen it done bettergraphics no faulting the title graphically
it is spectacular
you will love the graphics
for my money it is a step ahead of rayman
i really liked the graphics  just superbsound oh god
think of the most sappy crappy aweful thing you can eat now eat it
now vomit it up
this is a close approximate to the music here
it is really bad
frankly it destroys the game
it is bad
which brings us to the next partstory equal to the music
i know it is a game and really who cares but it is notably bad
few games have done such a bad job of making gameplay worthwhile
it is like the worst pokemon reject script ever not in content but in quality
it would not be entertaining for a  yr oldcontrol i have to say this is another bright spot
they did a good job
the game is on rails which makes the camera work easier for a programer but still overall quite good
job really well doneoverall the game is good but not any kind of breakthrough
people really seem to want to build this up as a hardcore platform game for those who want to avoid the rush to bigger name characters
id have to say the game is more like a really solid platform game that will appeal to fans of this type of game
those that can wait should definitely rent it first
it is not the next sonic or mario or crashthese are essential for some n owners because there are more than a few games that dont save on the cartridge
its a nice quick fix if all you need it for is to save a game or two
for me i was tired of starting turok  over and over again
so it does whats its designed to do and not much more
data storage is small so youll probably only be able to fit a few games on itstill its good for the price and its taken out a lot of headaches that would be caused for the lack of a memory card in the first place
so overall its an alright memory cardthe memory card allows me to save and load games for my controller
everyone who orders a nintendo  controller must also order one of the memory cardsthe only way this memory card is worth  is if they no longer make it and its very hard to find and you just want to collect it for the memory of the playstation system otherwise i would not pay more then about  for this but do not try and sell it to gamespot they will give you  for it and i am not even remotely joking about this i only purchased this because to play playstation  games you have to have it but if you ask me if i like the product itself i would say moderately
its useful and it works for a pretty long period of time but when it does stop working and it will everything you had saved on it is never recoverable as far as i know
memory cards for game consoles are certainly something of the past and for good reason
i wish the playstation  and  had internal hard drives to store the data on but the fact they didnt helped attribute to their cost effective pricing to reach a wider market of consumers at the time
im sure there are some modifications you can make to a playstation  or  to give it a internal hard drive to store data such as save games but because it was never released that way i dont plan to attempt to modify it like thatessentially get a memory card if you need one because they work and theyre pretty much all you can use anywaywell this cord works fine with my old school ps one console however the wire is very short so you need to hand an outlet or powerbar close by
its seriously like  or  feet long thats it
it could be good if you want a short wire and it works okay for my setup but if i ever changed my set up id need a longer cordthis isnt the cable that i needed infact i really dont know what its for but i couldnt use it for playstationthis works
increases video quality
audio is soso but it is a ps so a digital audio cable would fix thatthe first time i tried it it didnt work
but for some reason i tried it again and it worked
however there doesnt seem to be any advantage over the standard cables that come with the pshooked up properly i thought i would get a bit better pic from the old ps games
tried different settings on the ps  on my vizio  but couldnt get pic
ps browser picture  playstation logo appears but when the game itself loads i just got a black screen
seller was very prompt in giving me a refund
hope to do business with them againi wanted this bad back then and when i got it i was bored quick even for gba
its just a mix bag for racing even after so long it is hit of mis no matter what mario fans say
i guess at best  great if you agree with the  star people but if you dislike it then look for what they hatemy reaview in the end is good but repetative short  to  to  just makes its a short run game or its just a game with easy to hardi realize that nintendo excels in many video game genres
for example mario will probably always be the king of platform games
mario party will always be the musthave party game
no one has even tried to top super smash bros but mario kart is an exception
sure super mario kart for the super nintendo was fun when it was the only cart racing game out there and it was a new concept
but nintendo has done almost nothing since to improve upon its own ideain mario kart super circuit you will see essentially the same courses same weapons and the same characters that you have seen in every other mario kart game
the courses are actually pretty short and boring
you spend a day or two playing through all the circuits to unlock nothing and after that there really is no incentive to ever play it again
if you can find some friends who have gbas then you can have up to a fourplayer race
but in order to play the battle mode which is probably the best part of the game your friends all need to have not only the gba but the game cartridge as welloverall this is a pretty sloppy effort by nintendo
i like mario and i cannot seem to resist buying every one of his games but i always want to kick myself for buying the mario kart gamesi almost gave this game  stars automatically because it has the words mario and kart in it a shame that it doesnt deserve itof course the graphics are great snes graphics on a handheld
no slowdown and very colorful
i liked the questionmarkblocks in the snesversion better though the sound is ok nice voices but the music isnt as good as his older brother
it just seems so uninspiredand so do the tracks
they are very standard except for that indianshyguytrack  and most important too easy even in cc
also the questionmarkblocks keep respawning every few seconds so its very hard to miss them and youll blast yourself upto  in no timeif youve won the gold cup in each race you can try to get a star star starrating to brag about against yer friends a  starrating is doable but above that it only gets frustrating youll have to pick up all the tiny coins which are sometimes almost invisible because of the gbascreen and avoid the sand    times in a row you wanna play the most fun mode in the game the battlemode with  players
not possible in singleplayer only available in multipakmode
that means that youll have to find  other people with a gba and mario kart
i wish you good luck finding themyoull be using the lbutton fire and rbutton jump a lot
be prepared for crampsso all in all this game although it sounds great just doesnt delivers the charming fun of the snesversion
i you really wanna play this have you considered buying the originalsometimes when there is so much hype around a kind of video game it just doesnt really lead to aything but nothing for the money
that really can be surprising from a world class video game icon like mario
arguably when nintendo developed mario back in the s he had proven to be the most successful plumber of all time
still the downside comes every so often when a game does seem to actually rev up those engines today and back then it does seem to cool down and it has done it here a little bit too much
after the massive success of mario kart  for the nintendo  nintendo thought they had a sure hand victor again with another mario kart but they were wrongmario kart super circuit is the first racer for the game boy advance that features mario and his gang including bowser yoshi wario and princess toadstool who is known now as peach and a few others
basically it is the same gang as it was from mario kart  the game displays  different tracks that really dont seem to break out as they did before as well as the hidden tracks from the original mario kart
the game is mostly like the very first mario kart from the super nintendo without a lot to showcase
the control here is also a lot harder to go around here and can often try to frustrate you in the process no matter what the course is
although it is a little bit challenging mario kart may seem more like a throwback than the successor to mario kart  or even the mario kart double dash for the nintendo gamecubein all in all mario kart super circuit for the game boy advance isnt as surprising as i thought it was
it actually seems more like another dull racer that it is on the inside rather than the box on the outside
i only suggest this if you havent played the first mario kart for the super nintendo but not if youve enjoyed the mass appeal of the other two mario karts
this isnt one on the moneythe graphics in this game are amazing the sound is of excelent quality but the game itself gets dull pretty quicklythere are no hidden characters only hidden tracks and tracks are tracks run around a few times different color and shaped obstacles that all have one of the same three effects
they either slow you down make you spin out or make you falldont get me wrong i like the game but there could have been a lot more to itwas sent w games saved on it and written on poor condition
not totally satisfied it works  but there is something a bit off about the working condition
be careful of used memory cardsi was really excited to have this game come out
being a big fan of the show i eagerly anticipated the gaming experience of competing against tribes and within the tribe and suffering through tribal councils
while this game delivers these things i was less than impressed overall with this gameit starts out really well with character creation
choosing different traits of your character is essential to winning the game
i mistakenly shortsighted my strength for empthany which was a mistake later on in the game
you can even put your own name into the showthen the game starts and you go through camp time a reward challenge immunity challenge and tribal council
one of the things you have to endure is painfully long uploads for each section
maybe my pc is slow but i actually took to reading a book between each eventwhile the camp time was fun in chatting with people the reward and immunity challenges were often difficult to manipulate
my team kept on losing them time after time and after awhile i was down to three members and all of us very weak
managing the fatigue and effort levels for the team members was painful and not fun at all
i did enjoy the graphics of tribal council and the voting was fun but it seemed not to connect to anything that i could telli never made it to the merge because my pc crashed soon after and i cannot now uninstall this gameoverall this has been a mixed gaming experience
i felt that the quotweakest linkquot captures its game much more effectively  but its much easier to simlulate a close staged gameshow than a open air survival show
maybe with a few tweaks this game could be really what it needs to beive been waiting for a ncaa football game since purchasing my dreamcast and this game is it  well sort ofthe game plays very smoothly and offers a number of playbooks customized to the team youve chosen
however some of the true excitement of college football is missed
a few college fight songs are in the game but theyre played in every stadium
its annoying to hear another colleges fight song in your quothomequot stadium
of course this means that most college fight songs are not includedsecondly the playbyplay announcers are way off base in many scenarios
including calling tcu the quotmustangsquot and smu the quothorned frogsquot as well as indicating teams have turned the ball over when they havent
i wonder if this game skipped the qa process to hit a time deadlinein any event despite these annoyances the control and graphics and good and are modeled after the same in nfl k
in trying to provide an option offense for the college version sega almost got it right but the quarterback control during the option is a bit awkwardthe game is worth the money if youre like me and youve got to have a college football game but if you only have a passing interest in ncaa football id recommend saving your moneylet me start off by saying that i do own this game and i have played it unlike the other reviewers so far
this game is long overdue for the sega dreamcast
lets face it sega is the system for sports games and what better game is there than college footballhowever i am quite disappointed with this game
visual concepts are the geniuss behind nflk series and i expected a much better game
first of all the fight songs are played randomly so you could be playing as the university of new mexico and your band is playing the notre dame fight song
whats that all about
my version of the game has a quirk in which the announcers seem to forget what two teams are playing and start refering to us as different teamsim also disappointed with the fact that there isnt a bcs ranking system the bcs bowls arent in the game with the exception of the rose bowl and the recruiting system seems to be half bakedon the other hand the graphics are awesome just what youd expect from vc
the game isnt bad just not anywhere near where it should have been
i hate to say it but ncaa  from ea sports makes this game look very badi like spiderman but hate side scrollers
ive also played all the newer spiderman games and my expectations were low
this game was no surprise
its one of those games you play a lot at first and if you havent beaten or even if you have and never pick up again
if you like side scrollers and the other spiderman games buy it
if youre not one of those people dont get itif you fondly remember that great early s xmen arcade game then pay attentionthis aint it
quotxmenropquot is indeed done in the same style as the afore mentioned classic but suffers from a case of flawitis
what are those flawswell ill tell you
first off play control is a bit awkward and a bit slow
the jump button is the right hand trigger and for big hands that isnt always easytrust me
your xmen also doesnt like to be bothered to run they crawl
rouge has some great animation but she needs to haul it
there is a dash move but enemies will hit you if you try to use it to escape
enemies will crowd around you
and since there is no defense youre toast
not to mention the fact that they can attack you during your attack making it sometimes impossible to advance in the game
the sound is terrible
tiny punches and quotarrgghhquot when you die
bosses dont make any flashy entrances and they all have the same voice
given game boy advances sound potentialsomeone messed up
the bosses you encounter are unlocked once you beat them
you can use them to fight a la street fighter but you cant fight the cpu
they are only available via the gamelink
great marketing poor programing
so if you are interested in any of the games cool bossesjean grey psylocke gambitthen get a friend with the game link and another game packso whats good about it
the graphics are great
the xmen have great animation and the characters are nicely detailed
background graphics are cool too
even though they arent playable in one player mode the fact that some oool characters are in the game as bosses or minibosses is a great idea
if there is a next time i would like to see the unlockable characters selectable in the one player modehint hint
and even with its short comings the game is still fun
its the xmeni liked this game alright
i dont have it anymore but when i did it was an okay game
the graphics were good enough and so were the moves and characters
i loved the fact that apocalypse was the big bad final boss
he is my second favorite xmen villain next to magnetowho is also in this gamethere are many other cool bosses and you can play as wolverine rouge cyclops or stormall of whom are in my top  favorite xmen membersunfortunately there are  major things that make this game get pulled down to just being ok  the game is too easy
you just play as wolverine and slice and dice your way through all the enemies and bosses
 the bosses have cool attacks but i have seen much cooler out of other bosses including other game versions of them
 the music may be good but some other sound effects are sort of cheesy
overall all of this averages out and makes this game an ok buy
if you love the xmen to pieces  you desperately need a game dedicated to them then this is for you
otherwise get something else
this one may be alright but there are others that are better
quite a few as a matter of factthe xmen are back cyclops storm wolverine and rouge on a quest to discover who has destroyed the mutants mansion
it is of course apocalypse if you could not tell from the title a huge mechanized alien bent on destroying humanity
anyway this is a d beat them up game which is reminiscent of teenage mutant ninja turtles because you have to fight countless robots
unfortunately these countless robots all look the same which makes for a boring game
until you find the leader of each level such as the blob cable and apocalypse himself
the game is pretty boring because of lack of different enemies so its a good thing that there is a battery save function
the graphics are stupendous there are lots of moves and combinations and the animations look like they came straight out of a comic book
the button configuration is unique but a good one r button is jump l button is a mutant power the b button is a fierce attack and the a button is a quick attackthough i am a solid fan of mobile suit gundam and its many spinoffs i am writing this review as a seasoned gamer and nothing more
only the games content will be discussedit starts off great cgis animate the hundreds of orbiting colonies the mobilization of the zeon and federation forces an orbital battle sequence and finally amuro rey and the gundam giving a squad of zakus some serious paybackafter beating the first mission the game takes a sincere downfall
manually aiming and firing the gun is awkward
one must get up close and personal with the incoming dopps in order to take them out either by thrusting directly into them or standing on the white base in wait
destroying enemy gaws in the third mission requires thrusting repeatedly landing on top which is painfully difficult at times and wrecking it from theremost of the gundam fans out there defend the controls as being authentic and true to the show
thats all well and good with a game like silent hill  where the player assumes the role of james a depressed widower with little or no combat experience
thus the controls are strange and clunky in order to give the player some feeling of how james isnt used to swinging clubs and firing gunsheres the tradeoff
while combat is only used when absolutely necessary and performance ratings are nonexistent in silent hill  all of the goals in jj involve fighting and performance is graded based on remaining life defeated enemies time taken etclet it also be known that fans are optimistic in saying that one gets used to the controls
with any game the player soon memorizes button functions and special moves
this does not make the controls respond better at all though
being on the receiving end of a beam weapon while trying to dash away makes one want to hurl the controller across the room
all of the moves listed in the instruction manual except for the sequential saber slash are difficult to execute take time and are not worth the effort in the end
strafing while using the rifle bazooka or hammer is the best strategy at any and all timesif anything rent or borrow the game find a good strategy guide and play through it once like i did
the cgis and animated cutscenes are done well and fun to watch
the mobile suit specs movies and music tracks in the gallery are worth checking out
in short the gameplay suffers while everything else is thoroughly enjoyable
bad gameplay is however totally unacceptable which is why i only give this game an average ratingon a final note it ticks me off that the first good gundam game on the ps is one in which the player fights on the zeon sidevisually it is quite nice but of course if you cant get a game to look decent on a ps then you have a really big problem
the opening cutscene is fabulous
i wish the game were more like the opening sceneall the other reviewers criticisms are correct
the game has terrible controls
when you start out with the first mission it doesnt seem that bad
but when you play the harder missions where you really need to be able to control your mech the controls are absolutely uselessthe sound effects are very good
but when the game attempts to mix music sound effects and voice overs at the same time it quickly becomes unintelligible
i found myself switching off the music immediatelyonly buy this game if you are a really big gundam fan and really like to see a d model of a gundam run around
i remember watching gundam  when i was a kid and so this game is nostalgic for me
but if you have played many of the other ps mech games and are not a gundam fan then pass by or rent this title and wait for the zeon front title to come out
perhaps that one will have learned from the mistakes of this onethis is my second gundam game and i liked that it contained dubbed cutscenes from the animated series which i have yet to watch
fans will love that the dub keep all the voice actors from the showoverall i liked the game but there are much better mecha fighters out there with better graphics and controls and hopefully better protagonists
this one was whiny and annoying at times
but if you dont own a ps yet than i guess this is a good way to start you gundam collectionthe number one biggest problem with resident evil code veronica is that its completely unnecessary if you go into it having thoroughly played and completed resident evil  and code veronica basically combines the mansion of the first re and the atmosphere and puzzles of the second re and tries to paint a fake picture of being a completely new game with updated graphics and atmosphere when in fact that couldnt be further from the truth
this game is just a huge waste of time compared to the previous games in the seriesthe biggest problem is that and this is a huge problem if youve already played the first two resident evil games you will probably feel completely bored with code veronica and be left with the impression of been there done that
this game was outdated even when it was brand new because it adds absolutely nothing that we havent already experienced previouslyi only recommend playing code veronica if youre new to the classic style resident evil series in other words if you havent played the mid to late s resident evil gamesif you go into this code veronica having played the first three re games you will be severely disappointed because it does absolutely nothing new or innovative
all this game does is progress the story a little bit but the gameplay itself is stale and pointlessthe enemy variety is also horrible
zombies dogs more zombies more dogs that sums up the majority of the enemies you will discover in this game with the addition of an overrated new enemy called bandersnatchers
oh sure the way these enemies can elevate themselves to new heights when you reach the second floor is impressive and somewhat unsettling as far as fear is concerned but other than that these enemies do absolutely nothing for me and they definitely arent in the same league as hunters or lickerssteve is an annoying character too
i dislike him a lotive seen arguments over which resident evil game is better this one or nemesis
i can promise you that nemesis absolutely smokes this game into a million little pieces
nemesis adds progression to the gameplay such as the ability to make your own ammo and feels so much better than code veronica its not even funnyalso code veronica suffers from way too much needless backtracking
were talking about a serious moment of wandering back and forth here folks the likes of which never happened in a resident evil game before this one was released
its definitely quite tedious and unnecessarythe game removes the still frames that were dominant in the previous resident evil games but since the majority of time is being spent walking through previously explored empty areas this isnt exactly some major exciting leap in gameplay or anything
in fact it doesnt matter at alloverall probably best to avoid this game and pick up resident evil  and  instead the two best games in the series imoresident evil code veronica x is the best version of re to date
in creating this game capcom kept the original formula of re and threw in a couple twists
instead of using still shots for every location the entire game is now rendered in polygons
this allows the camera to follow the action similar to dino crisis capcom and eliminating most of the dubbed bad camera angles
this also allows players to catch explore more of the area
the down side to this camera in motion approach is that you often times will miss the shimmering object clues programmers give to allow you to find important items
this can cause for some added frustration but once you adapt to this new view i am confident you will prefer itthe play mechanics remain for the most part unchanged from the previous installments of the series
up still walks forward down still back steps any avid video gamer should be familiar with this control scheme
the ability to spin  degrees to face an onslaught from the rear has been changed from a simple button press to tapping back and the run button
this alteration can be cumbersome to use at first but you soon become accustomed to its uses
another welcome change is the multitargeting ability on some weapons
for example when claire has the twin machine guns she can target multiple enemies
this is great for pacifying crowds
my favorite adjustment to play was increased usefulness of the knife
previously the knife was used for little more than a last ditch effort but in recvx it becomes a primary choice of weapons for zombies
precise swipes with the knife can inflict serious damage as well as decapitate zombiesthe story is somewhat of a wild goose chase
in the beginning claire redfield featured in re is trying to locate her brother chris redfield featured in the first re
claire is captured by umbrella corp they lock her in a prison on a remote island
the problem is a helicopter crashes releasing the tvirus infected monsters
claire now has to fight her way off the island
meanwhile chris is in europe acting as a member of stars stars is like the swat only better
when chris finds out that claire is trapped on the island he rushes to the rescue
meanwhile steve a new character to the series helps claire escape the island
as the game progresses claire keeps going where chris was then chris is right on claires heels
it is just a wild goose chase
the difference between this and the original dreamcast incarnation is the addition of a  minute fmv telling about albert weskers introduced in re escape from the raccoon city mansion
the video does not add to the overall story but is a fringe benefit for owning the ps version of recvxthe graphical aspects of recvx for ps seemed like a downgrade from the dreamcast version
though most of the game holds a dimly lit eerie feel in well lit areas the pss antialiasing limitations become more apparent
this gives a grainier look to the nicely polished exterior
enemies have not changed a bit in diversification
if it is a male zombie it will have a consistent look throughout the game
hunters look extraordinary this time around
the attention to detail on their lizard like skin is exceptional compared to previous re titlesi wasnt too impressed with the sound effects and background music
the sfx seem to be touched up versions of the previous games sounding dated against the pss power
capcoms choice of bgm doesnt really add to the feel of the game either
instead i usually turn the music off
theres more visual suspense than audio in recvx
even the zombies have one cry
it is the same groan used since re
i hope for their sake they put more diversity into the enemiesoverall i did enjoy this game
it is not the graphics or sound that appeal but the story and feel presented
i rated this game an  on the game rankings scale
i found recvx to be amusing but it falls into the same frustration loop that other games do if you dont have a guide
either way this is a good game to own for your ps
if you dont have a ps i recommend owning the original for dreamcastif you are a diehard fan of the re series you will love this game
if however like me you dont regard capcoms monster franchise as the beall endall of actionadventure gaming you may want to give code veronica x a pass
although the backgrounds are no longer prerendered the player still has no control over the game camera which is both puzzling and frustrating
puzzling because if the environments are generated in realtime d why cant the camera be usercontrolled
frustrating for the same reason as any other re titleits just plain too hard to see whats going on sometimes
in many rooms the camera angle is facing the door through which the character enters making anything outside of that view including enemies totally invisible
often the only clue to the presence of zombies is their moaning
how is one supposed to aim and fire at something one cannot see
why should the player not be able to see anything the character can
another issue continuing from the earlier re games is the control
how archaic is the old quotrotateandforwardquot control scheme
dont even try to do this with the analog stick if you want any kind of precise movement
thank heaven there are no jumping puzzles in these games
combat is and has always been a hitormiss affair in resident evil games and code veronica x is no exception
wasting bullets when there are few enough to be had in the first place is supremely infuriating but often happens because the characters rotate so slowly with their weapons drawn
the silly quotcinematicquot camera angles may indeed be dramatic but totally useless for any kind of exciting combat
was it impossible for capcom to include a control scheme that would move the character in the direction indicated by the controllerthe puzzles are actually ok in this installment as they have at least some rudimentary logic within the game world
for example there are no mysterious iconic statues in the middle of a police station but rather computerized security systems that need to have an id number input to unlock a door
a metallic symbol must be reproduced in plastic to allow it to pass through a metal detector and then used to unlock a gate
these puzzles add to the realism rather than detract from it like the sometimes silly ones in resident evil and re the graphics are impressive especially considering they are done in realtime
the games art direction is just as clever and beautiful as any other capcom survival horror game
the music again is more of the same but it feels very familiar and does well to let you feel you are back in the re world which is ok the over sound is good too d sound effects make locating those outofcameraview baddies a little easier
unfortunately these superficial qualities just dont do enough to overcome the sameness of the the experience and dont do anything to overcome the flaws in gameplay
i think that re games in general are becoming a little overrated and the series has overstayed its welcome
re survivor was lambasted as being a horrible game but at least you could see those zombies when you walked into a room full of them
by the waythe devil may cry demo is amazing
almost worth the purchase of resident evil code veronica x but not quiteto those of you who never played the resident evil series before youd do well in picking this game up
it has plenty of surprises for the lot of you and plenty of action to keep you entertainedbut for the rest of us we know the score right
havent we heard this story all before
do you remember resident evil 
what a adrenaline rush that was eh with plenty of weaponry scary monsters and atmosphere to keep any gamer happycode veronica x doesnt host that much of new material to old fans such as myself
sure the characters lips move in the quotmoviequot sequences so what
the weapons if nothing else has been reduced the action isnt that immence compare this with resident evil nemisis  and youll know this
yes there really isnt that much new in code veronica
its just the same old thing which gets boring rapidly fastnew gamers buy code veronica at once
old fans if you have played through resident evil  youve gotten all the action you can handle and wont need to bother with resident evil code veroinca xthat was the rough explenation
if you want it in detail read onok firstly let me just start off by saying that i am a huge resident evil fan
ever since the beginning resident evil ive been there shooting at zombies getting terrified being compelled by both music and story
my personal favorite of all resident evil games has to be the second one with the third one being a close encounter
the second game had so many elements that makes a game great that i dont know where to beginnow that the resident evil series has jumped up a platform what is new
well actually not very much
i must say i got to be a little disappointed with the start of code veronica
there seems to be less zombies and less scary moments in code veronica in the other games
so you ask me why
well my guess it it has to be that this game covers a huge area
the first game only took place inside a mansion whilst in code veronica you get to visit an island two seperate mansions a science complex oh did i mention the cave
the game seems to be stripped of that claustrophoc feel which i consider a must have for any resident evil game
sure resident evil  nemisis did take place in racoon city but still the city looked so closed down almost like a ghost town
so the claustrophic essence stayed intact in the last game
but here the wide area doesnt help the game muchthe graphics are of course better than ever
now you can actually see the lips moving on the characters the music too helps a lot now being on the the quanity note since there are a lot of themes but none of them really grasped me as much as the few used in the other resident evil games
graphics moving lips
who needs it
i never considered the movie aspect that first appeared in resident evil  that much great
yes of course it is nice to have something extra
but i feel code veronica is more like a movie than a gamecontrolling wise the game is a step backwards
yes you can turn  degrees like in resident evil  but where is the option to jerk away a blow from a zombie
complitely missing
even though that was just a chance thing and not messured by skill i still think that was a fun addition in resident evil  another thing why have they censored the zombies
i mean if you try to use your shotgun to blow of a zombies head it wont come off
whymaybe capcom wanted to grasp a much more wider audiencebut it kind of loses its reallity a bitdontget me wrong resident evil code veronica x is a great gamebut if you are a but short on cash i would opt if i were youto wait for devil may cryresident evil code veronica x was originally a dreamcast game and has been ported to the ps
while not a terrible entry in the series it never really took off for me
sure it was fairly long but it still felt incomplete somehow
maybe it has something to do with the lack of unlockables and only one ending
in the first resident evil you could get a closet key and unlimited rocket launcher
there were also multiple endings
same goes for  and  why not in this
your guess is as good as mine there are indeed multiple possibilities
still if your into resident evil this is a real installment it just falls short of the main series due to the lack replayabilitythis game is virtually the same as all of the other old school resident evil games
limited supplies lots of puzzles item management and zombies
the limited items creates a tense atmosphere and there are plenty of jump scares
if you liked any of the previous re games youll probably enjoy the gameplay of this one
now dont get me wrong i love old school re gameplay there are just a few things about this one that are far more frustrating than they are funfirst of all it has way more backtracking than i remember in any other resident evil game
they all have backtracking but they dont involve you going back and forth across a giant island multiple times
you cross the island only to get an item that unlocks a door two screens away from where you started
im not a fan of the plot which at times gets rather ridiculous
there are also a lot of annoying enemies
bandersnatches are nearly impossible to dodge as their arms can stretch across an area to smack you and can jump from level to level
getting past them is a chore and they show up early on in the game at least it waits til the end to throw hunters at you
i recall a few puzzles where i was completely stumped and upon looking up the solution in a walkthrough would have never figured it out
i dont recall any puzzles like that in other re games
there is also a room full of moths that plant eggs on your back which hatch and poison you
now the moths are fairly easy to dispose of one shot from anything kills them and the room has an infinite supply of blue herbs but once the eggs are laid you cant get rid of them and theyll hatch in inconvenient places
also none of the bosses are any fun
one boss involves you running down a hallway being chased but unless you want to lose a powerful weapon for the rest of the game its impossible to get past without taking damage
they also throw you in a room you cant backtrack out of so unless you actually came prepared and have a relatively close save you can get stuck
another boss has tons of little minion things that push you around and deal nearconstant damage
it makes the battle far too difficult especially considering the amount of shots it takes to end it
there are some other minor things but i wont list themif you want traditional survival horror gameplay then this will provide that
it is an earlier resident evil title after all
however its incredibly frustrating in the unfair sort of way
demons souls was a difficult game but one that i thought was fair
this isnt  if you want a great resident evil experience go for the gamecube remake of the originali am not very impressed with the graphics they should have took some of that graphic ability they used on the cinemax clips threw out the game
which are really cool to daze apon
the camera angles uhm why is it when your looking at the screen with your gameing charecter you see your charecter looking at you when she should be looking at the monsters you cant see eating at you when there where
infront of you terrible camera angles
i give it  stars cause atlease it scared my wife and thats all ways funhey there lemme tell ya about a little game i played for the sega dreamcast way back in the day
it was called re code veronica and it was the next installment that capcom gave us dealing with re and its huge following
the game pulled off ok in alot of respects because of the obvious graphics and sound improvements
however for me it just didnt seem to have the same pull that re  or re  didnow we look at re code veronia x for the psx  once again capcom seemed to have an idea of what they wanted us to experience
graphics and sound aside which of course were nice the game didnt seem to have alot of that extra umpf
that the other games have haddont get me wrong i liked the game but the reason i have given it a lower rating overall from re  and re  is because i just couldnt pull myself into the original re cv or the rereleased re cv x games
im thinking maybe it was the fact that by this time i was getting kind of tired of dealing with zombies like silent hill eventually loosing its steam with disturbing images
i was feeling all zombiedout they just were not scary anymore but thats for my resident evil  reviewin closing id suggest getting this game over the original re code veronica for dreamcast anyday
as for getting this game because you are looking for something scary or heartpounding to play maybe try re  or silent hill  one last thing as i have said with resident evil  and  i will not and would not pick those or this title up for the gamecube they are nothing more than just a port not a remake as they should have beenwhat can i say
this title was pretty good
it is for sure a strong three maybe a  but i have lost interest in the game
if i wrote this when i bought it it would have been a   it looks really good plays well and sounds creepy
it seemed a tad short and i was left wishing for another disk like in resident evil   rent this game and check it out
it did not dissapoint but it didnt blow me away eitherthis was the st resident evil i played and beat myself
it was satisfying and fun and the story was interesting
i loved every aspect of it but it got so hard at times that i would not have made it past certain points without consulting internet walkthroughs or cheating
the storyline is very confusing and the backtracking is tedious and ridiculous
nothing is explained in the beginning to let you know that you need certain items found in the beginning to get past points later on
the game also requires you to ditch some items youve found in the beginning
i would have been so mad if i would have not cheated
ill probably buy it again to play on my wii just to see if it really is as difficult as it was on ps when i played because it is a fun game
i enjoyed visiting and exploring all different places especially the mansion
the controls take time getting used to because they feel awkward
you cant store many items and ammo is limited very limited
the puzzles are impossible i didnt even try to figure them out
overall its worth playing through to the end because the story is great but it is not an easy or painless processso be prepared to get so frustratedi just beat this game a couple days ago and let me say that it was really dissapointing
its not the graphics are bad they are fine
it wasnt the controls they are basically the same as re    there just wasnt that extra something to make it intresting the cut scenes seemed lame i was basically bored the whole time playing the game and dont remember ever really having that excitment thing going at any parts
beating the game was more of a relief than anything this game will never be played by me again
 more thing it seemed like in this game the puzzles were just annoying you easily have to spend  hours gametime just running back and fourth with nothing to kill and it just gets frustrating
i like the re series but this one is a letdown but still you have to have it for your re collectionthe st re for ps arrives accompanied by somewhat of a muted cheer with codeveronica x a direct port of the dc veronica with a couple of additional cinema sequences
re newbies will find an enjoyable adventure here but veterans will find it to be treading on very familiar ground
veterans of the series already know what to expect monsterblasting action crossed with braintwisting puzzles and it does not deviate from that formula either
the narrative follows survivalhorror franchise pros clairechris redfield travel from a desert island to a secret arctic base both locales are of course densely populated by zombies and mutated monsters thanks in part to the gvirus tvirus or whatever they seem to be calling it these days
veronica x delivers a solid stream of shocks and surprises although some story elements are awkward as the games title puncuation
after a couple of quotromanticquot interludes between claire and an island prisoner named steve youll yearn for the nononsense style of jill valentine and re
one of the prime selling points of the game is additional cinematics that werent in the dc version of the game
only those rabid fans who want to know every last detail of the re narrative should play this
the rest
wait for re on the gc
you really arent missing much herei agree the ambience is eerie but that the fog is so thick it becomes very annoying
my main complaint is the scenes that leave me saying what the  was that all about
like when you are being chased my  metalheads and after ricocheting bullets off their masks for three years they all of a sudden stick their own spears in their throats and continue standing even though they are dead
in order to get through the door after this you take eggs out of their hands yes eggs and stick them in the door
spoiler at the end it says some mysteries have been solved and some remain  im not waiting for all mysteries to be solved but maybe these scenes could be reconfigured to make more sense than an lsd tripi got sh  years ago
for its time the graphics were great and the story was definetly something original no other game developer team had tried before
if you were to ask which i found more scarybeing attacked by flesh eating mutants or receiving a genuine letter from a deceased loved one written after they had died id be inclined to say the laterregardless that is the dilehma james is faced with
his dead wife has lured him back to silenthill and you know that is not going to be a happy walk in the parkfirst of all let me say i think this game really made people rethink the survival horror genre
it tried being witty intelligent and chalked with macabre symbolism as opposed to zombie arms that broke through windows
even the side characters were more than simply devices to move the plot along
eddie and angela have their own interesting inner demons too and maria looks just like jamess deceased wife though her personality is drastically different
if that is not enough to sell you on this premise i could simply say oh yeah this game introduces pyramidhead
that alone will have people lining up in drovesnow putting everything good about the game aside im going to be brave and talk about why i think while it deserves praise it still is not all that and a side order of extra big fries
yes i know this is the game the elite silent snoots put on a pedestal
the one game no other sh can compare to
the holy grail of team silent
is it that earth shattering
for me anyway it was notas with the other games there is a suspenseful build up
first it is sounds
then it is fleeting shadows
finally it is full blown creatures
the only problem is often there are not enough monsters and instead you are forced to aimlessly wander around trying to collect keys or pieces of an obscure puzzle
now i admit sometimes its fun to run around an enviorment without fear of dying to see those little details
however in a survival horror game you should never begin lulling into a calm sense of security and thats the biggest flaw of the game
in most areas i felt safe and that the monsters were easy to manuever around
every once in awhile an eager lurching pyramidhead made my heart race a bit but besides for the beloved apron adorned big guy no other creatures instilled in me any amount of dreadthe true disturbing factor comes from interacting with eddie and angela
i will not divulge why they are so psychologically unstable but talking with them alone requires a few steel nerves
these are normal people that snapped and you get the feeling you are a participant in their  horrorifying delusions
things get stranger when you meet maria the sultry doppleganger of mary who embodies all james sexual fantasies given flesh
is she james wifes ghost
sadly silent hill never makes an explaination that easy so you have to keep playing to find outas the game slowly drags on it picks up when we find out james has his own dark secret
when you finally get that revelation everything comes together and you know why silent hills foggy streets beckoned to himnow there is one thing i like to make clear to the fans
pyramid head pursued james because james subconciously wanted to be punished for his past misdeeds however  a few references from the other games prove the executioner has been apart of the town history for a long time
ph was not manifested from james he was merely drawn to james
this is why it is ok ph was in the movie and ok he is in sh vexamples
in origins the gillespie house had a picture of ph
origins took place way before james arrival
the room talked about the red devil and jimmy stone
this story ties into ph if you read it carefully
another document in origins talked about the executioner as well
in sh  there is a picture of one of alessas past goddess incarnations with ph in the background amongst a few other people
you can view it in the cathedrali just wanted to clear that up because there is a huge debate raging ph should be confined to only this game which i find to be a waste of breathas you can expect the music in this game is haunting and very befitting of james sad tale and descent into madness to find his redemption
if there is one thing sh  gets right it is estabalishing a powerful thought provoking moodcombat is what you expect from sh
you are not going to be able to fight like a marine
a plank with nails in it is your first weapon
that should tell you something right there
eventually you get a few guns and a few other melee weapons besides your buddy plankzorz
aside from stomping on monsters when theyre down you are not a golden glove brawling champion
perhaps it is for this reason it is good why most of the monsters are so gosh darn pathetic
besides for the acid spewing of the patient monsters and the sheer size of the abstract daddies nothing made me feel overwhelmed that oftenso in the end ill say this game is great for atmosphere and a brilliant story
if you can stomach a horror game with more emphasis placed on wandering around solving puzles and talking to crazy lunatics to glean disturbing revelations you can likely over look the fact the combat engine is uninspired and the monsters are more scarce than the items in your inventoryin the first silent hill game we were introduced to a town that had a deep dark secret and as we experienced the environment there we saw things get ever more and more bizarrethe reason for this was never fully explainedbut there was enough story to allow us to draw possible conclusionsthis time around konami has concentrated on giving us mindblowingly sharp graphics  from the full motion video sections all the way through to the ingame environments
and with the several possible game play options there is a lot to do as far as play and replay are concernedhowever the story this time is not very well developed
and where there is some attempt at plotting there are sadly few surprisesas with the original game there is never a complete explanation of the situation
how did james sunderland  the character we play as  end up in silent hill
we learn that a note from his presumably dead wife inspired his journey but never understand much else about him
when did he notice the world around him starting to mutate into the bizarre place he visits
why does so little of the strangeness around him have an impactthere are plenty of attempts made to creep us out in this game and the enemies are definitely strange and interesting
the puzzles with their multiple levels of difficulty are also a nice feature
but these elements just dont add up to all that they mightthis isnt a major disappointment by any means
it just doesnt live up to the promise inspired by the first game
even with the psrelated improvements the elements of a great game are essentially the same
unfortunately silent hill  lacks several of themi bought this game hoping to finally find a game that could scare
i will admit it is graphically beautiful and moody
obviously a lot of work and thought went into the game
however when it all boils down it was basically a bore
very guided simplistic puzzles and by far not frighteningsilent hill  was known for its creepy monster array and its unique use of nightmareinducing scariness
silent hill  is far from the original
it does make you scared at times but not to the degree as the original did
with silent hill  we are introduced to better looking fogeffects and overall graphics
silent hill  managed to do more than  does with a lot lesswhich is what bothers mesilent hill s main attraction for scariness is quotpeoplequot instead of monsters
what i mean by this is that every person in this game including you have your fair share of quotproblemsquot
there are some people that seem to evolve from normal humans at the beginning of the game to downright mentally unstable whackos
it really makes you think about mankind
in this edition of sh you are put in the place of another hopeless guy in search for a loved one this time its your wife instead of your kid
i wont give away the surprise ending even though i guessed it beforehand but it is pretty wierd and disturbingmy biggest beaf with this game is probably its lack ofabsense of enemies
what does this mean exactlyabsense of monsters  examplewell if you played sh then you remember the freaky little kid monsters
well they were taken out because the creators thought they were too scarywell i thought this game was supposed to be scary so that was a major bummer to melack of monsters  examplethere are probably  monsters excluding minibosses and bosses that are reused and reused throughout the game
in the original silent hill there were probably  monsters total that they used excluding the bosses sparingly in the games evolution from normal to downright scary
this is a big downfall to this game because you will find yourself in a completely new scenario and fighting the same monsters over and overbut this game is not without its benefits it is disturbing when it wants to be
you cant really trust anyone in this game not even yourself
everyone tells you lies and they avoid the truth at all costs
even though the original game offered more weapons this game offers some cool ones like a sword that is probably the length of a mans body so its not a total lossto sum this up if you are interested in silent hill so much that it doesnt matter which one is better then you should probably get this and judge for yourself
i bought it for that reason and i still own it
other people that are new to the silent hill series should probably play the first before you play this to get a feel on what scary really issilent hill does develop an interesting story but it is spooky and gruesome to the max
dispatching the living dead is a bloody mess and could give a person nightmares for a week
there was no excuse for the slow movement of the main character and difficulty in guiding him
the puzzles are challenging but the  search for items in dark decaying hotel mazes tried my patience in the end
i wouldnt attempt this game without a strategy guidethis game holds a spot very near and dear to my heart as being my favorite surrivival horror game and ive played a lot of them so instead of getting all mushy on you all ill mearly give you some of the basics
let me stat by saying that many people believe this game represents one of the finest examples of story telling to have ever graced a video game and i will spoil none of it in my review
the game in short combines the creepiness and mood from the first game with the controlls and graphics of the rd
from its opening scenes the game draws you in and however horrific and disturbing things get on screen and at times they will get very disturbing the game mearly becomes more addictive
as things go on you find your self intrigued not only with the story of the protagonist but with the history of the setting of the story the town of silent hill im not giving anything away here the name of the game is silent hill  and if you cant make some sort of assumption that the game takes place in silent hill you need not bother with this game at all
like many other survival horrors this game has fixed camera angles sort of you can push a button to put the camera behind your player but this only works in some areas that can become a little bothersome at first but in the end help add to the suspence
it also has corny diolauge but this can be easilly forgiven as it does not take away from the mood that the game creates
next up this game is not for every one and is not a gore filled splatterfest but does feature some blood and several disturbing images that will stay with you for some time to come
i recomend the game to mature players not only because of its content but because of its story
the game does not spell out any thing for you and there is a lot of symbolisim ie
many things you see hapen arround you reflect things that have happened in you characters past or in his mind and you have to make this assumption all on your own in many cases wondering what something symbolises and the story touches on many quotmaturequot issues such as child abuse wedding vows euthanasia suicide hommicide and religion
after all the praise i have given the game you may be wondering why i rated the orrigional sh with only  stars
this is because the orrigional game is not nearly as good as the quotgreatest hits version for ps or the quotrestless dreamsquot version for xbox both versions are exactly the same
these versions contain many things that were not included in the orrigional game such as more endings more items more options and a different playable character and her own short storyprolouge that you can play through lasts about  mins to  hours depending on your skill   because of this the quotgreatest hitsquot and quotrestless dreamsquot versions are  star games while the orrigional is only  when compared to them
be sure that if you are buying the game for ps make sure the box art has a red top with quotgreatest hitsquot writen in the red
if you own an xbox the restless dreams version is the only one availabe for the xbox so dont worry
in conclusion this is one of the best survival horror games ever released and scares you in a subtle creepy way that very few games can
including an awardwinning story easy to learn controlls good graphics the graphics are saposed to look grainy after you beat the game once you can make them smooth and turn off the grainy filter and a healthy amout of replay value this is one game that belongs in any survival horror fans collectionan impregnable darkness lingers within the corridors of the haunted hospital a faint yet disturbing crackling sound echoes close by then the shuffling of feet
a silence wells over the man plodding through the blood dried halls
handling a crude pipe and a trusty flashlight as hes only means of protection james sunderland goes on
the impenetrable mist of fog harbors unseen monsters they hunt him leaving hints of their presence with distorted cries
his flashlight emits limited visibility
he is rapt to find his former love who supposedly wrote him a letter to convene at the ethereal town of silent hill
a letter she has written from the grave beyond
when my big ol ears chanced upon the story behind the exaggerated gore game i was surprisingly head over heels
inspired by hollywood gorefests and perhaps resident evil konamis suspenseful game was something to get all schoolgirl about
irresistible screenshots from various zines slapped me in the face saluting it as revolutionary
presenting one devil of a pessimistic setting silent hill  looked to have everything going for it an absorbing story a mix of hairraising visuals and an arsenal of oddly enough attractive undead nurses
needless to say i expected a spinetingling crusade into hell and the game delivered just a little too much of unpleasant hell
my definition of hell you ponder
first the apparent dizziness from the camera scheme
konami initiated  phase super artsy incorporating a futile attempt to capitalize on the aspects of horror films
the last time a director went artistic was the disaster known as the cell  starring the notalent jennifer lopez
unfortunately konami nearly ranks on the cells  verge
secondly the gameplay identically mirrors the exact setup to its predecessor
basically the player must chronologically progress from point a to point b while eluding monsters along the way
other than the flashlight and the pipe there are guns with very limited ammo
akin to resident evil the player should conserve ammo and sling em on mutant bosses
once you play an hour of silent hill  you pretty much played the whole thing players feel heartbeats stem from the controller stumble on a grousing oddity playing hideandseek in the midst of excessive  fog scramble from vomiting enemies flirt or dart away from stalking nurses collect an item here and there to unlock a door crack plenty of conundrums equip your game face for an upcoming boss and finally if youre a vet to the horror genre youll  feel the wane of the scare moments
corresponding to the rules of the now dreary survival genre tactical options on gameplay is naughtthe only distinguishable difference in silent hill  to that of its predecessor is the dazzling facelift
a sheer novelty the playstation  refines the graphics to the directors own dark morbid world
konamis underscore has to be the highly polished environment
shadowy and stark the town is heavily congested by indolently flowing fog
the atmosphere is so detailed that it can probably manifest a life of its own
there areas where pure darkness shrouds the room with nothing more than a flashlight guiding the player
animation on both the characters and monsters are parallel to the fluidity of water
ps harnesses the best facial expressions i have ever seen
in each cg sequence the mugs on the characters are superbly distinct showcasing a uniquely designed emotion
graphically silent hill   has attained an otherwise unreachable ascent until nowin the audio department theres the fundamental elements found respectfully for this type of genre
there are downright disquieting silences mainly found in the game
the music is commonly suspended as the player focuses on the presence of threats by sounds of movement or verbal noises
the few tracks of music suit and correspond to the mistrustful setting
sound effects are wonderfully rendered like the scraping of metal the shuffling feet and the bizarre crunches
although the sound effects and music are excellent the voiceovers in the cg sequences have not improved over the original
again the japanese creators have mistakenly selected incompetent actors who sound insanely cheesydespite the promise silent hill  had going for it the evils of gameplay slipups tarnish its potential
if konami were to patch up the wounds on the inescapable camera crisis and append a fresh sheet of innovations this would have been passed up as the king of the survival genre
too bad tooalright does anyone else feel like this should have been a stand alone game
it deserves to the the first in a series
it does so many things right
the graphics are beautiful even compared to modern consoles
the atmosphere is the reason you play the game
the controls feel stiff unresonsive and good enough to keep you going
the story explores the psyche of a man trying to hide something and you are discovering it for the first time
the town itself is an enemythe combat is not the reason you play this game
sure you kill strange slightly effeminite enemies but you are playing this game to understand what the hell is going on
that is the important part
this game is good because it makes you care about a character we do not even know
it makes us want to find out explore find everything go everywhere learn try do be repulsed confused aggrivated amazed and then doubly confused
this game makes you question reality question yourself and discover something about you the playerthe puzzles are woven gently into the story still complex enough to warrent a guide but not so difficult that a sharpminded person could not solve the problem although the fire axe you carry should be able to cut through that lock it will notthis is a game a collector needs
there are so many versions the ps version is the one i stick to but the others are just as awesome
this game is good
it is art it is fun it is everything a game should be
you can replay it interpret it have fun and be scared all at the same time
yes get this gamethis game would have made a very interesting movie  as a game it can get boring so i had to play it like two hours at at timethen rest the story made me curious i just had to play this for myselfits a the kind of when you just want to open and close door fecth this fetch that and solve some aimless riddles this the game for you
did i mention the controls
its like trying to steer a lawn mower with a axe handle
but if you want more i dont think this will satistfy your gaming needs i still love konami and this isnt so baaaaaadi think it will have its fans i am just not one of them laterzzzzzzi am a casual fan of bomberman and this is the first bomberman i own and i must say that the game is sweet funfor a while
the gameplay does get repeative and although they added a variety of different game play objectives it still just boiled down to the same thingbomb for me bomb for you bomb for everyone
the graphics are sweet and the anime intro is mad just mad i could watch it over and over again
the gameplay as i said is standard and repeatitive although the aqua fights rule
if you are a bomberman fanatic then by all means get it you wont be disappointedjack of all games is a good name because you get jack of their games pretty fast
this game had alot of potenial
viking legends and characters and an exciting history
the game is ok its alot of killing slashing and hacking and for the most part seems to have no reason behind it
i like hack and slash games
but i like some reason for it
thats why i enjoyed the medal of honour games
they are basiclly shoot everything but i like the missions
the character is a little tricky to control at times and if you are having trouble it will really annoy you
the sound is ok but the speech is excellent and probobly the best part of the game
the graphics are just a little clearer than the psx so they have a long way to go
i would be wary of buying any jack of all games titles
but maybe worth a renti guess this game graphic wise is decent due to when it was released but my main problem with it was the load times
some points were pretty cheesy like eating lizards to replenish health
the voiceovers werent that great either but i guess they were good at the time
another thing i didnt like was when you were in first person mode and you were using a weapon you couldnt see it
this game is beyond being perfect in anyway but its worth playing if you rent it or find it at a very cheap price
dont expect too much from this because youre not going to get itif youve played this game on the pc i dont recommend playing it on the ps
although it looks nice the controls are so difficult
this isnt a game that should have been brought out for the ps
the game itself is one of the best only on a pc thoughplease hear me out before you say im a strange guy for not liking halflifei never actually played the game i watched my younger cousin play the game
watching him play i got the feeling halflife is pretty much nothing but running around very quickly shooting things
i dont know if maybe my cousin was just really good at the game or maybe the character is supposed to run around that quickly
or maybe my cousin did have it on hyper mode
either way it wasnt that fun to watch because you pretty much zoom through doors and hallways
maybe its more fun to play i dont knowit appeared from watching him play that basically all you do is run around as quickly as you can shooting the small amount of enemies that happen to cross your path while exploring a big clunky government facility
theres a bunch of games like that on the first playstation or rather a bunch of games not much different
halflife also has puzzles but they seemed rather simple to complete
its possible the puzzles are more difficult to find than to complete seeing as how the game is so hugewatching my cousin dash through what seemed like a countless amount of hallways and doors i got the impression the game wasnt very interesting
im a video game fan from the playstation one days and halflife just didnt do much in the way of separating itself from most playstation games besides having better graphics and much bigger and longer areas to explore of courseactually i was expecting the graphics in halflife to look really good because the playstation  is supposed to be a graphically appealing gem but the graphics in halflife were actually not much of an improvement compared to many playstation one graphics
i know the playstation  has better examples of wonderful graphics than in this game im just saying they werent that goodi dont know
dont hate me for not liking it
im sure its actually a good game and that its simply a matter of waiting until the day comes when i can appreciate the new style of video games
as long as storylines are dominating video games however it probably wont be anytime sooni had a great time fighting off aliens and soldiers because of the nice story  but the multiplayer looks so rushed its like they let a bunch of monkeys work on it
i had no fun at all fighting my friends in this get unreal tournament instead for a good multiplayer fragfesti really love this game
however i would prefer playing the version on the pc
but this has a few different details that are not in the pc version
slightly improved graphics is the main thing as well as halflife decayi really wanted to love this game
ive loved the wipeout series since the original
i love racing games especially nontraditional ones
xg is deffinately a wipeout knockoff
it has very cool graphics
it is a lot easier to drive than wipeout so people who dont have much time to practice wont be frustrated
i like the idea of getting at least two cycles side by side and the weapons are easy to use
however the league system they use is pretty lame
i just wasnt very motivated to want to go farther like i was in wipeout or ssx
also while the controls are easy to understand i had to reprogram the pad to really play effectively
the default setup really stinks
overall the game just didnt captivate my attention
i suggest renting before buying on this one just to make sure it will yourswell heres another solid racing game for the ps
personally i enjoy fantasy racing and this game definitely did the trick
but as is the case with many games play value becomes an issue
this game definitely has play value but not enough of it
once you buy all the weapons and upgrades you have nothing to do
the game could use more of the above
and would it hurt to slow down the game a little
this game is definitely not for beginning gamers
the controls are tricky and the weapons icons hard to see
my advice stick with gt
thats it from me
im out  i got this game awhile back and played it quite a bit
i loved the idea of it but i highly recommend purchasing restaurant empire instead
its a better game with many more optionsbasically in this game you get a blank restaurant you outfit it you staff it you make the quotmenuquot and you try to keep customers happy
the biggest downside to this is that your menu consists only of pizza
you can make all kinds of pizza which actually has a really fun interface but you can only make pizza
the other part is  if you make pizzas that are popular in the real world like pepperoni the customers dont like them
they seem to like crazy pizzas like quotmaggot sausage pizza with antsquot  ummoverall its not a bad game
i got it in the bargin bin at the game store for like  and it was worth the cost
despite the few faults it is fun to play and i got many hours of enjoyment out of iti always thought a quotrestaurant simquot would be fascinating  preparing the menu choosing the decor hiring employees expanding etc
fast food tycoon seemed to offer some semblance of that but not with the depth i hoped for
it would be nice to be able to branch out beyond pizza  though the choices of toppings are somewhat inspired
the game game with few instructions other than a tutorial that you can play upon starting the game and even that wasnt all that intuitive to figure out
i guess this game would be a good diversion for a while
i havent tried the rest of the quottycoonquot games but i hope some of them are better than thisi bought this game because i collect mario games 
it wasnt really what i expected but proved to be a fungame
some parts of the game are kinda confusing but you get through them
if you like classic mario games this isnt one for you
if you like sidescrollingwario sorta puzzle games this game is great
the bosses are pretty unique and some are pretty hard to beat
over all a fun wario gameit is difficult to give a review for this product because it does one thing and one thing onlyprotect your gameboy advance games
i consider these essential to keeeping your games in good working order because your bag might get banged around possibbly damaging the tiny game carts
these protect it from glitchcausing dust scrapes on the label and any other damage possible damage resulting from usebut the problem i have is that i have to spend extra money the games themselves are expensive enough to buy these cases when they should be included with the games
nintendo has nothing to gain from these cases being sold they are not manufactured by nintendo so why not give them to buyers so they can protect their games
i hope they consider including these with future gamesi cant open them
these are very hard to reopen after theyve been closed
however they seem to be the only gba game cases on the market
hmmmi could finished this as soon as i was given it since i started playing it straight away but my boyfriend had other ideas
i managed to get to the fifth level i think before this arm came over my shoulder and switched it over
the next time i tried to play it could i get past the fat police guy who had a gun
nooooooooooo
and who are we blaming for thati think i definitely prefer beatemup games or racing but im rubbish at them to any other cos if youre in a seriously bad mood then you get to take all your frustrations out on this
i didnt use the special move button much  to be honest i forgot about it a lot  but it wasnt really necessary as some simple punches were enough to get rid of the bad guys
some sure took a little longer but they will eventually diewhat i do find bad with these games is the bad guys rarely change
most of them are easy to dispose of and it gets slightly boring when they come at you constantly
i hated the guys who looked like chavs ok so you americans arent gonna know that name  guys who wear hooded tops hang around street corners think theyre hard just to generalise it with names like jay  billy i think
they were just too quick to move about for me as i found it really difficult to move up or down as the bad guys normally went the opposite wayi did manage to get to the last level of this game but unfortunately got a game over before getting very far
i could have finished it on my first try given half a chance though
i enjoyed the game squealing every time i killed a bad guy although it does get slightly repetitive
and i liked playing as cody
he looked good in those jeansi already owned the super nintedo version
so i was hesitant to pick this one up
this review is mostly directed to those who have the same question i did
is it differant enough to warrent the extra money
whats differant from the snes versiontheres cut scenes between the character you play and each of the bosses talking smack to eachotherthe music has been tweaked
its still mostly recognizable but very differantboss names now reflect the names they had in the arcadetheres a new pickup item that allows for temporary invulnarabilitythere are secrets to be unlocked for destroying bad guys street fighter alpha versions of guy and cody number of lives select stage select and other such thingsgraphics have also been tweaked slightlywhere as the snes version only threw three or four baddies at you at a time the gba version will positively swarm you unless youre set on easy levelmost importantly they added the industrial area level that was missing in the original snes version and of course they have guy which many people missed the first timewhats the sameits still the same game
its still cody haggar and guy slugging it out through the same characters through the same levels going for the same goalthe characters that used to be women in the arcade and turned into guys in the home version are still guys in this versionso is it worth getting if you already have the snes version
not really
if you missed out on the snes version id definetaly get it
portabilitys nice and its an over all good gamebut the only thing this really has over the snes version is the inclusion of the industrial area guy and the alpha versions of guy and cody
nice additives but probably not worth the  if you already have it on sneswelcome to the world of sia warrior princess
a side scrolling animated adventure as you of course are lady sia on a mission saving hostages collecting diamonds and going against the bad guys of your castle realm
keep in mind because this is an animated type game these bad guys are bears with swords rouge mice giant bee men and so on
the bad guys also number in the s and you can only slash them so it gets very boring and tedious
the game is solid it has a rich plot for kids to follow easily and between levels is a very good animated story to show whats happening
the animation is incredible but it looks like your watching a cartoon when you play disney cartoonish
which may shut out older players along with the fact that the game is quite easy to play and get the hang of jump and slash thats it
because of that fact it gets very tough on the thumbs
ouch
bottom line is fantastic for children but then for older players please skip itmediocre game at best
the controls are clumsy and it has a very strong halffinished feel
bosses range from childish to mind bending as do the levels
good animation thats difficulf to see like most gba games in low light runofthemill story
music is fun to listen to though
however you can play the game in german so thats a plus
all in all dont buy if youre a heavy gamer but not bad for little kids and people who dont know betterextermination is a game that lets you kill monsters and play as us special forces
you play as dennis a man apart of a special forces team that comes to discover a underground base of some sort
the base is inhabited by horrorful creatures and monsters that you will have to facethe game is pretty fun its something to play if you are tired of playing games like resident evil or silent hill
it offers pretty interesting puzzles and a pretty cool weapon
yet like every great game it has its pros and conspros  the controls are great and it is easy to move around
cutscenes are cool and the voice acting is very well done meaning their lips actually move to the words they say even though you have one gun which is one con you find different attachments to put on you machine gun
ex
shotgun flamethrower knife grenade launcher the enemies are cool looking and detailed
the key items and puzzle items are easy to located as long as you know what your doing the ending is fantastic
cons  sometimes the number of enemies in each room can bad they can gang up on you and kill your guy which wiill piss you off
when trying to aim the gun the aim can sometimes be clunky and hard to find a enemy to shoot
the game has only a few invisible walls
even though getting attachments is a pro it sucks that you have only the machine gun as you main weapon have i already told you that the enemies can piss you off
lol oh yeah i forgetoverall the game is a good choice if you are getting bored of playing other horror games like re or silent hill
yet if you had to choose between re or this game i recommend getting re first then getting this later in timei actually have attempted to finish this game twice and i may give it a third try
there is something compelling about the game but yet it has so many flaws that advancing in the game seems more like work than like fun
for one thing theres a lot of tasks that must be performed in order to advance to the next stage  typical of this type of game but the tasks in this game seem to be laborious rather than simply challenging or fun
and as other reviewers have criticized here its just way too easy to die in this game  not from anything you really did wrong but because of poor camera angles and touchy controls
and i really hate the one rifle with the multiple attachments
i much prefer to just have different weapons with a shooteradventure game  shotgun rifle pistol etc
not all in one weapon with confusing attachments where you must constantly go to the menu to change attachmentsone of the most annoying aspects of this game is when you are moving down a dark corridor the only way that you can see what is in front of you is to point your rifle with the flashlight attachment in front of you
this makes it impossible to move through some areas fast
plus there isnt a lot of ammo for some sections which means you just end up running away from enemies  which works way too much of the time
i have played quite a few of these types of adventure games now and i must say that this is the worst voice acting of any game ive played
absolutely dreadful  seriously
the inflection and timing is so off it makes you wonder if these people are actual english speakers
or perhaps the japanese staff that made the game were standing over their shoulders telling them how to say or pronounce the lines in englishhahahaand the voice actor for the main character sounds like hes either  or gay  and this is a marine right
i do like the sound effects for the game
it definitely has a creepy feel to it
the graphics are not good enough to make it scary  the graphics are pretty subpar but this was a  release  but its creepy nonetheless
however despite all this the game is not a total flop  but it gets tiresome to complete because it always felt like i was having to do some particular set of tasks just to move on in the game rather than enjoying the journey of the game itself
perhaps one day ill go onto finish it but then again maybe notthis game eliminates boredom and allows one to enjoy their ps machine
this game is fun and interesting
enjoy have fun gamingwow what a disapointment amazing graphics boring game
if you like games with realistic graphics this is a game for you if you like action packed games buy soldier of fortune or  they are much better choices
this is one of the most disapointing games i have ever played with so much hype for itgraphics are pretty gameplay is rather droll
try deus ex insteadway too many cutscenes and babble not nearly enough game play
its ultimately very boringmgs sol is a good game no doubt about it
the new abilities that you havepeeking and shooting around corners guard captures and body hiding make for a more realistic experience when coupled with the really good graphics
however as many have already have noted you only get to play as snake for about the first hour
after that you play as raiden a rookie foxhound operative who knows very little about the operation that he is engaged in
actually raiden is somewhat of a dork
i mean here he is up to his eyeballs in ak toting baddies and he allows his girfriend to  call him and ask those lame quotwhat are you thinking aboutquot type questions
sheesh
anyway everyone assumes that snake was killed yeah right
during the first chapter of the game
eventually you find that he is in fact alive and posing as a navy seal along with our old geeky pal otacon
later we also find that otacons sister is more annoying than her brother and the cyborg ninja isnt gray fox back from the dead but a russian woman named olga who has hairy armpits
eventually otacons sister buys the farm ocelot gets away again and col campbell turns out to be a figment of raidens imagination
all of this culminates in a goofy ending that makes us all go quotwhat was thatquot if i gave the story away im sorry
butthe good features of the game are again great graphics intense and for the most part realistic action and of course the need for stealth
now the bad even more so than what i described before
the cutscenes are very long and you tend to get confused quickly
the story is somewhat preachy and you get a little tired of it
i mean if you wanted a happy little world where everyone lives in a log cabin and picks flowers all day then why are you playing a game where quietly decapitating dudes with a silenced  socom is so important
the ending was rather vague and the overall plot was a little on the lame side
however metal gear veterans will probably like this game
the controls are the same as the psxs mgs with a few small changes and raiden does take some getting used to
but i guess thats life
anyway this games good outweighs its bad and overall it is an enjoyable game to play
and as for snakes mullet maybe he has a  camero and really digs listening to billy ray cyrusmetal gear solid  sons of liberty is the sequel to the innovative original mgs game that appeared on the playstation one
even though the game is quite fun i probably prefer the original
heres why first of all the amount of cutscenes in this game are incredibly high
id say you have twice as many cutscenes to deal with in this game compared to the original
true these cutscenes might end up telling a good story if you actually have the patience to watch them all but it doesnt really excite me on a personal overall video game experience level
years from now the only thing i will remember about sons of liberty will be all the cutscenes i had to sit through or skip if i chose to do so
to make matters worse many times im interrupted with spoken conversations during critical moments where i really cant afford to be interrupted such as during a moment when im trying to find the best way to eliminate a guard blocking an important path
i cant be distracted during these moments and thats a shame
this was never a problem in the original sons of liberty is just about the same length as the previous mgs game if you choose to skip all the cutscenes that is
im serious
a sequel is always supposed to be a longer and more interesting game
however this is not the case with the metal gear solid series
i can beat this game in  hours and  minutes
i can beat the original in  hours and  minutes
so its only about  minutes longer overall
im not happy about that at all the very reason the original metal gear solid is a much better game overall is because of this the boss fights
in sons of liberty you only have  or  boss fights total and none of them are very creative or interesting
whats up with that
one fight has you shooting between crates trying to locate and eliminate the enemy
its fun but not that great
certainly not sequelworthy in my opinionanother boss fight has you running from the first to second level shooting stingers at the enemy
this is sort of fun
another boss fight has snake diffusing bombs
i dont particulary care for this one because for the majority of the first half of the game it seems like youre going around making sure bombs dont go off in certain places
i dont want to continue doing the same thing during a boss fight
it also seems like theres an exceptionally long period between the first and second boss fightin the original you had up to  or  boss fights and they were more creative than the ones here too
you had a helicopter battle a sniper fight where you had to guide missiles through a winter forest to find the sniper a battle with a large army tank a fight with a ninja a really fun fight with a huge mechanical robot where you were required to take down the big thing with stinger missiles and more
the boss fights in sons of liberty come up short and feel uninspired compared to the original metal gear solidhowever the one thing this game does better is that the guards you encounter are much smarter this time around
you cant just walk by them they will easily see and kill you if you dare to attempt that
this game encourages you to find the correct way to deal with each of the guards that happen to be in your way
sometimes you have to stun them and drag them out of the way because other guards might walk by and spot their dead bodies and then suddenly a search for you will go out which would then require you to find a way to get out of there and fast
smarter enemies in this game are certainly a nice welcome and probably the only thing about the game worth mentioningsome people say that walking around in firstperson view makes this game better than the original metal gear solid but i dont buy that because it seems like every game nowadays has a firstperson view
the original was uniquestick with the first metal gear solid game if you are given a choice between the two
its more exciting and thankfully doesnt feature an overkill of cutscenes in all the wrong places
thats where sons of liberty fails unfortunately
too many unnecessary interruptions
still its a pretty good game
just not the major improvement we were led to believethis sequel to one of the best selling ps games left me a little dissapointed due to that fact that the cutscenes are longer than the actual gameplay there are parts where i cant figure out what the hell is going on and i know alot about mgs
if your looking for good gameplay get the first one if you dont already have it
arsenal gear was much easier in this game even though there are  of them
 metal gear was harder in the first one
however i will point out this
the graphics in this game are breathtaking
you will see many improvements in this game
you can also zoom in during cutscenes
no point to doing it just something hideo kojima added in there
a out of this game begins with some serious promise and some good old nostalgia with my good buddy snake
i enjoyed playing as raiden for the most part
i was just pissed off that i didnt get to play as snake more instead of playing as raiden like  of the timepros
the story and the graphics were really great
the characters had some serious depth to them and you were introduced to some old bad guys and good guys as wellcons
there was a lot less boss fights and longer cutscenes in this game and i didnt enjoy that at all
you dont get to play as snake that much
this game should have been called metal gear raiden
ughh
overall a fun game but i wanted to play as snake moreoverall this game was entertaining and worth playing just to keep up with the series
also this game has one of the most epic boss fights in gaming history
a sword fight with your adoptive father
enough saidgame on my fellow gamersif i may quote solid snake from the end of this game quotwhat the hell
quoti dont even know where to start when reviewing this game
my friends and i just beat it and it took us  hours
but about  of those hours were a giant movie that had one of the trippiest stories ever
metal gear solid  started out awesome with snake infiltrating a tanker trying to gain information about metal gear much like the other metal gear games but then the story gets really weirdfor those of you who enjoy regular american military games stop playing after you beat all of the tanker mission because after you beat that this game turns into some weird japanimation manga story with some messed up twists and dialogue that totally seems like the plot did not translate well from japanese at all
your are not even snake for most of the game youre some guy named raiden and no one tells you what the heck is going on
you just do what needs to be done then the plot takes another messed up twist and you do something elsethe story even does some crazy stuff like tell you about morals and family values
at one time while you are playing as raiden and walking around naked trying to kill guys your contact starts wigging out and saying crazy stuff
he even blatantly told us to turn off the game wed been playing for too long and we might damage our eyes
quotwhat the hell
quotoh the game also made sure to tell us about the differences between killing in real life and in a video game
i have no idea why it did this since you spent most of the game watching a lot of computer generated movies rather than killing peopledont get me wrong when you actually do get to play the game the game play and graphics rule
too bad you only get to actually play for  or  hours and less than half that time you play as snake
i cant believe they even tried to pass this game off as metal gear
this should be a metal gear parallel story sort of like vr missionsi gave this game  stars simply because the beginning where you are actually solid snake sneaking around the tanker trying to find the new metal gear is really awesome
that portion of the game deserves  stars
yet the other  of the gamemovie deserves only  to  stars for being so weird
i mean you dont even play as snake for half the game
that would be like playing a legend of zelda game as some new character that weve never heard of before
i am still in shock at how dumb the story sounded as the game progressedif you are truly a metal gear fan you might not enjoy this game and find it too trippy and weird for your taste but if you like roleplaying games with crazy twists that dont make sense in the end buy this game nowi may have a limited view of this game after beating it on easy the first time but the simple truth about this game whether you agree with anything i said above or not is that most of the game is completed through computer generated animation and movie sequences
you really dont get much gameplay out of this game
sure its dvd video and cool and all but if i wanted a dvd i would have rented a dvd
also at one point in the game the president of the united states of america grabs the main character in the crotch and says so you are a man
now they may do that on some weird japanese cartoons but here in america the president should be a no nonsense guy and not some crotchgrabbing sissy who sells out the country
what the helli bought this game expecting to play solid snake as the returning hero
instead i get solid snake as the introductory hero and a snot nosed rookie who has a very over possessive girlfriend to play the rest of the game
the controls were better than the first but the story line seemed choppy and not well put together
i also felt like i was watching a movie more than playing the game
when i bypassed most of the cut scenes it was a short gamei had a hard time getting into this game
for some reason it felt more like work than the distracting fun experience i was looking for
gameplay seemed convoluted and i had a hard time controlling the characters point of view
weapon selection and use wasnt intuitive or comfortable
the overhead radar view of enemies didnt make sense to me
this game just wasnt very much fun for me to play a disappointmentwhen the playstation s launch date was announced so was a sequel to metal gear solid which was on the original playstation
a year of waiting brought us metal gear solid  sons of liberty
i have always had the opinion that metal gear would be better served as a movie and for the most part sons of liberty is mostly movie
the grpahics are outstanding and the gameplay is nicely done but there should have been more play and less movie
for periods of up to twenty minutes you are beaten over the head with movies and dialouge
the vioce acting is good but with such a good game engine why would you want to show all those pesky cutscenes
grant it you can skip them but you may find yourself not knowing what to do
the stealth element of metal gear  is outstanding
you can hide in everything from lockers to boxes
you will also find that the time when you are playing that metal gears camera is pretty helpful in most cases
sons of liberty is easier then the original playstaion game and does boast a better storyline
the question is does it have to much storyline
well i believe so
i enjoy playing this game but it is easy to get turned off by the semingly constant cutscenes
metal gear solid  is a solid game but it is not as great as all the hype you hear
undoubtably this is not a game of the year contender when compared to the masterpiece that is grand theft auto iii even though they are different types of games
this is dissopointing when you think about how long playstation fans have been urning for an awardwinning sequel
the bottom line is the gameplay is great once you learn it
once you wade through the movie you find a good game that is at least worth renting for the weekend or if not buying itmetal gear  is a game of many contrasts that i will discuss in this review
first lets start with the gameplay ive never been a huge fan of this franchise to begin with and while i do like how the game mixes things up some times by introducing different styles of play i have never found it that rewarding
i also think that the guards enemies are ridiculously stupid i mean you can actually stand about ten feet in front of a guy and he wont notice you
how are you supposed to feel good about your stealthing abilities if the guards are that stupid
dont get me wrong i do like this game in fact i liked this game in some ways that apparently other gamers didnt
which brings me to the next part of the review the story the word on this game is that it has a bad story now i dont think the story is the problem my main grip was with the script
i thought the script was at most times just plain lame
the stuff with raidens girlfriend rose is especially horrible and comes pretty close to ruining the game completely
its just so utterly bad the dialog seems to have been taken from a romance novel that was written by some pubescent teenage girl
but beyond the script i thought the overall story was actually pretty good
that said lets get to the final part of my review which is the graphics mgs  probably shines best in this category
i think the visuals are very good and this is coming from someone who is reviewing this game about a full year after its original release
the shadow and lighting effects are quite impressive and the character models are great i also appreciated the amount of detail put into generally every aspect of the levels
my only real complaint about the graphics is with were you spend most of your time in the game the off shore treatment plant
in my opinion the tanker level which you start on while playing as solid snake was much more appealing
i found the plant to be a little bland quite frankly and also somewhat boring
it seems to me that the developers spent a lot more time on the much shorter tanker portion of the game and kind of skimped out on the vastly longer lasting treatment plant part and im not just talking about the graphics ether im talking about virtually every aspect of the gameto some up my general opinion of this videogame i think id say that its a lot like a big hollywood blockbuster it had a lot of hype surrounding it that it probably didnt live up to it had great special effects backed by a questionable script and it defiantly made a lot of money
also like a big hollywood movie theres probably a lot of better stuff out there that youre going to miss
but that said i still enjoyed this title and cant say that i wouldnt go out and bye the next one
and there will be a next one i guess as a man who appreciates a quality well rounded game it has become sort of a guilty pleasurethree starsthis game is great for the most part but dont listen to people who say for you to buy it
its better to rent the game twice to decide if you like it ok i like these types of games but i feel that metal gear solid and hitman ii were  games that didnt live up to all the hypehowever i have to be fairthis release of metal gear solid ii is a pretty cool game way better than the previous mgs game and it offers the player some really cool moves and cool gameplayno doubtbut i would have like to have spent more time playing the actual game than watching all the long drawnout movies throughout the game
it gets old really fast
every  minutes youre watching yet another video clip or moviejeesh
while not my favorite militarytype ps game its a decent game fairly cool to play but doesnt really deserve a star rating in my viewmgs is one of the best selling games in existence because of the type of game that is it
this is a counterespionage game that relies more on your ability to conceal yourself than running around the place blasting the hell out of anything that moves which you can do too if you want
for this reason the game becomes very realistic and the graphics and sound are all too genuine and do not make you feel anything less than actually being there doing what the character is up to at that point in time
the world that you are immersed in has rain sun and smoke and bad guys patrolling the area
you have both hyperrealistic st person views and a third person overhead view as you run around the place
the amount of moves and their combinations are staggering and the actual movement of the character is unparalleled by any game of it type
watch as you throw your character over a railing and move along the pipe with your hands while dangling over a huge ocean
let go and watch in horror as you fall to your death
amazing
the plot is coherent and there is plenty of story to boot but the game design itself is terrible terrible terriblemgs is by no means a disaster but unfortunately tries too hard to be a movie and less a game
the truth is that the vast majority over  of the game is spent watching video clips instead of gaming which is really what we want to do and is the reason why we bought mgs in the first place
there are so many video sequences in this game that all of the above suddenly crashes back down to the reality of holding a controller and watching the television screen as some video plays itself out
sure you can skip it but then two minutes later you find yourself back holding the controller and watching yet another video argghhh the other two major disappointments is that the game only takes place in one location  an oil rig but it is huge
the other is that there are far too many calls and dialogues to go through on your communicator
fans of the series may also not like the fact that the main protagonist in the first game has been replaced  however this is acceptable and does not detract from the experiencein short this is one of the most hyperreal games that you will ever play  the graphics are nothing short of stunning and the character moves are out of this world  but it is all marred by the terrible amount of video clips that you have to sit through
in short this detracts from the overall gaming experience and you will soon get bored with it
play mgs  only   if you have the time and the patients to sit through a three minute video every other minute of game playeveryone raves that this is the greatest thing since sliced bread
uhmm no
this game has great gameplay but gameplay is only part of the game
the rest is dominated by a horrible movie
when i first popped it in i was all excited
trudging through the fake weapons the plot of characters i could care so little the tired excuses to show artwork just zapped all that
the first two hours literally consists of  minutes of play
no joke or exaggeration
of course thats only the tip of the iceberg
there are so many long drawn out interruptions that it ruined the rhythm of what would have been a good though not great gameduring the few interludes where you can actually play you get to see a good game
even though i wish the movements and game was faster it still combines many elements of platform adventure and first person shooter ups
you have to use stealth accuracy thought and quick reflexes to pass this game
the very base of gameplay makes it enjoyablei do have some troubles with the controls
first off and this is picky the x button should never ever be the abort button when it comes to the front end
every other game on earth uses it as the enter button to navigate menus but not this game
there are so many times where i was about to save it only to be aborted for pressing x  also swimming controls are just plain backwards and clumsy
i struggled through the swimming scenes purely because of this
also there are other things like youd be walking and all of sudden youd be flat against a wall just because you turned away from the wallthe general feel i got from the game was that all the effort was made to make it a movie and then add the game as a side note
there are only two parts a ship and a large complex
the ship takes only an hour to finish and the complex consists of about  structures that are pretty much similar
thats it
no complex environment no contrasting views
basically  percent of the game play takes place in gray metal roomsprosgreat gameplaycombines action stealth and puzzlesconsawkward controls x button swimmingtoo many moviesyou will yell shut up many times at your tvlack of variation in environmentstime  hoursfrustration high mostly from the interruptionsi hated the game on game boy color i played it over and over and i never could seam to beat it but ill give the gae a fighting chancei have mixed feelings about this game
perhaps i should note here that i played and very much enjoyed the original armada
in some ways i think the sequel improves on it where in others the developers seem to have taken a backward stepon the progress side there are many new units and two completely new races species  yes i had to look that number up and the cardassians
the new units generally comprise an assault ship of some sort two new frigateclass ships and one battleship
for example the federation gets the galaxy as its battleship aegian and sabre class ships as frigates and the iwojima class as an assault ship
this gives you quite a lot of choices for ships other than the originals which are all here and looking exactly the same as they used to
however you can play this exactly like you played old armada and that will work just finenaturally there are also a bunch of new special abilities though the superweapons remain very much the same as they were in armada  you can also change the camera to a d movement mode though it is still quite difficult to control your forces from this perspective
the graphics have been updated and generally tweaked for the better
there are also the new resources metal and latinum harvestable from planets and nebulae respectively
planets can also be used for colonization if you need more crewnow some things i really wish they had left alone or at least put less emphasis on
in general the new d camera mode is little more than a good show
its still too hard to move things around in it for it to be practical in combat
sometimes ships will move close or farther away from your isometric perspective camera appearing incredibly big or small and having to move up or down to attack
this can be rather disorientingwhile the new ships are cool as i mentioned earlier they arent really necessary
also the old ships havent changed at all
you would think they might have moved some things around such as making the defiant and akira higher up on the food chain but they havent changed a thing
defensive platforms shoot far slower than they used to but their hull can actually take damage now
also you cant just charge a starbase with a lot of ships even really powerful ones because even though they wont take down your shields they will kill crew off like nuts
not sure how or why that happenswarp
i dont think i need to say anything more than this and if you dont understand you havent seen it happen in the game
it looks ridiculous isnt realistic and the game could really do without it
at faster than the speed of light you would think your fleets would get to their targets instantly but that would be rather cheap so they just go at about double their impulse speed
you lose shields in warp so you can get screwed up on the way if you arent careful
also ships sometimes jump to warp to engage an enemy just outside range
it can get extremely disorienting and looks totally retarded
i hope they patch it out altogetherin general i think armada  is a good deal of fun and more or less an improvement over its predecessor
its just that i was hoping it would be a really big improvement and it simply isnt
in fact in some ways i think its actually not as good
alas it is difficult to live up to gamers expectations of a sequel to a truly great title and armada  did not live up to minei should start off this review by stating that i am huge shadowman fan
i went so far as playing and beating all formats of the original shadowman because i loved the extremely horrificand macabre storylineso i have to admit that i was a little dissapointed that the content of shadowman econd coming seemed a little watered downwalking through the adventure of econd coming reminded me more of a slightly darker version of zeldarather than walking through the demonicsometimes satanicblood coatedon the verge of apocolypse hell of the first installmentof course if the first one freaked you out too much or youre an obsessive censorship buffthen this might be a good thingi myself was dissapointedthe game is far from a failure though as it was great to have mikenettie and jaunty back on my tv screenthis game takes placea few years after michal leroishadowman destroyed the infamous demon legion and saved the world from apocolypseas the game progresses we learn that several diffrent cults of demon worshippers and demons themselves are preparing to ressurect their leaderi guess legion was just a general or something
from the pit aka hellagain another example of how i think this game was censoredto destroy the worldwhich was found out by information of former nypd wheelchairbound cop named thomas deaconremeber deacons file that nettie gives you in the first shadowman gameyeahthats where he comes from
again i have to stress that while playing econd comingi just didnt ever get the feel of it being on the verge of omega as i did in part oneand there was never a sense of terror simply by moving around in certain parts of the gamehow many hairs on the back of your neck stood up when you were stumbiling through the darkness of the birdmans tenant in shadowman 
there was nothing like thatin econd comingwhile the voice acting was still good in econd comingwith the return of the same actors from the original who played michalshadowman and jauntyi love that accent
it wasnt as goodfirst of all because the actress who played the sexymiss cleoishjamican accent of the voodoo mambo nettie in part  was now replaced with someone else who wasnt nearly as convincingno accent mahn
wait a minutedid i just use sexy and miss cleo in the same sentence
i can only assume the reason why is because perhaps she died in real lifethe game opens up with in memeory of angela atikinson its the only reason that i could figure out being the fact that the same mike and jaunty actors returned
alsomichal deacons voice soundedwellkinda stupidnot that a new yorker accent is badhes an nypd officer
but the actor sounded more like a guy who was trying to have a new yorker accent and failing very badlyanother let downjaunty only has four scenesonly four scenes
hes hiliariouswhy only four scenesfans of the original shadowman will recogonize the voice of the greater demon in the opening cinema as the voice of legionwhile the voice acting wasnt as goodthe gameplay rocked
a keypart in it allweapons automatically locked on enemiesand with mike being able to hold a gun in each hand
wellyou can already imagineinventory was also alot more manangablebut whati hated about the controls was the fact that r and l buttons were used as your punchfire buttons which took awhile to get used tothe only real annoyance i had with the control was that every time you fell into waterblood the weapon you had equipped would become transparent even after you switch handsin short youwould have to take off the wepon completely and then reequip itto get it to register in the gamemaking it an extreme pain when you fought the demon boss in russia over a nice big lake of ice waterthe game was great in showing the needed relationship between micheal leroi and shadowman as you can switch back and forth between the two personas with a pocketwatchmicheal of course being the braunhes been pumping up sense the ps daysand shadowman being the magicbut neither of the two being independant of the otherin fact you need to switch over from the other in order to complete the gamei think the soundtrack of econd coming improved over the original onewhile perhaps failing in the scarethehellouttayatwisted music of asylumbut victorious in other generesfrom the celticchanting female voice of the ireland stage to the drumthumping voodoo beats ot the duppie village in deadsidemaybe im being too harsh on this titlebut its just that i loved the first title so much that i expected the sequel to be perfect instead of just goodif youre a huge shadowman fan like methen go ahead and buy this onebut expect to be a little dissapointedfor an older d fighter last blade does have surprising depth in terms of gameplay
last blade also sports a cast of interesting characters with a huge array of impressive looking attacks at their disposalwith that said there are a few things that prevented last blade from being great
the first thing you notice is the frame rate
this game is choppy by todays standards so compared to street fighter iii third strike and guilty gear x last blade looks downright archaic
the other minor problem is the control its not as responsive as most fighting fans would like
even when compared to its older snk cousins in the samurai shodown spirits series last blades control isnt as crisp and the games quotphysicsquot seem a little light or quotfloatyquotif you own madden  for the ps theres no need to get this
the only things better in this are the graphics which have improved only a little and the option of saving during the middle of a game
the very slow load times makes this game almost unplayable but if you dont mind the load times and dont have the prequel get this one or rent itmadden  is an improvement over  for sure and while it is not exactly a brand new product it is a very polished version of the first one
the graphics and other bells and whistles are great the animation are very realistic and the weather effects really cool
the running game is solid and the custome features deep and customizable
what is the aforementioned flaw
the passing game is infuriating
if you play on any level above rookie like most players you will find passing to be quite difficult with even the best receivers dropping passes or unable to get open
quotbut its realisticquot  you say
well if i wanted to throw  and an interception per game id go play myself
video games are about allowing you to play like joe montana not joe schmoe
to add insult to injury the computer will absolutely pick you appart at least  drives per game where nothing you do will stop them from completing  passes in a row en route to a td
even with a  rated secondary the worst nfl teams will still carve you up for  yards plus
the computer actually seems to quotcheatquot whereby you will stuff their offense for  of the game and then they will score at will to get back into the game making incredible catches having slow wr positively burn  rated cb etci recommend this game but i have a feeling nfl k may surpass itoverall this is a very good game
but i give it onyl  stars because there is really not much difference between this and madden  for the psi was really expecting a lot more out of the latest version of the madden series from ea sports
if you own madden  for the ps and are considering buying the  version rent it first
there arent very many significant improvements over   the  biggest that ive noticed thus far are that the wide receivers have more catch animations this year
youre not getting the same pirouette that was the standard catch motion for the receivers in the nd thing i really like is that you can now save a game in the middle
this has come in very handybut some of the things in  and many other recent selections from ea sports signify at least to me that ea sports is resting on its laurels returning punts is nearly impossible
in order to do so ive had to pull a tackle off the line of scrimmage and run him back to block for my guy
the guys on the outside blocking the gunners simply give up
they just let the defenders on through
 gameplay needs some attention
i am lucky to register one sack a game but the computer wil routinely sack my qb  times a game
this is in spite of the fact that my lines are rated much higher than the computers linesthose are just a few things
the madden series continues to dominate the arena of football games for consoles but ive begun to think this is by default
i am a fan and madden is certainly worth owning but i will be buying nfl k for the ps to compre the this game is of course awesome because well its madden
madden football games have always been the best except  amp  on snes
madden k has the best graphics decent gameplay franchise mode is the best but the biggest problem with this and every other madden on ps and ps is the passingthe passing is extremely difficult on every level except rookie
even as the allmadden team playing an nfl europe team my best receivers could never burn their dbacks which had pathetic ratings of  or lower
if there is a defender within  yards of the receiver and the receiver makes the catch he will drop it
about  of the time to be exact
even if he catches it and moves upfield which is more of a fumble he will be hit and the ball pops out
it doesnt matter what reciever rice keyshawn rod smith anyone and everyone drops the ball nearly everytime they are hitalso the computer can be shut down for  of the game but then at random cannot be stopped no matter what you do
they simply run right through any defense you throw at it
the computer seems to cheat on many other occasions with crappy recievers that can burn allpro corners and so onanyway its still good but i much prefer the college game by ea sportswhile i liked sonic adventure i was not very keen on its sequel or sonic heroes
the blue hedgehog and his pals simply do not belong in a d world and i was more than eager to get this game as it is a return to good old days of sonics previous incarnations on the genesiseverything you would have liked about the old sonic is back
the level designs the powerups the cool music and gameplay that nextgen consoles lackedhowever fun the game is to play it doesnt have much replay value
there are secret entrances in every level to the special stage and i only found one of them
sorry but im not going to replay every level looking for the special stages
the special stages themselves are kinda hard and theres no way id be able to get through all of them
although turning into super sonic as a result of winning them would have been coolincluded on this cartridge is the chao garden
if you have a link cable to your gamecube and you have sonic adventure  or  you can transport your chao onto your gameboy and keep it as a sort of tamagochi
when transporting them a pipe will appear on both screens and suck them up and plop them down
its really quite cool and one of the few reasons to keep going back to the gamestill i will without a doubt be getting sonic advance  and  regardlessgraphics asound agameplay alasting appeal cthis game is a great game first off
the graphics are great but dont show all of what the game boy advance can do
second there arent that mant levels in the game and the game is very easy
i love the sonic series and i remember playing it on the genesis and dreamcast
only on this one i can get through the first  levels in about  minutes with no trouble while on the genesis versions i cant get past the fourth level
if you want a short game that you can beat in a really short amount of time or giving this to a small child you should try this
but if you have to decide super mario advance  is a much better pick
it has  levels and is one of the best games everafter playing games like quottheme parkquot i cant help but feel this game isnt very deep
theres no new buildings you can build over time no employees to hire all you have are dinosaurs that you can find by sending out an exploration teamthis may seem to give the game depth but its not the dinosaurs that people come to see its because of your advertisements
you can have one dinosaur for the whole game and it really wouldnt make a difference as long as you keep advertising and buy new buses to maintain the visitor growth you dont have to really do anythingright now ive been watching more than planning and actually doing anything
konami could have easily made a deeper more complex sim than this
sim city was done on the snes why not herei should start off by saying this game is okmost of the reason why it is rated ok or bad is because of the lack of a tutorialand the difficulty of the gamei do reccomend this game to any jp fanits not as fun as it could bebut overall its worth itecks vs sever is a nice little fps game for gbabut it does have its problemsthe graphics are okaybut the gameplay falls somewhat flatthe controls are pretty tough and takes awhile to get used totheres no way to jump in this gamewhich makes it pretty toughall you can do is duck downby pressing both l and r buttonsi found that to be a painthe game itself is also very hardat firstit dont seem too badbut by the third levelit gets very hardthere are some cool guns to pick up and usebut the eniemes are tough to get throughthere are health pickups as wellbut your health can get very low really fast with just a blast or two from a baddieoverallif you want a fps for your gbaid recommend thisonly if you love a good challengedont get me wrongi believe blizzard was ahead of its time with diablo and they usually are
the loot variety is pretty darn good for this game
i bought the game because i plan to get d and want to know the story
however it is very datedmovement graphics etc
not to say i didnt enjoy it but im spoiled ill admit it
once i got past that i was able to enjoy it
click awayi played this game years ago and always remembered that the cutscenes never played properly or at all
ive done a plethora of research on how to resolve the issue to no avail and even checked the official battlenet blizzard support site followed the steps and still frozen cutscenes
probably isnt a big deal to some but for me it is either all or nothing and unfortunately many pc games have the same problem to a certain extent including descent iii but the problems with this game are simply not fixable without having to invest in another computer made over ten years ago or dual boot with windows  or xp
such a shame my two centsfirst off all i have nothing bad to say about the game at all
diablo ii and its expansion were a blast about a decade and a half ago when i was playing it with my high school friends and now that im replaying it is still very good
butjust dont bother playing this on any modern age pc
seriously dont waste your timei should admit that i did get this to run on windows  following the tips on the blizzard website but it might as well not have worked at all
the frame rate skips caused by the windows s xp compatibility mode which is a joke if there ever was one made the game borderline unplayablethankfully i still had my old single core windows xp desktop in my basement
half an hour i was all set and yeah the game ran perfectly on that ancient thing
i dont know why i hung onto that computer probably because it was too old for anyone to be interested in usingbuying it but im glad i didlook i know this is a near fifteen year old game but despite being an old game it deserves much more than this
on top of that i had no problem getting the original diablo to play once i had the patch from blizzards website
youd think id have trouble with the older game but noanyways a great game but unless you have a spare computer from before the multicorewindows vista days i would just not bother
if you are interested to the point of paying money beyond the price of the game i would suggest finding an older rigwhat was i thinkingthe graphics are awful by todays standards
ah well
i have to get back to torchlight nowneeded it for my collection i have not played d when it came out
i like playing it once in a whiled has a lot of good features
the graphics and sound effects are great
the character development is better than any which i have ever seen i played adampd for the last twenty years and i think that d has developed a better character system
the game is divided into four acts five with expansion
the first three acts are fun challenging and not too hard
the fourth and fifth acts are just rediculously difficult
i find myself running my characters around in the third act in an attempt to beef them up only to still find them far too weak to stand up to the hordes of fartoodifficult monsters in the fourth actthe only reason i have even seen the fifth act is because i have some quothackedquot characters which are ultrapowerful one is a rd level paladin with about  hp and yes he has been killed on the hell difficulty levelthe difficulty goes to the extreme with the nightmare and hell difficulty levels and i dont know how anyone could ever beat them
a typical monster has over  hp and does hundreds of points of damage
at the same time the experience point demands for advancing levels becomes skyhigh
while the ammount you get for each monster becomes miniscule in compairisonall in all a good game that needs to have the monsters toned down a bitthis expansion pack adds a lot more to the game than the previous two and combined with the other two makes for an amazing and full gameplay experience
the addition of the downtown lots gives your sims a kind of second life and a new way to meet friends or hang out with old buddiesthe new social interactionsand there are a lot of themadd tons of humor and cool to an already very slick title
want to send your sims to a nightclub to dance the night away and watch dj z buffer spin
want to hang out in a bar and play pool
want to hang out by the pinball machines and meet new people
or have a picnic
or take a date downtown to try on some new lingerie
you can do all this and more
this expansion delivers at least as much as it promised
its hilarious its engaging its a hell of a lot of funbut its also broken
when you install hot date if your cdrom drive can even read the disc certain items from livin large if you have it will disappear completely sims will get stuck sitting on the couch sims will forget to go to work any music playing downtown will become garbled the game will crash or fail to recognize the cd and a number of other glitches major and minor will have you pulling your hair outyou definitely want to get this expansion but you should keep your eye on the sims web site and wait until there is a patch announced
its incredibly frustrating to see the promise of a good game but be basically unable to play
i wish they hadnt rushed it out the door because now i feel like im still waiting for it to come out even after ive bought itafter installing this expansion pack a new area will be added to your neighborhood
now you can go to downtown alone or with someone accompanying you there
you can do some shopping on clothes magazines and other stuff like flower and teddy bears
you can have your dinner there and do lots of thingsto go there call a taxi using your wallmounted or regular phone
a few minutes later a yellow taxi come in front of your house and you or maybe with someone else may go to downtown and have some fun there
going to downtown is a good way to raise the relationship meter and buying some things for your own needyour relationship will also get more complicated with this expansion pack installed
you will discover new ways in interacting with people around you
this could be a good point if you like to try new things on your character in the game
in the other hand this may become a pain for them who are having characters with not much time available for interacting with people in the neighborhoodoverall this expansion pack is worthy for the sims series fani know that the idea behind the sims is to challenge you to make a family survive in a quotrealquot world sort of situation
i loved the first sims plus the two addons after that
with hot date that sims are finally allowed to leave their houses and go downtown
they can meet many people in these downtown areas at parks resteraunts and stores
the game is definately fun in the aspect that you can go downtown to talk and hang out but that is where the challenge startsin the previous sims games as well as this one relationships are needed to help you stay happy move ahead in your job etc
but in quothot datequot the relationship aspect is twice as hard to build
you can fall in love with somone in the morning and by the end of the day they wont even like you
that is the drawback of this game plus friends are twice as hard to make and take twice as longwhile you can go on dates downtown the people are a lot harder to get to know
it is definately more challenging than the first simsadds but for anyone looking for a leisurly gameplay will not get it in quothot datequot
it is fun
but due to the fact that the stress level and difficulty of it is much higher it lowers the funit was a great extra to add
it only makes the whole game a little too quotlovingquot it starts to get annoyingi had a bunch of sims like my friends and family and while my character was in town next door i saw my moms character and my friends character kissing
i screamed and ripped the power cable outnot for the younger peepsthis game was definitely fun when i first got it
i could make them kiss all different ways
i love the fiery kiss
and all the downtown stuff makes it even better especially when you want a new outfit or something like that
it took so much work however to make the sims like each other
now they have two relationship bars one is the regular bar that goes up really fast and then the other one is like the lifetime relationship one and it takes me almost an entire day for two sims to really like each otherafter playing for a while i got bored with the downtown area
everything was the same and i definitely think they could add a lot more stuff like places to buy cuisine food and stuff like that and maybe even a buffet
sure its fun to play with at first but after a while its the same thing over and over
and the mall is nothing like a real mall kinda lameif you are a hopeless romantic though you might like this expansion pack
be warned though it freezes up so much that it gets annoying
also this new interest inventory makes it even harder for people to get along
but if you like a challange go for itone of my first complaints about the sims was that it wasnt very complex
relationships had a base level they went to their jobs and entertainment was calling someone and inviting them over or watching tv
livin large gave them more things tp play with house party gave my sims something to do besides watch tv and hot date fills in everything you could possibly wanthot date can complicate things
instead of meeting another sim talking with them complimenting them talking some more and then hugging them to make a family friend you now have two meters on your relationship scale
you have the long term and daily meters which means it takes longer to make good friends or fall in love
this isnt necessarily a bad thing it means you have more work before your sims are good friends or lover
the added abilities are nice too they can shake hands or wave to greet someone theres a bunch of goodbye options and theyre no longer limited to just talking they can talk about interests or just gossip
also sims have interests so they can find common ground with other sims
it would be nice if you could pick each sims interest but there doesnt seem to be an option for thatthis is definitely a more adult game as theres intimate kisses and hugs theres a cuddle option and a blond bombshell in downtown
the downtown is interesting theres a lot for a sim to do and you can change it to look however you wantoverall the new complexity and a seriously long load time make this my least favorite addon
i dont mind some of the added complexity but this is going way overboard
after a while it gets tiring to try and keep friendships just so and to invite someone downtown for fun
it takes the realism a step too far from being a game or toy as maxis calls it where you can direct things and makes it more of a realism simulator although the sims dont seem to learn or get smarter as the days goes onthe load time really bothers me with livin large and house party my sims take close to  minutes to load without viewing the introduction
also when i create a new neighborhood and check out the downtown it takes several minutes to create it
my computer isnt all that fast at ghz but its still irritating to have to wait as long as i do for it to load especially if im only checking something or get called away from my computerwell madden  is all in all good but not great
first off the ai stinks thats it
everything about the ai is bad first the game plays out too slow a   quarters goes out for a long time
then its impossible to stop the defensive pass plays there are many consectutive completions in your game
but thats the only gripe i have about this game the rest is really good
i forgot the commentary stinks dont have pat summeral do the commentary he is dull and boring thank god  version has micheals in the game
the rookie difficulity is too easy and the pro diffuclity is too hard
on rookie i won with ers  vs saints it is good to win but the pro is too difficult the lions beat me  great graphics and real live gamplay butea fix the ai you would probably have  stars if you did thatif youre looking for a realistic football sim definitly do not buy madden 
the pass defense is way out of whack
the computer will complete about  of its passes against you and complete all of its long bombs
i dont know how on earth ea let this game get out
and every te is a superstar catching  passes a game  the screen pass is now impossible to do
half the time the ball lands in front of the player and even if you player does catch it you  are very lucky to get back to the line of scrimmage
the computer cant run the ball worth jack
the game play is so unbalanced in this wayea also got rid of the accel clock feature so you have to play  minute quarters to have a realistic game
as in number of playsdont listen to the reviews that say this is the greatest sim ever they are most likely marketing plants from ea sports
they do this with every game
go to any madden forum and you will hear the wide spread complaints about this gamemy impressions are primarily based on a ghz system with a high end meg video card nvidia geforce pro amp mb of ram
i also have a mhz cpu which i tested it on
this game is the best current football sim
that said it is not a great sim but a good one
it has huge glaring flaws in some of the physics
and ea sports is quite unreceptive to comments about things other then crashes
in other words if it runs its good enough
this is an unfortunate stancegraphics a very good
not flawless but very well done
the weak points in the graphics would be the stadiums
the score board is just a drawing
the crowd and the players on the sidelines are just obvious flat badly draw d art
the catching fumbling and other things involving character animation is not well done
but more or less acceptablesound c ok but redundent
the number of different comments john madden amp pat summerall do is very very limited
you will hear the same exact comment a dozen or more times in a game
quite dull
the stadium sound is decent
but the thing i miss the most is the taunting
last years model had the funniest things the players would say
it added a nice bit of color which is sadly missingplay designplay book f this feature was present in last years model
and while it was weak last year at least it was there
there is no playbook customization or play design of any kind this year
very disappointinggame play c the computer cheats badly and obviously and eny level of difficulty
this can be balanced with the sliders but by default should this be neededother areas such as pass rush qb skill etc can not be balanced with sliders since any movement has no discernable impactwith patch  this part is better
not perfect and not really tweakable with the sliders
with default settings pass rush is still nil qbs have an easier time going deep then passing short etc
i think the most annoying aspect is that hitting the qb  times in a game has no impact on his ability to play
it would seem that the qb being pummled should have at least some reduction in his skillfranchise modec it works mostly
however the draft is heavy skewed towards just a few positions
everyone in the league will soon have an all star te or  and more fbs then you can shake a stick at
the trading module is pretty broken
the computer will never offer a trade
the computer teams pretty much dont sign free agents either
want to help the computer
sign a bunch a free agents and trade them to the computer teams for low draft picksplayer movement is too limited
players seldom have comeback seasons or the such
if they are young and deemed to have potentional they can and typically will improve
however there is no in season learning
there is no moving from position to postion
want to play rod woodson at corner like the good old days
he will only play there with out of position penalties
it is not  uncommon to draft a player with great potential and move him to another position
the nfl has several examples of former lbs playing safety amp so onbugscrashes b it doesnt crash often with the patches
a nice change from last year where it took  patches to improve system stabilitythis time it was reasonablyh stable after  patches
it did not like my nvidia graphics card until i updated the driver
it would reset the cards clock speed and ram speed to the lowest programmable level leaving the system partially unstable and the game unplayable
this was not a bug in the driver since this is the only game to ever have this problem
updating to the latest drivers from nvidiacom solves this issuegiving it a quotbquot here is clearly being a bit too charitable since i am not factoring in having to update drivers and apply several game fixes
but if you do the same you will probably also be pleased with the over all stablity
if you dont take these steps be prepared for crashes lockups dumps to windows etcover all c it does somethings quite well
it is pleasing visually
with a few obvious and glaring exceptions it has most of the features we want they just dont all work very well
bottom line is this
i would rate it lower if there were anything to compare it to but there isnt
sadly this is isnt the best pc football game it is the only oneimproved from last yearplayer ratings are a tiny bit more detailedgraphics are improvedstability is improved comparison after the  patches  with all  or  patches is equally stablebetter sliders most offer seperate tuning of computer and human playersonline play is supposed to work this year
i havent bothered yet based on how very badly it worked last yearworse then last years modelplaybook customization is goneplay design is gonethe hurry up clock is gone
and since the game manages time so badly you have to play with  to  minute quarters to compensatesound
removing the taunting and smack talk removed much of the color from the game playover all its slightly better then last years but not by much
its disappointing to see how many of the flaws carried forward
even most disappointing to see features being droppedi have to agree with everything the last person wrote
the computer passes like a god it is almost impossible to get through his line
he cant run worth a lick though making the game very one dimensional and uninteresting on defense
almost every game i have played ended in scores of  points to  points
if the ai was better on defense and the computer ran more and better on offense this game would be awesome
also there is no option to create custom plays
on a good note the graphics are incredible and the motion of the players are ultrarealistic
just a few tweaks and this game would be incredible i hope ea is listeningoverall this games is very similar to  they used the same autorun and main game interface that they used in  but they spiffed it up
the close up view is really neat though
plus you can make your own logos and field logos for your customized teams which is really cool
the flaws to this game are the fact that it does not work well with k or xp
it says its compatible with k but its not
i have k with a geforce   mb ddr and the menu is slow as hell and takes forever to load
oh and god forbid madden and pat say a few more things and sound a little less corny
i have nothing against john madden or pat summeral in real life i believe they are the best color commentators in the game but in madden  they sound bad
overall this game is decent and gets you all the new stats and updated rosters and a few nice new featuresthis is another brilliant masterpiece made by westwood producers but buy something more worthwhile
yes it is pretty cool yuris revenge does have some new vehicles maps and single player campaigns
but i played yuris revenge once its basically the same thing as red alert  same grapics same gameplay
so after playing it once i just stuck to the regular ra and uninstalled yuris revenge
kind of a boring expansion pack if you ask me
waste of memory waste of time but worst of all waste of your money
please take my heed of advice and go buy some tinkertoys or something
unless you have some money to burni can still remember the final battle of the original command and conquer from back in the s
what i thought would take a few hours ended up taking an entire evening
defeating those wicked nod guys was the most mindnumbing experience ever  i could still feel my brain pounding long after the final cutscene played
getting up for work the next day was almost as difficultso of course when westwood announced they were going to make a firstperson shooter based on cc i had to get it
i can tell you cc renegade is a worthy first attempt yet it does fall short compared to the current crop of shooters out nowpros graphics  im surprised at other reviewers complaints
not the best in terms of detail or graphic quality but still very good for a game of this size and scope
action  very engaging
its not a oneman show  youre usually thrown into the heat of battle with explosions all around you
plus you get to drive a lot of the vehicles too
cc theme  all the goodies gdi cannons tiberium harvesters obelisks etc  the sound effects are very reminiscent of the early games it even keeps track of the number of nod soldiers you squish in your mammoth tank
cutscenes  very cool
just when i think westwood is slacking towards the later levels they throw in a nice epic movie to watch between levels
music  awesome
as always  cc games still have the best soundtracksneutral level design  yeah its westwoods first foray into level design and it shows
but quite frankly it shows just how accustomed gamers have gotten to having everything linear we expect to follow a straight line to the goal and never have to backtrack once
at least in this game you can pretend this would be more like a real world assault
besides were doing everything from beach assaults to desert sieges to sneak attacks in cities submarines and snow covered mountain bases
whats wrong with that
voice acting  decent
our hero major havoc sounds more like duke nukem
youre going up against a whole squadron by yourself
yeah doesnt seem fair does it
maybe ill shoot lefthanded
am i the only one who gets a little creeped out by the way they move their lips
weapons  all nicely balanced with the exception of the grenade launcher
this worthless weapon makes huge explosions that seem to leave the enemy unfazed most of the time
is this thing oncons load times  ugh
over  min to load a level
if youre killed or even if you restart the same level it takes just as long
its so annoying youll end up playing the easier difficulty settings just to avoid dying
minus one star for this annoyance
enemy ai  atrocious
as much as id like to be biased i have to admit this is one of the worst ever
i can round a corner see someone crouched behind a box pump about ten rounds into him and while i stop to reload he goes back to crouching behind the box uhhh hello
ill pick off someone with my sniper rifle and the guy next to him will just stand there and wait for his turn
i smirk when im warned of elite enemy forces approaching as these highcaliber opponents basically run into my line of fire and take maybe a few more hits to kill
doom had better ai
minus one star for this and thats being nice
system requirements  considering a game like wolfenstein runs on my system without a hitch im disappointed i have to minimize all the detail settings using my fairly new geforce  pro and even then the frame rates choppy
youre gonna need a  gig system and a gf at the very least to run this game smoothlyto sum it up  cc fans with sufficient hardware will find enough to overlook the rather major annoyances in the game
hardcore action fans however will find plenty to nitpick about but may realize that in spite of it all its still a really fun game to playhope my review helpedgreetings general  it looks like this time were going to need to get our hands dirty
thats right this time theres no advantage in numbers we need you to go in solo
command and conquer renegade places you into the first shooter in the campc universe
playing the role of nick quothavocquot parker in your quest to stop nods most evil plot to dategameplayas far as firstperson shooters go this sits on the arcade side of the market
everything from hit detection weapon physics and  enemy ai lacks what could be considered realistic direction
yet as far as arcade shooters go this one has its merits
the enemy density is quite challenging at times especially on the hardest settings and their accuracy will give even a seasoned fps gamer a run for their money
the downside is that the enemy ai reacts with more of a bot mentality than an intelligent one
for those of you unfamiliar with bots this means that regardless of the enemies using any cover or environmental awareness they just come straight at you
often in straight lines if you take the time to string them out
their lack of intelligence is compensated by their inhuman accuracyany of lack of polish exhibited in the game is more than covered by its definite campc feel
as a gdi commando you have access to weapons and vehicles made popular in the original campc world
whether youre driving a flame tank or placing beacons for your ion cannon it definitely feels like youre playing a small albeit important role to take down the brotherhood of nodgraphicsthe game looks dated even for only being from  it is really blocky
the character and vehicle models have extremely low polygon counts
the fmvs between each level also use a modified version of the game engine and the eyes and mouths look completely off
however im never one to downplay a game because of its graphics unless that is all it has going for it
just being able to walk around and inside a hand of nod or being able to get inside a mammoth tank and crush the opposition is enough to satisfy anyones visual needssoundrenegade uses a ton of sounds familiar to any campc vets
even the music is highly reminiscent of the original
all this adds to the feeling of being inside the campc universe
the only downside is that because the sounds are old at times it feels like your weapons really lack some oomph
you can unload  rounds from your assault rifle into an unwitting rocket soldier and the sound can make it feel like your shooting spitballs at an overripe watermelonoverallthis definitely has to be the best crossgenre attempt made by any gaming franchise
i was highly worried about buying this after having gone through xcoms attempt at fps but i was pleasantly surprised
for the going price this is definitely a must buy for any fan of the campc series and barring a few bugs the only downside to this game is the botstyle ai
just make sure to update it asap and if youre looking to stretch your gaming dollar even further be sure to try it multiplayer where you take part in a tribes  savage mixi found this game years ago on sale for  dollars at best buy and i had a gift card that was about to expire so i thought i might check it out
the graphics are realy bad
the controls are preaty bad too
the game was easy at parts like fighting voldemort i won in no time at all
this game also was good for putting all the challenges at the end
so over all this game is oki played it and it was to easy because my friend beat it in  days
the only good part of it is the qudditch torument
for true gamers dont get iti bought this game when it first came out and my poor old hp computer could barely handle it
i was amazed at the graphics at the time and loved the audio
omaha beach was intensei was on a battlefield  binge and decided since i was in fps mode id load up good ol moh
at first i thought it wouldnt even install since vista is loaded on my computer
but it installed and played without a hitch which made me giddyas i started playing it on the hardest mode i felt my old childish gaming feelings rising
i was dying
these werent live people on the other end of a toon shooting at me these were computer run programs designed to shoot at me and i was dying
as i continuously died i started blurting out expletives
then id pause the game and wonder where that particular word had come from
id continue playing and die again and another expletive would explode from my mouthi soon realized that i have been playing online games for about  years now and am used to a human opponent killing me
i got used to it and realized that humans are pretty smart and that no matter how good i think i am theres always somebody better
but coming back to a straight storyline fps game and getting shot up by computer ai was unacceptabledo you ever remember a specific movie from the past that you absolutely loved and still say you love today even though you havent seen it since the mids
and then you find the movie on video or dvd buy it watch it and say to yourselfhey this is kind of goofy
why did i like this so much
its called the test of time
moh was groundbreaking in its day and certainly was fun to play
but now compared against even the classic battlefield  it is archaic in its simplicity both graphic and playability wise
that doesnt mean it isnt challenging and fun but you can see the limitations it has compared to where technology is today
kind of like going back and playing pacmananyhoo after fighting my way from africa to the beaches of normandy to the bocage and beyond i eventually beat mohagain
after my final victory i quickly went into the bathroom and washed my mouth out with soap
i then dressed nice and walked over to my neighbors homes and apologized in person for the loud obnoxious and obscene houseguest that was staying with me during that timei have to say the whole nazi killing and world war  thing has gotten kinda boring
a year ago i was excited for this games release and i am highly dissapointedi had also been looking forward to rtcw and this is a very good game
i have to admit it is fun but the story is dull the violence is toned down you have to play multiplayer on gamespy arcade which swarms you with advertisements the instant you open it
i am highly dissapointed to see such a great game have so many downpoints that i actually rated the game so sothe other thing is that the system requirements are way and i mean way to high
the system requirements are mhz with  megs of ram
my mhz p computer with  megs of ram doesnt cut it
if you think that your old computer will do the job think again
my computer has done nothing but crash and freeze day and night
this is very strange because i also have a radeon  gpu which should also have done the trickexcept for the toned down violence the gameplay is pretty good
this game also has relitively bad ai too
most of the time the blood helps you out and you find out if you have hit the person or not
i found it annoying when i thought i would kill someone and they would just run right up to me and shoot me deadi like the choice of weapons in the game
you have machine guns a rocket launcher rifles smgs pistols and some far out grenadesto sum it all up this game is good but with many downsides and the system requirements are too steep
hope this helps
this should be a good game on high end computersi would really love to have someone release a wwii shooter that actually felt like wwii
and while ea likes to boast the realism frankly that only goes as far as the weapons the launguages and the location
the game is  linear and  predictable and after finishing it i feel more like i have finished reading a book not playing a game
honestly the mistakes are so glaring that ea really could have made a better game if they would have tried harder
this is definatly one you will need to try for yourself and reach your own conclusions onthe good missions remain interesting throughout the game some wonderfully scripted encounters and occasionally you will get to see wonderful character actions in your allies as well as your enemies nice range of american and german weapons and fairly accurate noises
tanks are fairly lifelike as are aircraft lots of speaking english and german
scripts are correct for the locations and you dont run into situations where dead soldiers are carrying on conversations and such as you do in some other titles accurate uniforms within reason sniper rifles are accurate powerful and fun and there are plenty of opportunities to use them if that is your thingthe bad the graphics are not as good as for example return to castle wolfenstein on the xbox im using a nvidia geforce mb ddr video card or as nice as delta force blackhawk down which is a better game when shot your characters aim flies across the screen
this may enhance the realism but when you are confronted with multiple enemies it makes it virtually impossible to hit anyone and soon becomes incredibly annoying enemies have certain locations from which they spawn in fact you can find them and stand there and gun them down as they suddenly materialize
also some enemies like snipers have not materialized until you step past a certain point into their line of fire and then they spawn and fire cannot interact with surroundings doors windows etc
 lack of blood to maintain the teen rating very linearthe ugly mg is lethal in the hands of the enemy but when you have the opportunity to man one the bullets fly everywhere but where you are aiming in fact the machine gun is only slightly more effective than any of your standard arms and much more frustrating to try and use allied ai is nil and considering some of these guys are supposed to be rangersthey just run into the open and fire then stop then fire and stop again while they are being gunned down
i was happy to see them get slaughtered so at least i could move oh yah you are stuck behind any obstacle as if it were twice as wide as it really is enemies continue to rush you with no regard to their own casualties and will even run from around a corner straight into your fire requiring no effort from you to gun down entire squads shrubbery and leaves will block your bullets but not the bullets of the enemies making snipers almost impossible to kill unless you rush their positions snipers are way too good even when i knew exactly where they were they could see me before i could see them the signifigant lack of an ending of any sort is unforgiveable
what did they do just give up halfway throughthis game had a pretty good story line and decent gameplay
the graphics are fine and so is the musicwhat really annoyed me about this game is that when someone sounded an alarm in a few of the missions the game kept flooding you with guys until you turned off the alarm the reason i gave it  stars not  but otherwise this game is greati was so excited at the prospect of playing medal of honor allied assault that i put out the money for this overpriced game
i felt like i was playing the hbo miniseries band of brothers or the movie saving private ryan
this made the game a rerun right out of the gate for me
however there are some aspects of this first person shooter that make it worth your time
first it is hard to play
this is the first game that has challenged this veteran gamer in a long time
those germans are nasty
second the missions offer variety and are innovative
you switch from working with a team to following a spy to welli dont want to give it all away
if you are new to this genre you will not feel as quotseen it done thatquot as i wasim seeing those who are bashing and those who are praisingso ill direct my review at both viewsprosyou get to build your own golf courseyou can play on your creationyou can hold tournamentsmini rpg you can improve your shotsconscan get boring fastcatch phrases get oldyou can only build  holes so there is a maximum capacitymy recommendationits a tycoon game so if you dont like them then you wont like this onei gave this game a  star fun rating because it is quite fun to play
though if you arent willing to spend the money then dont complain about itthere are definitely some good aspects to this game that have already been mentioned so ill only note why i had to give it a lower ratingi prefer to play all my games as single playeri started playing on easy level for obvious reasons of trying to learn how to play the game successfullythe next level is moderate   i question that very seriously after playing on this level in many different scenarios with  and  other ai opponents on different maps  with different civilizationsa separate issue i have is that its also more of a mad rush to reach imperial age rather than enjoying some technical strategy  building an empire
youre forced to fly through it to keep up with the opponents advancementsbut as i was playing with  ai opponents i was forced to pay exorbinant tributes very early in the game to keep one as an ally if you ignore his requests he comes to attack you soon and you end up with  against  which is impossible to sustain this goes on while the other opponent builds up very quickly much quicker than i believe is even humanly possible  wout having to give away his vital resources and started attacking me before i could build any proper defenseso i was kept down by tribute fees to  while the other quickly built up a strong wealthy empire and attacked me mercilously
not fun
and this is on moderate level right after easy
that led me to try playing with  ai opponent instead to see if that was any easier without having to hand over tributes that depleted me and it really wasnt as the attacks were relentless because they build up so fast and strong
id keep checking to see where the other kingdom was early on in the game and it literally seemed impossible to have stone walls  gates so early onmoderate level in my opinion is actually hard level its not scaled correctly for moderate players
easy is too easy which is fine with me for beginnersso i was left with either boring play i could easily win or so difficult and obnoxious that it was very frustrating to play and frankly too advancedif youre able to keep up with the ai opponents then youre extremely rushed and flying to upgrade which for me takes some fun out of strategy which should take a little timein the end i love the concept and gameplay i simply dislike how fast the opponents progress into a new age which forces the game to go too fast and seriously question the level advancements theyve created for single players where the first  levels go from too easy to insanely difficult  nearly impossible to win without using cheats i foundif thats moderate id hate to see what they consider hard
i also found other people who complained of this same problem on single player modei consider myself a pretty decent player  easy is just too easy  but the very next level should not be this drastic  steepjust to note the best thing you can do when under continual siege is to hurry up  build a wonder before the others and do  then do all you can to keep it for the  yr timeclock that beginsits fun but it has a serious level flaw in my opinion for truly moderate gamers on single player mode
note  this game works on my vista bit pcflight simulator is in some aspects way better than flight simulator  but it also has its consprosnew aircrafts with a much more detailed virtual cockpitsthe grand caravan amphibian can even land on watergraphics are excellentyou can plan your departure and arrival airport which makes it easier to travel from one place to another unlike in flight simulator  and  where the player has no clue where to goconsneeds a very good computer system with a minimum of  mb of video texturetakes ages loading and takes a lot of space on the hard diskoverall it is a fun game to play and you will cherish every moment of itdont expect any awesome graphics in here becasue youll get very normal graphics in this game
the only reason the keeping this game attractive is the style of gameplay
people who love helicopters might love this game but for me its ok to play when you get bored with other gamesi dont know what to say this game is kind of fun but really lacks any real replay value
you play as a chopper pilot who flies around the city either putting out fires and rescuing people or helping the police track down a bad guy
it can be fun sending your little guy down a rope to pull up some poor little person but it gets boring
decent graphics and control are the only really high points for this title and the number of modes are low just goes to show you that being on the ps doesnt mean the graphics are phenomenal
this is a good game with a couple of different modes to play in
the hardest thing is gauging how highlow you are in relation to the peoplebuildings and the controls are very awkward at first but become a little less awkward as you play and get used to them
i wish i had bought it used because it wasnt worth the pricecity crisis when you first play it seems to be a brilliant game but eventually it seems that that this game has no staying power
in the game you take the role of a pilot who helps to assist  the police in chasing criminals or you could be puting out fires and saving people from highrise buildings
yes this is an original style of game and it is fun to play but its not a game that i would go back to in a hurrywas very excited when i first heard about this game and couldnt wait to get it but isnt that great
the finisher moves arent as easily done as they claim in booklet for it
i still cant do them actually
plus it doesnt have none of the special features that were rumored for it
theres no scaffle match no barbwire match and nothing you might of heard about
plus most of the guys on the game never even feuded with each other
cant have a game with legends without guys like ric flair austin sting luger zbysco vader rhoades and many of the other names that are missing either
most of the wrestlers in it were never really maineventers either half of them a midcarders actually
too many of the wrestlers do most of the same moves too
probably the best things about the game is the season mode and the graphics
other than that its no smackdown just bring it
acclaim shows that they at least improved a little hopefully theyll get it right sooner or laterthe gameplay  movement is sluggish but no bigtime freezesbugs or anything else that stops the game dead like third one
it lets you create wrestlers without filling up space in your memory card but you can only make  caws
in the career modeyou have to make sure you save it or else it wont
its also a good reminder of the s ecw because there are no countouts and nodqs
infact this was originally set to be a ecw game but the company went out of business in  so they changed it into this
this is the only low game that has rob van dam in it
i give this game a  out of whats done right in low 
well it has a roster of  oldschool wrestlers with standouts such as koko bware george the animalsteeleand the  road warriors hawk and animal
it also features an innovative combo system that makes playing the game one part wzwarzone and one part parappa the rapper as you try to hit the right button in time to reverse grapples or counter attackwhats done wrong
everyting else
the slow unintuative controls underlie awful slappedtogether graphics anda bargin bin soundtrack that features midi rocktype soundalikes of the real wrestlers theme
classic superstars like rowdy roddy piper and andre the giant are conspicuously missing while now say it while pointing your thumbs at your shoulders and looking like an idiotrvd and sabu made it on the list
if you love classic wrestling do yourself a favor and pass this up youll be glad you didi rented nhl hitz yesterday because i have been playing hockey games since the old nintendo and sega games and am on the lookout for a new good one
the best game since those old systems was by far nhl  for ps not just my opinion
i bought nhl  last year for the ps and was not disappointed or thrilled for all of the pointed out problems
getting to hitz the graphics are like  until the game starts and then they are lackluster
the combination play is not very good
guys get on fire and you can lay out some big hits and the fighting is good
granted i only played it on one player but there are no moves besides a  spin which is highly unrealistic
you cant deke the goalie and you will never know what type of plays warrant goals
it is very frustrating due to lack of consistency in goalscoring
maybe its fun in six player mode but with lack of teamplay and passing combinations and only big hits which you cant see bk the graphics are not great anyway and fighting this game is not getting my vote and i am returning it to blockbuster after one day of playing it
if you love hockey rent it firsti rented spy hunter the other day and have barely played it  i loved the old arcade version cheesy as it seems by todays standards and i thought i might get a kick out of the updated gamewhat i got was a slick variation on a driving game and i hate driving gamesdont get me wrongthis seems like an excellent game  graphics are good there seems to be an underlying plot your car features lots of nifty toys and there are the requisite bad guys in black sedans trying to run you off the roadso all the ingredients are here and if you like driving games youll enjoy the extra dimension spy hunter brings to emmyself i was having too much trouble keeping the car on the road the targets in my sights and the civilians out from under my wheels to really enjoy this onespy hunter is a fun action pacted game that is great when you first start playing it but becomes quickly sappy and annoying
having to go back through certain mission to complete certain objectives to get points really gets on your nerves
also the game really isnt that hard except for a few missions and those are killers
i found myself doing one particular mission like  times
i did it so often that i had the entire landscape mapped out
but the game is pretty cool mostly because of the wide range of weapons you can use such as targeted swarmer missles and a rail gun
the defensive weapons are pretty cool too
overall though spy hunters a game to simply rent a play until you have to return it dont waste your money on itthis game is missing some things that i would have liked
first i wish there were more replays or the choice to have more replays
second the players werent zoomed in too much and they looked like ants
furthermore you really couldnt hit the other player after the play was over  a lot  like the arcade version where you can keep hitting the player two or three times before selection of plays
lastly the computer ai is too good generally
when you are stomping on them the game ups the defense and they either intercept or force you to punt until they catch up
overall this a good party game but in singleplayer mode it bitesthis game does however has some redeeming qualities
the commentators are smartalecs but their comments do get repetitive
next the use of the impact player is innovative and assists with the offensive strategies easily
lastly the graphics generally are much better than the arcadeoverall this game is a rental unless you like nfl blitz in the arcadethis game tries to expand the notorious frogger arcade hit from the s by bringing an adventuretype gameplay and increasingly difficult missions to accomplishgameplay is easy to grasp the instruction booklet is almost not necessary as hints and help are available throughout the game
you are still in command of little frogger moving him in the familiar directions north south east and west
you can also jumpglide rotate him and use his tongue to catch insects and do other stuff
this time frogger not only needs to avoid traffic alligators and water he also needs to overcome and conquer boulders snakes henchmen mean bosses and the evil mr d in order to claim victorygame music is upbeat and modern appropriate for the each level
you can set sound effects music lives and continues at the options screen
the game can be saved in one of the  internal slots available eliminating the need to enter a cryptic easytolose continue code
a very nice feature is the language selection
there are  languages to choose from including spanish english french italian and germangraphics are clear and colorful control response is fair
the only thing i found was that the game gets too difficult too fast
that could be the only reason against recommending it
but if you consider yourself a game jockey then you are in for a treat starsive always liked the frogger series so when they decided to bring it out as a d game i thought the idea was cool and could really be an awesome game
unfortunately that wasnt the case when i set down and played the game
although graphically the game looks awesome
its the controls and other issues that brought the game down to me
one annoying thing to me was getting stuck in certain areas of the game literally
id find myself in places that i couldnt get out of like under the ground
this was a glitch that seriously needed work on
besides those two annoying issues the game overall was pretty good
i just feel it coulda been better
much bettermy recommendation is its worth a rental or at least a x price tagbut nothing moreif there is a sequel to this game i do hope they work on those issues or alot of people will be driven awaythis game came in perfect condition and flawless but the game is very confusing on how to move to the next level so we just gave up and dont play this game anymorei played the  version and i liked it a lot
but i found this hm more repetitive and not as good
it has less things than the  version only  types of crops no festivals less house upgrades you can only build a kitchen and a dog house less activities no marriage or sons less tool upgrades no postman no dog races etc
instead of making it better than the  version they made it worse
i also liked more the camera of the  versionit may get fun at times but then it starts to get monotonous and boringeveryday i would simply wake up get eggs from the chickens brush and milk the cows water the same crops all the year which is actually  months each month a season harvest the same crops all the year sell the same crops all the year maybe do some parttime work and maybe give presents to people i want to get close to
it only varied sometimes almost never when i had to meet someone or i was asked to do somethingnew things that didnt have the nintendo  version were parttime jobs goddess a few different characters not more gnomes theres a cafeacute the whole town isnt in the same place and i think you can cook more things like cakes cheese or jams and pick more things from the forest which isnt really a forest like berries flowers nuts mushrooms herbs etcit isnt really bad but some people might get disappointed with this gameokay so this game is good but not awesome
its one of the more slower moving versions including walking around or even running
it doesnt have that same vibe the other versions have i think because of the way the graphics and layout of it is maybe
this is a game for those that enjoy all the harvest moon games and really just want to test drive this one for the heck of it
either way its not a bad investment also for those people they know that play farmville lol trust me itll keep those kids busy or the adults in your life too hehehere are the other games of this series that are way betterharvest moon a wonderful life special editionharvest moon back to naturethe reviews of harvest moon are mostly positive and mostly correct
however in this game each year you start from scratch as far as friendships go so it does not have the lasting appeal of other versionsthis version is fine if you want short games you dont really get attached to
if you want a better harvest moon experience get the n version of gameboy advance version
if all you have is a ps prepare to enjoy the game but not for very longthis is a harvest moon unlike any other in the series
while harvest moon back to nature was hardly antying but a port souped up for the playstation this one is totally different
these graphics are amazing from a first person viewpoint
it seems as if this harvest moon is for a mature audience as it isnt near as sunny in fact it is misty and foggy in the whole game
the enviroment takes alot to get used to and you get alot of different things in the game you dont get from the other games
but the huge complaint i have with this game is you cant date girls
thats the most fun of the other games so why did they leave this out
they have plenty of space in the game do they just not care
if i knew this before buying it i would have definatley thought twice about buying it
but it is a great game and you should check it out especially if you are a fan of the others in the series
but i think that if you are beginning get back to nature first because its just a better gamefirst off i have to say that i have owned every version of nhl from ea sports ever made dating all the way back to nhl for genesis in   and what gets me is that this is the worst version of the game they have ever released
i wasnt a huge fan of  but it was at least solid and i know i owned it on the pc so the graphics were better but still the ps graphics are somewhat weak
the controls are fidgity and the comentary oh my lord who thought that would be funny
the franchise mode is still patheticlets see some impressive offseason simulation
the game has become either a fast paced mash of buttons or just floating in unleashing slap shots at the goal
strategy is comming along but still the game is all arcadei rented this game because of how much i liked previous nhl games made by ea sports
so i picked this up and poped it in
the first thing i noticed was that there were a lot of little movies
players getting pumped up before a game celebrations on and off the ice
i thought that was pretty cool and a new added feature
but other than little things like that this game doesnt offer much of anything new
heres what i thought about this game and why i only thought it a renter not a buyer
the graphics the players are sharper the ice is thicker
the fans actually move in d
but overall not to great
the puck is way too big and the overall graphics just arent to improved
this game had great graphics but so did previous versions
the options horrible
no create a team no new features
and the biggest thing no franchise mode
that was about as dumb as having no franchise mode in nba live  i am seriously disapointed by the options in this game
nothing new whatsoever
the overall depth after your first season this game will probably get pretty boring
more new features and better graphics is what this game needs
i hope ea changed things in  edition
oops too bad
they did the same thing
until they finally add some sort of franchise and stuff like that eas nhl series will continue for me to be a renter not a buyer
rent before u buy then make your decision
just a warninghope this helped and i expect a lot more from the great company that is ea
thxthis isnt a bad game at all but it isnt much of an improvement over  it might not be an improvement at all
the commentary is better but the gameplay and graphics are pretty much the same
also a career mode is present but it doesnt provide the depth necessary to make it a fun feature
the user interface used to view stats and edit lines is a bit cumbersome
for example there is no quick way to switch a guy on sl with a guy on sl
you have to go through and change each player separately
not a big deal but when you make a trade or someone gets hurt and they are on several lines going through each one and changing it does take some time
the ui is one thing they should have left the samei was hoping for a big jump forward from last year but  isnt
it is still a good game but if you have  you dont need this onethis game could have been a great game
the graphics are great
the idea itself is great
but the game is not
its really hard and can get tedious
for example you cant just save your game whenever you wantyou have to find a quotmagic bookquot dont get me wrong
it is a marginally fun game sometimesall the gnome shooting is all right and the puzzles are fun
but if you want to win this game your in for a challengeif you are the parent of a  year old who likes being challenged and has a great attetion span you might consider this game
otherwise forget itthis isnt what i wanted out of a hp game
the magic is pretty good but the adventures are just ok im not saying its a bad game its just not hp
graphics are cool though
ea needs to make up on the next game for xbox pc gammecube and gbathis game does a pretty good job of sticking to the storyline and has a creative gameplay
however it varies from being waaaay too easy to being far too hard it literally took me  months to complete one task
my advice buy chamber of secrets it seems to be the superiorfor one thing i will say this games not too awful but there are a number of problems that need to be addressed
for one missions arent very exciting and they almost feel like fetchquests like you see in rpgs
when it comes to broom riding the controls are awful and i failed broom test flights numerous times because of the controls and you have to repeat the course every time you fail
so because of this i found myself yelling constant obscentities
the graphics are awful come on 
consoles in this time period had better capabilities than this 
 and the character voices sound terrible
this game feels like it tries to imitate rpgs too much and falls flat on its face in the process
the game doesnt take much to complete either i completed  of the game in just over an hour
with that said this game doesnt suck but its not very deep or exciting eitherthis game although it is fun is not at all what you expect
i played it a little and let me tell you there are only  missions like  weapons and no rumble pak
i was considering buying this game but dont do it
if you want the best fps on gba definitely get ecks vs sever
it rocksthe graphics are kinda bad thats only becuase its some what old
even if the graphics are bad its is extemely realistic
one of the most impresive and gruesome things about this game is the massive amount of blood and gore and the realistic actions of your victoms
like you shoot someone in the chest with the  cal sniper rifle and theyll blow in half
shoot someone in the leg or arm with a pistol or weaker gun and theyll grip their arm
shoot it with a shut gun and it will get blown right off
their isnt really a plot to the game but if you love seeing lots of blood and killing stuff get this gamei dont know why i purchased soldier of fortune
its not that i regret it necessarily its just that i had never played it and i had only read mixed reviews
so i think what intrigued me was the  controversy over the quotgorezonesquot this game featured and how violent it was supposed to be
i guess i wanted to see if the game lived up to the controversyit does
soldier of fortune is a typical first person shooter about a one man army who fights his way through level after level of enemies that look exactly the same
aside from the extremely graphic violence you wouldnt be able to tell this game apart from any other mediocre corridor shooter
but the violence is very very graphic
heads are split apart limbs are torn off intestines and chunks of various other organs protrude from gaping wounds
it is all an attempt to portray violence realistically in a videogame but after a short period of time it all seems too overthetop and very unnecessary
regardless of whether or not the developers were trying to make the game realistic blood and gore should probably be a bit more limited than thisso aside from this gimmick the rest of the game is very average
the control takes some getting used to the framerate gets very choppy even with the very bland visuals and the multiplayer mode seems pretty tacked onit isnt a horrible game
but its probably a better rental than a purchasea good game with great graphics and a reasonable story to boot but come on
how can you make people wait for  minutes while the game reloads and loads in the next scene
it isnt on and just gets really irritating after a whilewell no
straight away
you can go for a tea break and a number  and still come back to find tha computer in the process of loading
and hell does it get boring when you cant find which pile of boxes to jump on in which order to get to a control panelnot impressed
sorry but im just notits not terribly good but its much better than the first one
i actually had something that resembled fun while playing itwell in japan this game is galled tales of eternai
it was only when it was brought stateside that the name changed to become tales of destiny iilike its previous installment this game was released for the original playstation video game consolegraphics well not so much different than the first game this game also uses sprite graphics similar to the previous game
but the quality has been upgradedcharacters are very expressive and are nice to get to know as each one again has their own history and background just like all the tales series games havethe game has a couple of cutscenes which make it stand out a little bit more for its time periodgame play you have limited control over the characters but you can make them walk run or jump how you want them to be able and dothis game uses the technique attacks
but the tp will not replenish itself alone
you actually need to be able and use a gel to help you restore the tpthe main character this time can use more than one main weapon
one of such weapons would be a nice axedepending on your predicament and what style of fighting you like you can choose the weapona nice thing this time is that you can and will be able to save your game in the middle of dungeons
which i personally found was a very nice and handy featurestory a nice tales storyline
i will not spoil it hereit is the basic save the world again
which almost all rpg games have now
but at the time it was something new and very fun and entertainingflaming streaks saturate the blue yonder  a mystical spacecraft crash lands disintegrating foliage and vegetation alike
aboard the spacecraft is a young enigma possessing the horrid awareness of a great forthcoming catastrophe
sent as an emissary meredy must prevent her home planet celestia from fatally colliding with the planet inferia
witnessing the monstrous projectile disembark close to their village two dear friends reid and furrah futilely attempt to communicate with the visitor
unable to comprehend the intensions of meredy nearby villagers banish the stranger
concerned and up to the brim of gallantry reid and furrah agree to voyage with the gatecrasher and what they least expect is a crusade to as with all rpgs eventually defend their world
namcos third installment to the tales of destiny series is definitely a stalwart one yet not as enticing as the closely nonexistent playstation can truthfully offer ie metal gear final fantasy vii
what seems as a slackjawing quest only passes up as a sluggish and dreadfully predictable onereintroducing the rpgs most inventive feature realtime clashing namcos latest can only go so far with one great area the fighting engine where the other departments hurtle in a downward spiral
tweaking and ameliorating flaws found in the prequel namco has decided to discard the round  fighting found in the prequel allowing the player to manage one character in real time fashion as the computer takes control of the other three
the battle encounters are generally fastpaced even though at times the computer on your side typically performs useless moves like casting an ineffectual spell or two
the enjoyable customizable setups and minigames are unsuccessful to deeply facilitate the games shabbiness
mildly enhanced the rpg is a hollow shell when compared to current rpg standards
thrown in are the repetitive mundane phase random battles level gaining overly exaggerated bosses traveling from town to town and recruiting seasoned allies along the way
although knocking the crap outta the enemies in fighterlike style is fantastic the games lagging story is a hideous monstrosityrevolving in oldschool d and characters textured in brightly rendered sprites tales of destiny  appears as if it were one of the more earlier playstation games
the overview world is done in a scruffy reduced landscape and lacks the punch to impress anyone who owns any nextgen system
heroes in the battle engine are garishly tinted with a fine coat of colors
monsters usually in a goop of bizarre cutesy outfits get quite annoying with their harmless forms
on the contrast to the fluid colors it really goes along with the simplicity of the game
the musical score is nothing to brag about delivering dull monotonous sounds
plagued with many inescapable flaws the game couldnt possibly lower its status but does with terrible voice acting
the spoken dialogue seems to be a bunch of scrambled unrehearsed linesallinall tales of destiny  stirs up as habitual as your daily brew
failing to furnish the life span of the playstation i wouldnt recommend to shell out money for this unpleasing rpg
with final fantasy x looming closer and presently released in japan namco should have been more on the highbrow and pulled this one off as a revolutionary title on the playstation   mediocre games like these further indicate how the playstation should take its concluding vacationwhen the gba came out young me was so excited
i knew i was getting it for christmas but the biggest surprise under the tree was the new spyro game
perfect start to my new gba collection
right
ehhhthis like enter the dragonfly was good in theory and visually pleasing but the programming is lackingafter spyro defeated the sorceress many rhynocs found themselves suddenly jobless or stuck in positions less than appealing
one such rhynoc is grendor who is in charge at the grand central dragon realms library
he is lacking in smarts and stature so when bianca visits the library and accidentally leaves behind a spell book it seems like his golden ticket
he finds a spell to amp up both his brain and his brawn
unfortunately he reads the spell upside down
he gets his wish but he also gets two heads and two massive headaches
the only cure is the wings of  fairies so he freezes them all and tasks the other rhynocs with retrieving them
who better to save them than our favorite purple fire breatheryou start off in the autumn fairy home and work your way up to summer
as usual spyros main attacks are his horns and his firey breath
the levels themselves are actually pretty stunning for a gameboy even a gba
unfortunately several things overshadow the pros with no map it is very very easy to get lost in a level especially with the above view
i would often find myself stuck in a level for fourty five minutes because i couldnt find the exit or the last fairy despite having learned how to swim in the last two games and the premise directly stating this game takes place after year of the dragon spyro drowns if he so much as gets a toe in water
this is no exaggeration there is no standing on the edge like in the old games he drowns and youve lost a life there are some bits that are a little too difficult for the target audience
even when i went back as a teenager and tried to play them i had trouble glitches
much as enter the dragonfly had some problems being the first spyro for the ps there are some problems with the first attempt at putting spyro on the small screen
this is especially problematic in hummingbird fort
the way the platforms are set up you cannot tell which ones are above you and which are below youll often attempt to glide over only to find out youre about to drop to your death
even worse again especially in this level is getting hit and suddenly flying halfway across the level
this really comes into play with rhynocs that target you from above with missles anytime i get hit by one rather than just being knocked back a couple inches shoots me back halfway across the level and causes me to lose lives like crazy thieves are very difficult to catch especially with how easy it is to fall off a leveldrownetctheres a couple more issues of course
its worth buying but definitely used for a few bucks
nothing morethis game is difficult in some ways and easy in others
spyros gameplay is usually pretty easy though there are a few challenging puzzles and minigames
spyro breathes fire glides charges and hovers in this game
the objective is to free all one hundred fairies by melting the ice crystals they are in
spyro also can enter speedways
he races against time towards the finish line while flying through hoops and shooting fireballs at enemies and obstacles to gain time
he has dodge certain obstacles
depending on the enemies color it will have gems in its place when shot give you time or have no effect at all
the only thing you do as spyro flies the course is is shoot and dodge enemies and collect gems
at the end you get a fairy if you complete the course
there is a normal and hard mode
sparx is more difficult since you are often surrounded or blocked by several enemies
sparx can dash around enemies and shoot them
there is a different boss at the end of each stage
you obtain a fairy if you defeat the boss
there isnt much of a storyline
however the game is relatively fun though experienced players may find it too easyi would have gave this game  stars if the loading wouldnt take like  minutesit has lots of challengesbut if you try to get  gems it would take more than  minutes because the loading takes a lot and while you try to make the gem or relic and the tries it takes to get the gem or relic men it takes more than  minutesif you are not fan of crash bandicoot dont even botherthis is ok itys exactly like the other games though and the graphics are improved a little
but it takes hours to load so i wouldnt buy it if you have any of the othjer crash games or you cant waiit the long load timesok
im new to the whole crash bandicoot series so im not fully up to speed with it so i wont say too much about the game as a whole
just the gameplay and everything else in betweeni have to admit i liked this game
its no mario world but its very challenging very clean and crisp the graphics are very good and all out i had fun with this game except when my world was getting rocked by the battle ships with cannons and all i had was a little dragonfly with a pea shooterthe thing that just bothered me about this game was the loading
it just took so long for you to start a level that is was ridiculous
it was slower than legends of wrestling
but atleast in return for the long loading great graphics very textured and full and good gameplay gives this game a good thumbs upi still think its a  star game rather than a  or  because of the loading but other than that excellent
enjoy this one and when youre done give it to your kids because im sure theyll have a good time with this titlethis is an excellent game gameplay wise
the graphics are spectacular and the music is the usual crash bandicoot style stuff
the controls are easy to pick up
they even added a few new types of levels ie
rolling crash bandicoot
imagine super monkey ball with crash inside the ball 
it is kind of short but what is there is extremely fun although sometimes irritating
the reason i gave this game a  star rating is because of two things
the first is the load times
it takes on average  seconds min to load each level
this wouldnt be bad but that brings me to the second problem
there is no loading bar so you cant see how much longer its gonna be
plus while you are waiting for it to load this annoying alarm type noise plays
now put all that together and imagine sitting there for a minute not knowing how much longer they are gonna torture you with that annoying noise
this prevented me from beating the game because i refused to wait for the loading screen
i have heard that the gamecube version is much better with the load times although i wouldnt know because i didnt want to buy the same game for two systems
definately buy this game if you are a crash bandicoot fan but i reccommend the gcn version instead of the ps versioni really enjoy crash bandicoot games
the wratch of cortex was also enjoyable in its way but there were too many frustrations for me to really be enthusiastic about it
there are  levels in the game including the bosses
if you have ever played a crash bandicoot game before then you will find everything you have come to expect from one
you are in a d world sometimes sidescrolling sometimes a third person view from the front or behind and sometimes using one of the games numerous modes of transportation ie
biplane mine cart dune buggy etc
if you were expecting improved graphics then your expectations will be pleasantly fulfilled
the game moves very smoothly through some beautiful environmentsso what are my complaints
first crash seems harder to control than i remember from his previous adventures
i think one of the biggest factors in this are the camera angles
sometimes it seems that the camera is too close so that you cannot see everything around you and then sometimes it seems too far away and it is hard to judge the depth of your enemies
i think i noticed this the most on the levels where you have a front view of crash and he is being chased by something behind him
the camera seems to be in way too close so that nitro crates holes and other obstacles just jump out in front of you forcing you to die a million times while you memorize the route you have to take
second some of levels tended to be repetitive
granted i did enjoy some of the newer levels
there were a couple of short sections of levels where you got to ride a mine cart which was fun
there were also three levels where you were rolling through the level inside a sphere giving it a marble madness feel
i would have liked to see more levels like these rather than the underwater and biplane levels that seem to pop up repeatedly in every single game in the series
third the bosses were just painful
i may be biased because i really do not like bosses but these ones seemed more annoying than usual
lastly the loading times were the worst i have ever seen in any video game
you have spend at least a minute or so staring at a loading screen every time you enter and leave a level
i was actually discouraged from playing this game many times because i knew how much time would be wasted on loading screensof course a crash bandicoot game would not be complete without the gems and relics
after you beat a level you can replay it and try to open every box in the level to win a gem or race through the level and beat a set time to win a relic
once you beat the final boss you are granted access to a secret room with  extra levels that are earned by winning relics from the levels
this could be interesting if you actually have the patience to play through all the levels over againi might have given this game  stars had it not been for the hideous loading times
it got so ridiculous that i would start flipping channels during the loading screens because i got so bored
aside from that this is a pretty adequate helping of crash if you have enjoyed previous gamesi have been playing this game for about  days with my  sons ages  and   and we have been enjoying it for the most part
i had really high hopes for this game as we play through crash  warped every few monthsthis game is much more difficult than crash   we have gotten through about  levels
some of the boss stages  have been unnecessarily frustrating
i would say that my  yr old can do about  of the levels and my  yr old has only been able to do  or there is only real new play mode weve seen so far  on several levels crash is in a glass ball and you run in the ball through the level
i think these are pretty good we have replayed some of these just for funon a couple of levels crash flies an airplane as in previous games
these levels arent nearly as difficult as the past games and are now kind of frustratingly easythere has been  racing level that i didnt enjoy too much
there are holes in the road that you cant see until too late and the other cars seem to make it their mission to get in your way
it took me about  tries to complete it and when i did it seemed like it was random instead of that my skill had increasedon a couple of levels you play as coco and in parts of these levels coco rides a scooter or a snowboard
it is kind of irritating that coco doesnt inherit the skills you acquire like tiptoeing or doublejump
we really like the levels in the old game where you rode the baby tiger and were kind of disappointed that there werent any of those in this one
the cocoa levels are pretty good thoughthere are a few underwater levels in which you swim or drive a submarine through
there are some minelooking things that fall down from above as you approach them
the only trouble is that they are sometimes off the top of the screen
you either have to take baby steps through the level or memorize where they are
i dont think these levels are very fun but then again i didnt like either the swimming or jet ski levels from crash  eitherthe load times are extremely annoying
my  year old and i have  ways to entertain ourselves during the load times
sometimes we imitate crash falling through the air
sometimes we joke about how many things we could do while a level is loading
i say wanna go eat dinner while this loads
he says  are you sure it will be done by then
i usually turn the game on and walk away and do something
then i load a level and walk away againi dont think this game is as polished as crash  was
some things are irritatingly hard and others seem too easy  it seems like they rushed it out for christmas   one of the little things that drive me nuts is that you can fall off the edge of cliffs when you are trying to go onto the platform for bonus levels
it seems like the key to success is often to die and die until you memorize the level enough to get through it jump here dont jump here
that box is not worth trying for etc
the first game of the series was kind of like that but i thought the nd and rd were less sowhen you collect the rd mask it is hard to tell that you are invincible
the previous games had a really distinctive drum beat that played  in this game the music changes but it is really subtle and you have to be paying attention to even knowi also think the music is not nearly as good as in the previous games
the songs from the previous crash games were pretty hummable but i cant say i even really notice the music in this oneone more thing i wanted to mention is that i get some motion sickness sometimes when playing d games
i know that many people suffer from this
one if the things i appreciated about the previous games is that i could play it without getting dizzy
this game does contain a few levels in it that make me a bit dizzy but it isnt too badso what you want to know is should you buy it
i think ive been really hard on this game because my expectations were so high due to home much we enjoy crash  which is my favorite platform game ever
some people have complained that it is too easy but it matches my attention span for a game pretty wellthis game is great
its a really good game to be honest
the levels are just like theyre supposed to and stuff like that but as soon as you press new game then it hits you
loading time ahhhhhh
this is common in all ps games but really
in this game is ridiculous
i find myself on the loading screen more often than im playing the actual game because i die a lot because this game is hard
when you get a game over from what i remember when you get a game over it loads to get to the title screen
the when you press load game it loads to the file selection screen
once you load your game and enter the level you were on it loads to get to the level
overall its a great game but the loading kinda ruins itim a diehard crash fan and i can hoenstly say the theres something off about this game
the load times are obnoxiously long and some of the higher levels are way too easy and over too quick
coco is now playable but imho shes impossible to control and doesnt do any of the quotpower movesquot that crash gets double jump wumpa cannon etc
im not dissappointed that i bought this game as it did scratch that d platformer itch but its not the same quality of game that naughty dog made the series popular forive played all the ps crash games to death but this one the first main series entry after naughty dog isnt up to the same standards
its very similar to crash bandicoot warped in terms of level themes and warp room layout with a bit of variety added in special levels where you do things like roll around in a giant glass ball or play as coco
however the colorful bosses from past games are replaced by a single new character crunch bandicoot who uses elementals to gain different powers for each boss fightthe loading times are also really really badto start off the game shows us just how great the ps graphics can be
i dont know if this is because konami helped out with this or what but the game certainly lacks in what the first three on the ps surely had and that my friends is gameplaycrash returns in this game to once again battle cortex
the formula for crash isnt changed much at all but this game suffers from what the first one suffered from
that my friends is tedious load times
it takes a minute just to enter a level for crying out loud
the load times of this game definitely make this game sufferthe ingame levels are fun but are immenesly populated
not just with enemies but with obstacles too
some levels are also extrememly lengthy and it seems like your going to ask the question quotare we there yetquot several timesawkward camara angles in conjunction to enemy placements and platform placements was a pain
the camara would be at an awkward angle and youd think the platform was in front of you but you end up having to move to the right or left a bit
by the time you figure it out youll probably have died several deaths that couldve been avoidedas usual the controls are very easy to learn and shouldnt be a problem to get the hang of
but sometimes the response of the controls can cause you to lose sometimesoverall this wasnt a bad game but it certainly wasnt a good game either
the series lost its edge of solid gameplay and went down to the frustrating levelthe game is average in just about all aspects graphics gameplay and storyline
the game doesnt provide anything over the standard mariotypesmashingcratesandcollectingfruit game but is still fun nonetheless and provides a good amount of play time
many of the levels are too challenging for younger players
there are some levels where the player quotdiesquot by missing a jump falling into water and drowning
i thought the image of the character floating face down in the water wasnt appropriate for younger kids
for the most part though it will provide entertainment for all agesif you playedcrash bandicoot  warped youll feel deja vu as it is pretty much the exact same game with the graphics beefed up
if you had the choice i would suggest getting warped if you prefer  game play over graphics otherwise get this game if you prefer graphics over gameplayi liked it enough to play it all the way through and i have no patients for games and will drop them on day one if theyre not up to par this game is short which for me in this game is a plus because if it had gone on for much longer i would have eventually gotten bored of it not long after
but its a fun game at a great price
just no god of wardevil may cry is real exciting nonstop action puzzle solving a must have game
it has great mini games doubles the fun
however the control is terrible and the camera angle is so horrible that it gets real frustrating
and same looking monster again and again boss is real tough and real challenging but anything related to graphicfrom playing the small portion on the demo i couldnt see my self buying this game id buy a poster of the cover
it has excellent movement compared to most other ps games it has that good ole annoying camera angles youd expect to work well but just dont weapons of fair quality weak graphics terrible creativity of the enemies all around i say good ideal great title could have been a real winner with so much potentional but that only gets you so far
so along with the crew who made this nightmareish game and who shortly will be crying from the sales i too share tearsnot that this is a bad game
but it is the definition ofoverrated
the story is one of the worst i have ever seenand the voice acting is worse than resident evilthe game was designed fine not many glitches or bugsits just not that fun
boring is what comes to mind wheni play this game
so even at the marked down price iadvise you to rent first
some people love this game but alotof people will be turned of by how dull the gameplay is stars instead of two because there are few bugs and glitchesand it is a beautiful gameonce again shinji mikami has successfully made money off of someone elses ideas
just like simon belmont or alucard in devil may cry you are a supreme hero summoned to follow in your fathers footsteps to rid the world from evil
 instead of saying die monster you dont belong in this world
you say flock off feather face or you can stick around and find out the hard way
this game is a in your face arena of firepower and gore
all you do is run around and kill everything thats stupid enough to move
you are a collector of very original guns such as the rocketlauncher shotgun and pistols
you obtain a very small percentage of swords which cant even be upgraded
you can however buy yourself some extra abilities which are fun and easy to utilize
you have the option to buy additional items as well such as holy water castlevania which kills everything in sight
your money is blood in the form of gems that you extract from the enemies you kill
more castlevaniathe puzzleswhat am i saying
there are no puzzles
just get your gun and sword and turn your enemies into toss salad
i beat the game in  hours when at the same time i was beating grand theft auto  rent devil may cry finish it and later forget about it
the groudwork of this game is as empty as its soulthis is one of the most boring games ive played
the storyline is almost nonexistent the fighting is very repetitive and the puzzles are extremely simple
the graphics are nice but far from perfect
the controls are frustrating due to a horrible camera system
the sound is the only decent part of this game
so out of a perfect  i give itgraphics sound control fun factor devil may cry at first glance will blow your mind with its beautifull graphics
but dont be fooled
gameplay is addictive but the games subtle charms wear off pretty damn fast
the worst part about it is how it tries so hard to be resident evil but just doesnt cut it
and what is supposed to ne a horrer title is anything but horrifying
but in order to give justice to a title that is decent ill list the pros and cons below to let you decide for yourselfproseye pleasing fightswonderfull cutscenesbeautifull graphicslots of bloodcool weapons and itemsdante kicks major conslow environment interactioncheesy as all  storylinerepetitivnessalot of runaroundthe charactor is a regualer supermanlow replay valueive long been a fan of the street fighter ii series on the snes
when i heard there was going to be a gba version i couldnt wait to get my hands on it
and while its fun to play its far from perfectfirst the good stuff
the graphics are nice and stay true to the original as do the sound effects
arcade mode is a blast to play and the various little bonus games you can unlock are pretty coolbut there are unfortunately some significant problems with the game
firstly theres the fact that the gba has two less buttons than the snes
the control scheme is customizable thankfully but it takes time to get used to it
fingercramping is pretty common after playing for a long period of time even if youre used to playing the gba for extended sessionsanother downside is the music
to put it simply its bad
were talking barely game boy color quality here and its a real shame
part of the charm of the sf games is the cool music and unfortunately this aspect did not carry over well to the gba at alland one other gripe  the game can crash
after unlocking akuma he can be your opponent in the arcade mode
but unfortunately the game crashes and burns horribly  times out of  when it brings me to him in the arcade ladder
a console game crashing under normal usage is a very bad thingtm and thats ultimately what brings this games rating down from  stars to  stars in my bookconclusion sf for gba is fun but in many regards it just doesnt do justice to the snes versions
when you see awesome conversions like mario kart super circuit and compare them to this somewhat lacking port of street fighter ii its faults can become pretty glaringi believe for every review made by a person for another person should have an overview of the reviewers characteristic and quotdefinitionquot of a good game for himheri like rpgs but am good in all games
i define a good game by the right mixtures originality game quality easy to get use to and control action type objective settings and so on
ill make this clear and precise as possible
please take note this is my opinion you might think differentgood thingsthe game is nice if youre bored of the same old pokemon games and their battling techniquesthe games texture and graphics are a good improvement from other gba gamesthe game is long and challengingbad thingsthe game can become extremely frustrating
why
many reasonswhenever you enter the net you come across viruses or enemies to make it simple
they are challenging at first but in the later stages when you become powerful they are just plain annoying especially when youre trying to accomplish long tedious missions given to you by the game
you must have an escape chip to actually escape
you can only hold  chips in your quotmovesquot folder
so if you have for example  your chances of getting them and escaping battles you dont want is 
you get  chips per turn that you skip and press add during your chip selection
think about itthe cost of items in this game is way too high in my opinion
as a player in a rpg game you would like to improve your weapons so you can defeat your enemies fastereasier right
well try to when it takes zens just to get one m cannon which does  damage
the common later viruses have like hp
the beginning bosses are about 
therefore you need more than  powerful chip
how long would it take
say foreveroh yeah chip combos are made by putting same letter chips together
example two different chips with the letter l next to it say cannon chip l and dash chip l you can select it both at once and use it without the need to wait for the bar to fill up to select more chips
its really hard to make the combos and play fast when you gotta check out the letters next to each chip to see if you can play it together
the letter range is longthe missions are nice if you know how to get it
they seem to expect you to know exactly where to go
well they dont mrcreator
therefore what you either do is get faqs or wonder around mindlessly and extremely frustrated until you find where you need to go
got milkthe only real fun is raising megaman upgrading him which is hell and fighting the bosses and people with powerful pets
megaman is a pet
this is where it beeped up
its usually rare or it takes a horribly ammount of time and work to finally encounter those few people
the rest of the game is filled with viruses that arent challenging and you cant simply escape easilyheres a clue for everyone
why buy when you can get it for free
hahahapros i love the megaman games
ive been playing them since i was a kid
the x series is my favorite but it started to decline with megaman x
this game is a little better than x because you arent forced to listen to alias messages that frequently halted the flow of megaman xs gameplay and i really like the shadow armor which finally lets megaman conquer his greatest foe of all spikescons unfortunately there still are no anime cutscenes like the ones in the outstanding megaman x and the storyline is weak
theres so much more that could be done with this series but theyre just not putting the effort into it anymore
i dont think capcom really knows where theyre going with the story
what we need is a serious game with a decent budget and some freash ideas
all the bosses dont have to be animals or plants and sigma doesnt have to always be the final boss
im sick to death of sigma
they need to finally reveal everything about the origins of x and zero and whatever ties they may have to the original megaman series and perhaps the legendsdash series then they should conclude the story
unfortunately megaman x jumps even further off track with the storyline but ill stick with the series till they get it right againmegaman x is an ok
game but if youre just getting into megaman id reccomend the megaman collection coming out in may and megaman x first
this ones just for megaman x loyalistsi wasnt really impressed with x
while infinitely better than x a stupid game especially with alias constant quotadvisingquot this one doesnt really do anything to expand on the mega man x franchise
its a shame that the x series is going downhill although i do recommend checking out mega man zero for the game boy advanced thats worth it and the plotline continues to be even more confusing
i know that when it comes to games youre supposed to play the game and probably ignore the story but a solid storyline really enhances the game
capcom was on a good road with x with its inclusion of anime scenes and impressive arcadelike gameplay but now theyve chosen to downgrade themselves
check out the first four x games theyre fantastic but you will be disappointed with this one and more so with xwell we didnt see this coming
and neither did keiji inafune
as legend has it inafune wanted to end the x series with mmx bad idea
so that he could fully concentrate on the mega man zero series but the makers of x obviously not wanting to be out of a job made x under his nose in only a few months and released it forcing inafune to change the zero storyline to fit the new plot elements introduced in this new title namely zero coming back to life
so one would ask is x any good
surprisingly yes it isto a degree
the problems that exist in this game are numerous as a result of the quick creation time but for a game that only took a few months to make this is surprisingly wellcrafted
all the limitations present in x are in x the crouching the inability to shoot through walls etc but theyre easier to take in this time around and arent as much of a culture shock
the environments have a strong visual appeal the armors are fun to work with zeros fighting tactics have improved upon his rebirth and even the level designs though flawed and incomplete can challenge the most ardent mega manx players forcing them to strategize in order to complete them in as few deaths as possible
then again all these good elements are offset by a storyline that basically apes the story in x engrishstyle dialogue complete with grammatical errors the bosses having a rollercoasteresque learning curve both the pitiful commander yammark and the insidious infinity mijinion and the end result is a game with a lot of loose ends that still needed tightening but as it stands it is nevertheless a decent title and better in scope than the anemic xgood but games like golden sun are a lot better
heres how it lays outgraphicssound nothing specialstorygameplay too much magicoverall if u want an rpg get golden sun insteadif they would of simply made this the same as the classic tetris game from gameboy it would be great
it is really distracting to see three of the next peices coming instead of one
also when you get a quottetrisquot four lines at once the classic sound is not there
the sound effect when your piece hits the other blocks is not there
also the blocks themselves should be more detailed
the detailed backgrounds are cool but sometimes very distracting
they should of included the option to play the original tetris as standard instead you must put in a code to get it to appear
when you play the quotpopularquot version the background is always ugly grey and the game makes no noise at all when you score a tetris
worst of all it does not save scores
i got a score over  and i cannot save it
at least you can choose the classic tetris music though thats the best part of the game so it gets  stars instead of dont get me wrong i love tetris
ive been playing it in the arcade as well as the gameboy colorin the case of tetris worlds the graphics are beautiful but they become intrusive to the gameplay
for example in one scene a penquin bounces around while you are playing the game
although its pretty to look at its completely unneccessaryits seems that the game designers tried to jazz up the simple gameplay of tetris but they overdid it with the graphics
another bad thing they did is that they never bothered to include high score save ability the old gameboy color tetris had this
thats a shameits still a good buy but keep in mind this is definately not the best version of tetrisive seen so many negative reviews of tetris worlds for the gba and it is unfortunate that a lot of people have been unhappy with the game
however i think that much of the unhappiness stems from the fact that so many tetris fans hold the game in such high regard that even tampering with it for the better seems to offend them
i am not a hardcore tetris fan and indeed up until a few years ago i did not enjoy the game at all
i think i can offer a bit of middle ground perspective on tetris worlds and hopefully this will prove useful to peoplefirst the good
i really enjoy three of the new game modes namely cascade fusion and hotline tetris
they all feature gravity pieces fall into gaps below when you clear lines and offer many opportunities for strategic planning
the original tetris is also rather enjoyable although i dont care much for sticky tetris or the pretty much useless square tetris
i do however find the new features which apply to all the game modes to be rather useful the ghost piece that shows you where your piece will land the ability to see the next three pieces and the ability to hold a piece and recall it later
not everybody will care for these features but i think they add a lot of opportunities to plan ahead and make for longer gamesnow the bad the d backgrounds are pretty lame
id just as soon have the cartoony backdrops of tetris attack
i dont find them as distracting as a lot of other reviewers here have though
perhaps thats because early reviews of the game were on the original gba and the clearer screen on the gba sp makes the backgrounds less annoyingalso theres the mattery of the battery save
there isnt one
this game came out in  and i think everyone will agree that no game boy game should have ever seen the light of day in  or after without a battery save feature
this has two unfortunate consequences for tetris worlds theres no high score table and no way to save your preferences
the latter is particularly unfortunate if you decide you hate some of the new features and wish to turn them off  youll have to do so every time you fire up the gameultimately what it comes down to is this if you like tetris and want some variety tetris worlds will most likely satisfy you
is it the greatest tetris game ever
no but it is a good one
i originally bought it just for the cascade tetris mode but ive found the other variations growing on me as well
ive sunk far too many hours into this game that could have otherwise been spent being productive and in that regard this is indeed a good tetris gamei rented this game for my ps
its graphics were okay and its gameplay was great
the only problem was that sometimes it is hard to see whether your shot went in the net or not
otherwise i think that this is a pretty cool game
i advise nba lovers to rent this game before buying it in case they are not satisfied with itwhen i bought the new installment of nba live for the ps i was expecting it to be a good game but to my dissatifaction its not what i expected
the camera angles arent that great the commentating blows and the gameplay is ok at best
graphically the game is on point however graphics alone cannot make a good game
my first basketball experience was nba k following nba k on dc perhaps thats what im used to
in terms of a complete basketball game in my opinion nba live lacks it i personally am waiting for the nbak to come for the ps next yeargt thats what a basketball should benow that ea has released their new version of fifa featuring the world cup mode buyiong this is knid of obsolete
there is a solid soccer game here but it all feels very outdated
although this is cheaper it is not as good
graphics are fine but the gameplay is what saves this title
it is precise and gives you plenty of control
however this feels a little bland
it is good but try to pick up world cup insteadthis game is in keeping with eas current trend of making more arcadestyle games rather than sports simulations
if youre looking for a fun time playing soccer pick it up
its got great graphics all the teams you could possibly want and easy controls
if you want a real soccer game ie
scores like  and  then go online and find yourself a version of championship manager for the pc or one of the plethora of other great realistic soccer games they have in europeokay
these is a memory card
you need one to save games
also they cost way to much considering theyre at least  years old
also theyre surprisingly hard to find
im not sure whats up with thatthere is no question that this is a awsome color but it is still the same old standered playstation memory card
you still have a hard time finding space on the card when you want to save if you have an expansive game collection like me and i would assume many other people
i still recommend one of those bigger memory cards where you can store games and not have to delete one of your precious savesim on a new game kick right now so you might notice my page has many game reviews crunched together
i am trying to find that just right game
if you have a  yr old or are an adventure game beginner this game is sure to delight
its literally a junior version of myst
it is riddled with beautiful graphics rich color and has a great mystical story line
unfortunately for all of us average gamers who did solved the fantiscally frustrating myst a while ago this is not for us
the games puzzles are too simple many times unrelated to the plot and frankly i just cant see it holding an advanced gamers attention for more than an hour
its just too easy
i give it  stars for a junior player but  for youngaverage adults
dont waste your money
since i am testdriving a few others after this please feel free to check my page here at amazon for the others i try out you know for that perfect game fitthis game has really good graphics and great musicthe animal noises such as the beesthe frogs and jungle birds are awesomei rate it about average compared to other gamesit is not as hard as necronomicon and several othersit is still fairly challenging howeverme and my girlfriend enjoyed a saturday playing this game
while not the greatest game it was worth the time and energy spent
very linear in play and not to hard to figure out
a myst type game but no where near as challengingokay okay this game wasnt the best but sure wasnt the worst i admit i was quite entertained when playing it the reason i gave it  stars was because sometimes it gotten boring where i did not want to play it and on top of that it was easy like all super hero games in my opinion this game would most likely make a great rental but if you want to buy then dont waste your cash but for me being a critic i give this adventure  stars enjoy i hope they make sequelsif you like comics and the updated style of batman cartoons youll really like the look of this game
the art directors did a great job keeping the feel of the show and the video inbetweens cinematics are really good
in fact getting to see the next one is incentive to keep playing
and while the ingame graphics obviously arent as polished as the prerendered parts theyre still pretty good staying true to the cartoon
the opening mix of gameplay and cinematics is very dramaticthe controls could be better
particularly when youre flying the batplane or driving the batmobile
in fact the batplane section so far has been the weakest part of the game for me with the batmobilecar chase a close second
plus running around quakestyle shooting batarangs is a little boringsome of the ingame directions could use work too
some objectives arent particularly clear at firstthey should have tested the gameplay on people who didnt work on itmy hope is that response will be strong enough for a streamlined sequel with better overall controls deeper fighting combinations and the ability to batgrapple wherever youd like
the game isnt particularly hard and it felt kinda lame beating up mr freezes thungs who are all young women
who manage to be tougher than jokers big thugsessentially this game isnt nearly as puzzle oriented as tomb raider but it makes up for it somewhat in overall style
if you see it used for  definitely pick it up
each star is worth i got my copy of batman right after release day ive finished the game but not after almost throwing my ps out the windowthe premise for the game itself is confusing  there are  separate story lines that are supposed to be drawn together by the cinematic sequences between levels
but they bounce back and forth with no explanationmy second beef is with some of the levels  namely gasworks  what a pain
im all for games that challenge skill level but jeez i spent hours and hours trying to get through this one and im hardly a novice to tough games
this level highlights the fact that the game developers really didnt seem to be going for any type of continuity or intuitive basis for their workthe game looks great though and i hope that theyll continue to develop the series with stuff a little more exciting
it look felt and played like spiderman did for the ps well see how they do with the next installment its definitely not intended for the younger ones
it really is just too difficult
im  and i loved playing it loved some of the challenging jumps and timing moves and puzzels
i thought it compared pretty close to tomb raider with some other neat features added inhowever my friends yearold who eats and sleeps batman and superman played it for about an hour and handed me the controller at least a halfdozen times to help him out before becoming frustrated and moved on to a different gameif this is for a younger gamer rent firstthis is a fairly decent remake of batman and his adventures in gotham
the plotline attempts at metal gear solid but the story is far too predictable
the controls are slightly awkward and sporadic
batman moves similarly to lara croft in tomb raider chronicles and you have to constantly adjust the camera with the r button
but batman is more hyper than lara and runs exceptionally fast
you have to control his movements with finesse
the music in the game is also wellselected and gets you into the whole batman episode that you are attempting to defeat
the action of beating up thugs and bosses is actually fairly decent but the whole jumping puzzles are plain annoying
and please be prepared to do a lot of jumping puzzles in this game
another major flaw is the control of the vehicles the batplane and batmobile
the batplane is like flying a simulator eg ace combat star wars rebel assault etc
however the batmobile is just plain clumsy
the batmobile can only drive within specific streets and you dont have the ability to explore gotham
the sound effects are also done pretty well with the thugs sounding like the show
furthermore the save feature could be worked upon
there is really no ingame saving like metal gear solid
lastly you really dont have the freedom to explore the city as i expected
in this way the freedom of the game resembles metal gear solid tomb raider or any of the other actionadventure titles out therealthough this game isnt great its worth money
the cinematics are well worth it with the voices of kevin konroy and mark hamill
even the lipsynching of the characters are welldone
although this game is no spiderman it does fulfill the batman quota  barely with very little room to sparebatman vengence ranks only slightly higher than the ps game orphen which i cannot even give away and for the same reasons just less severethere are two problems that keep this game from being a great game besides the pathetic gameplay
the first is too many fmvs full motion videos and not enough play
it seems like  of the time i am looking at a movie or a progressbar i hate watching statusbars anyone who is in electronic prepress knows why
and if that wasnt bad enough the graphics are not the quality one should expect of a ps gamebut i took  hours on this one  i like some of the puzzles and the only boss that kinda got to me was mister freeze this game was a walk through i enjoy being a dark crusader  it has its set backs the graphics sucks and the story was less than interesting the gas works was fun my friends overated the difficulty this game was fun not the best out there but worht playing rent it i wish i did i actually bought it so good luck laterzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzjade cocoon is cute
graphics are above average
creating strange looking beasts was interesting
the girl rock stars are adorable
on the other side of the coin the cartoon bubbles depicting the characters while speaking are redundant and annoying
lack of variety in characters movements is boring
in my opinion the creaters of this game should have rated this game for a younger crowd
its too slow for a mature gameri really liked the concept  a society forced to live deep under a mostly dead ocean but the gameplay needs work
in aquanox a mixture of underwater combat and trading you fight for pay that you use to upgrade your shipthe one thing that struck me about this game was the interface it reminded me of elite an old favorite
the control setup has a bug in it however the game likes to reset your joystick settings but proper setup is crucial for a successful sortie in your subi agree with most of the reviewers about the voice acting its really goofy
some actors are really good others are terrible
the sub combat phase of the game is fun although not very innovative
the weapons are fairly fun to use i liked polishing off enemies with torpedoesin conclusion its worth the discounted price but dont expect anathing newthe premise of aquanox is pretty interesting
because of the destruction of our planets atmosphere humans are now forced to live deep underwater in the oceans of the world
you are flint a mercenary with ethics and issues your sub along with all of its equipment has been stolen
now you have to take on pretty much any mission that will get you some credits all the while youre trying your best to track down the bastards that stole your submarinethe graphics are ok given the date of release of the game but im not a big fan of the soundtrack way too heavy to the point that the screaming male voice gets annoying and you end up turning the volume downthe game is cheap nowadays but still my recommendation to you is to just go for aquanox  much betteri use to play tetris constantly on my old nintendo system when i was a kid
tetris worlds is a newer version that offer a few new backgrounds but nothing else
the game can be fun but it isnt very challenging
i only paid  for the ps game at a thrift store so im happy about the purchase even though the game isnt perfectim not all that crazy about tetris worlds because of the new style of game play
im not all to fond of the mission modes that tetris has now
it still plays like the original you drop block and other shapes and the objective is to clear lines and get the four line score called a tetris
the graphics are pretty good and the backgrounds are pretty cool as wellim still going to give this a  even though i originally wanted to do give it a  
i still think its closer to  than it is to  but for those of you that love the series this is for you and you might enjoy this one
this is a great title for younger gamers because the game is very easy to play and the game is really never the same twice
in any case for you older gamers rent this one first and for all you younger gamers check out this oneever since i first played tetris on the gameboy i was hooked
it was an insanely addictive game simple to play but challenging to master
this past year i picked up a copy of the game for the original nintendo nes and i found the game to be just as fun and addictive as i remembered more than a decade ago
when i saw that tetris was available on the ps i was interested in picking up the game
it would be fun for my fianceacute and i to play the game together
unfortunately this game didnt live up to the standard set by its bit predecessorin addition to the classic tetris there are several other ways to play tetris in this game
they all work from the same basic formula of various block shapes falling and needing to be manipulated to form lines
what is different is the goals of each game
some games require you to form combinations of the same colored blocks others like cascade allow blocks that become unattached after a line clears to drop down permitting new scoring combinations
initially these new games were interesting but i found myself craving the classic tetris
that is here too  but the blocks on the screen are rather small and there is now an option to play with a time limiteven if i didnt like the new tetris games i expected that i would be as addicted to the classic tetris
i wasnt
i dont know what was changed but the game just wasnt as fun and addicting and yet i can play the nes version today and still get wrapped up in the game
this game doesnt seem to be as fast the screen is way too small and whatever was changed causes the game to be not as good
its the same tetris but the updates detract from the game rather than add to it
i cant recommend this
i would suggest you find a nes or a gameboy and play the original
ill be much more fun to playbeing a tetris fan i picked up this game expecting to love it
well i like it but i find the original version better
tetris worlds allows you to play in one of two modes the arcade or story mode
there are tutorials and a history of the game that you can choose to watchin the story mode you can choose the classic tetris of the following options square cascade sticky hot line and fusion
each option has a different background setting
there are five characters to choose from mekukaka okume nikikonu anonunu and umekume sound hawaiian to me
in the arcade mode you play the regular or multiplayer option and try to clear a certain number of lines within a time limit
these game go much faster than the original game of tetrisso bottom line the game has a lot of different options but fans of the orginal version of tetris may be in for a letdown
one other thing
this is a blue disc game but it works fine on my psthe wheel acted like if it had a mind of its own
when i used this wheel to play test drive racing game it apparantly tried to fight off my grip and against my correct direction by using its own preference
it also behaved like that when i loaded up test drive to try out the wheel
its so scary to know that some insideous life form is inside this wheel
other than that the wheel will not work with other games as one critic correctly claimed
so i agree with him that this wheel will only work for test drive though it will not work much with the other test drive  and offroad as i thought it would
i gave this three star rating because frankly i would somewhat be reluctant to purchase a replacement because of this forboding experience with the wheel with a spooky personality of its ownthis wheel is way over priced for what you get
it is uncomortable to put on your lap doesnt work with enough games due to a lack of analogdigital conversion
it doesnt have a shifter and the pedals move around
if you want a good wheel i suggest the mad catz mc
cheaper better
dont be fooled into buying this load of well you get the point
cyafirst of all i love this wheel except for a couple of flaws
the steering wheel is awesome in design and layout
the thing that i really dont like about this wheel is the fact that this wheel cannot shift up or down when going into or coming out of a corner
this makes me use automatic which i am not a big fan of
the other thing is that the steering wheel is too ergonomic
you can only put your hands in one position
i guess what i am saying is that for  bucks it should be much better and is not worth the money at allwhat you just read was the review beforeafter further using this wheel i raise the rating to a  i still find it much more fun than not using it for gt
oh as for the people who say it isnt realistic give me a break
how many of you actually have driven a car going  miles an hour around a sharp curve
well i am a racer and this is not totally realistic but it is somewhat realistic for my tastethe original mega man x for the super nes is an incredible action game that held up extremely well through the years
how does mega man x stand up
not as fun as the first one mostly because capcom took a backseat with the action and put the storyline upfront
i prefer action over storyline any day of the week so you can bet its disappointing to me
but because its mega man and mega man games have more action than paris hilton its fun to play no matter what
but x isnt crammed with action like the first x game and thats just not rightin x the music is less catchy
you dont feel like humming any of the stage themes after you turn off the game except for one in a sigma stage
most of the weapons mega man receive from defeating a stage boss arent interesting to look at but at least a few of them have some power
in fact some of the weapons are just as bad as the ones found in x in terms of how they look and the damage they do
you see if a weapon doesnt look good its important for it to at least do some damage to make up for its awful appearance
in x you have weapons that are weak and crappylookingeach of the eight stages fall short compared to the ones in the original x because of empty levels i hate when theres nothing around to shoot
thanks to the special chip in the game you have to encounter a lot of frustrating slowdown
thankfully the slowdown mostly occurs while youre fighting a boss and not when youre busy dash jumping through the levels
unfortunately the volcano level is loaded with obnoxious slowdownthis isnt a big complaint but there isnt a snow level to be found in x
you have to have a snow levelyou will notice other problems some minor others major such as the boss explosions are colored blue now instead of red like in the original
i hope you guys know what im talking about because its hard to explain
after you kill a stage boss and watch the explosion its blue instead of red
i think red is better suited for an action game so im kind of disappointed with the bluecolored explosionsthe final fight with sigma is a joke
come on its definitely possible to defeat him without needing to use a single subtank and you can carry up to four tanks
theres a lot of slowdown fighting him too especially the second half of the fight
the difficulty fighting sigma in the original x was just right but not in xthe good news is that x is more challenging than the original and x and x for that matter
most of the challenge isnt in the boss battles but collecting those subtanks and heart capsules which are quite often located in hardtoreach places
many times in x missing a subtank or heart capsule will result in an instant death even after many hours of practice
i like this
those early x games need a challengeif you want an x game with really catchy music fun and neatlooking weapons levels loaded with a variety of enemies to shoot and not much in the way of slowdown than please go with the original mega man x  the original beats x in nearly every wayplus the price for the original is much cheaper
if youre sitting out there angry because x is really expensive and you are eager to experience the game dont worry its not as good as the first one
plus you can always experience x through that mega man game that was recently released on the playstation  and nintendo gamecube where you can play all the x games
im pretty sure they kept the game as close to the original x as possiblea couple of years ago i bought road rage and i finally decided to share my thoughts on this fun but not very good game
so far the simpsons franchise has released many games
the simpsons is the longes running and best tv
series in history but the games unfortunately are not one for the record books
many years ago in the early s the simpsons for arcades was released
the game was quite fun but did not capture the feel of the simpsons
then came the simpsons wrestling for the playstation
the game was fun but got boring quickly very similar to road rage
and as far as the simpsons skateboarding goes i wont even get into how bad that game is
now the problem with road rage is that it is not a fresh formula
instead it is merely a crazy taxi clone with the simpsons
while the game was as enjoyable as crazy taxi any fan of crazy taxi became bored because they had already played the same game in a different style
road rage is not a bad game it just really doesnt give the simpsons video games that extra boost that they need
the simpsons hit and run was recently released
check out my preview on that
it is just like vice city except in the simpsons world
of course it is not as violent
however hit and run is the best simpsons game ever made so get that instead of road rage
but i wont lie to you
any hardcore fan of the series should give road rage a look even just a rental
but get hit and run instead
nuff said
this is one game that marge would frown at and bart would love
decide which you are likemy ratingroad rage is simply crazy taxi with the simpsons liscense
you drive around springfield with various simpsons characters and taxi them to where they need to go
its nice for crazy taxi fans because you get a lot of territory to explore and play in but the levels just arent as much fun as the game that inspired them
there are no great moments like cts san fran hills and the streets in road rage tend to look all alikethe simpsons liscense isnt used as well as it could have been here
the cars look celshaded but nothing else is and it gives the game a kinda confused bland look to it
driving around springfield to see the church or the elementary school  or other famous places from the show is not at all compelling mainly because they often dont look like the show at all
each character has a few comments to say to every other character so there is alot to hear but only some of it is funny or even in characterthe storymission mode is the weakest and also highlights the games big weakness its loooooong load times
i often had to wait  minutes to play a  second drill which is just stupid and totally kills the game
stick to taxi moderent this game unless you are a major simpsons or crazy taxi fanive always injoyed the simpons but this game gets old fast
because you dont have any change of back ground and after so long of running over the same things rocks stop sighens other cars lawns childern over and over agian the game gets lame and the missions are hard to beat
however the the graphices on road rage is very goodrent this first before you buyim getting really depressed how many bad games are coming out of one of my favorite tv shows of all time the simpsons
as soon as you see the box youll basically get the picture its a crazy taxi rip off with a plot thats a little thinthe good parts first the graphics are very cool
all the simpsons characters are faithfully recreated and they look very good
the cars you drive are kinda cell shaded all though the game doesnt really have that look
like i said before its basically a crazy taxi rip off so there is some fun to be had ferrying people from place to placeand now the bad the graphics are good but to me instead of looking like a cartoon it looks like they just got tired of drawing and left it uncomplete
the voices of the simpsons are included but they repeat way way way too much i played the game the first time for  minutes and must have heard the same thing  or  times over
not only the voices are overused but also the sound effects
when you hit a tree it makes the same sound as when you hit a carthe collision detection is a whole other story
sometimes its hard to get in an ally or around a building when you can see your car is like a foot away from the edge
with todays technology theres no excuse for thatto sum it up this is crazy taxi with the simpsons added and the fun taken out
rent it first if at all
do your self a favor and go out and get crazy taxi instead and play one of the simpsons cds while you playthis game was a lot of fun when i first got it
the graphics are very nice and all the characters are in it
it is just like crazy taxi so if you liked that youd like this game
i just love driving up to bumble be man and here him sayquotay chiuauaquot just before i run him down
a big problem with this game is replay value
i can get very old very quickly because of the repetative gameplay
i would rent this a couple times and if you still like it as muck as you first played it then you should buy itas a die hard simpsons lover i had to pick this game up
especially with the cheap copied games here in koreaanyhow all the voice acting in this game is done by the real actors and includes almost all the simpsons cast
from homers love for doughnuts to barneys loveable burps
only person i think they should have included is sideshow bob but krusty is still here to keep us companyok heres the major drawback
the idea of the game is to save springfield from cwburns new nuclear powered buses by the players becoming taxi drivers for the residents of the town
ok rip off of crazy taxi but its the simpsons you cant loose
unless of course the entire game becomes repetitive and monotonous
as you pick up the players and ferry them to their destination you earn money
the goal is  million bucks and you unlock new cars and locations along the way
well you find yourself doing the same location over and over whichever one youre familiar with and with whichever car you feel is the fastest
over and over and over again
they should have thrown in a few more extras and options to break up the monotony but the only thing to keep you company are the players hilarious wisecracksall in all pick this one up if you love the simpsons
no other reason reallyi enjoyed this game but after awhile it got old
i definately recommend it just to mess around not to be taken seriously
the voices are good and it has decent graphics
this is a game to get to keep your kids entertained for hoursthis game is fun especially if youre a simpsons fan
basically you race around springfield as one of up to  characters and in one of six locations picking up people and racing to drop them off somewhere else on time sometimes avoiding hitting other cars sometimes trying to devastate the town to earn extra time and money
as you earn money by driving people around you unlock the locations and characters
there are also some missions in which you basically try to run over a certain number of objects in a certain span of time
the ultimate goal is to earn a million dollars about  attempts to run mr burns nuclear buses out of businessthe game is quite fun out of the box
apparently the actors recorded speech for the game and the quips are amusing if occasionally non sequiturs
the cars are amusing and springfield is amazingly detailed
for a fan its especially entertaining as it contains a lot of side references to the series that you will appreciate if you are a devotee
those not terribly fluent in the simpsons will still like it you wouldnt be buying it if you didnt like the show but wont appreciate the little details a simpsons nutcase like myself willhowever the fun wears off rather quickly
the game is repetitive
and the victory animation is disappointing
the missions are especially poor  you figure out what path to take in order to complete the mission in the alloted time then keep doing it over and over and over again until you get it right
boringit might be worth buying if you really like driving games
but i would highly recommend renting before you committhe simpsons road rage starts off really fun and exciting
the premise of the game is that mr burns has bought the springfield bus transit system and its causing more chaos in springfield than normal
so the citizens led by homer decide to fight back and buy back the bus system
they start their own taxi service and need to raise a million dollars to buy the buses back from burns
there are a total of six levels five of which can be unlocked as you earn more money
also as you earn more money you can unlock more vehicles
different characters drive the different vehicles
as you drive along you can smash into lots of different things knocking over trees billboards mailboxes signs etc
this game is great to play if youre a simpsons fan because you get to see springfield in much more detail than you do on the show
the negatives about the game are that it is quite repetitive and it takes an extensive long haul or a tedious intensive amount of game play depending on how much time you have and youre gaming style to beat the game
the sayings each character says are funny at first but after the th time of hearing the characters say the same thing it becomes somewhat annoying
also you have to have  game cards to play the multiplayer mode and when you only have one game card and two people want to play it can be aggravating
the game also has a slow load up time so that after you finish a round it takes about  minutes before you get to play againthere is a mission mode on the game as well
it consists of  differet missions that are fairly easy to beat i thought grandma at the dam and homer at burns mansion were the most difficult levels
if you beat all  levels a secret vehicle is unlockedthe simpsons road rage can be a lot of fun to play
its basically an average racing video game thats more interesting because of the characters and setting
however it would make a nice gift for any simpsons fan and is fun to play on a rainy dayi bought this game a couple of years ago because i read good things about it
i played it for about half an hour and was sick as a dog
i love puzzle games but the way that the camera angle constantly changes it is nothing short of nauseating
my motherinlaw and i both have this game and have had to leave it on the shelf because we get sick from playing
this is not the only game that does this to me so ive had to be very selective in what games i select to buy and play
i dont recall this being a problem in the past but im sure that there are several out there that wouldnt expect a video game to make them sick but beware if you have any type of motion sickness whatsoever this game is not for youi must first admit that i havent spent a weekend playing herdy gerdy
i tried it for a few hours and heres my reactionthe art direction on this game is really great
core should be really proud of themselves
particularly the cinematicsim impressed with the amount of facial animation they put into lil gerdythe person who says this game has the worst graphics ever has no idea what hes talking about
this game has a great traditional animation feel without the obligatory toonshaded lines
i was really impressedi found the gameplay however to be a bit frustrating
the herding aspect proved tricky and i found myself getting more disinterested than compelled to keep on goingin fact i was more interested in just watching than playing
but maybe thats because im a little bit older
the mixed reviews are probably going to kill this game but if youre an animator or art director worth your salt youll be sure to pick up this game and give it a good lookherdy gerdy was a fun game dont get me wrong but its far from perfect
first of all the gameplay consists of herding animals with various types of objects
the storyline actually isnt so bad and the music is greatdifferent from any other game but the game can get boring pretty fast
its a bit to hard and that is what makes this game so frusturating
when i first got this game i played it quite often and got about  done
but then i got stuck and no matter how many times id try i could not get past that part
i sometimes still will go back to playing that game but i have never been able to get past the part i got stuck at about  years ago
on the other hand this game is a nice wholesome game that is suitable for younger kidsit only took me a few hours to realize that herdy gerdy wasnt the game for me
the camera as many others before have mentioned moves practically uncontrollably around gerdy making gameplay irritating and much less fun than it would be otherwisealthough the premise is interesting original and fun the irritating controlls and agrivating excess camera motion make for an unpleasant gaming experience
also spending at least half an hour herding animals and solving puzzles to open a door that requires  completion only to not be able to find the door you have opened often times leaving the level and losing all your progress gets very annoying
after taking all the animals halfway across a level it is no fun to go back through to do it all over againthis game may be good for kids in homes with no violence rules but i miss the days where chances were any game you pick up met that description
if youre looking for a good nonviolent game pick up a lemmings title not thisby far this is the best thps game with amazing graphics and tricks there is no reason to not enjoy it
this game was very fun while it lasted
only  levels with  easy missions what were the creaters thinking
i dont know
if they come out with a fourth tony hawk make at least  level with at least  difficult missions
that it why i only gave it  stars it was a fun game but it was too short
if you get tired of it play it with your friends while you are stonedif you put all your other gmaes aside you can easily beat this game is  hours
i did all  challenges in the first level in  runs
the second level in about  the level canada is too good to be true
i easily got  points in it
this is how to go straight and turn right when u can
go off the half pipe and do a kickflip melon grab to revert to a nose manual  flip and blunt slide grind that rail land in a manual then do a kickflip
tat should give you about  when thats done do the same about  times just instead of melon do another grab trick so the points would add upi got to the last level in  minutes
then the last level is frustrating
i finally beat it and put the game aside
i reached for gta and wasted  another  hours with thatif ur looking for a short game buy thisif ur looking for a super fun and challenging game get gta
if u dont have gta then u dont have a ps becuase a gta and vice city make a ps the best systemi was a huge fan of thps on dreamcast
i think i beat the game with every character and opened up all the secret levels
so naturally when i bought my ps i ran out and grabbed thps
well at first it was great
same great style and fun to play but after i gotinto it i realized that it was just the same game in some new levels
now the levels were more creative than s but they were not as compelling to play
in fact i downright hated many of the levels you got to
there were few improvements over  just the revert eveyone talks about and the createapark was pretty much the same
i never really got into this version and i beat it through in a few days and gave it on to a friend
i cant wait to pick up thps because that is where they really make strides in bettering this already great seriesi dont know what i was expecting when i ran out to the store and got thps the day of its release
maybe i was hoping for great graphics like madden  or maybe the storyline of metal gear solid
when i got home and popped in the game i was disappointed from the first board all the way to the last level which i got to in the same night
thps builds on the exact same stuff that was packed into thps
in fact i would call thps an addon pack except for the online capability which no one has yet
the graphics havent changed much and neither have the moves
secrets and hidden areas are far and few betweeni found them to be more abundant on thps
needless to say after a day of playing this game its going back
perhaps gta will keep my interest longer or maybe even fingernails on a chalkboard
bottom lineif youre looking from an upgrade from thps dont get your hopes up
if youre looking for more scenery for thps this is the game to getthe graphics and controls are great while the audio really blows away any other flight game ive played
however the game can be played through in a matter of hours and it does get rather repetitive bombing and bombing and bombingi highly recommend this game  for a weekend rentali played this game half year ago and i have to say for me an ace combat  fan this game comes as a bit of dissapointment
not that its not good or anything its just not as good as i expected it would be
for one thing it does not has a fasinating storyline as ac had
the players cannot interact with the world like what we did in ac we merely see the story unravels from two points of view and the story is really way too simple
and the result is the game is really short you can beat it under  hours if you have played its predecessor or you are an experienced gamerthis is one of the few flight sim fixes you can get on the ps but flight sim fans be warned this is not a true flight sim
its a bit quotarcadiequot to be a simi liked this game right up to the second to the last battle
the whole quotmegalithquot thing rubbed me the wrong way
in fact so did the stone henge thing too
i would have prefered more realistic campaigneswhat it comes down to is this is a warning for flight sim fans to rent this title firstwwf smackdown just bring it has great gameplay and grapics
but graphics are not everything
although this game has over  matches and over  wwf superstars the story mode is very very poor
i know as a wrestling fan this is probably the most important mode in a wrestling game
you pick a wrestler and then you try to go out and win a title
after you win a title you have to go out and defend it
not in this game
in past smackdown games for playstation  has an enhanced story mode
i am dwelling on this because its the funnest thing to do in wrestling
although the story mode is poor who wouldnt want over  matches
this is a very fun game thoughreading the early reviews of this game i got angry at all the negativity surrounding it
i loved the first smackdown games and figured the next generation on ps had to be fabulousbut now that ive had the game and played it for awhile i can see where they were coming fromfirst off the game is graphically beautifulthe only exception perhaps being the d crowd which looks pretty silly when your character goes into the crowd to fight
entrances are true to what you see on tv and the music amp videos on the titantron are fabulous
the createawrestler mode is big with tons of options even some you need to unlock
there are dozens of game modes including royal rumble which can now handle around  in the ring at the same time and hell in a cell with tagteams fatal ways and even a pack type matchit rocks to climb to the top of the ring and fight or jump off and pancaking tazz through the top of the cage was awesome
the many other modes are great and will provide variety in gameplaythe story mode is the main part of the gameyou pick a character and guide them through to the title
trouble is the title is usually only  matches awaytoo short
a careerseason mode would do better
you can walk around the arena at certain times but this is generally pretty pointless as you usually are just looking for a tag team partner and once you find one nobody else is around the building giving you nothing interesting to docontrols are not that great as trying to find a specific opponent can be rough
you can attack your partner or the ref and you will frequently do this accidentally during a match because you cant quite tell who you just scrolled to
in matches where you have multiple opponents this can cost you the match as you could get squashed by your true opponent while trying to find another
personally i often find myself launching a simple kick or punch when i think im close enough then wind up missing altogether and getting nailedperhaps its a perception problem on my part but this adds to the frustration factorcommentating from tazz amp michael cole is okrepetitive and pointless often quotfillinthewrestlers nameis different from other superstarsquot and other piecedtogether phrases dont make much sense but i learned to ignore the commentators after awhile ps  tazz does commentary for his own matchesoverall this game entertained me but wont have the shelf life it couldshould have
the create amp exhibition modes somewhat make up for a lackluster story mode but you can only have so many meaningless exhibition matchesgood for multiplayer games as a oneplayer will wind up collecting dust after a few weeksfirst of all i just have to say im a wwf fan
i watch all their shows all the time
this game is the best wwf game there is so farthe hair on wrestlers with long hair kane yj lita are just joke
they look d and seem out of place from the rest of the body
the characters themseleves look close enough to the real person
the character animation is goodpthe controls take awhile to get used to
i prefer fighting in one on one battles instead of fighing more people because its really hard to fight more than one person
its hard to tell who youre locked on to and you may just end up fighting the refthe story mode is a joke
you fight  or  matches before it ends
some story
you get a little branching paths to deside which belt you want but theyre all basically the same
the only reason you would want to keep playing it is to unlock the secret items
there are a lot of matches in the game
tag royal rumble hell in the cell tlc iron man i quit etc
this is the part you would probebly play the most
its funner to just  play those matches instead of the story modethe last thing in this game is the create a superstar mode
you can unlock extra things from the story mode to add to your characterfor my final say this game is just fun to play with your friends or once in awhile
it gets boring quick
in order to improve this game they need to make the story mode much better and longer
the wwf type storylines you see on tv are no where to be found in this game
i was hoping you would get to go to all the ppvs and shows
instead you do raw smackdown wrestlemania and then thats the end
wwf fans should not waist their money to just play as their favorite wrestlers
save it for the expensive ppvs insteadive bought a tons of wrestling games ever since the first wrestlemania on sega gensis came outso i like to think of myself as a wrestling game guru
this game had high hope in my opinion until i got home from work and put it into my pssure the graphics and entrances are close to realistic but the story lines sucksit the same thing over and over again
that definately will have to change
the sound is alright but the commentary needs a tune up as well
to hear michael cole say anything is allowed in the singles match makes me think i can bust the guy open with stairs so i go and get the stairs throw them in the ring and nail the hell out of on my opponent and i get disqualified
ok well he said anything was allowedsee where im going with this
this wrestling game was definately under par compared with the  coming out for gcubewatch out for raw and wrestlemania  coming soonsmackdown just bring it is somewhat of a bittersweet game as there are good things about it and bad things about it
when i played the game for the first time many years ago i was quite impressed with it but as time went on i began noticing flaws with itlets start off with gameplay
the gameplay is smoother faster and easier to control than the previous  smackdown games making matches overall more enjoyable to play
they make reversing much easier to do with the simple press of the square button on cue
storing finishers is still an option as welli was a bit disappointed not to see any alliance superstarsdivas like rvd booker t hurricane stacy keibler torrie wilson etc make it into the game
i know the cut off date is usually wrestlemania but they had time to add in the smackdown fist arena which didnt debut until august  so im a little lost as to why at least  wcw superstars didnt make the game
so it basically makes the whole gameroster based off of early  rather than mid  there were a few minor superstars missing from the game such as xpac justin credible rtc steven richards is the only member in the game chyna haku kaientai etc but it doesnt really take away anything as the absence of these characters is hardly noticeable unless you really pay attentionthere is no jr and paul heyman in this game as commentary is done by michael cole and tazz
the commentary is this game is rather awkward and mediocre
cole and tazz sound like robots and the fact that they werent given any better dialogue for the commentary in this game is unacceptable
for example if im playing say billy gunn vs edge michael cole will say something like edge
is a really nice guy and if im playing a match like the rock vs kurt angle tazz may say something like kurt angle
was great the other day and then hell go on to say something like the rocks the peoples elbow is great its just awkward robotic commentary that makes it hard to listen to while youre playing matchesthe season mode is fun but its way too short
each story doesnt last more than about  or  matches
some less than that
the player has the option of challenging for or defending all titles including the womens championship
all wrestlers on the exhibition roster are playable in season mode
so if i want i can take rikishi and have him challenge for the hardcore title while i can play as lita and have her defend the womens championship against one of the divas
if you decide to challenge for a title thats not the tag team titles the story starts out on raw with a superstar coming to the ring and calling out the champion
you come out and have the option of either talking trash to that superstar or running to the ring and engaging in a short  minute unsanctioned fight with himher
there are plenty of fun things to do in story mode most of them based off of actual wwf storylines that happened at the time
really fun but way too short
if thq took the time to give players a year long story mode rather than being lazy it couldve been one of the best season modes but unfortunately it falls flat as being decent
as you play though season mode the more matches you win the most things you unlock such as arenas superstars move sets videos etc
did i mention that fred durst is a playable character in the gameone of my favorite things about this game is the theater section in the main menu that features a couple of videos you can watch once you unlock them
they include the smackdown commercial as well as behind the scenes footage of the commercial smackdown  know your role commercial and behind the scenes footage of the commercial credits that are first shown when you complete the wwf championship route of season mode and recent greatest smackdown moments that shows clips of  smackdown momentsoverall unfortunately a  out of  stars is as generous as its going to get from me
the gameplay the theater the decent sized roster and the entertainment of season mode earns this a  stars
the lack of duration effort for season mode and the overly awkward commentary deducts  stars from making this game a full on  stars
thqyukes would improve the following year with smackdown shut your mouth but just bring it is an okay gameok let me tell you about the good things first
the entrances are the best ive ever seen
the graphics are great
the gameplay isnt perfect but hardly any of it is
you can do a lot of moves and with all the different matches hardly ever get tired of itnow for the bad
it without a doubt has the worst story line ever
you have to do all sorts of different things to get a certain title shot and when you do win the title the story mode is over
as far as i know you cant win more then one title with the same person
the comentary is terrible
same thing over and over again and it is all pieced together
this game is great with the exception of the story mode
i would recommend it to wrestling fans but just play the exhibition matches because the story mode is very disappointingsmack down just bring it has  different matches
but they times it by including nd rd and th playersmackdown wrestler look eregular with blocky facessmack wont allow you to fight in the crowd or bleed like raw iswarraw is war will be the besti went back and played this game not too long ago
i was shocked to see that i was actually enjoying myself
using jeff hardy is still as fun as i remember it to be
the only bad thing about this game is the brutal commentary by michael cole and tazzwhen tony hawks pro skater just came out on playstation back in i bought it and loved itthen came the much improved tony hawks pro skater  which i still play more than any other tony hawk game  i havewhen this came out in october i bought it and thought it was dissapointingfirst of allit has a big amount of pop up that wasent in thps or that can sometimes confuse youplus the loading is slower then the other games in the seriesand the levels need to be more interactive and improvedthe create a skater isnt anything special because you still cant create female skatersplus it needs more new improvements besides new tricksbut on the bright sideits goodcleanfunthe controls work goodathough not as responcive as thps or and multiplayer is a blast to play with a friend or enemyalsodoing goals through out each level is very addictiveand this game has alot of replay valuebut stillit has alot of unusual flawsbut it also has a good sidei would suggest renting this first to see if its the game for youeven for hardcore tony hawks pro skater fanslego racers  is but another racing game in the style of mario kart though they have managed to throw in a couple of nice twists
for instance your car loses lego pieces when you bump things too hardand when you run out of pieces you have to huff it on foot
its funny to zoom past your opponents as their little lego guys run for the finish lineanother neat aspect is the ability to build your own lego character and lego car
unfortunately building lego stuff on screen isnt nearly as fun as doing it in real life
the process is slow and i found myself just grabbing premade cars insteadtheres an explore mode which allows you to drive around the landscapes talk to other characters and find bonus gameson the downside the background music is painful to listen to and the loading times are excessive
plus theres too much wordballoon talking
you can bypass the wordballoons or you can read them at their slow pacetheres no ability that i could find for quickly reading text
the nonnationalist gibberish spouted by the lego characters is also a bit annoying to listen to as you sit there waiting for the word balloonstwo player mode seemed to be oneonone only unless i missed something
it would have been nice to race against another human and the computer at the same timeits a cute game with limited playability for an older audience
im sure if i were  years old i would think this was a really great game allaroundmy son loves the game
i play with him sometimes on  player mode  i had a hard time saving the game 
it doesnt seem to have auto save which i  like so that when you get to a point  it will save automatically
my son is   loves lego anything
you can build your oun cars to drive  put them together w the parts they give you that is a great feature
for me the game could be better but its pretty good  my son gives it a great score i give it a medium score
for some reason i have to unplug the joy pad to get to the menu to move the selection to save the game
it gave me a bit of a hard time for that reason  i lowered my opinion of the game
enjoyback in the early s i had a lot of fun with wwf royal rumble
this game is a big improvement over wwf super wrestlemania because royal rumble has more wrestlers more moves and overall a much better experience
unfortunately the much better wwf raw came along shortly after its release making wwf royal rumble not as good as it first appearedits true that wwf royal rumble is closer to wwf raw than super wrestlemania
so for all you super wrestlemania haters out there fear not
in wwf royal rumble you have  classic wrestlers from the mid s some of which are still wrestling  years later such as ric flair yoko zuna crush razor ramon macho man and shawn michaelsnow even though the game engine moves much faster in royal rumble compared to super wrestlemania in addition to more moves and options i wouldnt call this game a masterpiece or anything
i think wwf raw even with its problems is far and away the better overall gamebut if wwf raw isnt available or too expensive you can always pick up wwf royal rumble and have fun with it until you pop in the superior wwf raw
the thing is wwf raw has more options such as the bedlam option where you and your partner are allowed to compete in the ring at the same time a lot more regular moves the addition of super moves and just a better game overall
so for me wwf raw is the game to buyi recently bought this game used for about  total and while i suppose it was worth that much  i do like the game  im still mildly disappointed
i know this is only an snes game i wasnt expecting it to be like a nextgen game but i was still hoping for more
while it isnt really bad  it does have some good points  it has quite a few flaws that i find kind of bothersome and that i would think could have been fixed even in an snes game
ill discuss my pros and cons with the different aspects of the game as followsthe roster it features  wwfe superstars and while it is almost completely outdated and also extremely limited by todays standards it is still pretty impressive for the guys who are on it who include macho man randy savage nature boy ric flair bret hitman hart narcissist lex luger heartbreak kid shawn michaels mr perfect curt hennig million dollar man ted dibiase razor ramon aka scott hall undertaker crush aka brian adams tatanka and yokozuna
im far less familiar with the last two than with the others
over half of these superstars macho man ric flair bret hart lex luger curt hennig crush and razor ramon would move over to wcw after this game was made
in fact undertaker is as far as i know the only one of these guys still wrestling at least in wwe
at least three of them yokozuna curt hennig and macho man are sadly no longer with us
forgive me if my history is inaccurate its been quite a while since ive watched wrestling
however while the wrestler list for this game is impressive and while there are great portraits of the wrestlers most of the character models dont really look all that much at least not to me like the wrestlers theyre based on aside from most of their attires see graphics belowgraphics ill start with the wrestler graphics
the large portraits of the wrestlers look great
most of the small portraits look good too
however a few of the small ones look a bit weird to me for a couple examples undertaker in his small portrait kind of looks like a villain from a cowboy movie and ric flair in his small one just looks psychotic
worse however are most of the character models which as i mentioned above dont bear any really strong resemblance at least not to me to the real wrestlers aside from most of the outfits they wear
most of the faces seem wrong even though you cant see them really closely some of their bodies look too broad andor buff and so on
in my opinion the one that looks most like the wrestler it represents is bret harts though undertakers looks really good too
additionally the models are all the same height
thats right  undertaker i seem to be mentioning him a lot who is easily the tallest one in real life is on the game the same height as all the others
the wrestler selection screen gives the wrestlers reallife heights but the models all being the same height is a bit of a drag at least to me
oh and by the way howard finkel looks like mean gene okerlund
as for the rest of the graphics theyre great for an snes game
the ring is a good size and although there is no commentary which is fine by me there are two very animated pardon the pun announcers whom i assume to be bobby the brain heenan and vince mcmahon behind an announce table
of course there is a very limitedly animated cheering crowd  which clearly contains some hulkamaniacs even though the hulkster isnt actually on the game
dont know if they were put in there before or after hogan was taken out but probably before
he was removed from the game before its release because he moved over to wcw
there is also a really short kind of spikyhaired referee who looks like a kid when seen from behindsound really not a whole lot to write about here but what is there is good
mostly there are the contact sounds when you or an opponent are struck or fall on the mat generic wrestler grunts the same for each wrestler cheers from the crowd and reproductions of the wrestler themesgameplay you can play singles matches tag matches triple tag matches tournaments and of course royal rumbles where you must toss your opponents from the ring
i havent played the game a whole lot at least not yet and my only real gripe about the gameplay is the limited number of moves
while each wrestler possesses his own signature move the other moves are the same for each wrestler and there really arent a lot of them or it doesnt seem like it to me
you and your opponent always face toward each other while standing unless you or the opponent are tired so you usually cant grab or do any moves on someone from behind
and you apparently cant toss your opponent into a corner
it is possible to hit the ref though
although this isnt a big thing i also find the way that the game makes you pick wrestlers to be a bit annoying
i wish the game had a more regular selection screen instead of making you scroll through them to find the one you wantoverall a pretty decent and sorta fun game i suppose
while it doesnt offer as much as i had hoped it would i dont regret shelling out that 
it would have helped though if it had at least included characters that looked more like the real wrestlersps
here are examples of how off a few of the character models are or seem to me to be ted dibiase looks much more like chuck norris mr perfect in addition to his face looking wrong looks more like hes wearing overalls than a wrestling outfit i think crushs face and hairstyle both look more like the real mr perfects shawn michaels really looks nothing like shawn michaels except for his tights for one thing in shawns portraits his hair is brown but its very blond on his model razor ramon has no hair on his face or chest although he does have in his portraits and ric flair kind of looks like a whitehaired bodybuilderapparently its marvelent on the ps since this is one of two superhero themed seqoels to grace sonys little white workhorse spiderman  is the other
unfortunatly xmen  is a bit of a letdown
granted the first game wasnt all that good either but it was a pretty good fighting game considering the fact it was done on the ps
this time however the game feels as though it was rushed out the door in order to capitalize on the pss dwindling consumer base
most franchises at this point are going to nextgen systems why didnt this
graphically the game looks identical to the first which was pretty damn good but one would expect some sort of enhancements for the sequel other than just new secret characters
as far as gameplay goes this game isnt as nearly as technical as sf third strike
thats fine though the original wasnt a hardcore fighting game either
it may appeal to hardcore xmen fans but most will want to rent firstand i think its hardly worth thatthis game is exactly like thps for gameboy advance
it is a fun game with good graphics but dont buy it if you have tony hawks pro skater this game had so much potential
i picked this title up ready for a wonderful twist on the old rts formula
to say i was disappointed would be a gross understatement
the four clans graphically are very different but the strategy is all the same
you rush to build the biggest force and rush the poor sap that hasnt got as large an army
thats it
yeah there are things like fire arrows but all the clans have something of the sort so it dosnt really matter which clan you play as
the single player campain is not bad for a rts but still needs work
to sum this game up its nothing more that warcaft with another coat of paint
it would be a great bargin bin game but i would not purchase it at its current price if i had it to do all over againthis game is pretty fun but there is little variety
i havent finished the game but so far every level is just building up enough forces and wiping out the enemy
this is like command and conquer only the natural resources are unlimited rice keeps growing water keeps flowing and the number of units you can have is limited
in each level you can only have a certain number of men around  or  so far
so its difficult to have enough men defending the village and still have a large enough attack force
that may increase the challenge but it is frustrating
it is more involved too
you have to activate abilities for them to do anything so you have to watch the fight and use the abilities at the appropriate time
in campc it was more getting together a large force and just leaving them to it or going by stealth and capturing buildings in the enemy base
a problem is that units sometimes dont react very quickly
some abilities cause this but they also do it without being afflicted by anything
also it allows you to choose to save peasants from tyranny or force them to submit to your will at the beginning
but that seemed to be the only time which disappointed me
battle realms is fun but only some of the time
it doesnt require much attention and can get old quickly
its cheap so give it a tryi respect the design team of homm for what they tried to give us
we the gamer have asked them to give us heroes that actually partake in combat new and interesting spells and a new take on game play
and they gave this to usbut where the team failed was in the true charm of homm
all of us who have played the past games know the pure joy of having a massive stack of fully upgraded black dragons cook a entire wild army with glee
and many of us can fondly remember that late game moment when those grand elves joined our army giving us  very useful warriors
these feature are lacking completly or are pared down in this gameother aspect have also seen achange
the graphics of homm are much more pastel and garish than even homm
they also lack the sharp lines and contrast of homm
worse creatures no longer have an immpressive apperance
behemouthsone of my favorites from  look like oversized moles
thunderbirds look like pastries
as an added slap to our collective faces there are now only  levels of creatures meaning that while the th level is indeed powerful it doesnt carry the same weight of the top level creatures of  and   i understand that the makers are trying to really differentiate the creature types but even though a homm minatuar was basically the same as a orge mage they were different enough that having one or the other mattered
i liked more creaturesyes the new heroes are truly immpressive
yes they add a new level of play
but they are not the world shattering move to a new era that i personally hoped for
while playing campaign heroes are really a liability
i would skirt around even the small stacks of medusas and such because  shot may kill the hero in my army thereby ending the scenerio
and fopr all their power they took up an important opening in my army one i would have liked to fill with a stack but couldnt because i needed to level up my heroat first the ability to send out armies of only creaturesno heroes in it seemed very important
but once i found that they could flag nothing and were easily ambushed i would have a hero in every army
it seemes logical that a miller would be just as willing to give his gold to a army of beholders as some hero
in the end i usually used charmed or diplomized soldiers as fodder to find out just how strong an army really wasi could go on and on about problems
but i dont need to because my fellow reviewers will
read theirs too and note those written about system problems and lack of features
but in the end if you really want to be told whether to buy this game or notsave the money for a game that you know is good and not one that may beactually liked very much this game despite general critics that not as good as heroes most concepts are similar with a few improvements and differencesgraphics are way more subtle
the fact you could use your heroes without armies brought an entire new dimensionwould rate  rd in the series affer heroes  and  that are likely ex aequothe game itself is basically a fighting game although somewhat different from the norm  its built around picking up items and throwing them at your opponent
there are also the standard kickpunch and a simple kick kick punch combo that can be employed although theyre really only useful for making your opponent drop whatever it is theyre going to throw at you since the kickpunch attacks do very little damage themselves
you can also catch some of the things your opponent throws at you although its usually nearly impossible to do as is dodging items since they pretty much lock onto you and nail you even if you try to jump out of the way
the gameplay is also spiced up with chemicalx bottles  there are normally  around at once  hit your opponent with something to make them drop one of their bottles  if you get hit you drop one  if you manage to collect all  youre given the chance to use a super power which are wildly uneven from sedusas barely damaging slime attack to the powerpuff girls eye lasers that can suck away half of their opponents life bar  in the end the gameplay boils down to a simple matter of hit the other person with something before they can hit youthe graphics presented in an overhead d adventuretype view of the battle arena are fairly good
the intro movie is excellent
powerpuff girls fans will especially enjoy seeing the shows intro in d animation  overall things are nice and colorful and do a good job of creating an atmosphere similar to the show  the sound is also good although some more soundbytes from the characters or the show would have been nicethe controls are fairly simple albeit somewhat sluggish
in fact my first impression with the game was that it was quite slow
however as you get into the game a little more the pace seems to be just about right for the gameplay style  still it can be a bit tedious at timesas for difficulty and longevity  there are several villains and arenas to unlock by playing through the story mode with each powerpuff girl
these can also be unlocked with passwords that can be found online
normally the ability to unlock secrets would add to the longevity of the game but there arent many villains to defeat and the game can be finished fairly quickly  i beat this game and unlocked all of the secrets the first night i played it  thats not to say its easyits actually fairly difficult even on easy mode probably to the point that it would frustrate some of the younger fans of the show
however with so few battles to win it becomes a matter of persistance rather than skillfighting each villain over and over until you defeat them
after you beat the game theres not much point to doing it again
then it comes down to the simulator mode a one or two player single battle game that becomes very tedious after about a day
in other words its very likely to become one of those games that sits on a shelf indefinitely after playing it for a day or twowell the bottom line is that its fun for a while
its definitely not an outstanding game
it is somewhat violentbut those of you complaining about the violence might want to try watching an actual episode of the cartoon  if youre a big fan of the powerpuff girls its probably worth buying just to dust off every once in a while watch the intro movie and play a bit  for anyone else id say it deserves a rental but youll find that even the rental period will probably outlast the enjoyment youll get from the gamethis games is the most fun of any of the games ive played on ps
my wife and i just load it up and start shooting everythingamazon drops the ball on this one they are selling the version without the gun and dont seem to be offering it anywhere on the site
you cant play the game without the light gun
the company does sell this game with a gun included  more  look for iti didnt give it  stars because its way to short
youll go through all the levels the first night you have it
but its fun youll go through the levels again and againthis game looks like it is cool and is the next goldeneyehalofor you better gamers but then you play it and well i got tired of all the worthless gadgets like quotheres a lockpick for the master of lockpickingquot there were so many gadgets it took a while to scroll through them to get through the weapons
pp  of the time
this is cool with good grapics but ea tried too hard
worth a look for fps fans but none other lots of guns and gadgets splendid talking style and  evolved nicely from goldeneye but not that much and  nice way of earning codes but arent as cool as goldeneyes graphics dont look all that great its shorter than goldeneye
 what happened to holding two guns at once
 why is it that when there is no use of the vehicle the mission ends and why dont all of them be controlled manually
unlike halo where you control them yourself all the time plus missions are far from over when you get out of themthis game features the worst ps controls ive ever seen
the levels are incredibly linear and unoriginal
the quotjames bondquot looks like a roger moore knockoff and sound like none of the movie bondsthe firstperson shooting levels were awfulthis games only saving graces were the driving sequences and the cut scenesi have yet to play a  game including goldeneye that lived up to what it could have beenthis game is worth renting but pass on buying it unless its in the bargain bineveryone knows how great goldeneye was for the n
most people will admit that the formula was taken to its lastgen limit with perfect dark
what is it that game developers can not figure out
many gamers myself included want an engaging stperson shooter that will offer a fully interactive and programmable multiplayer
the bond franchise might as well be canned after this escapade
as a previous reviewer stated the last four have been lacking in gameplay and inspiration
if the perfect dark zero game doesnt pick up the slack then im buying an xbox just to play halothat said this game does make the ps leap successfully in terms of graphics
the women are gorgeous the scenery is believable and the facial expressions of all those involved are honestly the best ive ever seen in a game
the driving levels are also quite a bit of fun
this adventure does have its merits but is too short too easy too uninteresting past five levelsi advise you pick it up used for less than 
thats about what its worth
i would love to pay  for a decent update of goldeneye that would tap the power of the ps
hohumea focused on making this feel like a bond movie and they tried too hard
the innuendo and cutscenes are so force fed that the action plays second fiddle
instead of letting enemies ambush you
cant find the grate you need to get through the leveldont worry the idiot cam will zoom to show you where it is
and if you need a keycard a half naked girl will hand it right over after you spew a pickup line of course
the gadgets also get too much facetime
youll often spend more time cycling through an endless menu of gizmos than firing your gun
many levels feel like they were designed entirely around the gadget of the week
just wait til you use the q claw cell phone that turns you into a british spiderman and theq jet that makes you look like a suitwearing rocketeer
inspector gadget anyone
to make matters worse being bond like causes the first notes of his theme to blare
shoot a barrel that explodes da da da daaaa
melt a padlock with the q laser da da da daaaa
luckily the fun multiplayer modes and spy hunter lite driving sequences arent as annoying
they make this disappointment rentable but i shouldnt have expected a lot from something subtitled agent under fire
thats like naming a nascar game racer drives fastea has yet to prove they can really do something with the powerful bond license
they have yet to produce a product as good as rares goldeneye
this is probably their best attempt yet
the driving levels are actually better than goldeneyes and the quotbond movesquot concept is interesting
but the level design is lackluster there are only  levels and the control on the fps levels is a little loose
and where is the nice goldeneye control for peeking around corners to shoot
it is defintely a fun game but there are better fps games out there for the ps such as halflife red faction and of course metal gear solid   since this game was delayed a year i was certainly expecting a lot more
please do better next time ea bond deserves itlike halflife the first player mode is funfor a while
the secrets you unlock in this game are pathetic and the multiplayer stinks because there are no bots
still its good for a rental the intense action is what kept me going but soon ill get tired of it and play something elsewell all anybody can do is compare this game to goldeneye which it isnt
i played goldeneye for years and i loved it
i have played this for about a week and i love it as well
but unfortunately this game is already wearing thin
the levels are short the gameplay is too easy at least for me others not experienced with firstperson shooters might have more difficulty and even the muchpraised multiplayer gets tiresome after a while
within  minutes of the first time playing the multiplayer with  other people we were all killing each other at a tremendous rate
i racked up  kills in a ten minute game many times
that is just dumb
anyway if you are new to the firstperson shooters this is a great training game buy it
otherwise rent it a few times and you can beat it easilywell whenever someone sees quotjames bondquot on a game its probably gonne be picked up
well i was walking around at blockbuster and that exact same phenomenon happend to me
i took it home popped it in and began the first mission
i was at parts amazed at parts extremely disapointed while playing quot agent under firequot by ea games gameplay okaybut not very good in a lot of parts
first it just feels too easy
you go around shooting people who dont usually shoot back
the game is based on autoaim which really kills gameplay
the people dont look half as good as they should and missions overall are short and easy
there isnt much of a variety of guns
there is hardly any ammo and for that case what you come with isnt very much
the guns arent very creative either
just a handgun maybe a rifle here or therevehicles you normally control just one or two every  levels
one time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry but its gets old after awhile
the ability though when you have an assistant in the car to shoot from the headroof was extremely cool
that was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns
vehicles are here theyre just not that commonstory pretty good it actually has one at least
you must save a hostage escape the terrorists take out people in stealth break into the room etc it actually went by a story line but the bad part was james girlfriend gets graphics decent but not good
peoples hands dont have  fingers the backgrounds and guards and such dont have faces
bullet marks disapear after going into the wall
no weather factors collapsing buildings etc the graphics here were once again good not great
better than most ps games but way short of awsome
sound probably the best part of the game
the voice acting while peoples mouths dont move when they talk is excellent
the sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after reloading brings the gameplay alive
the cars squel when they start fast explosions rock the screen
overall its pretty good
the music in the background isbond of course
the sound was the best part of the game in my opinion that andmultiplayer very fun
the levels are fairly large and the variety of weapons is huge
from jump packs canons bazukas shot guns snipers handguns etcthere are tons of guns
the game keeps score and you can work as a team in player  on  combat
there are life vests to keep your health up and the overall gameplay is good
i loved only one part of this game
it was the multiplayerthis game overall is a good game in terms of how much is costs a twenty should cover it at most stores
persounally id buy it for the multiplayer not the story mode
something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two
this game is a blast in some ways and a major disapointment in others
i plan on buying itmaybe after renting it for a week not really surethxobryanstarsif youd ask me goldeneye was the only  game that you could really really enjoy
this game isnt really anything special with a complicated storyline that would confuse younger players and some level that take  trys to beat
the controls are really good and so are the graphics but the fun level isnt reallyfun
if you have a n get goldeneye then try this outssx was the best of the ps launch games but its sequel is it even a sequel or just a quotdirectors cutquot
cant recapture the excitement and delight of the original
its not that i think ssx tricky is bad but it fails two tests if you own the original game should you get the sequel
no
if you dont would you want the sequel or the original
get the originaltricky expends much effort fixing elements of the original game that really werent deficient such as adding celebrity voice talent when the original voices were just fine or adding medalstand animations and quips which become very skippable very quicklyit adds two new tracks which are enjoyable but wrecks many of the original tracks with changeforchangessake alterations  in many cases the tracks are cluttered with grindable pipes and rails which can make it harder to execute jumps because of the likelihood of hitting a pipe while quotprewindingquot your jumpthe quotea sports bigquot brand is showing signs of focusing more on quotbig and loudquot windowdressing than on solid gameplay
quotssx trickyquot is a step in the wrong direction and lets hope that they go back to the drawing board soon
until then stick with the originalthis game is a quaint but sweet cross between oldschool fun arcade style and hysterically laughable intern style
i would definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates and enjoys games influenced by arcadelike fps but at the same time doesnt take the genre too seriously
otherwise the horrific graphics and still more nightmarish voice acting might offend
that said vampire night as an arcade game obviously has high replay value and is great p fun
that is if you can find a second person who is willing to tolerate the distinc aura of mediocrity each and every cutscene exudes
good luckokage the shadow king called quotme and the demon kingquot in japan is a decidedly mixed bag of a video game experience that essentially delivers an especially memorable character in the evil shadow king stan who delivers some of the most definitely humorously droll dialogue seen in a video game for awhile but inevitably falters in delivering an exceedingly entertaining nightmare before christmassegue video game experience
by neglecting to improve the games battle engine abundantly retaining its childishly obnoxious visuals focusing to heavily on its grievously clicheacuted uninteresting rpg roleplayinggame stereotyped characters focusing on a moronically simple gameplay heinously allowing exasperatingly redundant enemy encounters and ultimately shying away from its central appeal of comedy a third way into the experience restricts this exceptionally quirky title from living up to its possible potentialonly recommended for those who wouldnt mind surviving through an extremely maddening video game encounter just to see one of the most highly amusing video characters in certainly some timea humerous littleknown rpg that parodies conventional rpgsplotyou are an ignored teenager whose sister falls under a pig latin curseand this dire circumstance forces you into the spotlight
your father calls upon the spirit of a bottle to cure his daughterunbeknowst to any of you he has summoned forth evil king stanley hihat trinidad xiv who reigned as the tyrant evil king gohma  years ago
in exchange for curing your younger sister evil king stan possesses you and orders you to help him restore his reign over the land
thus you must travel oer the land disposing of typical villain archetypes who have come to power during the course of stans absence
in the course of your journey you meet heroes scholars princesses and other rpg character archetypes composing the stereotypical ragtag band of outlaws
after all youll need all the help you can getthose evil kings arent going to go down without a fightgraphicsthe visual style is meant to be a tribute to that of tim burton the guy who made a nightmare before christmas
henceforth everything looks goth and halloweenesque
the atmosphere can be described as halloween in every season but autumn
so the atmosphere is both cheery and darksoundthe music is silly but fitting for the backgrounds
in some cases it is even good for listening pleasure outside the context of the game
they try to make the music sound irish in places with bagpipes and flutes
the sound effects are what you would expect to hear in an rpg with some other humerous sound effects like the kazoo and such
some of the fanfare themes sound like they were taken from the super mario bros and the evil king marching theme sounds reminiscent of bowsers themegameplaythe battle system is semirealtime semiturnbased as you have atb gauges like in recent final fantasys but once its a characters turn to attack action pauses and you have to choose your attack before another character can
if youre not sure which action to have a character take just select wait and then cancel that wait once you have decided upon a course of actionyou can choose to combine your attacks with other party members synchronize your attacks thus more than doubling damage rather than attacking alone or you can exploit enemies weaknesses by casting spells of an element they cant standone greatly irritating thing about the battle system is if your main character falls its an automatic gameover
in which case make sure to heal your main character often even if you think he doesnt need it
hp makes all the difference
this forces you to strategizeenemies appear in the field in semirealtime semirandom wayenemies can materialize anywhere they want but you still have to run into them before battle is initiateddungeons can be mazes or large open roomsyou have to destroy urns and use magic circles to open gates thus dungeons tend not to be linear a rather good move on the part of the developeroverallyoure getting this game mostly for the humor plot or character designs unless traditional rpgs are really your thingwell i picked up this game at my local games store guess which one it is hint it starts with a g and ends with stop and they seem to be everywhere from the bargain bin for 
now usually when something is in a bargain bin for such a low price it means theres a reason its there namely it sucks and no one wants it
however i had read some positive reviews for this game and decided to give it a shot
so here goes the reviewgraphics score  okage features a very distinctive art style
ive heard it described as burtonesque and id have to say that isnt too far off
the characters are oddlooking in a good way and the enemies are just too hilarious
in addition the town designs are all pretty uniqueno repeats of the same boring buildings here
i also like the blurring effect of things that are farther away
this gives scenery a sense of perspective
now the reason this section doesnt get a full  score is because of one big problem  the small font
there are several places such as the menu screen during battle that has really small font which makes me squint and gives me a headache
other than that though graphics are pretty goodmusic score  the music is excellent
its quirky fun and unique
they really didnt resort to generic rpg tunes here
all of the music is entertaining and doesnt become annoying repetitive or grating on the ears
also each area features its own music so theres good musical variety in the gamecharacters score  the characters are quirky and cute looking and much of their dialogue is hilarious
unfortunately they are also not that well developed
we learn almost nothing about these people who randomly join the party aside from their personalities
no back story no nothing
to be fair though many of these characters wouldnt have a lot of interesting back story to tell example i lived in a small village my whole life doing menial household tasks
hooray
so i guess its forgivable i just wish we had gotten to learn more about them i think the worst party members in this regards are big bull and eprosyou just dont learn much about them
i think the best developed person is ari the main character
i really enjoyed how you are able to frequently choose dialogue options for him and wish more games would include this
stan also gets plenty of screen time and i personally think hes the funniest character
so hooray for stanstory score  the story starts off with aris sister being cursed by a ghost
ari opens a bottle with a demon named stan inside at the behest of his parents
the demon agrees to rid his sister of the curse as long as ari will become his slave for eternity
once his sister is cured though stan tells ari that he must help him conquer the world as an evil king
this might sound like a dark storyline but its notthe curse is nothing worse than being forced to speak in pig latin and stan is hilariously inept as a scary demon
in fact hes rather cute
the story starts off cute and silly and you pretty much think you know that youre in for a fun lighthearted tale thatll be enjoyably silly but also predictable
wow are you wrong
the plot takes a dramatic twist about halfway through the game
the tone remains comedic but also becomes a lot more serious and interesting
i wont spoil anything but suffice it to say that the story is excellent
my only complaint is that there are some plot holes not answered at the end
oh well it was mostly perfectbattle system score  like a lot of rpgs okage uses a turnbased battle system
unlike other games though each party member has their own time gauge and thus attack at their own pace
this means that you dont just input everyones commands and then wait for them to carry it out instead characters command menus are constantly popping up as soon as their time gauge refills
overall the battle system isnt too bad but i feel that it couldve been handled better
the main flaw is that you cant choose which specific enemy to target
you can choose which enemy group to target but not which enemy
so if there are four crafty crows onscreen and one scarecrow you can choose to target the crafty crows but then the character just randomly attacks one of those four crafty crows
this is really annoying
part of strategy in turnbased games involves wearing down a single enemy and killing it off first its just not efficient to attack stuff randomly
now i have heard some reviewers claim that this games battles are really hard
i wouldnt say that this game was overly difficultthat is if you used the trick i did
i ran from everything you can escape without fail and leveled up exclusively on pots in the dungeons
this means that bosses are completely manageable using this method but normal enemies are still tedious to beat so i just didnt fight them
that being said its nowhere near as difficult as grandia iii
you will have to levelgrind a bit though but it isnt too bad if you use my method
in fact a good rule of thumb is if you come to a dungeon where every single battle makes you go up a level then you need to spend time fighting near the save point until you dont levelup like mad
once this happens youre ready to go
this way it isnt really difficult at all to reach the appropriate level for wherever you are and you dont need to spend more than  minutes leveling up in any particular dungeon
however any game that basically forces you to use my inane method of running from every normal encounter is basically broken in my opinion  the battles are not fun so the game is a bit fail in this regard hence the low scoregameplay score  this is a bit of a catchall category for me
gameplay is mostly good
i mean the menus are okay the pacing of the game is pretty good some dungeons are irritating ie
the aptly named escapeless abyss but most are not too confusing
people like to complain about the load times but i really dont know why
many rpgs have similar load times like the final fantasy series and okages load times arent any worse than those other games
my main complaints here are the camera angles the onscreen enemies and the ingame maps
first off the camera angles are weird at times
normally they hover over your main character at a decent range but sometimes they move in a little too close for no apparent reason
also the shoulder buttons swing the camera but it seems to be backwards to the directions in most other games
normally when you hit the r button it swings the camera right and l swings it left
it seems to be the other way around in okage which is a bit offputting
the right analog stick also can swing the camera and i use it because it seems to have more natural movements
occasionally though the camera moves really slowly for some reason which is also annoying
the onscreen enemies are just tedious
a lot of people seem to think that random encounters  more fights and that having onscreen enemies  less fights but it isnt the case here
normally when you have onscreen enemies they inhabit certain regions where they walk back and forth and you can run around them and avoid them so long as they dont catch you and theyll stop chasing you once you leave their small area
in okage however the enemies just randomly materialize near you they look like ghosts and start chasing you
they never stop either unless you enter a town
some even appear directly in front of you as you are running thus causing a battle
because of this irritation the amount of battles is comparable to having random battles anyway
i would actually prefer random battles for this game for a simple reason
in a random battle system if you stand still you cannot get into a fight
this gives you time to look around and get your bearings in an annoying dungeon
in okage you cant even do that because if you stand still ghosts just pop out of nowhere and attack you
this is extremely irritating and by far the worst aspect of this game
you can escape from battle without fail however so this somewhat mitigates the aforementioned problem
unfortunately you never get an itemaccessoryability that helps you decrease or avoid random encounters which blows
my last complaint is the ingame maps
theyre really small and rather indistinct which makes traversing annoying dungeons with constant battles that much more annoying
if okage didnt have these problems then it wouldve gotten a much better scoreoverall score  note this score is not an average its my subjective overall score
i must say for being a bargain bin game im not really disappointed
if they had fixed the problems with the random encounters and battle system id have a darn fine game on my hands here
as it is though it gets an slightly belowaverage score of 
is this game worth having in your collection
well it depends
if youre a casual fan of rpgs id pass it up for something better in quality like one of the final fantasy series  dragon quest viii xenosaga ar tonelico legaia  the list goes on
however if youre like me and already have an extensive rpg collection and are desperately looking for something new to add then you might consider okage
for such a low price even if you end up hating it youre still not out much moneythat is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case its just not my pot of tea
first the good things
okages graphics are very good sort of a fairy tale come to life not trying to be ultrarealistic but not looking completly goofy
the dialogue and story is laided out like a book with a narrator coming in every once and a while to continue the story
the humor is alright but seems to be aimed at a young audience
the fight system is interesting but nothing truly newand things kind of went downhill for me from there
the story is just not enough to keep me wanting to play its just too simplistic and didnt motivate me like ff or s story did
in rpgs story is everything and this one just didnt keep me going
ff story was highly dramatic and made me want to see what happened next this just doesntoverall this is a ok rpg in my opinion only the younger audience will really find this interesting
if your looking for a deep and involving story keep waiting for ffx
in the end i couldnt care less if stan took over the world or notdont get me wrong this game is pretty neatbut it does have its down sidesfirst the game play isntt all that great you mainly run around talking to people also known as quotgathering informationquot or battling some annoying creature
the battles are very much like final fantasy boring and tedious the graphics are great though and the story plot is pretty funny though i lost my entusiasm too quickly and just wanted to take it back definately rent before you buyi would like to say this stories premise is not a bad concept but everything is basic jrpg elements in the game
in my mind this game is self aware it is a video game especially shadow king stan
he sometimes appears in front of your screen and you have to say some nice stuff about him in ab lib structure and it is a hit and missi would recommend those who are jrpg fans andor nightmare before christmas
this might be a good game for you guys but if you are looking for early final fantasy ps reputation but it is no final fantasythis game is one of xboxs best
the graphics are great and so is the sound
now on the other hand the controls are something to get used to
i found them to be really frustrating at times
but as with everything else you get better with practice
if you like first person shooter then this game is for youi love this game but i was disappointed it didnt come with a case but i couldnt stay mad for longhalo is still concidered by many to be the best title for xbox
i do not agree
while halo is arguably the best launch title for any console ever released it simply has been bettered many times since launch
many who bought their xbox and halo together are reluctant to admit that halo is good but not great as halo is the game that gave them the xbox that they love
it is a good game just not great
levels are repetitive the enemy ai is weak and works more on overwhelming by force than by tactics and the vehicle control is strange at best a detriment at worst
halo brings nothing new to the fps style and by now things have been done better more than once
i am not a halo hater i actually enjoy reading the books more than playing the game
halo  shows promise at the time of this review but it is still a ways outfirst off it is a pretty good game but it has some down flawsone of them is there isnt damage on the warthog or the tank i mean like if shoot  a tank or a warthog with any weapon it doesnt even put a scartch on them that takes realistic out of the gamethe other one is the warthog never runs out of ammo that takes even more realistic out of the gamei hope halo  is bettergood game but its dissapointing on the realistic stuffid like to keep this review short since im low on time but anywayi found this to be a good game but it was kind of a let down after playing metal gear solid   its just not in the same league
if you have a ps and dont have mgs that is the game you want to buy
after mgs buy this oneuncreative implementation of one of the best concepts in gaming history
without a doubt halo    have the most engrossing story and universe compared to any other game bar none
better than average ai and a decent assortment of weapons can easily keep one entertained
in fact there is not a lot negative to say about halo but one of the problems is bad enough to bring down the entire game
this is of course the use of checkpoint saves as opposed to user saves
it may seem like a long game to some of the less perceptive gamers but in reality a lot of the game is simply doing the same exact things over and over again
i realize there may be some people out there that enjoy this type of mindless repetition but for those who require a little more intellectual stimulation than your average assembly line worker you will quickly begin to wonder what unimaginative knucklehead decided to make this part of the game
what makes this worse is the sometimes atrocious timing of these checkpoints
you will be amazed at how far back you can be set if you die before the designers allow you a save
this does not make the game difficult it just makes it a waste of time
replay value is also affected by this since some scenes will be so familiar from when you had to go through it  times they will begin to seem like a chore
hopefully in future versions the game play designers will attempt to put as much effort into the game as the people who designed everything elsea couple of other small annoyances
 architectural designs that incorporate huge drops as part of their structure for no other reason except to make something a player can fall off of
is there no osha in space
 the ability of the aliens no know that you have them sited in your sniper rifle from great distances
why these guys start dodging around as soon as i sight them up from a mile away is beyond mebrthis is definetly not the best fps out there
but it is still a really good game
the action is really heart pumping
the guns are really cool
vehicles rock and kick  but sometimes the framerate is really slow
graphics are excellentthis game is just abit boring
 minutes of playing is about it
it gets so boring
there is not much 
after all believe it or not gamecube is the world wide best seller gaming consoleif u have a gamecube buy metroid primemy grandson likes halo wanted to see where halo  and  came from
as to be expected he thought graphics were subpar but he enjoyed it anyway
he said it was ok but he wanted to get back to real worldits sad when the only thing good about a game is the multiplayer
after playing the single player for halo for about an hour i got bored
the game is recycled bits from other action games only with a nicer look
and the controls are terrible in this game
no surprise since the controller for the xbox is a clumsy lookalike of every controller for every other system
xbox the best system
please
if this is the best they can do i rate them just under segas dreamcast and barely above the atari jaguar
xbox is bound to fall into video game history as a bland attempt from an american company to make video games
nintendos virtual boy was better than thissure this game has had rave reviews and im basing this on games released in the same time periodyes there is a story
its a fairly decent setup but after the initial training its simply kill the aliens and save the marines missions
it gets pretty old pretty fast
of course the second one was supposed to be a lot better
well see when i get to that
it works really well on the xbox  as i would have guessed since this was their flagship title for the first xbox
it is available for download but i like to have physical media since you never know when their virtual store may not be available anymore or older titles may be removedhmm i waited a couple of years after this was released to pick it up on pc and i was not impressed
it was just another shooter
doom also seemed likejust another shooter
i was extremely impressed with halflife  however but i really cant say what all the fuss was about with halo
i actually never finished it despite being pretty far along in the gamei just got too bored with itgood not great
its way overrated
all my friends told meampquot oh man you gotta get itampquot so i did
it was good until i got to a part i couldnt pass
so i sat there trying to get passed it
and i couldnt
so what do u want me to say
good game and all
but nothing to get excited over
i gave it a  outta  because when i play the  player mode with sum friends its really fun
 player is the only time i play it
otherwise its just sitting with all of my other xbox games
latersure
this game is way innovative
shooting aliens
didnt i see that in halflife and chex quest
what is with the  weapons only
a shooter is all about shooting and you only get  guns in this onecrazy peopleeveryoen says this is the best game ever
i believe it is a decent game that is way way way overhyped
sure its fun to shoot aliens but it gets boring after a while no matter how you put it
many levels look similar and that doesnt help the repitition
multiplayer was kind of fun with the  boxes and  players
coop was decent if you get left behind your friend can go ahead and you automatically catch upgraphically this game is quite swell
it controls nice and all that rubbish
the sound is blech though
the guns sound kinda wimpy and they are somewhat low quality but not horribleall in all this game was not nearly as innovative or great as everyoen says
it is simply an overhyped game that is slightly above average and thats no bad thing
just try and get it when it goes platinum hits and no money will be wastedthe campaign starts off alright and when the game opens up to wide expanses its great fun but otherwise its a bland corridor shooter with repeating environments and little to break up the monotony
to be fair it might get better near the end but i just couldnt get myself to finish the library
i tried it a few times and realized that i wasnt having any fun so i put this game away and havent touched it since
the muliplayer can be fun but too many of the maps are either way too big unless youre having a lan party or just plain stupid such as the one with stupid amounts of teleportersto be fair this is an important game and redefined the console fps genre but unless youre interested in the history of videogames youd be better off playing a more recent halo game such as reach which i found to be one of my favorite games last yeari play pc halo quite a bit despite shortcomings
i would rate the single player game a  out of   it loses a point for some repetitive play and its short length
i would like to concentrate however on the multiplayer game which i rate a  out of   and that is being generous
if you were to list the glitches in halo pc it will add up into the hundreds
yes its fun but it is very buggythere are so many problems with halo pc that it would take pages and pages to outline each one
i will list below a few below the year is   i guess we havent made much progress on vehicle design and operation
the warthog overturns way too easily
the ghost and banshee get stuck on corners
a banshee going full speed is stopped dead by a branch of leaves and it sounds like it hit a rock
okay in the pc game we often get the mystery of the halfflipped vehicle
shoot a warthog from a distance with a heavy weapon and you will often see the vehicle begin to flip over only to instantly right itself and continue going as if nothing at all happened
okay forced flag pickup in ctf
if you get too close to the flag you are forced to pick it up even if you dont want to
this nullifies your weapons
it would be much better to have to press an action key to pick up the flag
many a people have been killed because they accidentally picked up the flag the reacquire flag bug
if you have the flag and want to drop it in order to shoot an opponent good luck
as soon as you drop it you will instantly pick it up again
even if you try to throw it you will pick it up again
even if you run forward and throw the flag and then back up you will pick it up again
many a people have been killed because they reacquired the flag when they didnt want to are rockets propelled by rubberbands
they go so slowly youd think so want to drive a ghost or warthog in a base
better be careful
even though your head height in the vehicles is many feet below the ceiling you cant see
you get all kinds of vision interference
hard to steer or shoot if you cant see so how did you get up there
thats what you might ask when you see people in the sky
yeah its a sealing glitch that can be taken advantage of if you know how  you can usually make a kill with one rocket or two fuel rod hits
but if you really want a powerful weapon use your fist
you can follow an opponent up a ladder and hit him in his feet and instantly kill him
a hit in a foot is more powerful than a rocket or fuel rod or sniper rifle
yeah that makes sense  what about the dud granades
yep sometimes you can throw a nade and it wont blowthis often happens if you die after you throw the nade
not all nades are the same strength either it appears
sometimes a nade will blow right at the feet of an opponent and wont kill
other times it blows  ft away and will kill
never really know what youre getting  the runover glitch
very frustrating glitch that occurs when you head in a vehicle straight for an opponent only to find when you hit him he will disappear and reappear about  feet away unharmed
sometimes this can happen over and over again as you try to hit him
another glitch is when you apparently do hit an opponent and you see him fly in the air about  feet  only to suddenly disappear and reappear on the ground unharmed
some will say this is a lag problem but i find this happening all the time with my  mb line at under  ping what is all this tking
it appears there is no adequate method to deal with it
id say at least half of all games have tkers on them
and if thats not bad enough there are the spys the spies change teams for a short period to see what the defenses are or to find where a flag is hidden
then they change back and let their teammates know whats up watch out you may get the boot
you might be thinking im talking about tking too much
nope
if youre too good the admin of the server may just boot you right off
a lot of games are stacked so that the admins team will always win
they just boot the good players off the opposing team
happens all the time
on a bad day i can get booted off five or more times by the admin just because i have too many kills or i killed the admin
okay stupid rules
sometimes you just have to laugh at some rules people make up
no driving vehicles  no using fuel rods or rockets  no camping
that one is the funniest
you cannot play defenseits not fair lol
this is only an offensive game
no defense is allowed
lol
when that is said just ask what camping is
you will probably get an answer like
its standing still
or  its staying in a location too long
so you cant stop running or hide behind a rock or a tree or wait for a ride
it gets so ridiculous that you just have to laugh at the stupidity of the players on your server  the following behind glitch
when facing an opponent guns are much more accurate
it is possible to kill an opponent with full health and shield in  pistol shots  even from  ft away
but running behind an opponent is completely different
i have run behind an opponent as close as only  feet away and pumped more than  rounds into his head without a kill
doesnt seem to matter if theyre head shots or body shots
no kill  the stuck in the wall glitch
sometimes a tank or warthog or ghost can break the plane of a wall and get stuck
once stuck there is no way to break it loose
the vehicle is lost
one game i played had no less than five vehicles all stuck in walls
again poor designsince im running out of time ill stop here
it may sound to you as if i dont like halo multiplayer
thats not true
in fact i still play it more than any other online game
however there are so many bugs and issues with it that even though it is usually fun i have to knock off a few points for some of the shortcomings
some might argue that all games have some glitches
true but not to this extent
these bugs are mostly confined to the pc version of halo not the xbox version
hopefully halo  for pc with be much less buggy
i rate it a  out of its not difficult to find reviews here which say this to be the best game everor any other superlativeafter so much hype i decided to play this game myselfi logged  hours straighthad to turn it off after that cos i had got boredand then after playing it i started scratching my head and wondering to myselfwas it really the best game i have ever played
the answer i got was a big noinfact i wouldnt even say it to be the best fps everim a single bloke and i have to play aloneso i dont get into the multiplayer thingand what i found out of the single player mode was that halo is just a good fpsjust thatnothing more than thatthe rest is all hype
doom  on pc is going to blow it awaynever beforei mean never had a review mislead me more here on amazon than this gamesand i gen trust these reviews which explains why im herebut i dont have a bead on what reviwers here are earning by hyping it up so muchthe thing isi dont have to rate a game great just because other reviewers are doing so and i may feel left outi have to write the review according to what i feel after playing the gameand my verdict is halo is just another gamejust a good fpsthats iti could mention negative points about the gamei gave it  starsbut whats the use if you wont agreethe only game that has held my interest on xbox so far to some extent has been rallisport challenge
now all ye halo lovers plz press that no button belowthank u n god bless ui recently bought this game after losing the pc version
i was extremely disapointed to find out it had no online play and had a lot less maps than the pc version
the game felt very limited compared to the pc version
i know its a classic but if you have a decent computer you should skip this and buy the version for the computergame starts off good but many of the missions get soo damn repetitive
going through the same bland covenant hall ways gets really boring
quotthe floodquot was just a bad idea and you dont get to use vehicles or team mate help very often
like  of the game is indoors and the indoor environments look really bland and unimaginative
the outdoor environment are nice though
most people think this game is great because of the multiplayer aspect
but the single player game should matter the most
the game is averageif you like consolebased fps games youre in heaven
get it get the xbox because of itotherwiseits a beautiful game but there is only so much you can do with a handheld controllerthe fingeryoga required to jump shoot and run at the same time while looking what is going on behind you is too much
its not intuitivehopefully theyll port it to the pcfuzion frenzy is a party game u  need a case of beer and a bottle of tequila at bestwhen u discover the  different gamesto play your bound to find a few ya like or get blitzed playingas for overall its just another  party gamethis is microsofts first and only
partygame
through the round you play minigames for orbs
at the end of the round is a fusion frenzy where you bet or bank your orbs
you then try to get as many orbs into a scoring zone as you can to get points
whoever has the most points at the end of the rounds   or  wins the gameeach level has its unique minigames
at the military base you drive tanks the waterfront level has bumper boats
but many of the minigames are very similarthe graphics are ok although the camera angle zooms out so far its often hard to make out whats going on
the sound is ok as well but you can play with music youve saved on your xbox which is nicenintendo started the partygame genre with mario party and fusion frenzy is a far cry from being nearly as fun
this definately is not a game to play by yourself so dont bother unless you have a roommatespousesibling that you know will play this with youi first tried playing this single player and was not impressed at all
it is said to be a party game so i then tried playing this game with  of my friends
the biggest problem is that there are so many different type of subgames that nobody knows what is going on when the game begins and everybody ends up doing terribly
nobody has an opportunity to learn how to play the subgames before actually playing them and since each one is different it is total chaos for the length of the gaming
if everybody had experience with the subgames prior to the session this would not be a problem  but then again this would also not be a spurofthemoment party game eitheras a solo game this one should get about one star and a half as a party game it should get four and a half starsmost of the four player games out there require you to obtain skills learn complicated controls andor moves
usually person who owns the game would be the best leaving no fair chance of competition
fusion frenzy is a game of quick hand eye and most important luck
yes somebody may play this game million times yet you can still beat them if you are smarter
before each out of approximately  or so levels you are given the instructions and directions
all players up to four see them at the same time so its very fair
i played this game with my friends against each other against computer and yes some things can be predicted yet every time the game is different
there is one game that involves sumo type wresting in steel round cages
point is to push opponents off the platform
game is so unpredictable that in first  seconds you may either bounce off the opponent and plunge down the abyss or just miss the target and fall off
the amazing number of outcomes no matter how silly generates endless laughs and puts a guilty player into shame
but shame last no longer than a minute
after that we are back into the new game and everyone has a chance for a payback
again this is not an action game
no halo assault drops with plasma rifle blasting or even close to it
this game was designed with multiplayer in mind
price to pay for it is expensive so maybe pick up a used copypartially i think this game is a take sorry microsoft you probably own those guys anyway from a japanese game called poypoy for playstation
but its nice to see it on the xboxtruely microsoft could have done a lot better on this title the power of xbox should be expressed within their own first racer at a launch and i will say they didnt provide us with that
the game plays like any normal racer out there but i do suggest another racer other than this one its rank and not my taste in a game
replay value is fairly high and should keep you busy for a while if you dont go to sleep first rent before purchaseoverall a good racing game
you will fing plenty of tracks but most of them have some sort of simillarity with the other tracks in that particular city
i dont think you will enjoy playing  players without the link the screens are too small
the cars are respectable but not too many tracks allow you to get wide open you know
i would buy it again
aw yea i consider myself to be a pretty good driver and unless you are better than me you will need the master code to unlock all the cars after hearing all the hype on this game i decided to give it a trygraphicsthe graphics in this game are the best i have seen in any racer yet
the cars and the cities look amazingly real and the cars show off a showroom shine and reflects all lights that come from the city around them
the details are amazing as well
your driving can be actually seen shifting gears as you speed down the city streets
the cities show off spectacular lighting effects and even have logos of popular resturantssoundnext to the graphics the sound is the second best part of this game
different vehicles have different engine noises
the ferraris gives off a high pitched roar while other cars have lower sounding engines
everytime you shift you can hear the engine actually changing gears and it is pretty realistic sounding
aside from the cars you have a wide range of music tunes to choose from while your driving depending on what city your in you have the option of choosing  different local radio stations which each play about  different songs
if you are in japan you will actually hear japanese music being spoken in japanese
when you get tired of the radio you can choose from your cd collection which is included on the game cd
when you get tired of that you can always play your own music while you drivegameplaythe controls are very responsive and are not loose like alot of other racing games which is a good thing
when you press left or right to turn your car does not spin out of controlmost of the time
sometimes when your turning a corner at  mph your car will mysteriously start spinning for no apparant reason
also the computer seems to have tank cars
by that i mean if your racing against the computer all he has to do is just tap you and your car goes spinning out of control
however if you ram into the computer at  mph it will keep moving as if you did not even hit him
that is very stupid and frustrating to say the least
the gameplay gets pretty impossible after you reach a certain level
unless you have hours upon hours to spend each day just restarting the same race over and over again you will probally never get all of the cars and trackspresentationthis is where i feel the game is most lacking
first of all there are not that many cars compared to other racing games
while most of the cars on the game are great it is missing a lot that i would have like to have seen in this game
where is the lamborghini
m
m
mclauren
they have a chevy camaro subarau impreza and even a ford focus but they dont have a mustang cobra
in fact the only car represented by ford is the focus big dissapointment
no hondas either but they do have a mitsubishi lancer
strange
this game needs more cars periodin addition to the lack of cars i am not too crazy about the kudos system
basically what it is is that you get points for cool things you do ie
sliding spining getting air time etc
the kudos you earn add up and depending on how many you get you can unlock new cars and levels
this is not as easy as it sounds because while your kudos are adding up if you hit a wall or a cone you lose all of the kudos you will have earned very frustating especially when unlocking the next level or car depends on if you earn enough kudos
the kudos system makes the game very difficult and after while it becomes more frustrating then challenging
it seems like the game concentrates more on how many cool tricks you can do rather than how good you can drive
this is racing not an xgames competitionfinally one more bad thing about the game play while the city driving can be very fun the tracks the game does have are not made in such a way that you can ever reach top speed in your car
they do have a speed challenge course but it still is not made in such a way were you can actually maintain your speed
the track has two straightaways but end in a hairpin turn where you almost have to come to a complete stop to turn
the highest speed i ever gotten was  in the ferrari f and since i was out of road i crashed into the wall
the ferrari has a top speed of over  mph i would have liked to have reached this speed in a race
i remember in need for speed  i was able to get  mph in the gt and actually was able to keep it there for a few seconds
this is impossible in pgr which takes away from the game
what is the point of having all those fast cars if you cant really see what they can do
if they werent goign to let you get over  mph in your car then they should have had all sedans and coupes in this game rather than exotic sports carsconclusionoverall i am dissapointed in this game
while the sound and graphics are the best i have ever seen the amount of cars and gameplay is lacking
this game is not for everyone some people might like the kudos system but it is not for me i i just want to race not see how many cool tricks i can do who cares that i can slide and spin on a turn going  mph or see how many cones i can drive through
again this is supposed to be a racing game not a drivers ed course
if you want to spend hours and hours and i mean hours trying to gain kudos points just to unlock new cars and tracks then this game is for you
if you just want to race and push your car to its limit then wait on another racing game to come outi give pgr credit for being unique
the system of scoring quotkudosquot for driving with style is certainly different among the current crop of racing games
however i found that i quickly lost interest in the gameas i mentioned above the game is based around a system of points called quotkudosquot which you earn for driving well
sliding your car and getting it on two wheels are examples of moves that earn kudos
you compete in various events such as races top speed challenges and overtaking challenges see how many people you can pass in a given time
along the way you earn kudos which unlocks more tracks and cars
the challenges are varied enough to keep things interesting for a while
and the promise of new cars and tracks serves as a good carrot and keeps you playingalthough pgr is unique as far as racing games go i found it just didnt hold my interest
the tracks werent nearly diverse enough and working toward new cars and tracks eventually lost its funi also found the graphics to be a bit of a letdown
the replays look very good but half of that comes from the aggressive camera anglesmotions that are used
this makes it seem more like real tv but its just a camera trick
to be fair the renderings of the cars are very good especially when you see reflections on them at night
the biggest graphics disappointment are the tracks themselves
the buildings look very flat making the scenery less lively than i would hopeoverall i did have some fun with this game but in the end it wasnt for me
try renting it first maybe your mileage will be differenta lack of imagination and graphic sparkle yes ever played the need for speed series on a p
leave this title a bit overrated
dont get me wrong its pretty and not as annoyingly complex as the gt series but the circuits priovide little visual variety and those special touches like rain on your winshield more realistic and hindering damage are missing
also why do i get quotkudosquot for spinning out as long as i dont hit a wall
fun but there are and will be better racing titles soon and ofteni was a little disappointed with the gameplay with this game
all in all i gave it  stars
if you are just looking for a racing game you will probably like it
howver if you are looking for something with some type of missions involved you need to look elsewherethis is a game that is the best in some areas and the worst in others
all of these ratings are out of gameplaygood idea but it is to hard to annoying and there arent any bonuses like shortcuts or special areas or different routes
its all race like this and nothing else
strategy has no effect in this game which is probably the worste partrating graphicswonderful graphics
if every area was as good as that this would be my favorite game in the world
it is taking advantage of everything xbox has to offerrating soundwonderful
over  songs plus you can create your own soundtrack
wonderfulrating varietythis game lacks variety a lot
i mean gt racing  has over  cars while this only has just more than   the tracks are hard which makes it hard to enjoy the big lot of tracks it has to offerrating total good things
 bad things
should be right around the middle which is not good when it comes to games
rating so in the end i rounded it up to  which is not good for a game like thisthe graphics are good
the game play is a little lacking
the game is not much of a challenge
if you are a big racing game fanyou might want to pass on this game
gt of playstation  is still the best you can geti got this game when i bought a bundle pack for the xbox i had read the reviews and thought i was pretty lucky considering when you buy stuff at the bx like this you take a chance at what you get
however after playing the game i decided it would be a bored beat all the other games dont feel like buying a new one right now so ill play this type game
i prefer gran tourismo  i like the ability to modify the cars plus gt has a much larger selection of cars id have to say ps has so far beaten the xbox in the car simulation games plus the tracks are kinda lame but they have nice detailno doubt that project gotham racing is an extremely fun game but it is just not as good as the second one
i will make this review in procon format
it is basically your average racing game with the addition of kudos which are basically points that you get for cutting sharp turnsprographics are over averageaudio if you like rapthe idea of kudos is pretty neatconnot as many cars as pgr not as many maps as pgr not very realisticnot onlinecan get frustrating at timesthis game definetely gets a  in terms of how fun it is but there is just way less features in this one then there is in the second pgr  which is the reason why i gave it a i love gtbut have played it almost through and wanted a new racing game
the other reviewers are correct its annoying to have to unlock all these cars the simulation physics arent there and the kudos points system is goofythe art is in not making the car slide
sheeshbut heyits racing
and if you enjoyed ridge racer  on ps youll enjoy this too
its certainly an excuse to own an xboxwhile its beautiful the characters are intriguing and the premise is unique as it always is in the oddworld games munchs oddysee is distinctly less fulfilling than its predecessors
whether its because munch simply isnt as appealing as abe or whether its because the game now feels like its made up of distincly isolated puzzles strung together by a story as opposed to a traditional platformer munch is less compelling less addictive and in a sense less interesting than its predecessoris it a bad game
by no means
its often laughoutloud funny the characters are quickly endearing and the puzzles are often quite clever
its a bit stilted in the actual fluidity of the levels and the characterswitching mechanic keeps the player from ever feeling any sense of real immersion but overall despite its problems a worthwhile experiencethis game has so much potential
because it is microsofts first attempt at a video game i am understanding
the graphics are what you will expect from an xbox game
the sound is great
the storyline is wonderful
the characters are cool
so why i am not completely happy with this game
you do not have a save option
the only way to save is to find these save spots within the game
if you had an emergency and had to leave without saving you would lose all your data or if your character dies before you have saved once again all data lost
this can be quite annoyingthis was a game i honestly never expected to beat other then the first water relm segment
while i had a vage idea of where to go beyond that everything was guess work
it wasnt untill i got the strategy guide that i began to try and tackle this beast
as i played on i grew to enjoy all the graphics most battles and appreciate how useful gathering gems and obsidions were
i could tell a lot of effort was put into this game and i applaud all those who developed it you turned out an excellent productstill as the game got more difficult i realized that without the guide is vertually impossible to get through this game
parts of the game are challenging and some logic can be used however all air relm segments life relm and the death relms would drive you mad trying to find the way out of them
i dont like complaining about a game thats too complicated games arent good unless most of them are
but this one fits that cake
extremely well done and thought out but too confusingheres one annoying example
the oracles give you information about where to go next but once you finish the earth water fire and air disks they stop being useful
once you finish disc  the oracle goes continue your search for the remaining disk fragments
oh helpful
almost everyone wouldve forgotten that the rd part of the life disc is in the volacanno area of the fire relm because we were there half the game ago
and then after the life relm is done the oracles speech doesnt change
so how are you supposed to find the death relm
it doesnt give you any clues
you wouldnt even guess that there is a dealth relmit was fun and i was extremly proud of myself for finishing but even with the guide tackleing this monster again probubly wont happenwell i bought this with my xbox and i wish i wouldve got madden
this game looks great really nice visuals
the commentary just plain  if i hear the color commentary guy call a play sweet one more time im gonna puke
the ai just isnt the same quality as ea sports
case in point
playing the computer you can actually call an audible for the same play you called in the huddle and the defense totally changes plays and you can score an easy td
i may be trading this one in for madden soonive been playing this game for awhile and ive decided that its pretty good
i havent tried the  version yet but from what i hear it has its improvements
nfl fever  consists of several game modes
single games dynasty basically like franchise mode fantasy challenge you play created super teams and othersthere are some tools included in the game such as the player editorcreator stadium and uniform editor which allows you to edit the name city uniform and stadium of an nfl team
ive been told theres a play maker in  but i cant seem to find it
if youre a newbie and need help with the controls there is also a practice and tutorial mode but many veterans will end up playing this as well because completing the practice objectives will unlock certain super teams to use in single game mode
the fantasy challenge provides a relief from the sometimes tedious constant regular football
you choose a team and play through a ladder of created super teams
all of them have  overall ratings but they get increasingly harder as you go along
the teams you beat in fantasy challenge can be used in single game modeplaying the game is really fun
the graphics are great though helmets cant pop off from being hit really hard like in madden and the audio is reasonably good
although the announcers can get pretty annoying but what sports video game announcers cant
there are some options in the game settings which include setting the frequency of penalties turning pass interference onoff and turning player taunting onoff among other things
if youre bored of games where turnovers on either side of the ball dont seem a factor and the game really isnt very realistic ummmmm nfl gameday maybe
this is the game for you
you can actually intercept in this game and sometimes there will be fumbles and blocked kicks as well
juking and spinning make a lot bigger of a difference in this game than in those past
another cool feature i found was that if youre playing as visitor and youre beating the home team really badly the stands will start to empty as home team fans leave
its pretty funnythere seemed to be a big problem though in single player game mode
if youre playing rookie and beating everyone and you decide to move up to the veteran difficulty level prepare for a bad surprise
it seems there is a big difficulty gap between rookie and veteran
and until you get used to playing on veteran it can be very hard to win on that level which can get quite frustrating
the dynasty mode was fun for me and if you play them long enough you can unlock hidden stadiums
however there are some quirks needing to be fixed
it can be pretty difficult at times to manage your teams salary cap
also there didnt seem to be enough good players in the nfl draft each offseason besides kickers and puntersthe trade system also had big problems
it is very difficult to get the computer to agree to a trade that youre proposing to them
for instance i decided to try my own trading experience
i went into trade proposals and declined the one in the list
then i made my own trade
i took the same player from the team i had just declined the trade from and offered the same player from my team that they had wanted in their trade
however the acceptability bar at the bottom of the screen didnt move and still said quotunacceptablequot
there are still highlights in dynasty mode though
there are a variety of awards at the end of each season and the superbowl is played in a different city each year which i thought was cool even if it was sometimes unrealistic such as having the superbowl in cleveland lol
there is also a good player tracking system which also displays their awards they have won along with their statsyou know  superbowl mvp has been to  prowbols  offensive rooke of the year etc
etc
all in all nfl fever  is a good game thats well worth your money and will have you hooked playing video game football for hours at a timeif youve gotten tired of the same old console football game like i have this game offers very little new in the way of gameplay
it has some interesting features fantasy stadiums etc and much better graphics than its predecessors  but it is not a major leap above the older games
i would recommend this game if you are a diehard football gaming fan madden lover etc  but if you are a game player more interested in immediate gratification doa nhl hitz like myself i doubt youll find this game very interesting  i didnt
after renting it at the video store i couldnt take more than an hour of nfl fever  before moving on to the other games that i had rentedwhen i rented this game i was so excited
then when i played it i was hooked
but after a couple of days i got so bored of it
i didnt play it again
in the season mode the time is automatically set to  minutes sacking is just too easy and there are too many interceptions
if you want a good football game get madden  or nfl kthis was my first sports game on the xbox
it is absolutely cool
a must have for sports game fans
with all the tops teams and a play editor i gave this game  stars because it deserves themcan you believe i never owned a football game before and to my knowledge only played one once in my entire life
this was in  i just never liked football until a couple years agoanyway i bought madden  i know its an old game with outdated rosters but that doesnt matter to me much
i just want to have fun with the game
what kind of advice do you have for someone who understands football but other than that one time in  has never played a football game beforewill it take me a long time to understand what im doing
i cant fathom at the moment what it must be like for the quarterback to throw the ball to one of his players
it must be really hard to throw the ball to the correct guy and have him run as far as possible
i know nothing about what the speed of the game is going to be like either
all the players on the field might move around too quickly for me to have time to react to anythingthe reason i wanted madden  is because this game has a classic mode where you can go back to how football video games were played in the early s
this is good so in case the gigantic d graphics become too much of a problem for me at least i might have a shot at glory playing the game in an oldfashioned way
i wonder how many weeks or months it will take until it feels comfortable to play this game
how long will it take until understanding exactly whats happening on the field makes perfect senseanyway this madden game has me worried because looking through the instruction booklet each button does something different
i dont even know what most of these things mean
cycle defenders secondary shifts powerswim
what were playing football underwater now
updateunfortunately im having a pretty tough time with the game
the part i said a couple days ago about worrying about the speed of the game seems to be true i have hardly no time to react to the defense and offense of the computer opponents
its like making one mistake will really cost me
i did manage to get a touchdown with the cincinnati bengals
i guess luck was on my sidei personally dont think i have the necessary skills to understand which buttons should be pressed at the exact moment a play happens
it seems all the buttons are used on the controller including the four buttons at the top and apparently i have to press the right button at just the right time
if i make a mistake the other team will do some serious damage to me
if thats going to be the story of madden  well then im done with it
simple as that
if you actually can improve the more you play the game i will continue playing itits too confusing to me how after every play a bunch of options appear on screen asking me what i want to do next
i guess having your players line up on the field in a certain way is very important
i never have any idea what the right move is supposed to be so i just pick one and hope for the best
i figure hey im not a genius
unfortunately the game seems to be designed for people who know football like the back of their hands
there really needs to be an easy modethat classic mode i mentioned about how you can play football the way it was played in the early s is pretty tough also
not to mention slow
each play takes forever to execute because you keep being asked questions about the next play you want to do
to add insult to injury there seems to be a waiting period after you pick an option for the next play
its like these really old and dirty graphics actually require loading
the music is insanely catchy though
the title screen music i mean there is no music when playing a gameall i know when watching football is that you have three attempts to get across the yellow line a gain of  yards
apparently you need to be much smarter and have a better understanding of the technical aspects of football to be able to execute the proper plays in video game form
these madden games require you to be really smart and knowledgeable about the game itself
what i need is someone who has experience with madden games to come over and show me what to do
without help im a lost puppy in the rainwhat bothers me the most is that since they keep releasing new madden games every year its expected that everyone who picks up the newest one will understand the game immediately
the people who create these games dont realize how much trouble regular fans of football will have playing a game
you cant just tune in every sunday to watch a game and expect to understand video game football
it doesnt work that wayits entirely possible that someone like me could experience the madden series for the first time in february  despite the fact that the series has been around since the early s
i would love to see someone play the game i just bought madden  to see how you actually play the thingim giving the game  stars because im holding on to the hope that one day i will have a better understanding of how the game works and improve my skillsi have owned all the madden nfl games for the previous  years on pc
my only problem with this game and the only reason i downgraded it from  stars is that at least for me going between levels pro and lower and allpro is very difficult
more than that pro is so easy that i always win every game by  touchdowns
i have never come close to a challenging game at pro level but if i turn it up  level i can never come close to ever winning
i lose by alot and cannot do anything right though i have tried for along time
so i am stuck with the dilema of never being challenged in pro or never having any fun coming close to winning at the next higher level
this really to me and has turned a really sophisticated great game into a real bore
sorry this has to be fixed or i will never buy madden againmadden is as good as ever on this game but i have to admit that nfl fever is better
dont get me wrong i love madden each year i wait for it to come out
i got madden first played thought it was a great game
then i went to best buy i saw an xbox and wondered what game was on there so i tried it out
the game was nfl fever and i am stunned madden better start making something greater and better or for the next  years its gonna be nfl fever once after another we madden fans all know that madden started on sega genesis and kept going to today
thats right fokes madden is running for its money scary aint it
if madden wants to keep on going for the next ten years it better think up something better than nfl fever which i think is going to be mission impossible for maddenps  the reviewer that said that madden on the xbox is the exact same thing as on ps i want to ask you one question why did you buy it for xbox if u had it on ps
when i buy a game i only buy it on one consolei think ea sports nailed stock car racing with this xbox effort
the only essential element nascar thunder is missing is maybe a fight or two in the pits after a race
that seems to be a pretty exciting part of the sport since they show them on tv all the time
either that or they should go all the way back to the sports roots and have players smuggling moonshine across county lines
but thats all wishful thinking
for now nascar thunder  is as good a stock car sim as youre going to see but the overall appeal of this game is truly a matter of tasteif you play videogames to escape the real world then thunder is only going to get you so far if youre not a diehard nascar fanatic
sure you can go  mph in some marvelous machines but  of the time youll only be going in a circle on tracks that demand more raw speed than driving skill
put another way theres a reason other racing games like gran turismo  always use ovals for test driving and it aint for their level of difficulty
thunder  is an excellent stock car racing sim that cannot and should not moonlight as a mass appeal racing gameok the xbox rocks the graphics are killer but there is more to games
thunder  has great graphics but could have been alot betterafter a race some hightlights are shown should have been able to view a replay i would think a better gui would have been possible navigating the many menus to get to where you want to go is a paini won a few chapionships and unlocked custom cars which are available to you thru the quotdriver selectquot menu not the car select menu
so you pick a custom car there and you cannot pick a driver you are now quotunknownquot and all your stats and scores no longer bear your name
great all that work to unlock an anonymous thing
and if you save your carreer turn off the power load it back up poof you can no longer access the great quotunknownquot driverdocumentation is shallow
the unlocked cars are mentioned once saying they can be obtained and that is itspecial features and settings are not explained
like the informative best line  a line that shows where on the track to be to get best lap times  has  colors no explanation of the colorsand are there is no legend top  players that i can see only the racing stats that get partially reset everytime you finish a year of racingwhen another player loads their game the other players no longer exist in any statsthe racing experience is great but the game seems to be thrown together around a great driving enginetony hawk x is exactly what you expect  an amazing translation of tony hawk and  with extra touches such as more detailed characters and crisper textures and details on the environments
unfortunately because its exactly what you expect this isnt a game that can be recommended to everyone
if you havent played tony hawk  or  on the other systems and youve just picked up an xbox then this is definitely worth your purchase
if youve already played the games on the other systems and dont own a gamecube or ps with which to play tony hawk  then this might be a game to consider for you launch package
but if you answered no to any of the above this is probably not worth your money unless youre a diehard tony hawk completist that must own every version ever made
despite the new additions this just cant compete with the gameplay in neversofts latest effort no matter how polishedhuh what who ok maybe it is because i am not a skater maybe it is because i am older then most players or maybe it is because the game get boring real fastrentrentrentrentbefore you buy that is all i am going to say rent it first really rent this first and you will seethis game was easy until the end where you have to use a codei use to own this for the ps years ago
i wanted to play it again so i bought it for the xbox thinking it would work on my  to my dismay it doesnt
i couldnt even play it again so i sold itthis game is alright but once you beat it it gets kind of old
the bonus levels are a cool addition to the xbox version of the game but the multiplayer modeslevels are not that various and are not as fun as expected
if you are a star wars fan it is worth renting before you buy it
i would have still gotten it if i played it before i bought it i guessthis is a pretty good game but the original one is better so i recomend you buying the original one as opposed to this onewhats so special about this game
well nothing really
its not bad
i mean i really liked the ps edition
i was really hoping they would improve on the xbox version alot and they uh didnt
its fun with good graphics and controls though
if you own the original then you might want to just skip this one
if not then go ahead and buy itthis is a star wars game that originally came out near the launch of the ps and was later ported to xbox as a special edition package
i just recently finally picked up an xbox and being a star wars fan decided to give this one a spinthis is a solid and playable game but in hindsight its nothing special
some star wars games have been outstanding jedi knight knights of the old republic some have been dirt poor obiwan and others have tried hard without quite hitting the mark clone wars bounty hunter
starfighter kinda falls on the lower end of that last category
graphics are very firstgeneration circa  getting the job done without blowing you away
the story weaves together three separate characters and their ships and ties into episode i but it just doesnt becoming involving
the gameplay is based off the rogue squadron series developed by factor  a mix of arcade and flightsim where you destroy stuff and protect targets in the star wars universe
only theres not a lot of innovation from rogue squadron and it feels like more of the same from levels you played during the n erastarfighter feels like a safe product for lucasarts a game they could churn out with a proven formula inbetween bigger projects
its worth picking up for any star wars fans looking to complete their collection but everyone else should passon the surface x evo  is the ultimate offroad game it has good graphics lots of sweet vehicles and tons of real upgrades
but when you actually start to play you notice many things wrong with the game
my main complaint is with the computer components
they are able to bash push rub and run you off the road without slowing down in fact they actually speed up
while you are left choking in their dust
they also have the ability to catch up with you no matter how far ahead you are or how much faster your vehicle is than theirsmy other complaint is with the environment
even though you have a quot lift kit and quot tires on your truck dont even think about trying to drive over a rock or youll find your self stopped dead in your tracks
the same goes with the checkpoint markers any other obstacle such as a fence or sign you can plow right over but not that little wooden sign marking a checkpoint
and if you miss a checkpoint or drive of a cliff and need to reset your vehicle back on the track the game puts you like a  yards back from where you needed to reset but if one of the computer opponents needs to reset it gets plopped down nicely exactly where it ran into problemsthis is one of those games you want to play over and over again and can really get to liking it a lot but at the same time hating it enough to brake the cd into a thousand piecesx evo  has elements of a very good game but the graphics are so disappointing it isnt worthwhilethe game centers around a career mode
you start out with k and have to buy a vehicle and then earn money for upgrades
you can earn money by participating in races organized into series or by completing missions
as you progress up the career path you get involved with teams and have the opportunity to purchase better equipmentthe races take place over large courses with competitors that are nothing short of ruthless
you are free to take any path you want to get to the next checkpoint
in fact using shortcuts is necessary to be competitive on some tracks
along the way the competition will do everything they can to keep you from winning
expect to be trading paint all the way to the finishthe missions usually involve finding a location on a map
you are shown a crude map of the location and then given a detail contour map for routefinding
the task is often easier said than done since the terrain is difficult to traverse and finding your goal on the contour map isnt easy
the missions may sound dull but they actually add a nice touch to an otherwise standard driving gameunfortunately the games graphics are so bad it just isnt worth buying
the vehicle models have almost no detail and no damage modelling
the environments while very large are visually unappealing and dont appear to be up to xbox quotstandardsquot at alli was so looking forward to this game but it turned out to be a weak copy of the playstation  ace combat  game
the graphics and sound are not nearly as good the planes are not as much fun to fly and overall it just pales in comparison to ac
thats not to say the graphics arent good but relatively speaking they are somewhat lackingthis game involves flying combat missions to attack air and ground targets
you begin by leaving an airbase and crossing a map of the region to get to your intended mission
however before you can actually fly the assigned mission you must complete several minimissions that might involve a dogfight with one or two aircraft and an attack on some ground targets
and in many cases you will have to fight these exact same battles over and over each time you pass through an area
this becomes very repetitive very fast and thus very tiresome
the minimission feature ruins what might have been an otherwise great gameif youve never played the ace combat games you may enjoy this game but be prepared for some repetitive game play
if by chance you have both an xbox and a ps i highly recommend you buy ace combat  and skip this onei bough afds thinking it would be like playing an interactive version of the tom cruise flick quottop gunquotits not
the objectives are extremely hard and the gameplay just not that enthralling
my copy  collecting dustright next to shrekthis game is very fun except for one reason
the reason being is that when the superstars come either the music stops and the game freezes or when the credits at the begining of the game stop and the game once again freezeswell im big into wrestling games and some of you may notice i owe a trunk load of wrestling video gamesi had actually ordered this one  months in advance and then cancelled the order  days before it was going to be shipped and went and bought it
i just couldnt wait through all of the shipping and etcra
the way i percieve the gamethe wrestlers all walk like they need to use the bathroomit is nearly impossible to do a finishing manueverit lacks the variety of matches that sdjbi hadit does have a longer championship modervd is on the game you must unlock himthe entrances are good but could still use a little tweakingthe gameplay is very hard to get use to at firstyou better rent it before you buy itthat is the truth
i wouldnt lie
i gave you the good and the bad all on  listthis game is a hardcore gamers best friend but a casual gamers worste enemy
if you love wwf and you watch it and wish or maybe you do go to matches which i dont then get the game and fast
but for people like me i dont think sothe night i purchased my ps i also purchased max payne mgs and this
this was the first game i played
i immediately turned up the sound on the tv and got ready for a cool game
thats exactly what i received
definetely has the best storyline out of gta  and  now that vice city is out
i recommend getting the double pack
it includes both games for only  at most storesthe graphics are horrible
it also takes like  minutes to load
the game is extremely fun but way to violent
the game is full of bad language blood and just plaingraphic scenes
also some missions are kind of boring and tediousthis is an ok game but if you want a good gta game get gta san andreas this game dosent have the large selection of guns and it is just to easy to die on this game but it is ok and kinda fun
thank you for reading this review and hope you found it helpfuli think that this game is extremely overrated i want to give it  stars but i couldnt
i will say it is a very creative game and interesting but that is it
personally i want vice city now that will be the game of the centuryadvice if you want gta  just wait until the end of the month because vc will be out thenthe graphics are really good but they could have been better like in final fantasy xthe violence is realistic but unecessarily grose at timescars break into pieces very realisticallythe missions are a lot of fun but can get so hard that youll never want to play the game againgame requires a lot of time and patience to beatthis is still probably one of the best games ever madei know that hyperactive violenceobsessed fanboys will immediately  bombard me with not helpful votes for giving the almighty grand theft auto iii an average score but let me explain myselfthis is a fun game
its enormous  huge city subdivisions
its definitely innovative the influential free roaming game design but it wasnt even the most innovative game of  a title that goes to ico as far as im concerned
i like the explicit content factor
anything that pisses off those fragile politically correct leftwing senators has my approval
being a nameless mafia guy is a pretty fun experience
cruising around liberty city while listening to talk radio
causing mayhem when the missions become dull
finding all the hidden packagesbut now allow me to explain the problems i have with gta iiieverything in the game feels very vulnerable
its a bit too harsh on taking damage and dying
maybe for realisms sake
the sports cars in a word suck
theyre far too flimsy and if you use one to escape from the cops itll most likely blow up before you manage to get a good hiding spotthe game gives you all these wonderful weapons to play with baseball bat pistols uzis grenades molotov cocktails  types of machine guns flamethrower sniper rifle and rocket launcher
unfortunately if you actually try to use any of these to try and kill people youll take too much damage too fast or alert the cops and trigger a nasty chaseto get the maximum amount of fun out of the game you have to use the cheat codes which im betting is the main reason people still play it
oh and you also cant swim or explore the insides of most buildings for reasons unknown
which is ridiculous for a game that prides itself on realismits not as overrated as halo but i have no idea why the reviewers at egm gave this a gold award
check it out to see a decent game behind a giant cloud of overhypethis game is aight
it gets boring after a while thoughi have read some reviews and i must say i agree that this is a great game
you can pretty much go anywhere it is challenging the graphics are great and pretty much everything anyone else has saidbut i must also say that this is an extremely violent game
i dont know that there is a need for that kind of violence and there is something wrong with killing innocent people and not getting punished for it
this is not appropriate for teens or children not at all
morals aside it is great and a lot of funhmmmmwhat does that say about me
really though the game is put together well and you can actually try to avoid killing pedestrians and innocent people but sooner or later it will happen
you will also be pitted against police fbi and cia becomming a wanted criminal many times through out the game
again i dont know if that is such a good thing
it is exciting but my biggest problem with the game is that children and teens will play it and though it is not the fault of the game writers i feel there is a moral obligation that is being sacrificed for profit
of course this is probably the wrong place to voice this opinion
anyway i gave it  stars for that reason
if i had no moral problem with the game i would have given it  starsof course the game is good enough that i still play once in a while soi got this game when it originally came out and it was a good time i had a blast with the free roaming ability however there are things that get tiresome and more noticeable especially after playing vice city and san andreas  negatives to me are repetitive soundtrack after awhile character has no personality the twist in the middle of the game that makes you change allegiances the mission to kill a certain mafia boss that forces you to be precise with a one bullet sniper shot otherwise ur dead takes the fun out of the missioni should be able to stand on the corner and just blaze with armor on and see what happens using my machine gun and grenades the handling of the cars is rough at times and they blow up too easilyi could go on but the story just doesnt impress meits a lot of fun to roam but the story does little to make me want to continue pass the plot twistgta is a pretty decent game
i dont own it but ive played it extensivly
the graphics and the sounds are flawless
the d enviorment is a definate improvment from the brdseye view of gta and gta
the thing that marks it down on my rating is the general point of the game
commit as much trouble as possible
thats just a little ummmsilly to me
the other thing that marked it down was the boringness
i played the game for aobut three hours
after two hours the game got oldfast
those are my only two complaintsi am not an avid gamer of this series this is my first gta i got one because my son has several of them and i was shown the games in action by himi like the game but playability is a problem when it comes to timed missionstoo much traffic too slow vehicles city map on screen too smalland some of these missions are quite tedious and take too long but then they dont give you enough time to complete them with all the traffic bad mapsslow vehicles etci much prefer the midnight club series to thesew gtasi would vociferate this game as extremely irritating
the radio songs are repetitivethe ai is stupid
the radar is so darn small your eyes start to sore
most of the vehicles are taxis and trucksgetting from one island to another is frustrating
overall speaking this game is for those who have ample time to spare and do not get easily irritated
most of the missions are epigrammatic and gang members get angry at you on inconcequential issuesits an extremely strenous task to find ammowell thats all i have to sayi would this game no more than  starsrockstar games has to come out with something worthy
theyre way better than thisstraight out of the packaging doa is a beautiful game
the graphics are very detailed fluid intense and colorful
and so is the action for that matterthough the game is okay for a single player it is much better suited for cooperative play or player vs player
you see while there are many different game modes like survival and time attack i cant believe this game so blatantly forgot a single player vs computer mode for single fights scored by kos or how many round are won that is present in any other fighting game like mortal kombat or street fighter
what you say
no player vs computer well yes there is survival mode in which you choose a character and fight cpu players right after another until either the cpu or you is knocked out but you have no choice in who you fight or where in this modeits all randomi would really have likes a mode where you could pick your opponent and play for the best  out of  rounds lets saysound excellent control over sound
in game settings you can adjust music volume combat volume special attackseffects volume
however i hope you like aerosmiththey provide  songs that you fight to throughout the game
they are decent and adrenaline pumpingbut aerosmith
should have been technogame control the game is somewhat sensitive to your hand on the game pad
could be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it
the a b x y white amp black buttons and triggers work great
however i found the  directional dpad a little too sensitiveoften resulting in wrong directional combos because you must press it perfectly
this fact carriers over to how you control you players attacks
like most fighting style genre games each character has hisher own set of moves based on the pressing of buttons in combination
while i see no other way around this and this is the norm for these type of games in doa it can become ridiculous
basic moves are easy to pull off but those spectacular moves require such precision and sometimes lengthy combos you most likely only use them by luck
because of the fast pace of this game doa turns more into a button masher console that a true strategy gamepractice mode you can practice your moves in a special mode but as stated above you really need to have extremely great coordination to pull some of them off
you get frustrated with some of the movesstory mode  the only real  player mode is slightly weird
you pick a character and try to complete a story by battling  cpu controlled players then a boss at the end
if you complete all  matches you unlock a great graphically detailed end cut scene that centers around the character
but heres the problems  all voice overs are in japanese with english subtitles
the only english you here is you win you lose start
okaywhy
if they can put this in english why cant they do the rest in english
why do i have to read subtitles that go by so fast
 flaws in the overall story  okayyou picked your character and now must fight  battles
i get this but some of the dialogue does not flow from one battle to the next
two sentences between characters before a fight does not give much of a storyor build up
i think the strangest thing is the battle the boss
after you win battle  you are transported to a hellish like realm and must fight this evil looking samurai named omega
but it is really never explained how you got there or why you are there who he is why you must fight him how he fits into any of the storylines no dialogue
most stories have a build up to the last the showdowna goal that players can understand
omega is just there
if you defeat him which he has really impressive yet hard to dodge special attacks you immediately see the final cut scene
end of story
very anticlimaticcamera mode sit back and watch two cpu players knock each other silly but neither wins
yesthats rightall you do is watch and there is no victory
umwhyall in all doa  has the potential to be a great game
the graphics are there the music and effects are there the characters with special moves are there
whats lacking is credible story and a good  player mode
this game is definitely fun if you can get someone else to play youthats where it shinesone of my favorite games on the underrated dreamcast i looked forward to playing this updated edition and launchworthy title on the xbox
sadly i never felt that it lived up to my original experience
graphically it is eye candy but the controller interface never feels quite responsive or natural and i found more frustration and boredom than the strategic excitement of the previous effort
the xbox suffers from a dearth of good fighting and rpg titles both of which hurt its standing against sony
this one does little to fill the gap and though it looks better its light years behind the enjoyment of say virtua fighter  on playstation one of the best games graphically i have seen
i think you will have more fun playing this four player rather than against the computer
i would buy it again
tecmo could have done better with the grab function on here
sometimes it is a tossup as to who gets the move you or your opponent
if you like fighting games cop this well this is undoubtedly the best looking game ive seen
the attention to detail in the huge levels is astounding and the characters look great
unfortunately its not as good as it looks
the first thing i did was play in story mode without looking at any of the moves in the manual
i was able to beat the game with the majority of the characters simply by employing buttonmasher tactics
the last boss is extremely lame and so patterned and predictable you just want to shut the machine off and watch tv for a challenge
overall its an incredible launch title it leaves me excited about the future of the xbox but overall this game seems a bit hollowthis game has some really tight graphics but i rented it about  minutes ago and i beat it ten minutes later and thats including watching the little movie before the game
if you like games where you can press any buttons and not know what youre doing and still win then this game is for you
however if youre looking for a game with awesome graphics and detail that has a bit more challenge try mortal kombat deadly alliance
hell even doa extreme beach volleyball was more challenging than this waste of timerent this before you buy it or youll be sorrywhats good nice graphics
great creative moves that are easy to use
its one of the top  fighting games along with street fighter and mortal kombat when it comes to enjoyable characters
lots of attitude and a killer soundtrack provided by aerosmithwhats bad like most fighting games these days its waaaaaaaaay too simple
it took me less than  minutes to beat all of the other characters
weak storylines
whats with the characters talking in japanese and having english subtitles
the rounds are way too short
each round lasts like  seconds and that if youve got a good fight on your hands
if its a weak fight then about  seconds top
you only play one round with each character
theres about  characters you have to fight
you do the mathways to improve the graphics are top notch in my book work on the game play and make the game more difficult without making it too difficult
have a mode where you can accesorize your characters ala extreme beach
get rid of the subtitles and make the characters speak english for the love of christi like this game which is a miracle because i did not like the last one or the one before that or the one before that
it is my opinion that dead or alive is about nothing else but exploitation
this statement holds true of doa  but for some strange reason it works for me this time
i noticed that the bounce that the series is well known for has been toned down significantly and the movement of the characters is more realistic
i guess because the game itself has less of an emphasis on exploitation that i can take it more seriously as a fighter game which is why i enjoyed this one and plan to buy it laterhowever some of its predecessors weaknesses rear their ugly head
once again the game attempts to tell an incoherent and irrelevant story that makes no sense
temco needs to learn how to tell a cohesive narrative in the worst way
the fighting engine itself becomes tiresome as many of the computeroperated characters can be beaten with the same simple combination kicks over and over again
the repetitive nature of the combat makes this fighter only good in a twoplayer match
once you get over the graphics the game becomes quite shallow
still fun but shallowits fun but whats annoying is that a rookie player just pressing buttons has a chance to beat someone that is an intermediate playergraphics indeed are amazing
tag team is somewhat funi ended up with doa  since it was included with one of the xbox quotpacksquot
fighting games never interested me so i was surprised that i initially found this game very enjoyable
part of that enjoyment probably came from the graphics
just about every other review has raved about them and they are right
the graphics are great
on several occasions i found myself looking at the detail of the sets and not fightinghowever once youve gotten past the eye candy youll find there isnt too much there
playing through the story mode is somewhat interesting since you learn a bit about each of the characters and get to see some cut scenes but story mode is much too short in terms of the number of fights and the stories are laughable at bestthis game is worth having around to play against other people as it is the only way it provides lasting entertainment
other than that it isnt worth keeping on the shelf
if you dont think youll be playing against other people go rent it for a couple days and enjoy the eye candy starsvery shiny me likey shiny
quotshow your musclequot graphics make up for lack of character concepts visual and fighting style in this entertaining but a fighter is still a fighter launch
lacking the imagination of the tekken series or bushido blade leave this game mostly for the fighter  heart and great for gaming with friendsdead or alive  is a fast paced and graphically outstanding fighting game
the game is three dimensional and the comabt is based on a mix of punches kicks throws and counters  moves that catch punches and kicks and reverse them usually damaging the opponentthe standard mix of modes are available story or arcade mode versus mode a practice mode team battles a timed attack mode beat eight enemies as fast as you can and a survival mode beat as many enemies as you can before you fall
there are tag battle modes available in the versus mode which allows you to control two characters and tag them in and out during a fight
you can even get them both on the screen at once for special combo attacksgraphically dead or alive  is one of the ost stunning games made thus far
the visuals are absolutely breathtakingdead or alive  has one major flaw it is not very deep
well actually that isnt fair the depth is there but it is nearly inaccessible
good fighting games are built on strategies that go several layers deep and we have that in doa
counters can defeat punches and  kicks throws can defeat counters and strikes can defeat throws
the different characters all have a huge assortment of moves in each category and each move does varying amounts of damage and works at varying ranges
furthermore none of the characters are broken or unfair so all the elements are there for an outstanding fighting system
unfortunately the game is too bloody fast and the moves are too hard to do
this observation may just be a reflection on my skill as a gamer but i dont believe it is
the pace of the combat is simply too fast and the number of options is simply too large to allow combat to evolve very far from button mashingdoa is still a lot of fun to play with your friends and its lack of real depth actually keeps the game balanced between veterans and beginners
veterans will definitely have the edge as they will be able to get at some the depth that should be there and exploit strategies the beginners cant but anyone can still fall sometimes to some wild button mashingall in all if you really have to have a fighter youll be able to enjoy doa as a quick fix for your addiction but it wont provide the sort of lasting satisfaction and near infinite replay value that some of the classic fighting games have given usjust wanna say that the graphics in this game are absoltely beatiful but the gameplay is rather weak and gets boring quite quiclyit is by no means a bad game at all it is good but it would disappoint many because with such amazing graphics you would expect great gaemplay too and unfortunately the gameplay isnt that great
the single player bored me and a lot of other owners of the game i know in a few weeks
the multiplayer is fun but nowhere near as good as smash bros melee for gc
there is not much that hasnt been seen in other fighting games here
once u get past the graphic you will find an average fighter
buy smash bros melee instead because it also has awesome graphics and more importantly plays like a dream with friends
me and some friends have played it since november and we are nowhere near bored of it
so wait for the inevitable sequel which will hopefully focus more on the gameplay elements and also look out for soul calibur ii coming out later this year because it will rockafter seeing the commercials for this game it had me convinced that this was a fighting game that features all female fighters
i was wrong of course but instead it features a slew of copied fighters from tekken playstation game pro wrestling there is a wrestler that looks exactly like hulk hogan and ninja gaiden very old nintendo game
the game itself is much like tekken and the graphics are astonishing with incredibly detailed fighting arenas that interact with the fighters such as electric fences which do more damage and areas with deep snow where you can run through the snow and the snow stays matted
the fighters themselves are very lifelike but the graphics alone cannot hold up this game can they
the gameplay is at best quite different there is a punch kick fierce punch fierce kick tag and grapple buttons
the grapple button is used to perform unique takedowns suplexes and or throws
the moves are quite simple to pull off whether pushing a punch button or holding back and pushing a punch button to perform a different move
because the moves are simple to pull off that makes for a quick learning curve but a quick boredom curve because you will be performing the same moves constantly
there are great modes such as a story mode tag battle mode with good double team moves survivor mode which pits you against fighters until you are defeated a watch mode to see the computer fight the computer a training mode and a practice mode
in all the game does not offer much to the fighting plate to make it different from the rest of the fighting games other than its graphics so skip this gamethe game has a good system but needs many improvementslet me get this out of the way doa is gorgeous
moving on doa is a good buy for your xbox if not for the fighting at least for the graphics
if you have never played a doa game before and are expecting anything close to soul calibur or virtua fighter be warned
while doa is a great game for button mashers and firsttime players it leaves little for the true fighting game enthusiasts to bite on
after the initial shock of the eyemelting visuals subsides you are not left with much
the fighters are hollow and dont have nearly as much attacks as other fighting games
that said the games reversal system is extremely smooth and satisfying though much too easy when it comes to timing the counters
the reversal system is based more on luck than actual skill decreasing the games longterm value
the sound is equally hollow and is made up of lifeless grunts and yells
being the fighting game player that i am i am very strict about how complex i want games to be and my  expectations are high
but for the casual fighting game players add another star to my score and buy the game
the graphics alone are reason enough to purchase this game and show your friends why xbox is the undesputed champion when compared to the other consolescome on 
get up the hill you can do it look your going to get this game to play with other people because playing it alone  simply put
the game could have been a little better with a better story mode as it stands now you can bet story mode with every player in a hour at most
after that your left with squatthe look of the game is great and there has never been one that has looked better but looks alone do very little
if you like fighting games this is for you if your looking for something with depth dont buy this onei played doa hardcore for my good ol ps and that was as good as ps graphics got now the game moved to the most powerful system on the market the xbox and the graphics are oohmyyy goodness the best until splinter cell came out but the only thing i find wrong is after you get past the graphics and beat the game with everyone its pretty much a better graphics more characters version of doa hardcore and i dont like a seemlike port of a good game but hey i still like the game it just dont seem like a true sequal just like tekken  but anyone with a xbox and never played doa then this is the fighting game  git
if u have i suggest a rental and that is something i didnt do but its one of the xboxs best showpiciesi really enjoyed doa the fighting system is amazing the graphics are outstanding
but i got the game yesterday and i have already beaten the story mode with every character
the game is much too short
i know there are other game options besides the story mode but one would expect the story to be the bulk of the game and well it isntwith todays console war heating up the pros and cons of each system are brought into the spotlight
one of the most important parts of a console is the controller because it can actually increase or dampen the enjoyment of playing a game
so how does microsofts consoles controller stand
unfortunately while the overall design is adequate its plagued by some serious flaws that might force some gamers to buy peripherals to hook up their xbox with a dual shock first of all the design of the xbox controller is remarkably similar to the dreamcasts controller in size and location of the analog sticks
the dpad is good enough and the trigger buttons are also wellmade
gamers might have to strain to reach the black and white buttons above the four face buttons but thats easy to get used tothe biggest flaw that many gamers including myself cite against this controller is its size
some gamers with large hands might find this controller comfortable but a lot of gamers cant use the xbox controller without constant readjustment of the hands
players sometimes have to strain thier muscles just to reach a particular button or analog stick which can get really annoying
and while the face buttons are in the right places they are so bunched together that pressing a wrong button is a frequent problem for some gamers
if microsoft hadnt used up a lot of room on the controller for the enormous xbox logo as if players will need a reminder of what system theyre playing the controller wouldve been a lot betteranother problem are the buttons themselves
while playing games with this controller i found that pressing the buttons sometimes didnt register a command in the game as if the game didnt know i had pressed a button
this might be attributed to the fact that the buttons are pressuresensitive but the biggest reason is probably because the buttons are in a horrible oval shape that bulge too far out
if games cant register a decent press given to the buttons the controller needs some serious adjustment
coupled with the first problem mentioned and playing a game can be quite frustratingoverall the xbox controller is fairly decent but it couldve been so much more
there is a reason why microsoft brought the japanese xbox controller to the us and is making that the standard xbox controller the number of people displeased with the american xbox controller was too big to ignore
if microsoft had paid more attention to the sensitivity of the buttons and less attention to the ugly logo that takes up a lot of space on the controller face the xbox controller wouldve been the ultimate controller
as it stands now its only for gamers who found the dual shock  too small to usei bought my xbox before the formerly japanonly type s controller became standard
i bought a type s when they became available but i quickly realized that i was already perfectly comfortable with the original and trying to force myself to switch wasnt worth it
theres no denying that the original xbox controller is huge compared to other controllers but if its comfortable then size isnt an issue
and i do find it perfectly comfortable
theres big and theres too big
this controller is not too big for me
and for the record my hands are not large
in fact they might be a bit smaller than averageunfortunately the reason im here now is to replace my original packin controller because its already worn out
it isnt even a year old june   and already the analog sticks are sticky and glitchy
i think the culprit is gunvalkyrie which involves constant stick pushing ie
using the sticks as buttons
ive had other controllers wear out but never this fast
oh well everything needs a flaw of some kindlike it
it is the original duke aka its huge like the sega dreamcast controller but larger
the buttons are layed out differently that the scontroller
the duke has a more slanted box fashion than the upright diamond of the s making it a strange adjustmentthis controller is big man
microsoft design the big controller for there big consoledid microsoft like to make big size for us
heh
i think soi try the controller at future shopthis thing is big alrighti can reach my thumb on the analog stick and the pad with no problemquotbut why big for us microsoftquot what about the little kidsthey like to play your console toothose little kids hand wont reach the padhey microsoft make xbox controller like ps amp gamecubethere controller is medium size and just right for our handshaving grown up on nintendo and playstation i automatically bought a memory unit for the xbox
you dont need one unless you plan to save games and go to a buddies house
i play only at home and really didnt need this capability
get xbox live while youre at it tooi never really had a use for this other than a portable save holderyou know somebody else with an xboxim thinking this thing works like the extra memory in the ninetendo   that some games wont work unless you have it
no
this is strictly for saving characters amp game settings and transferring them to other machines
your xbox will run any game without itthe good side is that you can play any dvd you want at any time
the bad side is that it is way too expensiveits  new and  used
i mean the price is terrible but the reason is oki own both an xbox and a ps and the xbox controller as basic looking as it is is much easier to use than the ps dvd controller
i guess theres really not that much to say about a remote except the fact that it is disappointing that you have to purchase a remote if you want to watch dvds on your xbox
its not like microsoft doesnt have any moneypros works fine
no ir connection problems great for people that dont already have a dvd playercons doesnt play dvds in progressive scan
why not
they can make games in p old hd for the xbox takes up a controller port slot
not a big deal but if you often have  friends playing you wont be able to leave it in all the time no backlit or glow no eject button no power button
what
never seen a remote without a power button
thus you cannot turn your xbox onoff with this remote cannot learn not universal
if you have lots of remotes youre better off learning this one into a universal remote many people already own a dvd player many with progressive scani havent had any problems yet with my xbox dvd playback kit but i should also tell you that i havent tried many dvds
while my experience has been flawless ive heard several experiences that are the opposite
basically your xbox is already capable of playing dvds you only need to purchase the playback kit which consists of two parts   a receiver that you plug into one of your xbox controller ports and  a remote control that you use to direct the dvd player
the remote comes with the usual assortment of dvd options but as others have pointed out two annoying omissions are a power button and an eject button
a power button would be especially useful considering the xbox hardware is practically a desktop computer and needs a little rest every now and then
i know friends that have had problems running some dvds but the worst news ive heard about the xbox dvd player is that microsoft employs different vendors to manufacture its disc drives and some models are not as dependable as others
therefore you could be limiting your xbox consoles lifespan by using it as a dvd player as well as a video game system
the dvd playback kit is recommended for anyone that doesnt own a dvd player as its a cheaper alternative and provides quality picture and sound but if you already own a dvd player i would keep it and stick with video games for the xboxthis remote should come with the unit which already has a dvd player as a part of the standard unit
making customers pay extra for functionality of an included item sounds just like microsoftnot even  stars but  this remote for the xbox is ok its not really what i had hoped for but it does work for the most partthe kit is ok i suppose
the controller is pretty hokey and it bothered me that there was no power button
it is pretty light weight not in a good way and hollow
the dvd picture is clear but what dvd player isnt
i dont have too much to say about it
at least it was cheap
too bad you need to buy it to play dvds on xboxof course i bought this to turn the xbox into a dvd player
it does that and it does it well
the dvd playing on the xbox is really nice but regarding this item itself the remote its simply okthe buttons on the remote could have been placed in a more organized and comfortable fashion
its a little confusingother than that im happy using the dvd on the xbox although i dont know if thats due to this item or the xbox console itselfwhen the xbox first came out i figured it would be a good competition for the ps
sadly this is far from the truth
the ps automatically came with a working dvd player without having to buy an add on or attachment to play themalthough on the plus side it does make a very nice attachment
the device works really well and works just as good as if it were a dvd player
the remote is simple not too fancy and not much to memorize
the remote comes with a owners manual with instructions on how to use the device in case you get stuck on how to use the devicemy only confusion about all of this is why do you have to buy an attachment when the device was already dvd ready to begin with
the answer is simple to make you go out and purchase more xbox items and give microsoft more money
so for those of you who were confused about why the dvd player wasnt working this is your answer and this is the only solution for it
you have to buy the attachment to be able to play dvdsi thought the concept of this was pretty cool at first but when i started playing this alot it got very boring
in this game you build a zoo feed animals make them shelters clean their pooh etc
but when you play this alot it gets annoying and boring
heres an example you make a place for animals to live say you have  living there
make them a shelter give them food put some trees and your done
but thats not it animals have to be happy at all times and that when the game really gets boring
they complain there is not enough foliage or food or a certain type of terrain they want or too much trampled terrain and the list goes on and on
you must make every animal happy at all time or visitors wont like your zoo
if you have a big zoo its even worse you must change the terrain every damn second of the game because its allways being trampled on or an animal is not happy with it and i mean every second almost literally
theres allways something you must do to make them happy and i just got sick of it
it was a waste of my time
so you might like it the first time you play it but when you get use to it you will hate it to death
please take my word for it it is very repetative and gets boring fastmaybe that is my problem i purchased this game with high expectations
i am a very big fan of roller coaster tycoon both rct   and both expansions but zoo tycoon is not a fun
first of all the staff members have less control
your maintenance people they are the ones in charge of making your park look nice tend to have a mind of their own
some of the animals are impossible to please
i will add that the game is more challenging
roller coaster tycoon is all about the guests
youre job is to make you park work nice and if you do things correctly the roller coasters dont complain about not having enough to eat or that they need more work done on them or they are feeling crowded by too many guests
the animals however are easily upset difficult to take care of and its very easy to forget about your guests and worry only about your animals
that makes the game a little more interactive you have to work extremely hard to make sure youre zoo is productive the staff and zookeepers are also more expensive
you have to worry about the animals reproducing dont worry mom and dad there are no graphics for that the babies just appear lest the animals grow to large for their enclosure
in my opinion that is what makes the game more fun than its sister roller coaster tycoonone of the big downsides at least in my opinion is that their is no winning
in roller coaster tycoon you have objectives and each scenario is different or more difficult
in zoo you pick your own level of difficulty but there is no way to really win
i am very competitive and for me there has to be closure
i currently have a zoo that has been open for ten years its completely developed and i have over a million dollars i started with only k what else do i need to do to win
needless to say i have lost intrest in that park and only bring it up and use it when i am boredthere is a fairly good sized variety of animals and you never run out its fun to make your guests happy and make money you also get to see the private donations that your exhibit attracts and that is quite fun as well
overall i am glad that i own it but i most definatley will not be buying the expansion packs
its a fun family game that really can capture you for  hours and its seems like you just started to play
overall fun game starsi was searching online looking for a sim type game and came across zoo tycoon
i couldnt wait to get it in the mailpros great graphics lots of animals to choose from and download have there own unique sound and you just dont put the animals in there you have to make sure their exhibit is suitablecons do get boring real fast esspecially having to build an exhibit for each animal time and time again
dont have enough excitement
the only bad thing that can happen is an animal gets loose and the guests take off running
i dont even know if they even die if they get attack
overall it is okay and because i am a fan of sim type games ill probably play it again down the linebecause of games like rct and other tycoon games here is a another nice tycoon game but with some problemsin this game you get lots of scenarios to play and the main things you use to attracted guests with animals all over the worldand very lots of them
and there are informations about animals in the park which would make the game more fun
but the problem is the creativity part is missing here
in games like rct you can carve your landscape in the park very easily and make complex tunnels and do almost anything you can think of but here the focus of the game is managing your animals instead of buliding creativity filled parkoverall its quite enjoyableespacailly if you like to watch cute animals wander around in their cages and do cute stuff
but if you dont feel like taking care of your animals in the zoo there are other great tycoon games to playi downloaded the demo and i thought the game was good
then i got the full version and it was better
but although there are many animals to choose from and many features it does get boring fast
everything just seems so repetative
a zoo may not of been the best choice for the next tycoon game
wait untill its less money unless you love zooszoo tycoon is a ok game
you control a zoo and try to make it a good zoo
it is a lot like rollercoaster tycoon
the bad thing about it is it gets boring it takes a long time to build up a zoo with a lot of animals
the grafics are ok but not the best
it is worth  dollars not  if you like rollercoaster tycoon you should maybe get itim what you would call a sim junkiezoo tycoon has cute graphics and the sound isnt bad but the lack of objects make it dullthey have a research department but after two years your done getting new stuffif your looking to take a short vacation from your sims this game will help a littlethis is one of those games that hooks you for the first few days
you know the kind
you spend countless hours playing it and working hard to master it only to find that you stop playing it a week later and never play it again
this is one of those
it was very entertaining going through the various scenarios
you have to go through all of the easier ones to unlock the harder ones
the easy ones were very easy but then i got to one that almost seemed impossible
i ended up getting cheat codes hoping to get past that scenario and move on but once you get the cheat codes it ruins the gamebottom line if you value your dollars i wouldnt buy this game
you may like it in the beginning and play it alot the first week but in the end youll put this game on a shelf and never touch it againgameplay heres how it goes down
you choose the animals you want to create
you choose the walls and make the pen
you put the animals in the pen
your read the zookeepers instructions on what the animals wants such as water trees and rocks then you do it
it may sound boring especially how i put it and it is but you can still suck some fun out of it
the annimals can be rather boring but the same goes for real life
the main thing you really need to do is make the zoo look pretty
this is more of a landscaping sim than a zoo building simgraphics the graphics are rather simple but they arent terrible
nothing great heresound the animals make the same sounds over and over whenever you click em
it gets annoying fast
the best part of the sound is probably the opening song which isnt that greatreplay value after you finish making a zoo with every animal you probably wont touch this game again for a whilei am a huge fan of roller coaster tycoon
so of course i had to try this game
and i do love zoos and animals actually trained to be a vet at one time so figured it would be right up my alley
but it just never really caught my imagination the way other games did
dont get me wrong it was fun building a zoo and seeing all the animals in it
the game is very well implemented and eductional as well
but it almost seemed like work at times and it didnt seem to have quite the fun of rct and the sims to just watch
im sure plenty of people will like it
as for me im off to play other gameseh where to begin with this one mostly i dont like it because of it being related like a twisted metal game which i hate those kinda games
the controls are ackward and just sometimes out of the way the schme is basicly destory everything wow
for you diehard twisted metal fans this is your game if not rent before purchase stars instead of  because the graphics are unlike anything i have seen before and i believe may lead to other games in that style which will be a good thing
cell damage is just way too monotous for me and i have play some sameold same old level after level games before
this is not quite even up to those
the weapons are rediculous to the point where you dont battle you tap and kill
i like battles and this didnt have it
i thought this would be more like interstate  or interstate  on pc and was let down so badly
i cannot recommend this game to anyone
rent it or find a playable demo disc sure but dont spend amt on thiscel damage is one of the funnest games to grace xbox
the steup is fun and the characters are uniquebut the game itself isnt one id play too long
im not a fan of this game that muchrecommended if you have a group of friends and need light hearted funif you get my headline youll get this game
if not you havent a chancethis is a simpsons game first a foremost
like most other simpsons games and star wars games for the fact only hardcore fans of the subject will love it
some people call the voices annoying but i cant hear enough of homer yelling usait gets  stars for the following reasons the first star goes the fact its something simpsons and everything that has something to do with the simpsons deserves one star my second star goes to homer driving the car that homer made its hidden at first but its the coolest thing since birth of the cool by miles davis my third star goes to the shear length at which it tkaes to unlock everything
whereas in some games you have to actually get good to unlock everything this game is designed to allow anyone including ralph eventually unlock everythingthis game is pretty good but it has its ups and downs
first of all the characters are very funny it has many features from crazy taxi you can unlock many new characters and levelsthe surrounding enviorment such as cars mailboxes trees poles and some doors to certain buildings can be trashed but it starts to become pointless
you just keep playing a level until you get enough money for a hidden character or level
the sayings stay funny for a while but soon become the same old junk
still this game should be bought due to its still worthy of the xboxthere are game flaws in this game
every so often in certain places it seems like you will hit an invisible wall where your car will stop on a dime
the screen will also flicker really annoying behind a wall making it impossible to see your carthe game must load everytime you start a road rage board mission or sunday drive
the missions are only  or so seconds long no extra time and the loading time is nearly the same length
if you restart a level it has to load again
it should quotrememberquot the board and be able to start over again in seconds like the xbox does in games like halo and ampedthe game itself is short and can be beaten pretty easily
you could probably rent it from blockbuster end up spending    dollars on late fees and be done with itif you have a friend with an xbox split the cost with him and buy this game
besides for the above problems it is a really fun game
i love the simpsons
this game is a must play and whether or not its a must buy is up to youhockey is a fun video game
the best part of hockey games is the fighting
i love fighting in hockey games i know that it isnt quite realistic to expect so many but thats what i want not being a true hockey player
but this game has the weakest fighting in any hockey game
the fights last for less than  seconds and it looks like they only use  frames of animation for fighting
ea truly treated it as a secondary aspect of the game and it turns me offhowever the realism is good
lots of stats good replays especially the breakaway when youre  on  with the goalie it goes into letterbox mode and all sound dims and the only thing you hear is a heartbeati rented this game because of how much i liked previous nhl games made by ea sports
so i picked this up and poped it in
the first thing i noticed was that there were a lot of little movies
players getting pumped up before a game celebrations on and off the ice
i thought that was pretty cool and a new added feature
but other than little things like that this game doesnt offer much of anything new
heres what i thought about this game and why i only thought it a renter not a buyer
the graphics the players are sharper the ice is thicker
the fans actually move in d
but overall not to great
the puck is way too big and the overall graphics just arent to improved
this game had great graphics but so did previous versions
the options horrible
no create a team no new features
and the biggest thing no franchise mode
that was about as dumb as having no franchise mode in nba live   i am seriously disapointed by the options in this game
nothing new whatsoever
the overall depth after your first season this game will probably get pretty boring
more new features and better graphics is what this game needs
i hope ea changed things in  edition
oops too bad
they did the same thing
until they finally add some sort of franchise and stuff like that eas nhl series will continue for me to be a renter not a buyer
rent before u buy then make your decision
just a warninghope this helped and i expect a lot more from the great company that is ea
thxthis has great graphics and playing it is loads of fun its just that there are some things that should have been in it
i mean it is a good game if you were comparing it to gamecube or ps basketball
but this is xbox and nba k has done a much better jobi have nothing against ea they make great games but what has happened to their nba live franchise
it seems that the quality goes down every year
the graphics are the best but thats all that i can commend it forso whats wrong with it
gameplay is a new low you can score pretty much by doing a pump fake and driving to the basket
they also implemented the new nba quotzonequot defense but they didnt really gave the you the chance use it what they did is they just took away the illegal defense callthere is also something wrong with dunks and layups they all look the same
when kobe or micheal dunks there is no finesse all they do is a power slam
same goes with layups even the clumsiest player can do a up and under layup with the lanes cloggedit seems that ea did a bad job on this one
to new gamers they might not notice the flaws but to veteran gamers it will be a dissapointed
rent this one firsteas nba live  is mediocre at best when compared to other nba offerings on the xbox such as microsofts nba inside drive  or segas fantastic nba k
ea needs to do some serious work on their basketball game if they want to compete with the new pros
not recommended  go for segas nba k insteaddont get me wrong
i love rpgs and building up custom characters but i dont like them in the d world of the gba
on the pc i have played awesome games like dungeon siege where the rpg element is at its best but i found golden sun to be really slowit took ages to get going and there is an unbelievable amount of dialogue in it
but there is no way to skip past it
you will literally be sitting there hitting the button for  minutes reading bland word bubbles
some have given this game a great review but im afraid this rpg just didnt do anything for me and i wont be checking out the sequelgraphics asound agameplay clasting appeal cvery good gamei just wish there was a way that gb and gba gamescould be worked into double screen games somehowanyway all of the golden sun stuff you loveis here the sounds the psynergythis is where it all startedi really love the game for ds called dark dawnits got all that great golden sun stuff butit uses both screensgolden sun is arguably one of the prettiest and best gba games ever seen
i can definately agree with that
however i could not stand the dumb story line
you start out living with your depressed mom and act like children pretty much all the way through
supposidly these guys are teens but nintendo clearly aimed it toward an everyone audience
i would have liked to see some profanity and characters that actualy acted like teens rather then moms
oh well
on the bright side the visuals are great and the battle system is original
it just depends on how old you are and what your likes and dislikes are i supposei dont think a lot of people realise this as it is not made clear by the seller but the old original doom games will not run on any modern pc
sure you can buy this but it will not work
to my understanding the only ways to still play the original classic doom are as follows if you have an old windows me etc machine youre all set
not many people do build an oldspec machine
apparently quite easy to do but who can be bothered if you have the original playstation  from  you can play the original doom if you want to play on a modern pc most of us you need to use a doom source port
there are many all free that have been written by doom fans down the years and they are all flawed to some extent or another
in some there are rendering bugs in others there are sound issues etc
to my knowledge the best is chocolate doom but you should researchdownload several and try them outi dont understand why id software have not at least kept the original doom source code updated so it can still be played on modern hardware
but they havent
they were probably too focused on doom not doom as we know and love itsoldier of fortune is a good fps with a story driven single player gameplay and a great multiplayer gameplay
you play john mullis a soldier and he sounds like micheal douglas
the story a gang war has taken place in the new york subway and the cops have been beaten though it is not a military operation the captain let you john and your patner handle the situation the leader gets away and you find out that something much bigger than the gang war has happened
four nuclear weapons are stolen and you have to get them back and stop the terrorist organisation
the game includes lots of very intresting missions in new york iraq sudan japan ect
the level design is very good it is fun and challenging to get through the level
the selection of weapons though not outstanding are very good and their effects are very realistic
the unique ghoul feature feature is superb you can blast the bad guys into a dozen pieces
the game is very violant and there are loads of nasty sences you could see a guys head blown to bits arms comming off ect in the sudan cow factory you need to travel through a whole place full of blood
i played sof on the default opengl video mode and it runs very smooth
it is built on a modified quake engine with detailed textures bit color ect
the graphics charecter animation and sound recording are very good
sofs main menu is very good you can reduce the violance in the game
you can tweak the enemy toughness enemy respawning inventory carrying capacity save game limits
with those options you can make sof very hard or very easy
soldier of fortune is a very good game for fps fans but it is not as good as halflife or no one lives foreveri enjoyed this game very much the plot and storyline were excellent but the game was rendered on the outdated quake ii engine so the graphics while better than quake ii itself were mediocre at best
the game focused too much on blowing people apart and not on the quality of the graphics to enhance the storyline
also the gunfire and resulting injuries or kills were very unrealistic as to what they would be in real life
i dont think there is anyway a pistol would blow someones arm or leg completely off their body
while this is no high quality game by any means it is a very fun one and has a very engrossing storyline and plot
lets hope they use a much better engine in the upcoming sequel and that the storyline is as well developed in the second game as it was in this onethis game is good because its powered by the quake arena engine
thats all thats good about itits so violent theres the most mature rating content ive seen in a fps
its so gorey so bloody so voilent so much suggestive themes i only played it for  minutes then uninstalled it off my computer tried it  more times felt the same waythis game is too voilent and should only be played by people  or older heck im only  and i coudnt even stand itnaughty i was to play it ehfor all the  years olders and higher buy this game if you are voilent and gory and want a voilent shooter infact then if you like this you are voilent
 years old and up buy this if you wantany thing below i dont reccomend it unless you have your parents permissionthis arrived in a prompt and efficient manner and i have no problem with the seller but the game itself is just poorly executed
not as much fun as you would expect from a virtualization of a card game
it was difficult to customize your decks and to understand the overall function of the gamewhen this game first came out i thought id be getting the perfect translation of the original card game
now while it has some of the rules down its far from perfect
element limitations were included
meaning certain monsters of certain elements can easily fall prey to another weaker monster just because hes of a different element
theres also deck limitations
i know we try to limit our decks to  cards but at least give me the option to go above that if i want
you can also only lay one trap card at a time
eds allows you to lay as many trapmagic cards as you want
youre deck isnt restricted to more powerful cards in eds either unlike dds where you have to earn that right
at least eternal duelist of soul for the gba has a  card limitation and is a much better and truer translation of the card game
if youre choosing between the two go for eds for the gba advance
if you only have a gbc sell it on ebay or something and get a gba so you can buy eternal duelist of soul
youll be thankful you didi dont consider myself to be a graphics junkie i do like onnovative graphical styles but i dont need fancy graphics to enjoy a game
legend of mana didnt have the most detailed sprites but i still really enjoyed that game
final fantasy tactics is my all time favorite game and it didnt have the graphical flair of ffviiwhich was the best looking game of that time
so i wasnt expecting anything special from dqviidont care if the case says warrior its always been quest to me
this game will not wow you with its poorly animated sprites on the world map however the monster sprites are decent
the gameplay is where this game shines its over  hours of questing and it never gets stale ive always enjoyed dragon quests approach to the rpg which is a collection of mini stories that eventually converge into the endgame with some evil threatening the whole world hence i gave the game  stars for fun but i cannot give it  stars overall because the graphics show a bit of laziness on enixs part its inexcusable given that this game came out around the same time as star ocean  and that game looked great
so its  stars and if you really wanna play this game i suggest looking on ebay its much cheaper then  on ebay i got my copy for dw has an interesting storyline and characters
unfortunately it is hampered by bad graphics including quite frequent graphical problems such as pixellation clipping and cutouts a translation rife with typos spelling errors and bad word choices and a clumsy battle system that makes the required leveling an often painful chorethe first disc is generally more entertaining as the player seeks to restore the world and figure out what happened which is never explained only hinted at
each new island is its own story some of which are excellent and some of which as with the lefans merely irritating
character interactions are generally welldone and sometimes laughoutloud funny
the second disc is primarily a series of dungeoncrawls mostly revisting places youve already been though there are two new onesthe dungeons are one of the weakest elements of the game  they are not generally interesting either visually or in terms of planning and puzzles and having to go through them multiple times as is common is quite boring
the constant use of paletteswapped monsters is also an irritationthe graphics are  roughly snes level
your hero looks like a lawn gnome though in part that seems to be due to toriyamas design
in addition pixellation cutouts and clipping are common and the cameras rotation inexplicably is sharply limited in the dungeons making it very easy to miss chests and staircasesthe job system has potential but this is the primary reason you spend hours levelling  you can only rise in job level and gain new skills after set numbers of battles regardless of the number of monsters you fight
it would have been much more interesting had they used monsters defeated rather than battles fought allowing for more flexibility
also several of the skills are largely useless  they work so rarely that the effort involved in attaining them is wastedall in all this is a game to pick up when it hits the discount rack and you have a lot of spare timeaddictive game play and spiffy graphics in an unfamiliar gaming environment give this game a pretty good replay value
lazy programming  iethe usual repetitive voice oversglitchy game play and slightly awkward menu interface when your not on a wave leaves it just short of a must have launch title
the split screen mode is not playable due to poor programming  it should be your fourth or fifth xbox title
transworld surf  should prove to be a worthwhile adventureshould be another hit with skateboarder types
average at best graphics and some decent tunes on it but not much else going for it
no plot or story linea pretty decent racing game with excellent looking water
great for a kid whos mom yells at him about those cool games that have the t and m ratingsthis is one of the best action games i have ever played
the visual effects were great slow motion actionmatrix type video games make it more like a real movie and you are the director
i would enjoy this game a lot more if there were different control options using both sticks is kinda difficult when you have to shoot people at the same time
i have not yet gotten used to the controls maybe if i do then it will be more fun
if you like action this is the game for ui liked the game alot
the graphics could have been better but they were on the right track
i love the lines like something out of a s gritty detective novelthe action is fast and hard bullet time is very cool
really i found little to dislike
the load times are a little long
by the real reason for  stars instead of  was a couple of truely stupid levels
both were dream style ones where max follows a line of blood in space
it is just plain dumb and very annoying
it serves no pointother than that i loved the game
well worth the time playingi doubt it if i would play it again at least once a month like my other games that i have
yes i agree with the editorial review on this game but i would like to add that there are two levels that you have to playendure as a involuntary druggedinduced max payne running and jumping through this bloodtrail maze
what really sucks is that if you step off the path you have to keep repeating the level until you make it through
this is so stupid
i dont know why the programmers didnt just make these into cutscenespeople who were expecting another gta  were way off
i was not but i was expecting a game that was betterafter a while the game play  with the quotbullet timequot gets really cheesy and repetativethe game is only average and is worth a rent at blockbuster to at least try itwhile the ps version is not really bad it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the xbox and pc
the pss sound and music to max payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on
the gameplay is still good even though some areas are cut off do to the pss limitations but that doesnt hurt the gameplay too muchgraphics are also very scratchy and so are the characters even though all the versions of max payne dont have great character models the ps version looks even more out of orderbut the controls are better for ps the smaller controller the ps has really helps compared the xbox controller and a keyboardstill highly enjoyable the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence
if you cant get your hands on any other version then the ps is perfect for youlets say i was expecting much more from a game like this
i must agree that the graphics and sound are good same applies to the bullet time thing but it doesnt give you a lot of continuous game play levels take a while to load and during the game you constantly have to stop and wait for the storyline to load read and listen not to mention the animation clips which you cant skip at all so these are my conclusionshighs realistic gameplay realistic graphics nice weapon arsenal very twisted storyline be aware of the m in the boxlows levels take a while to load you can only save at the beginning of a level gameplay is basically the same thorough all levels only different scenarios cant customize controller buttons you will finish the game pretty quickverdictyoull have fun while you play but there is no replay value i highly recommend previewing the game before buying it
fun factor i was very excited when buying this game but once i put it in andsarted playing i allmost in ah instint started to burst out intears
seriously its that disapointing  the graphics are terrible the sound is fitting the story lineis gripping the cinema is gawd awful but i still play it only out ofspite do i play this horrible just terrible gameone of the most critically acclaimed and popular computer games in recent years has been the max payne series created by a finland company called remedy
the first two games were best sellers in  and  and a third is planned for 
essentially a rdperson shooter like tomb raider this game has a genuinely compelling atmosphere with its dark and noirish story about hardboiled cops and gangsters and a wellconceived graphicnovel style cutscenes
the first max payne takes place entirely in one snowy night in new york city and it has you visit diverse places and achieve various objectives
but mostly as in many action games you just shoot and kill whoever that is in your wayyou play the title character an nypd detective whose wife is murdered at home in the beginning of the game
you then go undercover and seek out various new york gangs and informants and discover an evil conspiracy involving a deadly drug
the thick plot and stylish dialogs may be a turnoff to some but they are obviously a homage to film noirs
in fact the game makes references to humphrey bogart a few times
a nice touch is having cutscenes shown in a graphicnovel style  a panel of painterly still drawings with dialog balloons and voice overs
the cutscenes can be skipped and are always replayable by pressing f during gameplayin a game that has no multiplayer feature the level design and ai
for singleplayer become vital
the  levels in max payne show great variety and challenge
you go to many different places subway platforms warehouses shipyards seedy apartments highrise buildings laboratories luxurious mansions and even inside the dreams of the protagonist
each level is not too large and took me about half hour to finish
you have considerable interaction with the environment such as the ability to break windows break open boxes leave bullet holes on objects open cabinet doors switch on appliances flush toilets etc
 many of these are nothing new since halflife in  or even earlier games
sometimes you are required to interact with something and a big exclamation point appears above your head to remind youthe ai
artificial intelligence for computercontrolled characters however is not the greatest
your enemies always seem to misfire when you dive left or right to floor
they also dont move around or try to dodge your bullets often enough making them easier to kill
sometimes they come out of their hiding places for no reason and run straight towards you
very often ai
behavior seems scripted with enemies running the same routes and stopping at the same way points every time you replay the scene
i have never been a fan of games with a lot of scripted ai
such as medal of honor allied assaultin a rdperson action game where you are able to see your onscreen character movement controls become important
they have to work nicely with the gameplay and the results have to look good
sadly movement controls are rather limited in max payne
even in an old game like tomb raider you can do all kinds of neat moves such as shimmying at the edge of a cliff somersaulting swimming climbing doing a handstand etc
you have none of that in max payne which only allows you to strafe left or right and dive left right or backwardthe games designers obviously wanted to enhance the movement controls with perhaps the games greatest selling point a feature called bullettime which lets you move in super slowmotion for a limited time
this feature is supposedly helpful when you are greatly outnumbered in a gunfight and it makes the game look good a la the movie the matrix
surprisingly i rarely needed to use bullettime during the game
i was able to effectively dodge every bullet by simply diving left or right after every shot even when there were  of  guys shooting at me
also during every dive time seemed to slow down a little bit essentially giving me a mini bullettime segmentmore suspension of disbelief
typical in action games you just have to willingly accept the fact that you are able to carry  heavy weapons and still be able to move around acrobatically
thankfully newer games such as far cry put a limit on the number of weapons you carry
there are plenty of weapons at your disposal
many of them are standard items such as pistols shotguns automatics grenades grenade launcher sniper rifle
strangely i rarely had to use the sniper rifle
it was a design oversight not to create more situations for longdistance sniping which would have made the game more fun as in deus exthe game i bought was the unpatched original pc version
be sure to install the latest patch from d realms web site    or the game may not run on a windows xp system
on my pentium  ghz with an aging geforce ti graphics card i was able to run the game at xx with maximum details pretty smoothly at  frames a second
the game comes with and is made for directx   but i had no problem running it under the latest directx b
you may download a playable demo of the game from the above link and test your pc with it
also be sure your pc is compatible with the system requirements listed at  the controls of this game  the graphics remind me very much of syphon filter only looser and sloppier
aiming is difficult unless you engage autolock and then its too easy
im about  the way through the game and none too impressedthe graphics are good but cmon this is ps
i guess its a port of an older pc game but i cant help thinking theyre just updated doomsyphon filter graphics
plus there are no cutscenes
thats right
none whatsoever
instead theyve been replaced them all with cheesy graphic novel looking static imagesthe missions are boring and confusing
i commented to my girlfriend while playing that i constantly felt lost but max seemed to know where he was going
the only way i could tell i wasnt backtracking was that people would come out to shoot me
in fact with autolock mode on you could pretty much run straight foward while shooting and autolock would point you the right direction  thats where the enemies are coming from thats where i have to gothe gameplay is frustrating
you use the analogue sticks which being an oldtime gamer ive never quite gotten used to
im used to extreme slams on the stick being the same as subtle taps
other than that it really feels like the old syphon filter enginethe left stick makes max move and the right one changes his directionaims
you shoot with r select weapons in real time the game doesnt pause wile you do this with the dpad
aiming with the sticks feels sloppy and maybe thats appropriate because this is a sloppy game err gritty gamethe plot is interesting but doesnt really pick up until  of the way through the game
and the graphicnovel style cutscenes are just plain boring
plus the game has to load for like  seconds ever time it wants to flash one of them on the screen
whybullet time
now this feature is cool
hit a button  everything including max slows down
you can dodge in bullet time
it allows your reactions to be faster than those around you
this is an advantage because aiming if you can call it that doesnt slow down
it only lasts a few frustrating seconds and it has to be replenished by killing more people
onimusha did this betteras a shootemup this game probably rates a  or a  but im not a big shootemup fan
id much rather wait for the new syphon filter
worth a rental or maybe buy it used
could also use a tournament mode
whats the point of a shootemup without being able to kill your friendsthis game takes place in new york where you play as max payne
the game starts when max comes home to discover that his wife and child have been murdered
from there you basically go from place to place shooting up bad guys in a thirdperson view
the controls are a little confusing at first but once you get the hang of it theyre not so bad
a cool feature is something called bullettime where you can slow down time like in the matrix and shoot up the place
the graphics are pretty impresive with loads of detail on little things such as individual bullets
the game is fun if you need an action fix but it kind of gets old after a while
its still a good game but if you want a good action game then get gtai like this game because  i love the matrix bullet time and  you get to murder and slaughter
now with that being established id say the rest of the game is pretty bland
the control for one is confusing especially on the screaming baby head levelsthe story isnt anything new its the same one from the punisher but the character max makes it a little more interesting
the weapons really add a nice touch because the jackhammer is one vicious piece of machineryrent this one first its not so hard to beat so itll save you all a few dollars stolen from your grannys purse after the big win at bingo
actually dont rent it ask someone you know if you can borrow it like i did
with the money it costs to rent you could go to the movies and watch blade ii or get a double whopper value meal
your choicei bought this game after playing the pc version at a friends house
the slowmo quotbullettimequot gameplay looked and played really well but it felt like it was simply there to keep players from getting bored of the repetitive gameplayevery level is essentially the same and the game plays the same way throughout
the story kept me interested but after one run through this game simply wasnt worth the effort a second time even with the number of playable difficulties it offers
rent it insteadmax payne was one of the first games i played when i bought my playstation  but i hadnt gotten around to purchasing it till recently
though while still very good with other games pushing the pss graphical power the max payne is looking a little long in the toothmax payne is a new york detective whos wife and young child are brutally murdured
three years later the story is about to come full circle as payne finally discovers who has shattered his entire worldmax paynes biggest strength is its story
the storyline is very compelling and will make you keep wanting to play the game
full of mobsters wise guys lowlifes and all around scum bags the developers are remedy and rockstar games have painted a very dark and gritty picture of the new york underworld
if max payne were made into a movie im thinking it could very easily make the transition from game to screen
the cutscenes however leave something to be desired
they consist of comic book style frames with voice overs
but the story does manage to make its way through themalthough while still good max paynes graphics are somewhat subpar when you compare them to other games that have been released in the past few years
the character models are somewhat primitive by todays standards
where as a game like the getaway has more photorealistic renderings max paynes are almost stick figure like
what max paynegraphics do very well however is portray new york city extremely accurately
everything from the graffitti on the walls to the subway stations has a very new york feel to it
the framerate however suffers from considerable slowdown
often time it slows to a crawl
the sounds are very good
guns have loud bangs and you hear bullet casings hit the ground
the games music is very ominous sounding giving you a chilling foreshadowing of things to comemax paynes controlls are a little difficult to grasp at first
the targeting reticule consists of a white dot in the center of the screen and you aim by moving the right analog stick
its a bit tricky and takes some getting used to
one of the games standout features is bullet time
max can slow down time around him and execute matrixlike moves
max payne restores his health by rummaging in medicine cabinets and closets for painkillers
a bit of a unique change from the standard medpacks and meal rationsoverall max payne is a good game
the only thing really wrong is it looks a little dated
otherwise its well worth the new greatest hits price even if its just to pad your game library and definitley worth the discounted  pc game priceyou remember those great blockbuster movies where the stunts were amazing and the script and acting were close to unbearable
max payne is a game in the same vein as those movies
still much like those movies you easily forget the terrible script while your diving in slow motion and shooting a villain with two pistols
other than the atrocious script mob to cult to government
and soso voice acting max payne is quite enjoyable
a tad on the easy side though heaven knows those dream sequence levels were frustratingmeans that this game is over quite quickly but after that final bullet is shot one does feel quite satisfied with this game
if youre looking for a game where you like blasting and dont mind long loading times and unbelieveable plot max payne is the game for youmax payne was one of my favorite games last year but now the thrills of the game just didnt last that longprosnice aresonel of weaponsbullet time really helpsa port of a superb pc gamego through a good story full or twistsfun while it lastsconslong loading timesgraphics not as good as xbox or pcs versionafter beating it theres little thrills to play it againno extrascant skip boring moviesno shadows at allthe game gets repetitive as wellkillin level after level sure gets boringif you brought it sooner or later youre gonna wish u rented itthe voice acting is ugly and horablethe game was addictive at first and i ended up trading state of emergency one of the wackest games ever  dis
well this is better than it but the loading times are what make me mad the most cuz when i die i have to sit throught the loading times again and again
like i said rent or borrow b u buymax payne for the playstation  is not worth the money
the graphics and sound are amazing but the gameplay is frustratingly choppy and not very responsive
when three or four gangsters are shooting at you the frame rate becomes extremely slow and it becomes impossible to aim your weapon correctly
i rented it found the cheat codes and beat it in eleven hours total
the game is impossible to play on the ps because the ps cannot handle the smooth frame rate that is required
if you have a decent pc i suggest you buy it for that particular platform
it was a fun  hours though
for a good ps firstperson shooter try red faction or half lifeive learned firsthand that youve ever bought a gba port of a fighting game youd get what you paid for
with that in mind i discovered and snatched a copy of tekken advance
of course it pales in comparsion to console versions because of the limited hardware but you get the gist of what theyre like if you dont own them alreadywhile the gbas button layout compromises the gameplay you get a ton of moves that are easy to pull off against a fairly balanced ai
plus you can rotate around the psuedod platforms
a minor nuisance is that if you say land a suplex you get this ugly onesecond cutscene
a major nuisance is that ta needs an extra cartridge for vs battles missing the gbas multiplayer capabilities
man cannot live on  characters and  game modes alonethis game is rated t for teen violencethis game is a never ending game with no real ending to it
some monsters look really cool and others dont
my favorite is the dragons
i got one
you can play this game forever and you really wont quotbeat itquot
its a great game for those who like to train animals or monsters
the best thing is that you can put cds and dvds in and you get a monster out of it
you can also compete with your monster in tournaments
when your monster dies you can just get another one
overall its pretty good and those who liked the game boy pokemon games will probably like thisim a late bloomer to the doom phenomonon
my previous experience with the game consisted of playing the shareware version of the first game when i was eight years old and playing bits and pieces of doom  at a friends house
other then that i have not played the doom games
but when i saw the box containing all three games for only fifteen dollars i decided what the heck
and bought the games to try them out
my first impressions are recorded belowultimate doomthe origianal game
i started up a new game and started blasting through the martian base
the first thing i noticed was the remade music
when i first played shareware doom the music creeped me out
here its too rocknroll for my tastes getting rid of the suspenseful tunes
aside from that i was having fun killing everything in sight
the first high moment was when i confronted the cyberdemon in the tower of babel quite cool
by episode three i was starting to notice that the levels were all acting the same
kill beasts find key cards escape level repeat
i was dissapointed by the severe lack of any kind of story
i decided that the first game was ok but it desperatly needed any kind of story
the fourth episode thy flesh consumed was hard and a bit disapointingdoom after finishing doom  i immediatly jumped into doom  and started playing
but by level  i was very dissapointed
find key cards blast enemies escape level repeat
it was exactly the same as the first game
i was quite dissapointed until i watched a screen with text telling me about what was going on
delighted that id was trying to tell a story i continued blasting through the game eager to see how the story would turn out
doom  does have more memorable moments then the first game
my favorites included fighting ten hell knights and a cyberdemon all at once and fighting the cyber demon and the final boss of the first game at the same time
there were a few annoying levels near the end but the final confrentation with the games final boss was amazing
i also liked that after you won the game you got to kill all the charachters endlessly for your amusent
my final analysis was that while it was essentially more of the same it did offer some nice changes in scenery and the attempts at an actual story were well appreciated
but some of the music was awful
some of the tracks sounded like tropical music which does not fit into the gamefinal doomoh man i gave up after dying the tenth time on the first level while playing on the easiest difficulty level
this chapter was way too hard and i have yet to complete it
i did cheat my way to the last level which was pretty cool fancy fighting off seven cyber demons at once
doom  preview contenti only browsed this stuff for about ten minutes before quitting
a bunch of screenshots youve seen before three wallpapers that are ok and a non frightening trailer
i liked the creepy sound effect that played when you switched menusfinal analysisthese games are fun but the simplistic gameplay gets annoying after a while
there were lots of moments where i had no clue where to go next
i think a go here feature would be nice to have in case you get hopelessly lost it would be optional of course
the graphics were ok but i just focus on gameplay which i think is more important then graphics
i dont think there was a single moment where i got scared
a bit creeped out but never scared outright
these pixelated beasts are not very threatening in todays world of frighteningly realistic beasts in movies and games
my first impressions of doom is that its getting a bit old but still has its charms and of course lots of demon killing action
and face it getting three full length games for under twenty dollars is a very hard bargin to beat
i recommend this set for anyone who loves the origianl games and want to have them all in one setdaoc has lasted about  weeks for me which is a very long time for a game to stay interesting
but i doubt ill be playing it much longer
the main problem is more with the type of gameonline onlythan with the quality etc
i cant imagine what mythic could do really to make the game worthwhile for me
ingroup voice communications is one improvement i recommend but i doubt that would be enough to make the game really worth itfor me playing daoc is too much like work
i play games to escape reality and dealing with other people is the hardest most frustrating part of reality that there is
while ive met lots of nice people in daoc ive also met plenty of notsonice ones
and it only takes one quotbadquot person in a group of  to destroy in  minutes what it took a hour to organizelately ive found myself being more and more bored playing the game
the pace of advancement is very slow moving from place to place is slow forming groups is slow
and now ive discovered that even being in combat is boring
now that im no longer oggling over the fireballs and other effects ive discovered that the most exciting part of the game involves mostly sitting and watching the computer do things for meas i said i doubt theres anything mythic could do to fix this
i think its the nature of the game
and for me the singleplayer computer game is still king  something i can come home to depend on and know that if the powers on at my house i can play
i dont have to worry about my isp being down or the servers being down
and i dont have to sit around for a hour waiting for a party to formwhen i only have  hours a night to playwhile this is a great mmorpg thats really been pretty good at about level  im already a bit sick of leveling over and over and over and over because at my level theres not much else to do
i mean yeah this other stuff sounds coolbut at level 
maybe its just me but i dont have the time or patience to do a repetitious thing over and over for weeks wasting time just so i can do something coolin a monthplus i really dont think mythic was too imaginative about spells
whatever happened to flying
they could do something cool with that i find myself walking so much more than i need to
plus fighters should really have some sort of advantage i dunnothey dont really match up with enchanters and enchanters dont match up with fighters at the momentone thing that daoc really did do well is the interface
your stats are always handy the buttons are clear and its easy to understand what info theyll get you just by lookingone thing thats really annoyed me is that your gravestone is impossible to find in the dark
there should really be some kind of indicator that points in its direction until you pick up your expoften i have to ditch about ths worth of a level just because i cant find my own headstone
either that or you should have like a floating marker above it or somethinganything
while daoc is good for someone who is fine with simplicity im finding myself wanting more alreadyif youre not familiar with beta testing its a process where gamers test and play the game before it is released
i beta tested the game up until a few days before its release and while i thought dark age of camelot was a decent game i wasnt overwhelmed by itfirst off dark age of camelot is an online multiplayer game and it seems to be more stable than some of the recent disasters that have been released
one disclaimer to this is that i experienced bad lag pauses or slow gameplay due to slow internet signals in the major cities in the last days of beta testing because more beta testers were allowed in the game which makes me think that when the game is released it will only get worse
if youre going to purchase dark age of camelot i would check recent news and pc game bulletin boards to see if the companys servers are holding up and the game isnt experiencing too many bugsthe graphics are definitely impressive and i would compare it to the game asherons call with better resolution
as a matter of fact the game plays similar to asherons call with a set of rules resembling baldurs gate or any dungeons amp dragons pc gameswhile the game looks to be stable and takes advantage of better graphics than most online games it just doesnt seem to offer much
after picking a server to play on you also pick a realm to play in which affects what type of races you can play
some of the races are large creatures such as trolls or small creatures like kobolds and are a nice change from the usual formats for swords amp sorcery online games
after the races though the choice of professions for your character are very limited
essentially you can only be a warrior mage thief or cleric with subtle distinctions occuring as you reach higher levels and are able to swear to different gods in the game who give you special abilitiesi didnt enjoy the setup for gameplay
many easy actions such as simply quitting the game require you to type in a command
i felt the chat options were more technical than they needed to be and the chat box wasnt large enough to begin with
your actions are also recorded in the chat box and the game seems to be more oriented for the keyboard than the mouseits fun to see some of the warrior classes allowed minor spells at higher levels but the spells that are provided dont match some of the online competitorss games
the quests and adventures provided are difficult to find and most cities are very small
its almost like the game was perfected to look quotprettyquot while forgetting vast quests subplots npc activity and other elements that make many online games enjoyable for months
also if you are a gamer than enjoys playing solo this might not be the game for you because its oriented for group play with some clever options put in such as screens that allow you to find any players in your region that are seeking companionsi would give the game a try to see if you enjoy it but in my opinion it doesnt match up to ultima online asherons call or everquestthis game can be difficult to get into
i used to play everquest and i will make comparisons in this reviewdaoc players appear more serious about the game than everquest players
everyone seems pretty much focused on the gameplaying aspect and for this reason it can be hard to meet people
it felt like it took people a long time to trust new players and because i play such online games for social interaction i was disappointed by this
occasionally it was possible to play with really great people but often such groups would split at the end of the night and you wouldnt see them againdaoc certainly has beautiful graphics and its theme is wellgrounded in western mythology
as a student of all three areas that daoc is based on i enjoyed that aspect of reality
the names of the npcs the placenames the classes  it was all very consistentthe manual is quite limited and much of the gameplay is learned from other players
it can be quite hard to ask technical questions however if you choose a roleplaying server
stick with a regular server for your first character or you may be scolded for talking out of character
roleplaying servers however are great for those of us who do not enjoy ltspeak and want to get completely into our charactersin the end i quit playing because it became too frustrating to play with my limited time
one death could set me back three hours and i do not have that much time to invest in a gameevaluating daoc i would say that it is a very deep game with a devoted playerbase without many of the problems eq suffered from
however it requires a strong time investment and a willingness to take on the steep learning curvewhats hotlots of things to explorewhats notterribly complicatedgraphics really need some workfighting feels so lamewhats strangewhats the use of these pointless plot partsthe question game at the beginningthe overallthis not the game for rpg players
kingdom hearts can possibly beat thisat least it has good graphics
thats right
they are amazing
wonderful
detailed
to bad the story and gameplay are badthe game is great for people who like this type of rpg which is very complex
you need to have about  hours a day just to sit down and play thisthere are people who dont want goals given in a game and people who do
i thought i didnt want any goals in games because it was so appealing to just do whatever you want
but i just cant seem to really feel like traveling for no reason however in my opinion it got boring quicklycons not wanting to be someone who got out of prison hard to hit something in battle not sure what to do in the beginning where i should go characters are unattractive and move strangely the wood elves look like aliens loading time in some areas the amount of time needed to play the gamepros the water is great looking as well as the rest of the graphics there are millions and millions of items the controls are fairly easy to learn very similar to halosinteresting storyline character development the class systemmany people should read more about this game before they get it this isnt like a final fantasy rpg this is a very sophisticated and indepth rpg
in my opinion many people can simply get used to playing rpgs such as these however it will burn up a large amount of time
since all of the npcs non player characters have a lot to say it could take nearly an hour to talk to everyone around town although in my case i didnt bother talking to most of the people
traveling towntotown only takes about  min
if you dont run into complications which is a great improvement in comparison to some other rpgs in which it may take an hour to travel somewherethere is also an excellent class system where you can make your own class
this is one of the best features i encountered
the races however i didnt like especially the females of the race
basically none of the faces nor hair appealed to memany will find this game hard to understand at first especially those who have never played a rpg like this before
i spent a year and a half playing everquest when it eventually took over my life and i went cold turkey
even though everquest doesnt have a story it is very similar and i like the character graphics a lot better
clothes faces hair etc
however i do not recommend everquest in any waybasically what it all comes down to is being a patient person willing to spend a large amount of time playing
also one who knows what they want to do in the game and has an idea of something to doampeds gameplay is centered around a career system where you advance through the game by impressing the media beating pro riders and achieving high scores on each mountain
the game has a bit of an rpg element in that you get to upgrade your character as the game progresses
initially you are given a certain number of points to allocate to your characters skills speed jumping spinning etc
as you progress through the game you earn more points and get to choose how to use them to grow your characterthe career mode is very well done and the challenges are varied enough so that you must be good at all types of riding to progress
in some challenges youll have to impress a sponsor while in others you must follow a pro down the mountain and beat them at their own gamei found that i wanted more than just a career mode
it would be nice if you could just work on a single skill such as half pipe
i found older games such as the nintendos snowboarding game for the n much more enjoyable in this respectafter a few days of the learn new tricks  progress  learn new tricks cycle i was pretty bored of the gamethis game is not terible but then again ive seen better
the graphics are good but the tricks are basic carrer mode is bad tony hawk x is a much better game
if your going to buy a game go buy tony hawk x not amped
i strongly reccomend to rent this game before spending the moneythis game had a lot of potential and is still a must buy now that you can find it for less then 
but it had so much potentialand in so many ways it was wastedfirst off the graphics were magnificent
the use of graphics is fantastic
when u grind a rail u really think your seeing a replay of a competition
the snow dust and tracks behind you is incredible
this was the first game i saw for xbox and it really showed the graphics it could support
the mountains people you look so realistic youll think you really did get dropped off on a slopethe gameplay is okup to a point
in the game your ranked from beggining to end
the goal is to get ranked as the  boarder in the world
you start out at   i got up to  then i was just stuck
the goals they set inside the rank of  are incredibly hardup to a frustrating point
but hey if you think u can master it go for it
the creativity i must admit in the gameplay is fantastic
the use of sponsers and media is pretty cool
during the game u unlock sponsers
sponsers dragons wear for example give u new clothes jackets hats gear gogles snowboards and new parks to board in
this game would have been a blast and ground breaking if it wasnt so hard
this is one of  things that really killed the gamethe options thankfully one of the things this game lacked was not options
u can do single run just a run down any mountain youve opened with any pro u pick multiplayer which really  career and preferences where u baslicly decide what music u want to listen to your own soundtrack or the games
in career u can board down any mountain youve unlocked
pick your outfit from what clothes youve been given by a sponser board against a pro
this game may be quite hard but at least it had enough optionswhat ruined it  two things changed this game from a  star to a  star
the first was the difficulty
it just gets to hard
the second was absolutely huge
the multiplayer in this game was horrible
there is no split screen no racing
all u can do is board down a mountain one at a time trying to get the best score
but the stupid part is the second player has to match or out do the st players trick
i mean come on
this game could have been an awsome multiplayer if u could race down a hill with these types of graphics and or a split screen trick game
this game would have flown off the shelves if there would have been some sort of multiplayer creativitythats my review on this game and for its price you might want to counsider getting it
but dont expect anything ground breaking
this is an average game for an excellent systemi hope this helpedim almost  and have never snowboarded in my life  although i was almost killed by one once
so i got this game for my year old son to see if hed like it and we just spent a nice afternoon playing it
but my first reaction to all the quotstonerquot dialog was quotgreat now hes going to want to wear baggy pants around his knees and start every sentence with dudequotgraphically the snow effects and the physics are quite good
but inexplicably the fonts used in the menus suck so bad i could hardly read them on my hdtv
amped has by far the worst menu interface of any of the  xbox games we have and as a software designer who prefers skiing to boarding thatll cost amped a couple of starsim writing this review after reaching the last board so i think i canhighlight the action of this inhouse made microsoft game
thevisuals on the spells is the only thing keeping me from utterboredomfirst thing to get used to is how small the characters are
to get anidea of this look at your thumb okay thats the size of your maincharacter as you navigate through outdoor wilderness fightingcreatures half your sizea zoom feature only works when you are not in combat and thatswhen you realize that the humans in this world are nothing morethan escapes from some childs fisher price play set
roundedcomical cartoon bulbous little hobbit folk
saying things like quotmommyim hungryquot indicating to me that this game is meant for  and underthe story and the plot are themes that have been done overtime and time again
its lotr meets willow and a dash of gedof earth sea
the combat is a sort of diablorobotron run aroundthen dodge while throwing spells wildly
no real strategy just aninfinite army of color coded repetitive creatures bum rushing youwith the lack of adventure titles for the xbox right now this one mighthold you over till something better comes along new legends
sofar only halo and obi wan have been the real enjoyable ones thekind of games where a whole day of playing seems like only anhour
max payne and batman were a solid notch down mostlybecause they were straight ports from other systems and offerednothing more except jazzed up graphicsnot as good as amped but still fun
rent it and experience a different world of snowboarding
click in and then out of your bindings to do cool specials with massive amounts of air
better than regular ssxlike most people i eagerly waited for doom to come out for gbc
sadly it never came
years later i opened up nintendo power and saw an ad for doom on gba
finally i thought
so i bought it off of amazon
sadly the previous owner didnt take good care of it so i couldnt play it very affectively
i sold it to gamestop for someone else to be tricked into buying it
a few years later i saw it on amazon
hmmm looks nice
so i bought it and let me say im kinda dissapointedthe goodwell its doom
cant argue with that
i hated the controlls but you can pick a diffrent controll layout
i havent beaten it yet but i found that most of my favorite levels were still therethe badthey cut out the cybie and spider battle
the graphics are
balls
the save and load screen tells you the level your on not the name though
ex
l instead of tower of babel
i felt like even on nightmare mode that i was rushing through the levels in like  minutes a piece
of course im beast at doom
the music was terrible
beep beep beep bop beep beep beep bop compared to awesome gutair solo on the snes
it wasnt even its own port
it was a direct port of the atari jaguar version i believei would suggest the xbox live version
alot of people think that doom  on gba was better than doom  on gba but thats because it is
so if you want a version of doom to enjoy today find a different versionouch everyone will buy this expecting the standard of doom a lone soldier in a first person shooter against monsters of hades then they will play the game and see the violence challenge and secrets are turned down
the blood is now green and moments after killing an enemy it disappears along with due to the gameboy advance not being as powerful as someones computer original platform of doom the game tends to move slower and there are less enemies barely any decor items like pillars and meat and finally no lighting effects flickering strobe light
several traps have been removed such as you can now no longer fall into a deep pit of lava or acid as well as every single huge room with lots of enemies has just been removed all together
speaking of removed the spider mastermind and the cyberdemon have been removed
the two biggest bosses in doom are no longer there along with holodemons have been removed transparent demons
the controls are unique i have yet to find a way to change weapons but the b button is run and it is to open doors and pull switches
the a button is to fire
there are four slots to save your games and four levels of difficultydoom is the seventh best fps for the gba and the second released for the system
doom was first released for the pc back in   the game was awesome
eight years later the game is now portable
and yes it is still awesome
everything from the original is here except for some minor elements that dont detract from anything
doom is back back with a vengeancegraphics wise this game is lackluster
at times you get nice images but everythings so dark and shadowed its rather hard to tell
you dont have many character choices and you basically just press the attack buttons
over and over
if youre into this kind of fighting game try champions of norraththis is a nice tight little hackslash and rpg combo
it took me about four days to beat and i didnt play to straight out wingraphics are decent story line is good but a bit shallow making replay not worthwhile
the final battle is a bit dissapointing but everything up to that point is solid its a good buywell i was hoping to get an oldfashioned rpg game in my console
instead  i get diablolike gameplay
read my review on diablo if you want thats why i gave it  stars
thee is a good story in this game but in the first town you only get to go in one place
thats it
dont you remember the huge sidequests you can get in baldurs gate
this game is just follow the story and make it quick
however the grpahics and gameplay are great
the monsters were impossibly difficult but on multiplayer they sure drop like flies
enjoybaldurs gate dark alliance is pretty fun but short and it lacks much in the way of a story
just to mention it is nothing like its namesake the computer series
it is basically just a hack n slash action rpg
not the worst of that type of game but it is far from the bestthe gameplay is fairly basic
you run around each map and kill everything using your class skill as a sorceress you cast spells as an archer you use bows and as the dwarf you slaughter with normal attacks
it is actually pretty hard i died a lot especially fighting rats in the dungeon while level   it follows the grand tradition of dd games in that you are basically worthless at low levels
it is pretty well done but there really isnt anything which makes it stand out especially because it has almost no story
you just sort of go on an adventuredark alliance has pretty okay graphics
the lighting effects on spells and stuff are cool as is the water
it just wasnt all that detailed
even if they were excellent the zoomed out overhead camera makes it hard to appreciate
some said the death animations were great
i didnt notice
it also has very nice music but it is rarely played for some reasonall in all baldurs gate is okay
it is very short  hours but it has good replay value
it also has fun coop multiplayer which i enjoyed quite a bit
there are lots of better games to play but this would be good for a rental
just for funcapcom vs snk  is the sequel to the popular crossover capcom vs snk
improved features include more characters d backrounds restored controls the traditional  punch  kick button controls are back thankfully and  different quotgroovesquot
the most significant changes in my opinion are the addition of the new characters and the good old  button control layout
i believe the  button scheme implemented in capcom vs snk  and marvel vs capcom  seriously compromised the gameplay
so with the larger character roster and tweaked gameplay whats not to like right
unfortunately there are a couple of drawbacks
for some reason capcom has felt the need to leave the characters in their recent d fighting games in low resolution
i really dont see why they decided to do that because even the animation intense street fighter  was done in high res
also some characters have been stretched and resized when they didnt need to be and the fireballs are done with d graphics that do not match the d hand drawn characters
even though the graphics and overall presentation are only satisfactory i still recommend capcom vs snk  there should be enough d fighting action to keep any fan of the genre interested for at least a whilecapcom and snk made many games with each other during the ps era
while the snk crafted games are still to this day recognized as fairly competent fighters the capcom offerings were often rushed and slapped together
while this game is fun it obviously has little love put into it
many sprites are reused from other games causing size and resolution issues and making everything seem like a amateur mugen modstormfront studios blood wake for the xbox video game console was one of the first generation games for that system
released in early  blood wake combined the fastpaced gameplay and mayhem similar to the twisted metal series of games but with boats and water being the vehicle and environment of choicethe game itself was pretty much when boiled down to its basic core an excuse to blowup and destroy as many targets on the screen as possible during any given stage mission
all this is wrapped in a simple yet good storyline which unfolds whenever a stage is completed thus unlocking the next one
just like twisted metal the player can choose from a variety of boats and weapons configuration to play through the game
from the early going the choice are pretty limited but none of the choices are so bad and basic that one couldnt achieve their stage objectives and unlock better boats and equipment
most stages just require the player to destroys targets deemed important to finishing the stage with optional ships and coastal defenses as targets of oppurtunity to help pad the scorethe game at the beginning is pretty fun in that the water environment adds a new factor in controlling the vehicles and aiming the weapons
but as the game progresses to later stages of the story it just seemed to rehash earlier levels but with stronger enemies and more side onjectives
from start to finish blood wake became an actionshooter which stayed the coure instead of improving with each successive levelthe graphics on blood wake was pretty good for a first generation game on the xbox
the detail on the different boats and their weapons were pretty well done
the water effect and movement were also pretty to look at though if more time was set aside to designing and developing this aspect of the game it couldve turned out greatoverall blood wake became just such a game
it was a good game to try out and rent but never came close to being a great one to justify having to buy iti just rented this game and i guess it is ok for a first gen xbox game but overall kind of dissapointed
this game does have a few good concepts but i personally feel that they werent executed as well as they could have
mission concepts for example are quite interesting but unfortunately the first half of the game is way too easy
then it gets way too hard all of a sudden
unfortunately that is were the real interesting mission concepts lay attack on a harbour escorting ships etc
graphically water and boats are done with great detail but the land is quite plain
in the end i do feel that this game plays much better than mechassault a game that i personally did not like but not by much
you can probably get all that is here out of a rental but you will probably be wasting space if you buy itchad steingraberparadigminfogrameslevel designergame designerd artist on the terminator dawn of fatethis game definately has the water thing down
the physics on the boat through the water is superb
it fun just driving the boat around
but of course that isnt enough to make a great game
for me the game became boring real quick
the graphics arent as good as they could be come on this is the xbox guys
and the level design is slightly on the poorboring side
with a little bit of inspired innovation this game could have been really goodeven great
but alas such a game didnt surfacemaybe they will make a sequel with some much needed upgrades
anyway this is a rent first title before you buy itanother xbox title with great graphics  nothing ps or gc could ever generate  but annoying gameplay and poor controls
the other is wreckless
basically in each mission you drive a small gunboat and try to destroy enemy boats and other targets
the weapons you unlock are really bad and the missions are pretty much the same after a while
the worst part is the controls are extremely frustrating
as other reviewers have pointed out the game would have been better and more fun if it were more arcadey
as it stands now the boats are very difficult to maneuver and even at the ensign level easiest you face a lot of tough enemies who are very good
also the targetting mechanism is ridiculously stupid it simply locks onto the nearest enemy boat
you cant lock on a single boat and the targetting unlocks even when a boat is still in sightin short a game that has a lot of potential but is marred by poor gameplay design
i wonder how the games developers at stormfront studios can be so stupid as not to test the games thoroughly before releasing it
hello
we are gamers and we want great gameplay as well as graphics
shame on microsoft for releasing such an average gameif you like a fastpace shooting game then this will do fine for you
the graphics on the boats and water are very good and detailed
the first few missions are really easy if you have talent in the game but all of the sudden it gets like really hard and i still havent beaten it
but if your up for the challenge then you should definitely buy this gameprosgreat graphicschallenging and interesting missionspretty good ainice variety of weaponsfun and competitiveconsreally funky controlstakes to many shots to blow up a boatsudden change of difficultythe water effects in this game really and truely are awesome
no game has ever matched the detail that water is treated with in this game
having said that all you do is drive a boat
sometimes the boats get faster sometimes better armed but its still just a boatnow the game is an interesting concept and it is fun to play but the replay value on it does wear thin
additionally the multiplayer is tough to play because unless all  of the players are experienced it becomes a bloodbath for the one who knows how to play
which granted can be funbottom line is this
if you can get this game for a good price then by all means get it
it is worth about and will provide more then enough replay value
but as with many games once you stop playing it for a while it is not one that you will long to go back togood gamingthis is a wondeful game but its few major flaws keep it away from   those flaws are  it is repetitive
 there is probably not enough modes to satisfy for long
and  is that it is really really hardexcellent graphics and a fun game in its own rightsi was excited when i saw there was a fast shootin boat racing game but still after playing hydro thunder on psthis game is second best
eventhough hydro thunder is not a shooterblood wake isnt horrible its just boring at times
first of all the the variety of weapons stink
the waves and graphics are pretty good
the game includes a story mode and multiplayer
there is also different settings in multiplayer such as versus and open contest
open contest is where you and an opponent have to destroy a set number of boats before your opponent does
the story mode is a little on the boring side but it lets you unlock new boats
the game isnt a total waste of time and money so rent it then if you like it buy itthis is a great vehicle combat game to come to the xbox due to the fact that it takes advantage of the xbox hardware
this game wasnt toooo hard on normal difficulty until the last level where i come to think of that level as impossible
i had to wait until an invincibility cheat came out and i hardly ever have to do that with a game and with that code the last level was still hard to complete
there is almost no replay value to this game because who would want to go back and try to beat it on a harder difficult level such as admiral
multiplayer is also bad unless you have the code for bloodball soccer in the waterit is very funny but still not that greatthe graphics of bloodwake are dutifully impressive for an xbox title but if your looking for the level of raw carnage that twisted metal provides dont look here
in campaign mode your character is kai a naval captain whose squad is splashed by his own brother
fortunately for kai pirates happen upon the scene and pull him from the waves toward a shaky future
so of you go initiated into the shadow clan pirates
the story unfolds from there never quite being exceptional but never making the player roll their eyes in disgust either
in other words its ok but dont expect it to wow yougameplay takes a bit of getting used to your boat rocks and rolls with the waves reactes somewhat sluggishly and is difficult to control in reverse
but after you get used to it all its fairly entertaining
the player unlocks an array of different boats as they proceed through the game with an arsenal comprising torpedoes chain guns autocannons cannons rockets and mines
unfortunately though you cant choose which boat youll use in a mission its always an assigned boat
most missions are fairly straightforward sink enemy
but there are a few nice changes of pace along the way
that being said some of the missions are extremely difficult on any difficulty level above beginner and cheat codes are a must have for the last three
hats off to anyone who has beaten them without a cheatall in all its a good game but not great
a fun once in awhile game
and its a good choice for its current price of moneyblood wake is another hit braught by the xbox
the game looks to be promesing but its really not that great
the graphics engine for the water is just pure and amazing
i loved how they desighned the levels of water they really made them look awesome
the game is also great with the boats as you can shoot out many different types of ammo and this is one of those pretty cool run and gun fights exceptits with boatsbut the game is lacking
there isnt much to do except run n gun boats they dont add anything new to it
the gameplay is good for about  minutes but then just gets boring and a little repetitiveprosgraphicslil gampeplaywater desighncongameplayheheboring storycutscenes arnt that greatkina repetitive but we can handle itin the end i give this jumbo sized xbox title a out of  starslatesblood wake is a highspeed gunboat warfare game
the most impressive aspect of the game is the water physics
the effects are truly amazing and highly believable
the graphics are also pretty darn good
it keeps a fast pace and it is a welcome break when you want a change of pace and to try something different
while this game isnt necessarily highly engaging it can be a lot of fun
now that the price has come down a bit it is worth the purchasethis is your typical quirky japanese style video gameyou play as a boxer through story modeand fight a bunch of other boxers in different venuesthere is also a single match modewhere you and the computer or a second player can have a single matchthe boxers that are beaten in story mode are unlocked and can be used for the single match modethe gameplay in this game is fairbut very far from perfectthe controls can be a bit sloppy sometimesand it defintaly takes some time to get used tothe graphics are very outdatedbut the music is pretty goodoverallvictorious boxers is decent as bestthe lack of game modes and the sluggish controls really hurt this gameif youre looking for a really good boxing game for the psyoure better off just buying one of the fight night games instead and just leaving this title alonewhen dave mirra freestyle bmx  was first released in it was pretty fun for the timebut extreme sports games have come much farther ever since thenwith hot games like tony hawks pro skater  and the underappreciated aggresive inline pushing the extreme sports boundries so far these daysthere is really no reason to buy dave mirra freestyle bmx i will have to give it some credit thoughit features hugewell designed levelsathough you can sometimes get lost in them they are so big
and the soundtrack is actually pretty goodit features artists like sublinegang starrthe cultrage against the machineand morethat will only get it so far thoughi suggest you should skip this title and move on with your life because you arent really missing much if you dont buy or play dave mirra freestyle bmx a good game within its own category considering its a extreme sports game
it joins the ranks of tony hawks pro skater but does not live up to thps standardshowever the soundtrack is impressive enough to keep you somewhat entertained as you bike your way through the levels
it is a mediocre game but not of thps quality so unless you have a passion for bmx then you should keep some distance from this gamethis game is fun to play for awhile  but if your not a skaterbiker it wont interest you one bit
this game is almost identical to the ps version except the xbox has more levels for it
as with most games of this genre dave mirras has a pretty good soundtrack but is lacking number of songs
i found my self up loading cds of music so that i could listen to something other then the continually repeating seven or some songs from the game
as far as actual game play goes the game moves at an onoff pace some controls are a bit frustrating to get the hang of and the graphics are only mediocre
i think the best thing in this game is the movement of the biker when bailing from hitting a car or a railing
the biker resembles something close to a rag doll getting pulled on by a  yr old  arms and legs bend all over his body which is completely unrealistic but funny as hell
the other good aspect is the number of different multiplayer modes you can play everything from highest jump to horse to wipeoutin a nut shell this game can be alot of fun but only if you have the interest and a couple other people to play it withelectronic arts have really made a remakrable franchise based upon the wellreceived need for speed series
since the mid s this racing game series has been one of the most dominant and reality racing game series games of all time
they have honestly made it a huge stride in the world of cars
yet the while has been quite a braking effect awhile ago with the need for speed underground series
it had a lackluster reaction than other versions like hot pursuit had undergone in the earlier years
here is pretty much the same as before for racers alike from the earlier speedneed for speed underground  is the sequel to the adequate  underground
the game and its features are just similar as they were before
the game is set in one entire major city similar to games like midtown madness and the highly successful midnight club collection for the playstation   xbox
yet there are so many well driven and highly delightful cars that really go all out in their speed
the graphics are very well recognized and the music reallly is full of hard core splice just like the other need for speed games
the control also fares well with each challenge including the underground gameplay and the free roaming race scenestill there are a few disadvantages
one of them is that the game is mainly in one city throughout the numerous courses other than different landscapes and locations like other need for speed games
the second disadvantage is that other than the newest array of automobiles to choose from and unlock there really isnt much of a challenge for anybody who has mastered the earlier underground game
some may consider passing this one upall in all need for speed underground  fairs quite well as a racer but not for all who want to really be fast  madly furious
i suggest you rent this racer and see if the buzz is in the right court for you
otherwise stick with the originalgraphics bsound bcontrol bfun  enjoyment c overall cthere isnt much to this game
once you capture the first ghost you have laid the plan for what you will do with each ghost you see until the end of the gamethere are a few exceptions
the truth is it just stops being fun after awhile and the game isnt difficult
on the positive side the graphics are good and they flow smoothly
so if you are into good graphics and easy game and alot of redundancy i guess this game is for youluigis mansion is fun while it lasts and the graphics and animation are really excellent
as far as gameplay goes its fun learning how to trap the ghosts and its a rewarding experience when you solve the puzzles and open up each new room of the big mansion
but thats all there is to it enter new room find out how to get the key to the next room repeat
you keep hoping therell be something new but there isnt
and then the game just ends with no real rewardabout  hours after you started
the game is way way too shortkids will enjoy this game but if youre an older gamer youll want to rent this one and save your money for games like eternal darkness rogue leader wave race and super smash bros meleethis game is average theres not too much gcn games that are better infact most are worse because of all the babyish disney and cartoon network rubbish
you could beat this game pretty fast with an online walkthrough so id just rent it for a few days
pretty nice gaming experiance and the graphix are damn decent
this game was one of the first games released for the cube so you mighg want to consider purchasing it if you find it cheap cause this game might be worth alot in maybe a couple decades bought the game played the game beat the game liked the game sold the gamemy future brother in law gave me this game cause he didnt like i played it for like  min and its not that bad it could of been better if it was marios mansion but luigi put on a great performancethis game is okay but it took me only  hours to beat and is sort of based along the same thing catching ghosts
that is all you do
this was the first game i ever got for gamecube and i would beg to difer
i think nhl hitz  is better  if you thought this would be a good sequal to mario guess again
i wouldnt pay the price for this
this will have to do untill mario sunshine comes out next summerdespite being called the super mario bros luigi hardly gets attention
he starred in a lame snes gamemario is missing was in super smash bros melee but his moves were exact same as marios
he wasnt even in mario sunshine
has a launch title luigis mansion shows off some of the gamecubes power but the gameplay itself leaves something to be desiredstory luigi wins a mansion in a contest he doesnt even remember entering
he tells his brother mario to be there
mario in effect has gone missing and theres ghosts all over
but thanks to professor gadd and his poltergust  luigi can vacuum up the ghosts ghostbustersstylegraphics the best usage of the gamecubes engine is in the lighting and shadow
lightning strikes through windows provide perfect shadows as well as your flashlight shining the dark rooms
everything else looks rather blah
besides luigi and the ghosts the rooms looks almost unfinished and somewhat blurry in some casesmusicsound barely any music beside a slight reprise of the classic mario dungeon theme
when you vacuum in a ghost theres this irritating piano figure its literally one note repeated
as for voices professor gadd talks in a faux japanese almost as it sounds like it but way to short to be japanese and by pressing b luigi cries out mario
his health plays a role in how confident or scared he soundsgameplay the control scheme for this is awkward
shoulder l is for element firing r is for the vacuum and the grey buttons are for your game boy horror which shows either your map or a scanning featurealmost similar to metroid primes
to turn the flashlight on is a directly beneath it is the right analog which determines where luigi facesthe stumble at the finish line reference in my subject refers to the final boss
i wont spoil who it is or anything but ill say what happens you take on king boothis isnt really a spoiler whos inside a bigthing
anyways to suck up king boo you have to fire these big spiky rocks at the things mouth while its attacking but he gets so close to you the resulting explosion ends up damaging you
once you hit him king boo flies out and you have to suck him in
he literally has  hpcompared to your  not only that while youre trying to suck him in the thing is firing ice at youthis is an incredibly unfair fight
its like the difficulty was evenly balanced throughout the game then bam frustration alley
im no johnnycomelately newbie when it comes to gaming but i took well over  tries to beat the guy
kids will be able to progress in the game with little hiccups here and there but that last boss will send them running for their big brother
but other than that give it a tryas the title game for nintendos gamecube it was nice to see that luigi was in the spotlight for once instead of mario but when comparing luigis mansion to other super mario bros games it definitely falls shortthe premise of the game is simple enough
basically mario has disappeared into this mansion and luigi has to battle ghosts throughout the house and find keys to open doors in order to save his plumbing counterpart
the game controls take approximately  minutes to master so you find yourself quickly running through the mansion and vacuuming up ghosts thats how luigi defeats the spooky spectrums
and then before you know it youve defeated the boss and saved your brotheri would not recommend actually buying this game for it does not provide endless hours of gameplay
rent it and beat it in a couple of days like i did
its worth at least thatwhen i got my gamecube at local store the day it was released last november waiting in line for  hours beating the rush at local store later on that day to get my already reserved copy of luigis mansion and scrambling around to find an available memory pack i knew it would all be worth it
i just didnt expect exactly how disappointed id be with luigis mansionwell its not as bad as i just made it sound
the cons will be listed first
the game has no graphical prowess the music is repetetive the gameplay is overly simplistic and the game is over way too soon a little too shabby for gamecubes first game
but i wasnt beating myself over the head for buying it eitherthe pros are fewer but just let me get through them
while i mentioned that the music was repetetive nintendo finds ways to add flair to one song thats played basically the entire game
so its not like youre listening to the same song over and over sometimes luigi will be whistling it sometimes a harp will be playing it other times a low bass will be playing it when your health is low the music will play much slower
so its not all that bad
while the gameplay is overall simplistic it is challenging at times from finding all  boos to solving puzzles that can be a little mind boggling at times
the framerate is overall constant no slowdown whatsoever the graphics are smooth if simplistic and theres a pikmin movie
woohoo
luigis mansion is entertaining for about  days
once its over its basically over the hidden mansion doesnt add much either
if youre a hardcore marioluigi fan like myself maybe you should invest in this
if not maybe a rental would be good
and if youre looking for the next good marioluigi platformer wait for super mario sunshinemmm luigis mansion sounds like a good game
it looked like a great game on all of the e shows and magazines
this game has great graphics
i was hooked as soon as i took it out of the wrapper
this game has many strong points but unfortuantely there are also weak pointsmany weakpointscontrol is no factor in this game
this is some of the best control sincewell ever
you can move luigi around in all directions rather easily
you can move his upper body as well as his lower at the same time different dirrections
as i said the graphics are oustandinly gorgeous
you will feel like you are really in a haunted mansion
when i saw bowser at the end i forgot that i was playing a rated e game but before you go get in the car and run down to the store read the rest of the revieweven thought this is a great game on the outside it isnt as good on the inside
the gameplay gets old fast
all you do is just suck up some ghosts and it gets really boring
the story also isnt very good
there is really no plot development
all you do is go around sucking up ghostsas i already said
the game is so easy that it isnt funny
i beat it in  days and i wasnt even trying
the only reason i can think that you would purchase this game is because it has luigi on it
so if you havent purchased it yet rent it first
then make up your decision after about your th ghostlike most nintendo games this game is original and is fun to play
it has great graphics and interesting character designs
however it is very easy and can be won in  hours unless you are very young
after you win it you wont want to bother with it any more so go somewhere you can rent it for a week and enjoy it and be done with it
save your money and wait for super mario sunshinethis is a very original and beautifully detailed game
its very short and has little replay valuemario sunshine is much betterluigis mansion was essentially the gamecubes launch title
nintendo made their point very clear
the gamecube was going to be about brilliant graphics for a younger generation of gamers
luigis mansion painted that picture perfectly
unfortunatey nintendo made a marketing mistake by not following the same path as sony and microsoft
while liguis mansion was highly likeable for its graphics and character legend it wasnt a game that was very enjoyable
seeing this games graphics without having the time of your life playing it felt like driving an automatic ferrari running on a mere four cylindersluigis mansion is a fairly simple game that could be accomplished in half a day
some areas of lm
were actually enigmatic and annoying at times but the game flowed pretty well from beginning to end
if lm
was as lengthy as mario sunshine maybe this could have been a worthy lanch title but only on graphics alone
mario sunshine wasnt worthy of being a lanch title either
its not good for nintendo when your mvps mario  luigi of your brand cant be found it the best games
metroid prime star fox adventures and the wind waker easily outshine both lm
and msoverall luigis mansion is a good game but not great
not great in the fact its not long enough
not great in the fact it lacks some serious fun for all gaming audiences
nintendo marketed luigis mansion for the  year old gamers
while nintendo thought this would have been the best idea at the time it proved to be a marketing nightmare
no one will remember luigis mansion ten years from now but other gamecube titles will be considered classics
luigis mansion isnt even a top ten gamecube title
very low replay value but still one could discover entertainment if played on a rainy day
its currently something around  or 
thats a fair priceokay what the heck is up with the vaccuum cleaner
thats your weapon
interesting
this game is somewhat entertaining however it is not exactly cool and actionpacked
the whole point is to suck up ghosts with the vaccuum and rescue mario
its one of those games you sit around and play all day when youre bored
it will keep you entertained for awhile anyway
check it out if youre into the mario games as i said its certainlyinterestingi am a big fan of mario  luigi
this game is fun and i recommend it for everyone
you control luigi and work your way through different floors in a mansion
the object of the game is to find mario who has dissappeared in the mansion
by using a vacuum cleaner you have to capture ghosts then recieve keys to different rooms in the mansion
the graphics are awesome and catching the ghosts does get challenging in some areas
i give it  stars because you can beat it in a few hours
buy it used like i did or rent it and you will get your money worththis is a fun game but it just seems lacking
its incredibly short about  hours to get everything and the gameplay gets a little monotonous at the end
it becomes see portrait ghost find way to get portrait ghost take key get boo do it again
one goal is to get  boos elusive little special ghosties
that may seem like a tall order but when one boss is a giant boo made of  boos to be slurped up i felt a little cheated
i also felt really cheated at the endingit deletes the game and gives the option to go to the quotsecret mansionquot which in fact turns out to be the identical mansion except you have a small star icon at the corner of the screen
i feel its more of an quotohh look at that lighting effectquot and quotooowww neat reflectionquot demo type thing
although the graphics do what the n couldnt it doesnt really show off the true gcn horsepower for that try rouge squadron ii
the simple and basic gameplay will appeal best to less experienced players but nonetheless if you want a game to break yourself into using the gcn controller note drool this is it
if you want a challenge try rouge squadron iialthough i was considering giving this game  stars the game is just too short to deserve that rating
however the game is very innovative and interesting to play
the game also challenges the players mind a bit or maybe im just stupid
the only way to play this game for me is to collect all of the money and all of the boos
the graphics are decent sound is repetitive gameplay has a bit of variety and the control scheme is decent once the player gets used to it
however the short gameplay time and lack of a multiplayer mode means that this game may be collecting dust in a week or two
still it is an innovative piece of software and it is worth looking in toby now everyone knows what the mario series is
after all there is a mario game for everyone right
so anyway this was nintendos attempt to put luigi in the spotlight
and it almost succeedsgraphicsthe graphics are topnotch especially the dust effects as it gets sucked up in your vacumsoundnothing special both effects and music are onparcontrolwhats up with the vacum
it took me  an hour to figure outstorynothing much really
luigi gets a letter telling him he won a mansion and when he enters he finds that an old man is there
he gives luigi a vacum cleaner that sucks up ghosts and begins his search for mario whom has vanishedgameplaythis game was way too easy but it ended quickly just before it got boringoverallluigi was given a game that will last you maybe a rental but not much longer
if i were him id sue nintendo for putting mario in the spotlight and then give me a barelypar game to try to make up for thingsi made it to the nd bossfight and had been loving what was almost a fabulous gamebut when i had to suck up the same skeletons about  timesim not exagerating i dont thinkbecause the boss fight is virtually impossible to win i realized i had wasted my money by hiring this gameso many gamecubes are just too harddont get the wrong ideaim up to a challengebut noone wants to feel like a kid who is playing against an unfaircheating big brotherthats what its like
it should be just a tad easier and a tad more faira funchallenging game became monotnoustedious and boringthats such a  mistake by the game makersit really is a shame that what could have been a terrific game was ruinedunfortunately this game lacks the visual beauty of the sweeping  degree style of mario  but the game is interesting
for anyone familiar with asian cinema their take on ghosts and the supernatural is a bit more lax than the western traditions
ie
these ghosts have hearts
again disappointing compared to mario  but a cute little game none the lessi got this game for christmas along with a few other games and a gamecube
this game seems really fun at first and has pretty graphicsits about how luigi wins a mansion from a contest he did not even enter  and it is filled with ghosts
bad enoughmario is trapped inside and luigi must rescue him
you meet this little professer dude in the mansion called professor egadd or something like that
he gives you a vacuum to help you suck up the ghosts
so what you do is basically suck up ghosts
after a while it does get a little boring and the puzzles are not too hard
i am a  year old gamer and say this must be for a younger audience
it isnt totally boringit still is fun for a while
 out of when i think luigi i thinkumerwait who is the luigi kid again
wait the guy with the green hat and clothes
the green guy
mario marios brother
that guy
the one in marios shadowwhat was is name again
oh right
mama luigi well this is mr green staches first game for the game cube although mr green mario brother guy made like two other games
they were not well um goodmario is missing  lets not get into that and paper luigi mentioned in paper mario thousand year door which i heard was good
but this is his first true outingwell in mr leaf n greens mansion you take the role as mr greenie the younger brother of mario
who won a mansion
for a contest that he didnt even enterwaitthat sounds familiar i think i was in that contest too also i happened to have won a million dollars from the same email
well apparently larry didnt know what spam is so he falls for a trap like many of us have before
the rebel alliance generic side kicks poland the frenchthe list goes onso i guess mario decides to go check it out gets tricked and gets captured then lenny his brother gets there some things happen and virtually he becomes the next ghost bustersounds like the next plot of a ghost buster movie id watch that
thats the basic plot in marios brother mansion
but wait is greenies mansion a good game
well its biggest let down is its length
its short you can probably finish the game in a good  hours  hrs
if you played it before
its a good game i like it but i wanted more of it it just isnt long
so if you happen to come across garys mansion i suggested buying it or if your friend has it borrow it from herhim if she doesnt let you borrow it then borrow without asking
its worth an afternoon of fun
it is a fun game no doubt but the fun doesnt last once youre done with it at least not for longjust make sure you dont spend a lot on this youre more likely to just trade it in right after you get it
its a rental at bestthe game is very easy the only think that took me time was the last boss a little hard but with practice is easygraphics sound  gameplay replay  controls final   get sunshine or resident evil
and rent this oneluigis mansion is about how luigi looks for mario in a manchine
he meets a guy in the mansion who sucks ghosts up into this device
the man gives it to luigi so on his voyage to find mario he can have away to defend himselfthe game is set around a simple problem
yet this game is like many others
its easy to learn hard to masterthe game is great when you first buy it but the game becomes boring when you repeat each mission to find mario
the game is really short and compared to games like agent under fire auf or smashing drive you wouldnt want  luigis mansion lmi would actually rate this game as   stars
i would really like to give nintendos first gamecube game a higher star rating but i really cant
this game i think was just to quottest the watersquot so to say
it is a fun game to play and i was very impressed with everything about it the graphics the sound and everything
however it has next to no replay value
once you beat it you have no real reason to play it again
if you do play through again youll notice that everything is the same
there are no new enemies to fight no new items to pick up no new anything
the only thing that you would be able to do is try to get a better score and get a better mansion picture
overall it is a very good game but many people wont want to play through it many times since there is nothing new to do
if you want a fun and clean game to play on your gamecube then luigis mansion is certainly a good choice
however dont expect to be playing this game for months and then playing it again right after you finish iti will make this short
luigis mansion was a nintendo gamecube launch and looked very promesing
the graphics were wonderful but the game was way to bad
this game was really aimed for younger audiences for ages  or something like that
and the game is to short
it took me like  hours to beat the game
over all the game is lacking alot of things
one is lengh
the rest you just see for your selfprosgraphicsconsgameplayway to shortthe gameplay wasnt that fun at all
stick with mario sunshine out of latesduring the late s a duo of plumbers ruled the gaming industry
mario along with his poorly recognized brother luigi
overshadowed by his rotund brother luigi has accepted miyamotos brace on a reputable spot for the gamecube
despite the fact that the green plumber lacks the highest of the high eminence when compared to his counterparts super mario world and mario  luigis mansion sends the player on one of the topmost experiences a game can frankly provide
although it does not live up to the demoralizing hopes for a weekly played platformer luigis new dlike dance is incredible in all its rights
conversely not taking the vital steps as a boundless platformer luigis mansion has one sticky discernible shortcoming
spanning only and about six hours the game will be a mixture of being awestruck or deeply saddened for those rummaging for a clearcut mario sequelluigis mansion lobs the player as luigi a spineless ghostbuster
armed with a flashlight the hoover a vacuum cleaner and a game boy horror which serves as a  map the mildly brave luigi must investigate a haunted mansion where each corner and crevice must be thoroughly searched for interleaving puzzles
the puzzles work as a chain of sequence throughout the game marking advancement into the vast halls
each room gushing with several hordes of terrorizing ghouls must be explored in order to attain keys where entry is denied
the regular constant ghosts found to and fro the game are vanquished easily
by screening the flashlight on a ghoul a significant number of hp will appear and the player must completely nullify that number
operating the hoover luigi will be thrown left and right while the skirmishing ghost endeavors not to be sucked into oblivion
gradually its hp will melt down reaching  and finally being bagged
sounds very simple no
well soon the rules are altered as new nastier and more techniqueemployed ghosts come screeching down the halls
if the player is stomped on how to thrash a certain ghost simply utilizing the game boy horror will force the phantom to discharge a hint on ripping them apart
other ghosts intent on not letting the player see them unveil themselves once luigi carries out particular tasks
subsequently luigi goes face to face with immense bosses that require different tactics to slaughter
on the dot luigis mansion keeps and repeats this gameplay pattern not really making up for its abrupt conclusion and obvious repetitivenesson the graphical standpoint this is beyond what other previous consoles have come close to imitate
remembering when the playstation tried to encapsulate fitting cartoony looks the gamecube scoffs at all preceding efforts pulling off the greatest type of cartoon visuals ever
running at  frames per second making use of spotless lighting shadow and transparency effects luigis mansion will have any kid ditch the teletubbies and glue their faces onto the pulsating gaming screen
luigi has a original collection of facial expressions
moving gracefully without any slowdown the player and his surroundings are planed in a radiance of lightly colored backgrounds and an overwhelming number of illumination effects
just the little threads of detail in the game give a hint on how future gamecube titles will be furnished around dazzling tapestries
as if to counter this pro the musical soundtrack are rather lackluster and utterly uninspiring
while the games many sounds luigi humming to himself and all the other jingles are uptothepar with quality the redundant music recurs over and over and over
even though my gaming hunger for the next mario platform is months away mario sunshine luigis mansion proves to be a wistful frolic until the ornate mind of miyamoto breaks all the gaming rules yet again
lavishing some good innovation save for the succinctness on the hours the game is a demanding buy but well worth a revisit on the allstar plumbersthe background story luigi has just won a house and mario has gone to visit it
but the house is haunted and mario hasnt returned yet
luigi has to overcome his fears and go and look for his missing brotherthe game armed with a torch and a vacuum cleaner luigi has to suck in the ghosts who lurk in the furniture in the approximately three dozen chambers of the mansionmy opinion i found this game particularly short and aside from the final battle not very challenging my boyfriend and i finished it over the weekend
it is also rather linear and repetitive as you have to solve it room after single room
the only thing that isnt linear is the tedious collecting of the  boos but like the money you can gather it doesnt lead to any special reward
as for the graphics and the technological progress such as particle effects theyre nice ok but sadly the result didnt turn out as stunningly different from that of the n as i tought it wouldhaving bought the gamecube on friday the day it came out in europe and luigis mansion being the only game in the genre i like available at the moment i must admit i feel a bit disappointed so far
lets hope mario sunshine and zelda will live up to my expectations im sur they willthis game might have one of the best graphics seen on any console and it has on of my favorite nintendo characters luigi
but the game itself is the same thing over and over again get keys open new doors capture ghosts with a vacuum and getting coins
also the game is too short i beat it in about  hours
the game is fun while it lasts but i recommend to rent it firstthe way to move and control luigi is outstanding but come on it is a game for the little ones
i recommend this game to any parent searching for a game for kids of ages  through luigis mansion to put it simply is the perfect weekend rental
the title garnered a total of ten hours of gameplay out of me and has not been touched since
dont get me wrong the game wasnt bad or anything it was just really shortboasting some new gameplay as opposed to the usual platformer fare the puzzles in luigis mansion as well as bosses were fun while they lasted
a fairly simple game luigis mansion is not something that an experienced gamer should probably buy unless theyd just like it in a collection for some reasonfor the family game this doesnt do too badly although the fifty dollar price tag isnt justifiable
a good game for teaching parents and small children to play a game id recommend pikmin as a puzzle game over this and mario sunshine as a mario game above thisthree stars justifies the good quality as well as super short playtime
try renting it before buying itlike most people i bought a gamecube as part of a bundle so i didnt have much choice over my initial game selection
unlike the ps bundle i bought i wasnt won over by the games that were included with one exception
this wasnt the exceptionthe premise for luigis mansion is startlingly different from the previous launch titles for nintendo systems especially from super mario  instead of mario having all the fun luigi is now the central character exploring a mansion to rid it of ghosts and find his brotherthe graphics are excellent as you might expect although its more about detail and subtlety than highspeed action
the game play however leaves something to be desired
instead of the standard runaroundpickthingsupanddothings play luigi has a vacuum on his back reminiscent of ghostbusters
he uses it to flush out ghosts suck them up and return them to the paintings from which theyve escaped
he can also use it to pick up some items to throw and to suck up elements and spit them out
thats about it though
if youre used to squirrel tails superhigh jumping and the like you wont find it here
i found the absence of unusual movement to be a detraction from the game playthe puzzles too dont seem to be quite up to par possibly because theyre limited by the tools with which you can solve them
ill admit that i also got stuck at one point in this game which is something that i use as an indication of a games quality  how frequently do i get stuck and if i use a hint book could i have discovered this on my own
i never did check this out for luigis mansion partly because i wasnt inspired to keep playingthe actual capturing of the ghosts is essentially reeling them in as fish  if you played ocarina of time on the n youll remember that little part of the game
for me it was an enjoyable break in the game but hardly enough to base an entire game on
little ghosts are easy to reel in
bigger ghosts take more effort
sometimes you can reel in two or more at once
special ghosts require that you do certain things before you can reel them in
yawnim not quite sure if this is intended for adults as much as it is for kids but my experience with this type of game and with the kids that i know indicates that more often than not kids expect just as much out of these games as adults do especially if its their money theyre using to buy them
in any event i found it to be a disappointing launch title and i traded it in about a month after purchase
if youre a diehard marioluigi fan or if youre collecting every gamecube game there is maybe youll have more fun with it than i did
it was fun for a while but the novelty wore off quicklythis game is really annoying
you have to go around these hoops and that is one of the worst part about this
if any of you havent reaserched or played this game you shouldnt have wrote a review because you dont know anythin about this gamefunny
i like it but before you buy it rent it
the first  weeks the game was soo good but then it turned a little boring still good game
proximo q venhathis game has great graphics and is great when you have a sibling to play with but otherwise it gets old after a while and is fustrating
the courses are okay but are extremely fustrating since there are many things to crash into
also there isnt that much to unlock in it
overall you should only rent it unless you have friends over oftenthis game is pretty good
if you like wave runners then this just might be the game youre looking forthis game for me continues anotsogood trend with gamecube games
the graphics and sound in this game are top notch easily surpassing ps and on par with xbox
the water looks great and everything runs very smoothly the whole time
the problem is that this game ceases to be fun due to the insane difficulty of the last circuit
i dont mind a challenge i mean ninja gaiden was really challenging but at least you could have a life besides your nintendo and still have a hope of beating the game at some point
this game is so aggravating on expert it is a wonder my gamecube is still in one piece
one mistake and you are toastwhat kind of gameplay is that
add to this that the controls leave much to be desired ie
you either have a jet ski that turns on a dime or one that steers like a tugboat and you get one frustrating game
and one more thing how come all of the other riders dont have to amass points in the races like you do to stay in
at the end of the circuit there should be three racers going for the title if i get eliminated if i dont earn enough points
i would recommend this game if you would like a coollooking fast racing game and you dont mind that you may never unlock the final trackthis game has the best water graphics ive ever seenway better than any on xbox and psbut the rest of the graphics are wellunrealisticthe buildings look like drawingsand when you first play it it is really funthe next day i played it againand on the rd daybut then it happendi felt like this was getting very boringso iim not a big fan of racing that doesnt involve four wheels so when i had the chance to play wave race  for the nintendo  i was pleasantly surprised at the game play
it was pretty fun and although i never bought it it was worth a rental or two
when i saw that wave race blue storm was included with my gamecube bundle i thought it might be more of the same
unfortunately i was right  it was pretty fun but probably only worth a rental or twothe gameplay isnt much different from wave race  with one major exception
the racing concept is the same as before
you race other contestants on tracks finishing high enough unlocks other tracks and so on although its expanded in this game
one nice touch is that when you are racing in championship mode you get to choose the order in which you race on the first few tracks and weather plays a factor  waves can be higher and visibility poorer during rainy weather than during a sunny day so you have to decide whether to race on the easy track during the rain to balance things out or gamble that you wont need a topthree finish on the last track and wait till the endin addition to the championship and timetrial modes theres also a stunt mode similar to the ssx series where you do tricks to earn points
the problem is that ssx does it much better although in blue storms defense snow lends itself to tricks more readily than water does
blue storm doesnt have trick books costumes to unlock or anything like that  you just go around the course doing tricks to get a high score so theres no real incentive to play over and over againultimately that was my verdict on the game
it was fun to play for a bit but without a compelling reason to replay the courses once youve unlocked a series theres not much of a reason to go back and play again
this may be more fun for multiplayer competition but im looking for games that are fun for one player as well and wave race blue storm just couldnt provide the replayability that ssx tricky doesnormally any game made by shigeru miyamoto would get a heartfelt and appreciative five stars from me
pikmin is an exception because miyamoto broke one of his own rules of thumb when he designed it
that rule is let the player play at their own pacepikmins core game play itself has the makings of a perfect game grow and harvest criminally cute little colorful carrot people and then use them to complete various tasks and chores in order to recover enough pieces of your damaged spacecraft until you can leave the alien planet youre stranded on
ie
earth the pikmin come in three colors and each color has its own strengths and weaknesses
you must command your pikmin to knock down obstacles build bridges defeat enemies carry parts back to the ship and grow more pikmin
quite a bit of strategy is necessary or youll fail
you have to set pikmin to a task and leave them to it while you go and direct more pikmin to do something else
this in itself could have been gaming nirvana
but then miyamoto decided to take it a step further you have only  days to complete the mission
 day in the game  approx
 minutes of actual playing timewhile its not all that difficult to finish the game before times up it does add an unwelcome sense of pressure and stress to what otherwise could have been a delightful and even relaxing game to play
the playfulness and sheer whimsy is overshadowed by a dark cloud of impending doom
when you could have been happily cheering your pikmin on as they do your bidding you may instead find yourself cursing at them
faster you little morons
faster
no not that way you idiots
that way
damn you
damn you all to vegetable hell
it was the time limit that prevented me from completing pikmin back when it was released
not because i was unable to but because i stopped playing because i didnt need the stress
ive completed it recently because i want to play pikmin  which has no time limit thank god with a clear conscience
one of my solutions to facing the  day challenge was to get into the habit of scouting
you can only save your progress at the end of each day
at the beginning of each new day the first thing i would do is explore the level alone without any pikmin tagging along to look for ship pieces take note of obstacles enemies and the general lay of the land
once id formulated a plan to get that piece back to the ship id reset the gamecube and reload my save file so i could have the entire day ie
 minutes to achieve my goal
on the best days i was able to retrieve a whopping two ship pieces
in my opinion pikmin should have let you take as many days as you needed to complete the game and they could have offered a challenge mode with a time limit to satisfy the more hardcore gamers out there
as it stands i now admit that this is a fun and addictive game
however it could have been so much better and i would have finished it when i originally bought it instead of years later
im grading it on a curve a curve set by miyamoto himself with games like super mario world yoshis island legend of zelda a link to the past super mario  and loz ocarina of timei find this game hard and a little frustrating
you have a time limit of  days each day is fifteen min to find  peices of your broken space ship in five levels with the help of pikminpikimin is a game where you play as a space captain who has crashlanded on a strange and hostile planet via crashing into a floating asteroid
you have to actually see the cutscene doesnt he know not to drive drunk
when he leaves to investigate he notices that his ship has been totaled
as you may have guessed its your job to play as olimar his name and find the pieces to the ship within  days as that is as long as his suits life support systems will last
luckily youre not alone as you will soon find red yellow  blue creatures
although each have noticeable differences they are all of the same species called pikmin
theyll do anything for you even get eatenbut as for my actual review i dont really have much to say about this game
as in most nintendomade game there are no difficulty settings and it is mindbendingly hard
the gameplay mixes strategy and adventure genres which i like but what does it matter if each and every one of your pikmin are going to get eaten by some giant monsterthis was my first game i ever bought
and usually people like the first game they get to death
not me
this game started out to be way easy and i was lovin it
then level three came around
way too hard
the time limit is too short
so when pikmin  comes out get it
because it is  player and has no time limit
although by this game if you are the kinda player that doesnt kill himself if he doesnt beat a game after  years of playing itpros
nice grephics
each pikmin race has its own ability
the worlds are huge
the gameplay is very originalcons
the bosses are to easy to defeat
only three types of pikmins
the sunmeter is very enoying
the cameras are a real pain in the ass
olimar looks goofyits to challenging
i f you like a challenge get this
its not that fun but in a way it isthis game is cool while you start playing it
but once you get inside of it you will find out that the game has no new things only new color pikmins
every level is the same thing collect ship parts
the only thing that varies per level are the bad guys
i would consider it more of a rental than a buy
only true stradegy fans will enjoy itif youre looking for the same game that you had on the n then you have found it just with different stages
the gameplay is still as a tired as it was on the n and inevitably as boring as well
this game only adds to the growing concern that nintendo has been and will continue to dull the senses with its overemphasis on appealing to the younger audience
if you have a short attention span and want little depth to your fighters then by all means purchase this game
otherwise stear clear of this onethis game is a good sequel to ssb on the nintendo but its more fun with friendsplaying p all the time gets seriously boring fast especially after you beat the game
play it with friends
but unlock everything firstsuper smash bros melee isnt as good as its sequel on wii
its definitely worth buying though
theres a good number of different modes lots of stages lots of characters and more
it will keep you busy for a while with lots of things to unlockpresentation typical smash bros menu and opening scenegraphics some things just dont look rightsound super smash bros games always have good soundgameplay this game is very fun to play most of the timereplay value it gets boring before you finish unlocking everythingoverall  its a high star ratingssbm is a very fun game quite appropriate for inviting two or three friends over for some good vs battles
theres also enough singleplayer stuff to do to keep a single person occupied and the homerun contest and break the targets minigames are great fun and challenging though if you simply look up strategies on the internet and slavishly copy the work of others youll gain excellent records at the cost of draining all the fun out of these gameshowever the game quickly gets old
once the singleplayer features have been beaten the game loses much of its value
it just doesnt have a lot of replay value
the lasting value of the game depends on the multiplayer modes and the game is certainly above average and good fun when smashing friends but it is inferior in this aspect to the n game super smash brothers
the controls on the gcn are pretty pathetic the buttons seeming very insensitive and unresponsive so you may have to mash them furiously to get any moves to occur on the screen
two changes from the previous game dumbed down combat so as to give weaker players a better chance
combos are much more difficult both because of the unresponsiveness of the controls and because moves are less fluid and the opponent always has time to react after your move this reduces combat to random damagehacking and buttonmashing clearly helping weaker players who neednt worry about mastering combosit is unfortunate that the game felt it could only fix the degenerate characters and combos of the previous game by seriously reducing the effect skill has on combat
at a certain point one must simply mash the right buttons hard enough and hope to hit the opponent more than he hits back
another randomizing factor in the sequel is the appeance of items they appear much more frequently and all over the place
the items themselves are weaker and again do not lend themselves to skillful use as much as the items in the first game so they are little more than extensions of the hack and damage style of combat in this game
the game reduced the effectiveness of the hammer but in my opinion the hammer was never truly degenerate  it simply took some skill in the first game to disarm your opponent of it
in fact against a skilled player the immobility and vulnerability inherent in using the hammer could actually give better chances to the player without the itemin summation singleplayer modes get old fast so the lasting value of this game depends on the multiplayer game
if you find yourself frustrated at pressing buttons and having little happen and at combat where wins are highly dependent on random factors and not the players skill thus dependent on something the player cannot ever improve in this game will be disappointing
its a decent fighting game but worth no more than three stars and a massive disappointment compared to the first game which was easily five starsgreat game and stimulatingbut you could get bored with it quickly i will talk about super smash bros melee here
this game is good when you have about  people over your house
it has a good multiplayer mode but the single player games are so boring
the cast of characters is good but two characters always have the same moves like link and young link
 the array of levels is quite good
the melee modes are very good
the trophy idea lets you see characters from other games
overall i believe this game was a waste of money but as i said unless you have at least  human players it is pretty dumbthis game was alright
i couldnt get to into it after buying it off here
it allowed me to pass the time away when i had nothing else to doeternal darkness is definitely on the list of over rated games of the game cube
let me show you whygraphics these are easily some of the shoddiest graphics seen on the gamecube this generation
the game was originally developed for the n and released in  and it definitely shows
but the characters are extremely flawed graphically and the entire polish of the game is unquestionably rough
games like super smash brothers melee and metroid prime were released before or right around the same time and are still some of the best looking games around but eternal darkness certainly fails here and its one of the reasons why it loses in the scary factor
sound the sound is terrific
from the voice acting to the various effects this game has it nailed
nuff said
gameplay terrible is the best way to put it
one major focus of this game is exploration but it mainly consists of running by objects and seeing if you can press the b button
placing objects is even more archaic since you constantly have to return to the menu
easily the weakest element of this game is the combat
absolutely horrific
each character gets one decent melee weapon to use and it uses the same aaa button combination attack
the finishing move hardly differs and combat gets old very quickly due to the weak targeting and the lack of enemies
the only enemy you will be fighting is a skeleton in  different colors
mars the entire game
story superb
the story unrolls through  different characters through different time periods
its very engrossing but they should have shortened the number of characters and made it so that the games best ending could be seen in one playthrough
only the most dedicated will sit through  playthroughs of this game
scariness eternal darkness contrary to what many would have you believe really isnt that scary
if skeletons are scary then you might actually be scared
if not youll probably laugh
overall a pretty big disappointment and not worth your time
average i started a new game in eternal darkness sanitys requiem the other day
when this game came out all the reviewers talked about how it was the greatest game ever and how unique and cool and fun it was
and for the first playthrough they are right on
i played through the game with a deliberately low sanity meter just to see all the different insanity effects
and the storyline was complex enough to be interesting through the whole gamebut on the second playthrough
not so great
skip the cutscenes strip away all the insanity effects since youve seen them all several times over by now and youre left with a bland slowpaced and quite linear actionadventure game
for me its way too easy and at times very annoying those stupid trappers keep teleporting me gaaaah
underneath the sanity gimmick this game is seriously lacking in gameplay meat
there are only three different types of enemies which come in  variations each that youll see across the entire  hour playtime and killing them off doesnt take any great strategy  rup a  repeat
i certainly dont have enough interest to play up to the repetitive ending part where you have to backtrack nine 
times
and there is i think one lone unlockable feature beat the game three times over and youre given the ability to play through with unlimited life mana and sanity
whoopeedont get me wrong this game is a trip the first time through
if you havent played it you owe yourself a rental
but its too bad this game doesnt hold up on multiple plays
no other franchise has yet duplicated the sanity meter but the rest of the games mechanics have been refined in a half dozen games since eds releasethe two words i have for this game is that it is too easy
minus that the graphics gameplay and style of the game is great
to relate the game to resident evil is not accurate
the game plays more like a tomb raider with elements of resident evil thrown in
the puzzles in this game are very easy and one is never lost for too long that is a plus and a minus at the same time
where the difficulty comes in is trying to figure out what spells to use and the amount of bad guys attacking you
sometimes this aspect can be overwhelming and if one doesnt save too often they will be doomed to repeat sections many times
the story in this game is pretty good although it has its holes but the movement of the game through time and the ability to play multiple characters is great
the characters play much like they look
your big burly fireman has lots of endurance and can run for a long time your fat architect cant do as much
the game as a whole is a  in my opinion minus the easiness of the puzzles i would give it a  and a halfif you want to play this game a recomend you that first read all the big manual that came with the game and then try to play
its a fun game but you still in the same level by a lot of hoursi bought this game new originally from amazon in  if i remember right and played it for several months
it has a very good economic simulation that allows you to build any type of company
the game is really still playable today although im a bit disappointed that another new edition has not been forthcoming
you may be able to buy the game from a reseller but gog also makes it available for a fair price in digital form
i do not know if amazon offers this game for download because its  years old now
i highly recommend it if you enjoy or want to learn about building a business empireno really i wanted to like this game
honestly everything about it looked cool
but after playing through much of the single and multiplayer i resigned and would not recommend it
this game was over hyped
despite the pretty graphicspray you have a good video card and cpuit still feels like rainbow sixcomplete with stupid ai mindless path finding identical collision detection and cheap physicswhile the enemy ai is clever no doubt your team has an amazing bottomless stupidity
there might be an enemy near me and my team will shoot through me to get him
i once ordered another team to cross the road
they were cut to pieces before they got to the other side
i went to see what was going on only to find a single enemy standing in plain view on the road
even in the very first mission it reached a point when i could not order my other team to advance fifteen feet to the left but what they would be killed with out much of a fight
your team will not run from grenades
literaly i have seen my teams it taken out with a single grenade before i can move them
they see it they yell quotgrenadequot and they stand there and get blown upthese are not single odd events they happened to me regularlythats another thing you have to rely on the map to move your team
they will not take cover move advance fall back or try to out flank their attackers
this is supposed to be realistici thought that imporiving the skills of your charactors was good
until i realised that i had to reload everytime they got shot for the above reasons i had to reload a lot
if i lose a troop i can not replace him and it takes a while to bring a green trooper up to speed
the more i imporved their skills the more time i spent reloadingthe weapon selection is odd
why can you only carry two items
most of what you can take it pointless
extra ammo
even on veteran you have ten mags that i can never spend all of
pistol
why
i have a big rifle with plently of ammo binoculars
why
the scope of the rifle is about the same and the oicw is better
few of these things really amount to anything more than an extra optionwhat happened to the story
yeah there is one but with few real charactors and none of the stylish voice actiing in rainbow six
this feels more like cnn coverage
the breifings serve only to link mission a with mission b i dont expect jrr tolkien story telling in a military shooter but come on a little depth in plot would be niceit is generaly well made but it could not make me care
i am going back to rainbow six i advise you do tooif it just worked dang itghost recon is a tense fps type game with high marks for combat tactics and realisim
the key to playing and winning is quotsee the bad guy firstquot which is easier said than  done
the single player game consists of  missions in which you control  recon soldiers
the idea is to accomplish all of  your mission goals
if you can pull this off no mean feat the game will open quotspecialistquot soldiers that have somewhat better weapons and combat experience stats allowing you to quottakequot them along on your next mission
if you think you know small arms battlefield tactics this game will test you to the maxghost recon could have broken through to the top of the heap for type but unfortunately it is buggy as heck
i have had to do more workarounds and adjustments to my computer in getting the game to run than any other game i have ever played and i play a lot of computer games bytheway
gr was originally scheduled for release after the first of the year however it hit the shelves about three months early to cash in on holiday sales probably and it plays and feels like it  just not quite finished
the developer promises to release a patch around the end of january and that should address most of the quotbugquot issuesdo i recommend it
most certainly however you might want to hold off till after the patch is releasedalthough the concept behind this game was well intentioned the actual gameplay of it is lacking
r fans might have been looking for a change of pace but this is too slow
team members ai is awfulie guarding the levels edge instead of looking to where the rest of the board is
also if you leave a team member in a semisecure spotlike sniping in a doorway sometimes the computer will have him crawl out of it and snipe in the open
there should be more controls for the computer controlled team members like in commandos  or somethinggraphics are really good but they too seem to be d when you get up closeweapons are very weak in this series whereas in the r series you had a ton of selections
hopefully some mods will come out where this can be addresseddownload the demo before you buy this gamei wish i hadi got this game the other day i had looked at it when it first came out and wanted to wait a little time for any bugs to be taken care of
i will come out and say this first the website and updates are great
for a game that is a little quotoldquot the community is great and the fixes and updates are very activethe looks to the game are great
it is a higher end game so if your running anything under  you might not get a real good idea
one thing that does bother me it does get a bit boring to play
yes shooting at stuff and taking out planes or ground targets is fun but after a while getting to where you need to go can be long and very boringthe sounds are great in game i do get a few odd delays but that is far from a complaint
the idea that you can make your own campains and quick missions is great it does add alot to the game
i just think it has fallen a little short of what i was looking fori really dislike negative reviews so will not knock sturmovik but having really tried almost every flight sim on the mkt
and there are many i simply cannot find one as realistic as wwfightersthe graphics and special effects are awesomeif you can find this game you will be amazed at the conrol of the aircraft special effects and the wonderful graphicsten times better than any flight sim availableif you have not tried it you are missing the ultimate
you might locate it at amazoncoms third party sellers as a used itemits simple a wonderful gamei love rogue spear
and if youre here its because you either love rogue spear as well or are interested in learning to love the series
i own rainbow six covert ops and now this is a new addition to my collection
but i am not happy
there is just nothing really new in this game
its really more of the same thing
dont get me wrong this is not a horrible game
it plays well the graphics are decent pretty much identical with rainbow sixrogue spear but nothing improved or ground breakingwhat tends to happen when you have more of the same stuff is you get bored easilyand that i did with this game
i hate to say it but i never even finished this game because i got bored plus i picked up a copy of ghost recon once you go ghost youll never go back
this game never really kept me going
i got to the level where you have to stop the bad guys before they escape on a bus after a couple of trys i just lost interestbottom line  if youve never played any of the rainbow six games and you want to start i highly reccommend you pick up rainbow six rogue spear every level in that game is fun and it has good replay value
im all about quotthe experiencequot when it comes to playing games i strive to have a fun experience but with this game it just wasnt there if anything it felt more like a job
if you own any of the previous series i really dont reccommend this unless you really have to get every game in the series
if anything wait for ravenurban ops was a lot better
the online play addition was nice but thats all this game is really good for
the earlier r games have much better environments and provide a much greater challenge
i think its pretty bad when one can complete this game on the veteran setting in under two hours
on the brighter side the weapons additions are very nice
im not too sure how many are added and they are only available on the multiplayre setting but they are all pretty fun to play around with
it gives a sense of what the enemy is using against youthe concept here was good but poorly executed
i have played a lot of games on the gamecube and usually i resign myself to playing games that have great critical reviews
this title i picked up as a budget title and after a week i sold it
it is fun as a rental but save your money for other purchases
so far nintendos own fzero franchise looks to be heading in a similar gameplay direction as this game
i only hope that fzero for the gamecube turns out better than thisthis game is pretty good but rent it before you buy it
the graphics are very good but some of the courses are easy
also to people that dont often buy racing games i dont recomend it for it might turn you off from that genre
as for racing games get mario kart double dash when it comes out that is a good example of a racing gamedave mirra is an okay game but its the best of all the bmx games
but tony hawk is so much cooler with the phenominal game play that is rarely found in video games
the awkward objectives dont help boost the score either
the graphics are jawdropping but  ive seen better for tony hawk  the extreme sports genre is getting out of control but tony hawk keeps its cool
dave mirras bmx saga is doomed periodi bought the gc for my kids i just play once in a while when they are napping
therefore i only play for an hour at a time  times a week
the complex airial trick are too hard to pull off with having to hit extra buttons and all
i find this game is to hard to learn for non gamers
but other than that it is a well developed piece of softwaregoodthis is one of the greats
what a great game
you will not have more fun playing this game for the first hour
however after that hour has finished you will begin to see the game is really repetitive and kind of ugly
ugly meaning the graphics are dreamcast quality
but who cares
you buy this game as a fun diversion for  minutes at a time not as a long rpg you play for hours on end in the quest for the elfs magical bracelet
if your purpose is fun over a short time
youll love this game
if you want depth and hours of fun look elsewhereaaron shaw reviewer for causual gamerscrazy taxi is nothing more than it seems a simply fun game
there are no real missions no complex plot twists no real story just you and the open roadoh and your customersthe object of the game is to pick up and drop off as many people in as little time as possible often easier said than done
you can choose between four different driver which are different in personality but the same in driving skills
it really makes no difference which one you choose
the controls take a bit of getting used to and unlike most driving games the quotaquot button is not the gas pedal
instead the quotrquot button is the gas and the quotlquot button is the breaksgraphically this is a great game
the city is nicely detailed and there is a wide variety of people places cars and people at large
in the sound department the game also has the edge
the car street and voices are all nicely done and the music suits the game perfectly
what it lacks is variety which means that you will be hearing the offsprings quotall i wantquot twice in the same gamethe flaws in this game come purely from the lack of variety
there is only one city four drivers the same passengers the same four songs played over and over again
there is also no multiplayer mode
the list goes on
but keep in mind that that crazy taxi is not meant to be played for hours on end it is a fun wild and wickedly enjoyable game
i would not recommend it to people who favor long missionbased drivers for them i would recommend quotgrand theft auto quot
for others who just want a bit of fun this is your game
it is fun but will get old fast and is unlikely to have a long life in your video game collectioni like this game it can be fun but i found it got old fast
theres just a couple of tracks and the gameplay is always the same with little to open up what you see is what you get
i disliked how you have to perform the special moves it should be more easy
the music in this first game is pretty good wellsuited youll get tired of it though and driving without music isnt fun
i start to get sick of it after  minutes
the dreamcast version is cheaperits a fairly fun game but im going to have to play it muted
the drivers and the passengers say things constantly like every two seconds and they each only have like five lines so they reapeat themselves about every ten seconds or so
its very annoying
the constant advertising for levis pizza hut kfc and others is disturbing
i cant belive the game designers thought that was acceptable
also the music sucks
i do get some enjoyment out of driving crazy
the first time i played this about  years ago i drove home and hit the garbage corral behind my house driving crazy in the snowafter playing in arcade mode a few times it turned into one of those arcade games that you play when you have nothing better to do and thats exactly what i do with itcrazy taxi was one of my favorite games to play at the arcade
when i heard it was on gamecube i barley got it
the game is still fun to play but it can get old quite easily
all you do is get someone drive them to a location drop them off and that is it
you can do crazy stunts to get more money but that idea isnt too helpful to boost the mood
also there is a cray box a series of minigames some need to be unlocked that steps away from the standard taxi driving but some of them feel impossible to complete as you play
id say you should rent the game for a week or  if you by chance see the game in a game store or anywhere else you can rentpurchase gamesplaying this is essentially as close the films as i can imagine for right now and that is glorious
my fave level is easily hoth
however the plot is told just at screens or in your ship its not so wellwritten
a lot of the levels dont feel too star warsesque i think they should have introduced some sw prequel dogfights into this along with those ships
the codes are really cool you can get all sorts of different ships but they should be easier to input and save so you dont have to do it all the time
i love how the time adjusts ingame to the time that your gamecube has so if youre playing at dusk tatooine is at dusk also and thats great
it makes it seem at least somewhat fresh though they have you do some of the same exact things you did last time out like race wedge through the canyon and some missions are nearly the same as well
voice talent is first rate they got the actual wedge and a reliable mark hamill impersonator
ultimately i feel rs was more interesting more fun just more exciting rs seems like it should be more fun and it isnt quite maybe it was seeing the landscapes of rs being done on the n at any rate some levels are great just like the movies others are made up and its not fun to play the madeup levels or levels from sw books they arent distinct as something from star wars its like playing any other scifi shooter maybe character interaction is key
i prefer to do what ive seen done in the films maybe those few fights should have been concentrated on given a few levels based on one scene so the graphics could be even better and the gameplay could be more epic
id love to play the clone war in rs maybe rogues werent really around back then but they could work around it
anyway parts couldve been changed made less mathematical but its still a pretty decent thrillim afraid im in the minority on this game
while the graphics and sound are dazzling and story is true to the star wars universe this game was a big disappointment to me
simply put i found it to be ridiculously hard
which leads to replaying a mission level over and over
after awhile that simply becomes frustrating and takes the fun completely out of it
most of the missions are broken into submissions with cutscenes in between
essentially youre given  chances to complete a mission and once youve lost  ships its back to the beginning to start the whole thing over
there are no save points at the end of the submissions
after playing the same submission over and over only to die later in the same level the game quickly loses its appeal
of course the other factor is time
not only are you battling enemies youre also battling the clock
so even when you dont die you often fail because of time constraintsi readily admit that my skill level is below that of many gamers and as you can see most people like this game
a save at any point feature would have gone a long way towards enhancing my game experience but unfortunately it wasnt designed that way
if youre considering purchasing this game and if youre not a hardcore gamer you might want to rent it and see if its for you before plunking down yes folks the graphics are as good as everyone says
but other than that its the same game that was on the n
sure the mission and storyline is somewhat different but its still remarkably similar
if youve played the first one then id recommend renting this before you buy itokay why am i not surprised
i mean there are more star wars games out there then there are mario games
is that bad you ask
well no actually and this game is perfectly fine and fun but wellall the star wars games are kinda the same thing
i mean think about it if youre not playing someone on the ground with a light saber or a gun then your in the sky pioleting some wellship
i wish lucusarts would slow down with the star wars games and bring us more original games like monkey islandliked it but it wasnt my thing
i preferred the star fox assault
its more amusing in my opinion even though im not super fond of the person shooter part of the gamethe game is good and all the rating is due to personal taste
i did do about  of the missions or sowhen i purchased my gamecube on december st  theyre were tons of launch titles that excited me into buying the gamecube instead of the playstation  star wars rogue leader rogue squadron ii was one of them
i saw videos on online gaming sites and it blew me away
the amazing sound the outofthisworld graphicsi wasnt able to choose a game to buy when i bought my gamecube but i recieved tony hawks pro skater  as a gift
after i beat tony hawks pro skater  i got bored and i decided to get star wars over super smash bros melee
boy did i make a mistakewhen you start rogue leader you are greeted by little men in white costumes dancing to the lucasart icon
as soon as you start you see a xwing blast through the screen and you see the amazing animation and explosion graphics
i was impressed
the menus are cool and show clips of episode   and when i started playing i showed of the graphics and what the gamecube hardware was able to pull off
i kept playing and playing
i wondered what i did wrong but it was impossible for a person who hasnt play rogue squadron for nintendo  to complete the first level
my cousin has rogue squadron for nintendo  and we thought that it was really hard
rogue squadron is laughable compared to rogue leader
i havent played rogue squadron for a while
i couldnt believe it but it took me over an hour to complete the first level with a bronze medal
even on easy mode it still is impossible to beatwhen i play a game as hard as star wars rogue leader rogue squadron ii i go to cheat sites to help me with my gameplay
i found cheat codes for infinite lives and health i still couldnt beat some levels
i think this game is only made for people who were able to complete every level in rogue squadron for nintendo  with gold medalseven though tony hawks pro skater  was my first game and i beat it so many times i still go back and play it for old times sake
i even hooked up my playstation and played tony hawk  i once went back and started playing star wars rogue leader rogue squadron ii and honestly i couldnt play it for more than a halfhour
a game like this really gets me frustrated
out of the  games i own which are tony hawks pro skater  star wars super smash bros melee nba street james bond  agent under fire and aggressive inline i couldnt say without a doubt star wars was the one that got the least time under the hood of my gamecubewell i would only recommend it to star wars enthusiasts this is a good game at heart
you definitely need a gameshark to beat this game
i gave individual ratings belowgraphics sound control tilt replay value difficulty lasting appeal rogue leader is very much like rogue squadronso much so that the title rogue leader rogue squadron  might have been more appropriate
true the graphics are most definitely better quite possibly the most impressive graphics yet seen on a console but the gameplay just feels archaic and stale
how many times do i have to trip up atats with tow cables
didnt i already do this in shadows of the empire and rogue 
theres just really nothing new here and the repetitive dieandretry gameplay really gets oldyou see rogue leader is one of those games where in order to advance you have to do everything exactly like the designers intended you to
everything is scripted and you have to go along with the script line for line and word for word
any deviations will be met with an immediate game over screen
i would have liked a game with a branching mission structureas seen in games like wing commander and colony wars
for instance if i fail to protect a frigate then the game still keeps going but the missions will progress down a different path than they would had the frigate surviveda branching path system would have given the game much more replay value as well
im sorry but the medal system in these starwars games just seems like a cheap gimmick to try to increase the longevity of an otherwise very short game
who wants to replay the same level  timestrying to achieve perfectionjust so you can get a medal to unlock a new ship or secret level
this just doesnt appeal to me and if you dont replay the game to get these medals then rogue leader is very very short
with just  missions youll probably complete the game in  hoursi have a couple other minor complaints
one is the feature which automatically realigns your craft with whatever they decide should be up and down for that level
this is space there is no up and down
it can be extremely aggravating when youre on the tail of a couple of ties and then your xwing decides to realign itself causing you to lose sight of them
which brings up my other complaint why cant you lock onto anything
why arent there arrows which point to your target as there are in nearly every other spaceshooter
the only targeting information your given is a targeting computer just like the ones in the movies which comes down and overlays the screen
you have to hold the y button in order for it to stay
this can be quite awkward at timesespecially when you need to fire a torpedo
it really doesnt help you all that much anyway
it just makes all the enemy targets glow brightly so theyre easier to spotgraphics and sound are pretty much the best features of rogue leader
the graphics are quite stunning with bumpmapping reflections and just about every other bell and whistle you could want
and its a starwars game so of course it has great soundi guess i just want rogue leader to be something it really isnt trying to be
starwars fans who enjoyed rogue  and the starfighter games and who want more of the same simple arcade experience and those who care about nothing but graphics will probably find a lot to like in rogue leader
me i want something new
i want something deeper
purdy graphics slapped on the same tired repetitive game just dont cut it for mesound    its a starwars game so of course the sound is greatgraphics   quite possibly the most advanced graphics ever seencontrols    the realign feature and the lack of lockontargets is annoying but other than that everythings finegameplay    same old tired repetitive gameplay as all the other recent starwars spaceshootersfinal score  
if youve enjoyed all the previous starwars spaceshooters and want some more then youll probably enjoy rogue leader
i just wish the series would evolveits one of the better star wars titles but thats not saying much
it has sleek graphics somewhat entertaining gameplay with easy to get used to controlls
if you like star wars games then you might want to try this one
other than that its nothing groundbreaking and if anything its more of the sameunfortunately i was one of those idiots who bought gamecube over ps
i bought ssbm rogue leader thps spy hunter and cel damage
i will tell you about star wars rogue leader rogue squadron ii in this review
this game is great
well it is until you get to some missions where they they dont even tell you how to use your weapons and what the objectives are
some people call this a strategy game
i call it a piece of garbage game
it could really use a two player mode
missions like raid on bespin are almost impossible
unless you are really good at these types of games save your moneyevery time u die u must watch a  min
movie
gamecube rulez peacethis game would just be so much better if it had multiplayer in it
i know going  player would probably be near impossible but  player would have been doable with both a coop feature as well as a headtohead combatas a one player game this is a very good game id recommend it to anyone who really like star wars but the lack of a  player option just sort of kills it for mesuper monkey ball might turn some people off because of the fact that you roll through level after level as a monkey living inside a ball
the object of the game requires you to roll around the levels going from one place to the other
this can actually make you nauseous in the same way for example that the minnesota twins were beaten by the oakland as to advance to the next round of the playoffssuper monkey ball gets its fair share of complaints for containing too many ripoffs of standard platform games
its true the game is very much like a d donkey kong or kirby but you shouldnt dismiss the game until you try it at least
it will satisfy you probablythis is one of those games where everybody gets all hyped up about it because it is one of the first launch games for a system
dont get me wrong this is a good game but i think that if this game out later down the road when there where more of a selection nobody would even think of purchasing this game
the one player mode is entertaining for about and hour
multiplayer is the major strongpoint of this game
so if you dont have many friends u may not want this game
also another thing i dont like about this game is that it takes no skill what so ever
your  year old cousin could beat you on this game
personally i dont like games like that but if u do then this is a good game for u sega did a good job on this game but i think that they should be doing better things with thier time then games like this and we wonder why they dont make systems anymorethis is a rather strange game
you control a monkey in a hamster ball a complete various tasks such as roll yourself as a bolling ball fly thru the air or try to complete coarses while earning bananas
the downside is there really isnt any plot and player can get boring pretty fast
though if you have a friend or two and an extra controller this game can dish out hours of funalthough super monkey ball might not be the most complex of games available it certainly can be very engaging
for those of you who dont know about this game it basically involves moving a floor to make a monkey in a clear plastic ball move to a goal
the three levels of play for the singleplayer main game are beginner advanced and expert
beginner and advanced are both fairly easy but when you get to the later levels in expert you had better be willing to devote a few hours to beating them
if navigating a d puzzle isnt your thing you can choose to play any one of six mini or party games including billiards minigolf bowling fight race or target
the first three games are pretty straightforward and can be played with up to two people
the latter three are capable of being played with up to four people
while playing fight you command a monkey with a boxing glove attached to the ball and you try to knock other monkeys with boxing gloves off a platform
race needs no explanation and target makes you launch your monkey off a ramp and then try to glide over the ocean to targets
the problem with super monkey ball is that the game hardly ever has the correct difficulty level almost always being either too hard or too easy
so far most of my time has been spent playing the minigames
if youre a big party or puzzle gamer then super monkey ball is for you
if not i would recommend a rental first as super monkey ball is a very quirky game with a certain taste needed to enjoy itthis game came highly recommended to me and got good reviews but i have to say that this is one of the most infuriating games ive ever played
yes  of the  minigames that are initially unlocked are fun but to get the other  mini games you have to play the main game and the main game is infuriatingly not fun
actually the first  or  levels or so are pretty fun but then it rapidly and painfully gets difficult
its a lot like marble madness except for the fun part
a key difference between the way marble madness worked and the way this works is that in marble madness if you fell off an edge you lost time but were placed roughly back where you were before you fell off
in super monkey ball if you fall off you have to start the level entirely over again
combine that with levels involving balance beam precision and what you end up with just isnt funi made it through the easy levels but decided id had enough only a short way into the medium difficulty levels
an hour into it and i was only less than halfway to unlocking one mini game
its just not worth it
my advice would be to only buy this game if you have an action replay to unlock all the mini games right away or if you have friendsfamily who have a save with all the mini games unlocked that you can copy to your memory card
the mini games are fun and smb should have been entirely mini gameswhen i got my cube this was the first game i got
i started playing it and i got bored in about  hours
the game is very repitative you have to move the floor so the monkey trapped inside the ball moves and get bananas
pretty boring
except multiplayer mode which it can be the most addictive game for four players
check below the good and bad things about itthe good thingsawesome multiplayercool charactersnice graphics and soundchallenginguniquethe bad thingscan get boringnot fun for one playersame thing over and over againoverall this game is worth buying if you are a marble madness fan for nes or enjoy muliplayer funin my opinion a more advanced system than that of xbox or playstation  however its downfall was the lack of interesting titles
it seems nintendo simply put it out there and then forgot to make a decent library of games for it
i have lost faith in nintendo
supernintendo was the last great effort that nintendo made
now we are onto ps and xbox  so i would not recommend this system to anyone at this timei got the gamecube in christmas  i had fun with it and it was fun to have games like thps then my friend said that the gc is gay and told me to trade it in for a xbox or ps i didnt listen and was proud to have a gc
now i want to get a ps because i realized it is the most popular console and i want to be part of the ps owners groupall the brainiacs are trying to convince u to buy a gamecube over a ps becuase of its high simultaneous textures and polygon performance and stuff i dont know and i dont care wat those things are
an xbox might have better graphics and gamecube might have a better controller  the l and r buttons are comfy  but the ps console has wat those  consoles dont have and wont have
games
xbox owners make me sick by talking about the holy game halo
big wup
 good game thats not on the ps
well guess wat ps has gta gran turismo takken seriesand tons of other games that arent on gamecube or xbox
and people keep talking about gta for xbox and gamecube r u insane
gta will come out for those  consoles when gta vice city arives for ps
gta  even though its the best game i have ever played is gonna be old new since its sequel is supposedly betterso far i was ragging on the xbox
the gamecube isnt bad accept for its games
mario is old news and nintendo should stop
all the games are cartoons and are great for ages buy an xbox if ur hands are as twice as big as a softball if u care about polygonpartucilur memory and stuff yes i did make that up and if u like waiting  minutes for games to load and like when ur games crashbuy a gamecube if u dont want to spend so much on a ps if ur about  years oldbuy a ps if u like all sorts of gamesthe gamecube is a fine console but there arent enough titles to make it really worth owning
the only worthwhile titles for gamecube that you cant get for the other consoles are the mario games the zelda games and pikminwell the mario games so far for gamecube quotluigis mansionquot quotsuper mario sunshinequot quotmario party quot quotmario party quot and quotmario kart double dashquot dont add much to the franchise truthfully
the party games have more minigames but they still get old quickly
quotdouble dashquot adds nothing of real use  you could always drive and throw things at the same time who really cares that now its separate characters doing the two things
and quotsunshinequot is one of the most overrated games everthe lone zelda title for gamecube quotthe wind wakerquot was an ok entry in that series but nowhere near as good as its best quota link to the pastquot for snes and quotocarina of timequot for nquotpikminquot is a really innovative cute and entertaining if frustrating game
but worth buying a console for
not reallypractically all of the other worthwhile games for gamecube are also available for xbox and ps quotssx trickyquot quotssx quot the simpsons games quotgauntlet dark legacyquot quotbaldurs gate dark alliancequot etc
in addition there are lots of games worth playing that are not available on nintendo like the grand theft auto games and many other adultskewing titlesthis was the first of the new consoles that i bought
i wish i had gone with a ps which i eventually bought anyway
the siren song of zelda lured me to nintendo but in the end unless youre buying the system for a young child youre better off with ps or xboxits a great system that i use to play all the time when i was a little girl back theni own a nintendo gamecube in indigo and it doesnt compare to playstation  or xbox
nintendo has really gone downhill since this system but they have brought themselves back up again with the nintendo ds
this has pretty good graphics but playstation s and xboxs graphics are way better
some things i really like about this console is that it is very small
it even has a handle which is very easy for carrying
the fan is really nice too
this is one of the only systems that doesnt overheat if you leave it on for a day or so
the controllers are okay and pretty comfortable and they are pretty cheap now
the wavebird is really cool because nintendo makes it and playstation  and xbox have wireless controllers but they are made by wierd providers
i do like some of the games like soul calibur  and i also like super smash bros melee

i have owned at one time or another many of the the nintendo sony and microsoft consoles and love them all equally
after selling my cube recently to get a wii i recollected my memories of the cube and pondered over whether it was a good investmentthe answer i found was a hesitated yesheres whygamesthere are about a dozen really good ones but overall there is nothing special at all about the cube game library
unfortunately nintendo had no third party support because of its special discs and development kits that were much harder to program than a ps or xbox game
that was a huge mistake for nintendo bacause it is very unlikely that a console can be successful without third party support
but when you do find one of the few rare jems then the cube really shines
examples of these would be super smash bros melee
mario sunshine kiddie but fun resident evil  mario strikers sleeper hit that was suprisingly violent zelda windwaker twilight princess
metroid prime
tales of symphonia
timesplitters  mario tennis
paper mario
mario kart
pikmin these games while mostly kiddie though a few are very violent are some of the most fun you can have on a console of the gcpsxb generation
these games alone make it worthy of a purchase but maybe not strong enough to stand against the quantity of great games on other consolesdesignthis referes to only the design of the system and the controller
this is mostly a failure on nintendos part due to a couple key mistakes
first of all the standard gamecube is purple
it is also a cube
both these factors make looking at the gamecube extremely hard on the eyes and those looking for a sleek addition to their home theaters will be extremely disappointed
but the interface of the system is wonderfully easy and the inclusion of four controller ports made party games easy and funbut another mistake was the the disign of the controller
first there is the rediculous abxy setup which makes the a button too big the b button too small and the x and y buttons positioned so akwardly that playing games becomes a chore
the c stick is also a chore to use because it is an unresponsive nub of a stick that would have greatly benefited by becoming a full analog stick like the main one on the left
the shoulder buttons could have also used a second set of triggers instead of the completely useless z button
but the controller is easy to get used to and the big a button does mean simpler mechanics for simpler games
but considering the other two consoles had very similar controllers this akward controller made porting games over to that cube increadibly wonky and undesireablehardwareim not going to go into details but the cubes hardware is generally good and graphics can almost compete with the xbox almost
gamecube games also put you through much less loading times
the cube is also very reliable and you will rarely if ever suffer through a crash
cube discs did not allow developers to do as much as a ps or xbox disc but they work and there is not much to get offended by here
no online play is a big letdown but the party games on the system almost made up for that as far as multiplayer goes
dvd functionality is somewhat of a letdown as well but dvd is really not very important when almost every other elecronic device can play dvds
the lack of dvd support did not hurt the quality of games so in the end who really carespriceorigionally   less than the competitiondropped to  a few years later much less than competitionyou can now find them under  still much lees than competitionnuff saidoverallthe cube is not nintendos best effort and im sure we will see much better from them in the future
but this is still a fun system to play with and still has great value
considering it is much cheaper than all the other consoles it amounts to much less than its competition but much more than failure
that is why i give it an overall  out of i must say that gamecube is doing quite well for now with what its got coupled with the fact that everybody knows and loves the nintendo exclusive titles that most grew up with mario bros series donkey kong zelda series
my only reason for getting one this christmas is the bonus zelda disc though
it contains demos and other zelda games but personally i need my fix on the origional legend of zelda
updated graphics and bit sound
i am so therehowever beyond mario and zelda if your just looking for your best longterm investment keep looking
nintendo plans to halt the manufacturing of gc games come christmas according to gmr magazine
that is the true reason for the drastic price cut free games and constant tv adszelda metroid super smash bros melee super monkey ball and more
sounds like a long varied list of interesting games and it is by and large
but look beyond the firsttier lineup and nintendos software schedule begins to look somewhat bleak
thats the gamecubes biggest weakness
if you dont buy more than five games a year then you might be satisfied with the lineup thats available but if youre always hungry for something new the gamecubes probably not for youwhile the system is stripped down to a certain degree  it only plays games  what it does it does reasonably well
the graphics are sharp the first party titles are uniformly excellent and the flexibility of four controller ports and a slew of party games make the gamecube the multiplayer game box to own if youve got friends over for gameshowever having played every console out there the biggest hardware problem for me is the gamecubes controller
with an unconventional button layout and missing some features from the competitors controllers the unique gamecube controller makes games that arent native to the gc somewhat difficult to control
because the gc has the fewest number of buttons and no analog stick click functionality games that maximize the use of the ps and xbox controllers never survive the porting process intact
the size of the controller itself can also be problematic
i dont have huge hands but after an hour or two the size of the gcs controller makes for an uncomfortable gaming experience
its a shame too because the analog stick is the best analog stick availablethe gamecube as a primary console isnt a bad bet
it has some really stellar first party titles and a reasonably varied list of third party titles to fill the void
but if youre looking for a constant influx of new content youll find more varied libraries on the ps or xbox and the gamecubes online experience is a pale shadow of the excellent live service on the xboxas a secondary console just know what youre getting into
virtually every port will be better on another console due to the superior graphics of the xbox or the more flexible controller sony offers
youll need a gc to experience a masterpiece like metroid prime and as long as you know that the nintendo first party titles are relatively few and far between itll give you an excellent gaming experienceyeah i wished for a nintendo gamecube
and i got what i wished for
too bad it wasnt mint condition
it had light scratches and what seemed like mustard and ketchup stains i was not enthusiastic about cleaning it  i thought it was common sense to ship clean items
guess my love of pokemon will keep me from holding any grudges lol  its the best legendary video game console everthe gamecube is a good system i will give it thatwhich is why i own one
however the games are horrible save for a few select hits metroid prime zelda the wind waker fzero gx super smash bros melee and a few others
the reason i am giving this system  stars is not necessarily because of the system itself although it doesnt have a dvd player but because nintendo needs to get it together
i am sick of reading about the next disney party game or tonka truck game
i want more first person shooters more stealth more quality exclusively for gamecube
the graphics are great very smooth fluid and rounded off where it needs to be not as good as xbox but a good deal better then ps
the games come nowhere close as i just said the control does not have as many buttons making games much simpler and less intriguing
it is cheaper however the main reason i bought it
i would take and xbox over this but not a psthis kind of gc memory is becoming obsolete because of som many other bigger and sometimes cheaper ways i reccomend to buy one of the newer times  or  cardsthe nintendo gamecube memory card  it is definitely a good memory card dont get me wrong but this card could definitely be improved
it is fairly small and fits into the memory card slot a or b in your nintendo gamecube
you could easily take this card over to a friends house to play with your saved game it fits in anyones pocket very wellthe only major problem with this memory card is that it lacks a lot of major space
a typical game save can be between three to ten blocks but some take many more especially if you want to do a season on a sports game
one game allstar baseball  takes over two hundred blocks to save a season
this is ridiculous
there is one thirdparty brand memory card that offers over one thousand blocks of memory space and it is only double the price of the ordinary gamecube memory cardone thing about this memory card however is that it never fails
never have i had any trouble with any of my memory cards
they have never cause any trouble freezing a game or messing up my gamecube in any waythe dilemma of the memory card space will soon be solved with a firstparty memory card coming soon with two hundred and fifty one  blocks of space
the gamecube memory card  will be much easier to save your games onoverall this memory card is good but not great
it needs improvement which it will get at some point in the next few monthsmark williamsthe memory card does its job but has limited space
some games require less than  blocks and so several can fit on one card
its nice to store a single card with each game disc but that can become expensive essentially adding  to each game titlein the case of madden  you use a full card if you want to save a season plus you need additional blocks to save any settings or user information
simply unless you want to reenter information you need  cards for madden aloneit would be nice to see the cards drop to a more reasonable rate of around  bucks per  blocks of memory and i wait anxiously for a card that holds megablocks of memory or an adapter to utilize flash memoryi have only encountered one off brand gamecube memory card and it only saves you about  dollars in cost has no more memory and doesnt fit into the storage case memory card holder because it is longer than the nintendo branded cardtheres not much to say about a memory card
it saves games saves changes in your gamecube also in the calendar i like its design its really little
it had to be because the slots for memory cards at the gamecube are little
the bad thing about it is that it doesnt have too much memory
in my case with three games the memory from the memory card was over but its not that bad
and you cant play games without it the memory card is very usefulwe logged in countless amounts of time sweat tears and blood into that game
animal crossing and super smash bros were loved also
mario kart double dash was good for multiplayeroverall its not that hard to use but i agree the z button is kinda hard to reach at times
the layout isnt perfect but its better than some say starsthis controller fits like a glovea really tight one
i am  and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time
the z trigger is in a worthless spot and its not easy to use at all which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay
the analog is in the right place this time thank god but whats with the c analog
why cant i just use the the l and r triggers to move the camra
plus why cant i push the a button
i swear
regardless how big that button is i cant use it right to save my life and when playing a video game that could be a bad thingdont even ask me what well ever need the dpad for i dont know
the only reason im giving this  stars is because i like the black color on it
otherwise i dont recomend
nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers n anyone
 and this one is no differentalthough it might be a little difficult to tell just by looking at a picture of it this controller is basically a horribly deformed ps controller
sure the buttons are different shapes and sizes but they are in vitually the same positions and the controller itself is almost the exact same size shape and weightthe good thing about the controller is that nintendo seems to have made a slight advantage over the ps controller in that it adapts to different hand sizes
this is done with more narrow and slightly longer grips and bigger l amp r buttonsbut that doesnt exuse the bad
im almost positive that the joystick and the dirrectional buttons were switched between the ps and the gamecube controller so that the gamecube controller looks less like the ps
thats all well and fine except that it makes the right and down dirrectional buttons almost impossible to reachwith a joystick in the lower position it is much easier because your thumb pushes away the center of the control but with buttons you have to reach all the way over
which even for my larger hands is somewhat difficult and definately awkwardall in all the gamecube controller has its advntages and disadvantages
it is more quotcontrollerquot looking than the strange shaped n controller and looks like it will wear out less than its n brother which breaks down and essentially becomes useless after  months of any type of use
but i sometimes prefer the dirrectional buttons when playing a game especially games with special moves like tony hawk and this controller makes that a little difficultokay we all know that nintendo has had a long history of consoles and controllers
but they really messed up this time
it is way too small
the console itself is the best on the market except for dreamcast but the controller is the one and only reason that i dont have a gamecube
i gave this controller  stars because it is wellmade and and it looks great
however some of the buttons on this controller are very hard to reach z button
it is so far out of reach of the nearest finger that i didnt notice it until i examined the controller very closely
unless you have monkeyfingers i bet you will have trouble reaching it too
in conclusioncomfort button positions quality size basicially what i am trying to get to is that this is a good controller that is a couple  of sizes too small for my handsthere is very little different between madden  and madden  for the ps
theyve added various game plays such as the  minute drill a lot of fun
and situation and the animations are improved
wide receivers actually catch the ball without spinning around
the createateam feature in franchise mode is fun but overall theres not a lot different or innovative in this latest edition of the madden seriesthat said its still the best nfl game available for the ps in my opinion
the animations the gameplay and the franchise mode are unmatchedoverall this is a much better game than nfl k but i sure wish that ea would quit resting on their laurelsgamecube is an awsome system
i love it and wish i owned one for games like melee sunshine and animal crossing
but for sports titles im sorry to say its rediculous
and for madden its below rediculousreasons everyone knows the true joy of playing sports on a video game now a days is franchise mode
signing free agents drafting holding a team together or trying to repeat back to back
thats what make sports games fun
problem with gamecubes version of football a franchise takes up a whole memory card
sorry nintendo but you need some sort of built in memory for sports titles
as franchises and dynastys get yay longer and longer already some are  seasons its gonna take more memory to support it
 memory card now  for the  edition  for the  version etc  were not made of money nintendo
we only have enough cash for a few memory cards
the controller
i love the gamecube controller for games like mario zelda melee animal crossing pikmin
unfortunantly gamecube contreller  sports titles  no nonintendo made a great controller for those types of games but not for sports titles
not enough buttons for  to  receivers a boost button and a pump fake
not to mention the bounce back affect of the triggers
this is not a controller for sports games and definantly not football
people always whine about how many buttons xbox and ps have
in this case the buttons were well needed
sports titles need buttonsthose two reasons are cridicle to buying madden or gamecube
it just doesnt work
maybe if they make a special controller but until then i cant imagine a good game of football on a gamecube
sorry nintendo this is not your strengthgo for xbox if your a sports fan
i want to play nba football baseball and all of those take memory
xbox has it built in not to mention a great controller for it and slightly beter graphics
xbox even has some decnt games coming out tru fantasy online blinx the timesweeper halo  medal of honor frontline even gta is rumored to be soon on its way to xboxi hope you see my point when i talk about madden  gamecube  impossible
its great for other games but maddenthis game is very old now days and the very old bugs still remain where the enemy has x ray vision and can spot you even if your behind a hill or a pretty good ways off
its annoying and i have resorted to using cheats for the game to make it more fun yet somewhat still challengingi just picked this game up on a whim for pennies and while it has its fun moments and looks fairly good graphically it wasnt really worth much more than i paid for itessentially you have  playable charachters with slightly different abilities better at sneakingsnipingmedicaletc to choose from you choose  per mission and can control each of the  one at a time in a first or third person view
while you control one the computer controls the others and this can be both good the computer can see so much better than you or bad little to no ai
the weapons are authentic enough for this type of game and everything looks really good
however even with the graphics pushed all the way to the max you still find yoruself repeating the levels enough times to memorize exactly where every enemy is located because you just cant seem to spot them
regardless of how slow you walk whether you are upright or prone etc you will usually be spotted by the enemy before you can spot them and be put down in short order
frankly i just got tired of dying so put the game away after only  levelsi bought this game because it featured characters from the romance of the three kingdoms series
that and the fact that it was cheap
i got it on sale because it was used
sometimes when i buy used games i take a moment and wonder why the individual sold it
i may never know for certain why the previous owner sold it but i think it may have something to do with the characters
all the characters look kinda i dont know off
it was like the designers wanted the characters to stand out and they do but not in a good way
zhang liao is wearing antlers on his head for goodness sake
zhou yu looks like a character from a mercedes lackey novel
why does liu bei not have a beard
why is he clean shaven
why does he keep whining about diao chan
zhang fei is a drunken bufoon
also the voice acting is pretty weird with some hilariously bad lip synching
watch zhao yun in particularbut enough about the characters
lets move on to the gameplay
this game is somewhere between dynasty tactics and dynasty warriors
there is some action involved
you basically ride around on your horse whacking people upside the head with your weapon and occasionally you use special attacks that wipe out a whole bunch of people at once
the strategy isnt very deep
you basically have to find the quickest way to get your army to the enemys commander and defeat him
its too bad that you cant decide who to attack and when although you sometimesare allowed to choose between targets
probably the best thing about this game are the cinematics
it is fun to unlock the various movies and what not
but the biggest downer is that you cant play as sun quan
as one of the rulers of the three kingdoms you would have though they could find a place in the story for him but he only has a small role to play
think of all the potential that was missed
there could have been a scenario involving sun quan having to get zhou yu to stop hanging out with firesong so he could plan out a decent strategy and if you didnt understand that one then i envy youkessen  isnt really another fantastic reason to own a ps
it does continue akin to its predecessor by presenting another immense oriental military simulator
by allowing interacting in an amazingly impressive cinematic video game experience you personally will absorb the epic drenched melodrama of this games tale
however despite a fantastically labored frame rate finely portrayed graphics and an amazing initial dramatic draw kessen  reduces the gamers options and responsibilities in the game itself
instead of being able to decide between a halfdozen different battle strategies or concocting one yourself you are now derailed to choose between three different strategies per battle
though you still can personalize your strategy once the battle has begun the comprehensive personalized hardcore catering of the original game is sorely missedwith many more abundantly optioned and dramatically more captivating upcoming p games than kessen s admittingly intense action progressively interesting gameplay and unfortunately limited experimentation
kessen  is only recommended for genre extremists
with a woefully inane ensemble of supporting characters and blatantly monotonous gameplay in its battle sequences kessen  sustains a market only for those into koeis previous military strategies or for those who enjoy camp with their gameplay or for those willing to play a game with no replayabilityit is better than the first and you are more involved but i have to say that in the cut scenes it is over acted and once you beat the game it loses its enjoyment
this game has really cool parts to it there are different abilities each lead warrior has
for instances charge ability lets you charge through the enemy effortlessly fire storm sends a hail of fire down on the enemy
there are alot of spells that i wouldnt have the time to list on here
one cool thing about the game is being able to control the leader of one of your arms and going through and hacking up guys all in all i would say the game is worth  i wouldnt spend more than that on the game though
it isnt worth it it could have been better
it almost seems like koei was just creating a game just for the heck of itthe game is visually very appealing one of the best among playstation  games but it has a very steep learning curve
you need to have a lot of patience to learn how to play it
it is not something you can pick up and get to it right away
the chinese names of all the characters probably didnt help eitheri got kessen  for christmas a long time ago around when it came out
since then it has kept me entertained
i dont play this game constantly every once in a while ill see it in my gaming library and decide to pick it up again
after you beat the game as lui bei you can play through as cao cao and select the difficulty level for either campaign
this gives the game some replay value
yet i dont feel that i need to think that much with this game
i just pick one of the battle plans and follow it
and bassically units trimuph in battle because of the commander using a special ability that can cut a unit in half in  seconds
yet there is some thinking involved
lately ive reliazed that calvary advances faster than foot soliders and that certain types of troops do better against certain other kinds of troops
so there is a little depth here but not much
but why three stars
even though it has those features that i just listed its still very simplistic
if they had made it a little more satergy based i would have give it five stars but its not
so if you want a game that will keep you entertained for a long time check out kessen  excuse me i have to go conquer chinaim looking for some swampweed  is the only grown up thing you can do here
the nakedness and sexual content is removedfor owr tender and impressionable american eyes
this has some violence but no blood
a child needs to see the ugly side not to do it atari is stupid
however there are edits you can do to remove the undergarments of women or some such
you didnt hear it here
that said
it is still fun
you can do drugs as in part ii and you can peddle themin fact you have to to get dough at first
you are a prisoner so why in heckother word not
thier is a serious bug when you near the magic domefeild you will not die the game will crash and it will blotch it up permantlyas in re install
if you dont wish to waste time on this gameas in story continuety dont
part ii has good ref to this and playing this is not nessasary to fully understand the ii story linethis game is a good openended roleplaying game
it has great graphics and the world has a very real feeling but it is marred by a few flaws
first since the game was translated from german at times the manual appears to be written by a juniorhigh age gamer
for example the actual manual description of the sleep spell iszzzzzzzzz
instead of telling how the game works the manual spends half its space giving little hints on how to survive
while this is useful it would be better if told to you during the game
however my biggest gripe about the game is the controls
the game basically uses the direction buttons the mouse and the control key
there are a few other keys that are used but by and large to do something you hold control and press up
if you hold control and press left in front of a chest youll try to pick the lock
the game doesnt tell you how to do that you just have to figure it out
the manual leaves a lot of things out
for example i was trying to buy one thing from a merchant but i could only buy ten of them unless there were eleven of them in which case i could select ten items then the last one then send ten items back leaving one for me to purchase
it should not be that difficult to buy one item from a merchant in an otherwise realisticintuitive game
i dont like learning this game via trialanderror because decisions you make will permanently alter what is going on in the game
for example i challenged a person to a duel not to the death in one arena he beat me unconscious took my money and refused to ever fight me again
none of this was explained to me before i challenged him
this is an allegory for this game  you make one mistake because the game and manual didnt warn you and the game holds it against you for the rest of the gamethis is not a bad game it just doesnt play as smoothly or intuitively as morrowind and so im playing morrowind and not gothic
if your computer can handly it i strongly reccommend morrowindgraphically this game is similar to morrowind and in many respects i would presume if you like morrowind but want a story and purpose to your rpg this might work for you
its certainly not a bad game but its tryingthe issue in gothic is the incredibly bad impute control system
although the keyboard buttons are editable all controls on this game require two buttons simultaneously
now i ask did the people that designed the game actually ever try to play it
heres the thing do you want to pick something up pres f hold then w
do you want to fight
press left then either qweas or d yes swinging your sword must be done by moving your character which will quite often result in you running headfirst into the enemy and dyingi just died because i couldnt figure out which two buttons allowed me to climb down a ladder
talk about frustrating
all i want is a simpler interface to make this a good solid gameas it is gothic is a nicelooking goodsounding expansive rpg in which your choices matter and you have lots of quest to complete but theres no autosave and the controls are not customizable enough
that sucks it had potentialif you havent played any other rpg this would be really awesome but since im sure you played atleast elder scrolls iv oblivion this game will kinda suckgraphics there kinda like tomb raider  graphics really boxy but i would have looked over all that if the story wasnt soo boring in the first chapter
but i guess after that it was kinda coolmusic theres barely any music
and the music that is there isnt cool its dullstory it is so boring the main quest is so pain stakingly slow that i had to use cheats to freakin beat the game
i couldnt take the boringness
but after a few chapters in i kinda started to like the story if you get past the first chapter which takes like  hours
the story gets rather interestingreplay value its kinda ok i mean i only played it  time so i wouldnt know but i didnt have any trouble with it throughout the whole gamegameplay oh man this is the icing on the dodo cake its terrible
to even pick up an item you have to push  buttons and to talk to someone you have to push shift and hold down the direction arrow of the character you want to talk to and then press space
and the worst of all i know you can change the controls but when you do the game goes nutsand up is down
even if you try to change one control
the whole game i had to leave it on the default controls when your fighting anything you have to be  freakin inch away from them before you can even do damage
so when your attacking something your basically giving them the pleasure of killing you
x i know you can use bows but to shoot one freakin arrow you have to push  buttons
and thats only if you figure out how the heck to get the dam thing equiped
and the thing about spells you can only cast them one time with scrolls
though you can get scroll runes that allow you unlimited spell casting for that perticular spell but there extremely hard to find
and you cant buy them anywhere
if you want to play an awesome rpg that has a good story great graphics and really easy gameplay dont get this i recommend getting either the witcher titan quest spellforce or even two worlds
anything is better than thisps
if you still dont believe me i think if you want to buy it you should know that it works on vista but not on bit versions but im tellin yayour making a mistake  dont get it get something consideribly better
but if you insist on getting it i recommend that you check out a demo version you can download them for free and most of them let you go through the first  chapters
just enough time to prove to you that it sucksi have played this game extensively since purchasing it last spring
the historical accuracy is both its greatest strength and weaknessit is a strength because you are immersed in something like the world of the th century and beyond
you can follow even obscure states through  years of their historybut the weakness of historical accuracy is that the game forces you into the groove of actual history
it does this using several more or less hidden factors
first innumerable historically based programmed events will give you unique opportunities or shock your country out of tranquility with little regard to what you have done to merit them
second your territories have cultures that are entirely inflexible as does your government
if you hold territories that have cultures different from those of your government you will never have peace no matter how many centuries you have held them
this gives you a strong incentive to steer clear of them in the first place
finally your government belongs to one of five technology groups all with different rates of technological development
if you are in a slow ie noneuropean group you will eventually be overwhelmed by european conquerorsthe game is fun and replayable
but the more or less determined outcomes for individual states makes playing anything but a medium to large european power either boring or frustrating
the game also lacks any tactical aspect
on the whole much better than anything else in strategy and in tactics and resource management very poor compared to offerings like medieval total war or age of kingseuropa universalis ii is one of the most compelling strategy games for the pc to be released in the last decade
its combination of economics politics and warfare provides a much richer experience than the typical build and conquer style strategy gameshere are the high points large scale conquest is impractical and difficult
you wont find it easy to win the game by wiping out the competition
this means you actually have to think
 the political system is rich and diverse allowing you to actively make efforts to improve relations
 the large number of nations makes realistic alliances possible
 the economic system is simple enough to be playable but diverse enough to be interestinghere are some problems the game is supposed to be historically accurate but it defies this in two serious ways
the nature of exploration is unrealistic
because all military units have an attrition rate that increases with time you cannot send out long expeditions making circumnavigation impossible
also you cant bring ships into a safe harbor in unknown lands to refresh the crew
when you discover the new world empires aztecs etc
 they are treated exactly the same as the old world countries politically
this means you have to have a valid cause to attack them
in history the cultures of the new world were exempted from the rules of war
 the focus on history also limits your choices
as far as i can tell you only get explorers which allow you to move into uncharted map spaces that correspond with actual famous explorers from the country you are playing
some countries will therefore get a big advantage that others dont havein conclusion eu ii is a good game with a lot of fresh ideas but it has some limiting factors that can easily turn you off
it is worth a look if you are a thinking strategy fan but is probably not a good choice if your interest in strategy is limited to traditional war craft style realtime gamesi found that after playing this game for a while i went back to imperialism ii which is a much superior gamei dont think i can agree with the elements picked for this pack
the games are from three totally different genres that arent usually mixed
then throw in a subscription to a magazine that if you want it you probably already have it
come on there are just better packs offered hereok i want to love this game i really do
it happens to be the most recent hockey game out on any system to my knowledgebut come on only three players on the ice
whats up with thatyou only have access to some of the players not all of themand the way the stats are figured for the players is really badsome of the best players have horrible statscurtis joseph only has a  for goalie numbers and hes consistantly one of the best in the league every yearthe teams are all screwed up too
pick a good team and youll get stomped by a real sucky team
not cool or realisticif you dont know anything about hockey you might love this gamebut anybody who knows hockey wont like it very muchits worth a rental and maybe to buy if you find it cheapnhl k is a million times better but alas it is out of date and is missing current teamsnothing special nothing new not a bad game just very much the same game as any other given rts
there is nothing newthis game is based of course off of red alert which came out in around  well sadly since then the command and conquer series hasnt changed at all
this game just takes the tiberian sun engine and gives it a small visual overhawl but has bascially the same units and builds except instead of nod and gdi its now russia and america
however this game does have some qualities that give it three stars
things like the wonderful movies and story line that goes with it espically if you play the russian side which gives a transition into the expansion pack
however you will find that the game play puts you to sleep after a few missions and that in the end theyre all the sameprosgood moviesinteresting story lineconsover done battle enginereused missionssame quotbuild and rushquot tactics in the gameas the st and nd on n you just have more guys and a little better graphicssmuglers run  is good but its just like anaddon to the frst but cost  buck more
the original is just as good
also whypy the same amount of money forthis whn you can get grand theft auto  for the same amount bu be ableto use better guns be a taxi driver and steal more cars
gta is better but if thats to violent gt the original smuglrs run for less  and the same stuffi only played it a little bit  so i dont have much to say on it now 
i bought mine used   it did not come with a players manual 
that makes the game harder to play when you dont have the directions 
one thing that i really like about it is  that its not a ubisoft game no one lives forever is a firstperson shootersneaker that is set in the s
it has a humorous secret agent theme which combines elements of james bond with austin powers
with the music scenery voiceacting and a welcome dose of humor this game does a great job of pulling this off
there are long cinematic scenes sometimes too long filled with wisecracking type humor there is just something about watching stuffy people with british accents insult each other that is funny
kate archer is a unique main character that you wont find in any other game
i loved the mission interludes which is when you get your orders from hq and learn about the new spy gadgets that your organization has come up with
the graphics animation and sound for this game are all very good
these were the highlights of the gamethe game does also add stealth elements like what you find in deus ex and thief
enemies will react to sounds of footsteps and gunshots and security cameras will set off alarms if they focus in on youso why did i give this game only three stars
to make it simple  i found the missions themselves to be bland
add on top of that there arent many of them  if you take the cinematic scenes out of this game it is short
if you strip away the fancy elements you have mediocre maps and average game playthe spy elements in this game the stealth the gadgets etc never lived up to their potential
lots of the spy gadgets like the robot poodle have one or two obvious uses each mission and then become unnecessary
on each mission it is almost impossible to remain undetected and it is easy to mow down all of your opponents with your submachinegun so whats the point of trying to sneak around all day
there are some creative levels and settings but most of them end up as a typical bad guy hunt  go to room a clear out the bad guys then go to room b clear out the bad guys and so on
the maps are small and simple
there are a few good puzzles in this game but most of the solutions are spoonfed to you
other than occasional intelligence items that you are supposed to pick up which are simply left out in the open for you there arent many goodies to find or items to interact with
even the intelligence items have no outcome on the game  they are just there if you want to keep score of how much stuff you can findi must be spoiled by games like deus ex and thief which have much richer levels and a few different ways to solve just about every problem
it is for these reasons that i never felt compelled to play this game for more than about  minutes before moving on to something elseif you enjoy first person shooters then you should pick up this game
but if you havent played deus ex yet then pick that one up first
it is a much better gamethe game is fun but the right side of the screen flickered constantly
it gave me a headache and was very annoying
there was no way to stop the horrible flickering and it was major flickering
this was the second game that i purchased and both disks did the same thingmeh average fps
you can play as a marine alien or predator
thats kinda fun
but overall it gets boringi gave this review to aliens versus predator  the threestar treatment because its the midgrade score
so why the midgrade score
its a fun game by all means especially the alien campaign however if you own a computer that runs windows xp the game wont work well as it did for those that gave this game a better gradeeven with the game running on the lowestminimum settings on audio and graphics the game suffers from severe lag and awefully dragged out loading times
my computer specs tower over the minimum requirements in order to play this game but windows xp doesnt seem to have the compatability in order to enjoy this titlewhat i could play and deal with the game showed much promise to be great in both single player and with the online multiplayer games
i just never got too into the game because of all the problems with the system crashing long loading times and we are literaly talking about  minutes here and bad lag
i installed and played the game for nearly ten hours and got only two levels into it my character died many times because of the lagif you are running windows xp avoid this game
there are just too many problems to overcome
if you own a previous windows edition this game will most likely be a great title and be ready to scream louder that you ever have screamed before
well at least for the first rd of the game
i was looking for a good scary game heard of this game and picked it up
indeed few games have scared me more than the marine campaign of this game if the makers just made that campaign longer and kept the different races in multiplayer i just might be happy with my  dollar purchase of this game
the predator  alien campaigns are just bad compared to the marine one
for many reasons too it is well paced has a memorable main character and it is scary
i screamed almost every single time an alien popped up onscreen
you might want to pick up the game because of the low price is charging it
i think it is a dissapointmentthis is probly a great game and looks very good
i had been looking at this game for a while before i finaly decided to buy it
i was very excited as i got ready to playafter waiting about an hour for it too install and than another half an hour for it to start up i started the predator mission
it took forever for it too load before i got too playthe grpahics are wonderfull and everything looks really cool however after about two minutes of gameplay the frame rate dropped and it became a digital nightmare
i tried it several times before giving up and returning it to the storei attempted to start up the alien and terran missions which i never even got goingthis game is probly very good and a great fpsthe little i have played of it is great but make sure you have good enough techonlogy and grpahics cards etc
so if your computer is strong enough get this game but if not than try somethign elsethis game was reviewed on a gig pentium iii with ati rage  video and meg memory  full installation on a windows  pro osthis game has an interesting twist
i liked the fact that i can play three different characters with very different strengths and weaknesses
this was worth a star
unfortunately the execution does not live up to the concepti start by noting how buggy this game is
it aborted three times with error messages froze once and the color palette kept getting screwed up so that text became invisible or blurred and the alternative vision mode for the alien character became a black screen
i had to exit and reload the game to fix the last problem which takes quite a whilethis brings me to another issue
the time required to load the games was far too long especially considering how short the segments arethe game scores well in terms of playability and is right up there with halflife and is far better than blade of darkness
characters move the way you expect and handle well
you dont walk through your opponent or jump off ledges while trying to edge up to themsome of the missions are quite boring consisting of mazes with occasional bad guys
i liked the objective lists like quake ii but they need to be more detailed
for example for half the alien missions the sole objective is to find the hive
not very usefuli got stuck at a couple of places and couldnt figure out how to open doors
i was glad the cheats are easy to use so i could walk right through the doors in question
hit return then ltcheatgt mpsixthsenseoverall its probably worth the money but it doesnt capture your imagination like halflife does and doesnt have the visual richness of blade of darknessdoes any name in gaming quite conjure the same sense of gothic action platforming the way that of castlevania does
from the nes to the playstation no multiplatform series has carried over quite so well with such consistent quality
even the lesser titles in the series such as dracula x on the snes and the game boy castlevania adventures and legends are well ahead of similar titles in the genre
castlevania chronicles brings one of two castlevania games to never see release on these shores in this case akumajo dracula a japanese x pc game similar to us macs atari sts  amigas of the time thanks to the motorola  under the hood to the us for the first time via sonys playstation
while theres a valid point that this was the lesser of the two the other being the amazingly good dracula x the rondo of blood a japanese pc engine cdturbo duo game theres no question that its a more than welcome release to anyone that considers themselves to be even a casual castlevania fan
the great thing particularly for those of us that were weaned on the original castlevania on the bit nes is that akumajo dracula the game at the heart of castlevania chronicles is in essence a remake of the original castlevania
youll recognize the stages and most of the bosses the weapons are the expected fare and the music updated versions of what youve been listening to for years and in the end its a welcome trip down a betterlooking memory lanegraphics castlevania chronicles visuals arent really bad theyre just dated
this is an  year old game and it shows
while the arrange mode does offer a few updated visuals new sprites for simon  dracula by ayami kojima sotn better lighting etc
 byinlarge much of what you see is exactly what was there in the original x version
while i would expect this from the original mode i expected more from the arrange setup
while the new character sprites are decent its not even close to sotns masterful animation
graphically speaking its definitely no sotn but then again it wasnt supposed to be
its just a shame that more effort wasnt put into the arrange mode something that utilized a bit of what the aging playstation hardware is capable of producing as in many ways the graphics are actually inferior to the snes castlevania games particularly iv and lack the flair that made rondo of blood on the pce so captivatingsound as is expected castlevania chronicles soundtrack is your usual series fare which means for the uninitiated that its very very good
the arrange mode has a completely remixed soundtrack so all your favorites bloody tears for instance are here and in fine fashion
the one minor gripe is the fact that some of the music hardware options of the original mode have been taken out meaning that theres only one selection available
while this is not a particularly big deal i have always been of the opinion that the more options you have the better especially when all of these sound options can be emulated on the playstation
fortunately all you need do is press l  r immediately after beginning in order to activate the sound option in either original or arrange mode so its really a nonissue
hmmmmaybe konami can put the minibosses hardrocking version of the castlevania theme in the next one gameplay as usual in the series castlevania chronicles or really akumajo draculas is a shining example of simplicity in game design that works every time
while there are a few areas that subsequent gameplay additions are truly missed not being able to jump onto stairs multidirectional whipping while standing still or jumping and separate buttons to control the special weapon this is still the same castlevania youve grown to love
considering the games pedigree particularly its links to the original castlevania this is actually a throwback of sorts so it really does not hurt the game at all
as is typical of most castlevania titles aside from sotn cotm simons quest and theahemn wannabes gameplay is very linear
basically you have  levels each with multiple stages the areas between the doors and at the end a level bossguardian
the control is spoton and unlike some games you can actually change direction while jumping
actions consist of jumping whipping and using special weapons all the good ones are hear too
limited
sure
fun
absolutely
you might not have much incentive to play it through again for a while thanks to things being so linear if youve beat it once youve beat it a hundred timesthe exact same way but while you do its a great ride
the only bump in the road is that the game is fairly hard
while that wont be a surprise to anyone whos whipped their way through castlevania  castlevania iii it might be a bit much for some of the more casuallyinclinedtheme i could go into it again but whats left to be said
few games have provided more memories over the years than castlevania and frankly i think thats due to the fact that its subject matter is something most gamers are already intimately associated with and thats the horror movie
dracula is a character ingrained into the american culture repeatedly over the course of the th century in many shapes and forms
movies comic books video games hes everywhere
what konami did was take a great game premise and then throw in many of the classic monsters  myths weve come to love recreating them in a way that no one had seen before
add a largerthanlife hero in simon belmont by all intents just a solitary normal man standing against the odds against the prince of darkness with nothing more than his trusty whip blessed items  a longstanding family history fighting the evil and there you have it all in a decidedly japanese take
castlevania chronicles as a remake of the original castlevania effectively takes you back to where it all began to that very first quest deep into the bowels of castle draculaoverall truth be told there are better playstation games to be had and much better castlevania games out there on several systems
of course that isnt why youve read this far into the review you know these things
for what it is castlevania chronicles does the job and for the relatively low pricetag its well worth the meager price of admission
for all the castlevania fans who have ever heard the name akumajo dracula uttered in hushed tones tried to get the rom running on an x emulator more than likely to no avail or overbid on a copy at ebay this ones for you and while dracula x rondo of blood would have been a better choice my theory is that its next to come chronicles offers more than enough challenge for those who believed the original game to be too easy
chronicles is a refreshing look back into a series that has evolved into something much more in recent years and in looking back you see just how far konami has taken the concept as well as realize that castlevania games age gracefullyunless you have been a fan of the castlevania series since the first release on the original nes you may be disappointed with castlevania chronicles
the gameplay and graphics are quite primitive compared to todays d games so dont expect anything nearly as spectacular as in castlevania sotnbut perhaps it was intended to be that way
castlevania chronicles is basically a remake of the first castlevania with remixed music and slightly updated graphics and gameplay
it was clearly intended to be for long time fans of the series so younger game players may be confused by the lack of graphical quality
my only major gripe is that i think since konami bothered to go back and alter this version they should have at least included the ability to whip in all eight directions via castlevania  for snes
hardcore castlevania fans should love this one regardless of its shortcomings though because in the end the entire presentation is pure quotold schoolquot and packed with nostalgia
if you cant get enough of castlevania chronicles is certainly worth picking up
hopefully konami will release a true sequel to the series soonthis game is kinda fun for the price
i only paid  thats with shipping
if you like racing and you just want it in a different form then youll like this game
its easy and simple
you just race
would not pay more than  thoughif previous music games outta japan beatmaniaguitar freakssamba de amigo didnt use special controllers that looked like musical instruments they wouldnt be nearly as fun
unfortunately frequency only uses a dual shock  controller but even then the pad isnt made for the kind of super fast button tapping and moving you need in frequencys harder difficulties
the gameplay here is a lot deeper and more satisfying than typical games in the genre
songs are divided into parts drum vocal guitar etc
each has a seperate track in a large tunnel
you move from track to track clearing each and heading to the next without pausing to keep your combo going and the points multiplying
because of all this interaction frequency has a level of challenge and technique not found in other music games making it feel like youre really performing the tunes
but the thing that hampered my injoyment is the music selection
im just not a big fan of club style music nor of most of the featured bands like powerman  crystal method and the gameplay
on the other hand remix mode lets you construct levels and remix the music anyway you want
and frequencies visually more impressive than any of the music games from japan
its a strong entry for the musical genre but unless you really dig the music its not going to last very longi rented this game like  years ago and i enjoyed it
however the graphics werent finished in my opinion
the game seemed rushed and could have been much better if the creators spent more time
i bought this game mostly to complete my twisted metal collection
if you can get this game under  including the shipping id say its worth itwhen it comes to storied playstation franchises most people or at least those who grew up during the reign of the original console tend to agree that the various twisted metal titles were rather instrumental
well thats somewhat of a misstatement
as ugly as they were from a graphical standpoint twisted metal  and  were a big reason why the playstation could cultivate itself as a playground for more mature titles and gamers
i myself was drawn away from nintendos consoles by the first tomb raider and final fantasy vii because of the similar vibes they gave off and im sure others were subconsciously as well
now this is not a lame attempt to label nintendo  or the consoles that followed as kiddy but you have to acknowledge the above because  twisted metal would eventually push the maturity level envelope further with twisted metal black and  they would surprisingly try to scale back the same envelope in order to attract some younger players prior to that
the result the second change in direction would result in twisted metal small brawl a rather unloved game looking for some affectionnow the first thing you need to know about small brawl is that  studios was not the games developer so that will make a rather large group of fans happy
personally im kind of divided on the  games iii felt very poor to me while  was of a higher abet still conflicted quality but sony pretty much answered everyones prayers by having incognito inc produce this game
this developer was home to some of the team members that made the first two games and it clearly shows
there are so many things about small brawl that remind me of the first two twisted metals the controls the graphics which look like earliest ps games despite the year this was made the use of an original score you name it and its pretty much a very close facsimile despite the fact that singletracs original game engine and code was lost before handing the series over to  because of this its rather surprising to me that so many people dislike small brawl
well thats just me trying to be clever with the misdirection again because once you look beyond the gameplay its kind easy to see where the honeymoon endssmall brawls biggest problem is unfortunately its main selling point
personally i thought taking the cast of twisted metal  and  and making them children was clever as i was reading the manual but the titular humor that the franchises fans are looking for doesnt quite translate into the games various endings
there are moments where that old spark shines through but its way too brief to justify buying another game when you could just revisit the first two to get your fix
personally while i enjoyed the actual game well enough playing through with each character got old quickly because i knew the payoff at the end wasnt going to be that greatbecause of that the only people that small brawl will probably entertain for a significant amount of time are those who have never played a twisted metal game before
this would seem to justify the demographic the game is targeting yet ironically the game was slapped with a teen rating for its comic mischief which ironically puts it on equal footing with the first two games again
in the end twisted metal small brawl is far from being a bad product yet everywhere you turn it is either on right on par with something deemed superior or is defeated by something somewhat unfortunate and silly
despite this i would recommend checking it out if youre interested just as long as youre not expecting anything too great out of itits probably the worst twisted metal game of all but overall its still an alright gamefor the genre its a welldone game
graphics are great there are some very nice little extras autosave is a nice feature load times are nonexistent
controls are a little quirky but reasonableon the other hand havent we seen this game before
about a dozen times before
i havent finished it yet i just reached the last area but i seriously feel like i just replayed dark cloud spyro or crash bandicoot only without the depth and complexity
oh yeah whats with this stupid little trend of quotdance stepsquot when the character does something useful
you might say something like quotbut dark cloud and spyro werent particularly noted for their depthquot
yep thats right we have a game here thats even less interesting than ridge racer  storywise
they tossed in a few extras the awful quotzoomerquot a boat that gets used once a horrible quotfishingquot minigame but theres just nothing here storywise or even in terms of the game play
insipid is the word that comes to mind actually
enter area wander aimlessly and get killed  times while looking for power orbs repeat until done
i have no firm idea how many lives i lost but its a lotin the hundreds at least
the lack of a map and not even a treasure detector of any sort makes the game very frustrating to play at times
theres a list of power orbs but the worded descriptions are useless
wheres the quotfrozen cratequot
in the freezer
looking for mystery hidden item number  seems like a major waste of time
i doubt ill finish it its gone beyond boringi dont understand why they bothered with other characters in the game
mostly they mutter useful things like quotfascinatingquot or sit there dumbly when they get punched as theres no interaction to speak ofspyro is lightyears ahead hereat least the other characters serve some semiuseful purpose in the game instead of just being icons
theres a bit of a story and when i finished the spyro games i felt like id helped the characters out of a nasty situation
i seem to have forgotten why im supposed to be helping jak and daxter or even that they have a problemreplay value
none zero zip
not unless youre into finding all the power orbs and eggs oh sorry quotprecursor artifactsquotjak and daxter is pretty much like crash bandicoot over again but with diferent characters and story plot
besides that its a fun game to play
jak is the hero and daxter the little fuzzy dude is his smart mouthed friendwhich does nothing but sit on your shoulder throught the whole game
the game starts to get really hard after playing it for awhile almost impossible
the graphics are pretty cool
theres even time periods in the game day noon night sunrise and sundown
the controles are pretty easy toowith jak and daxter developer naughty dog basically retreads over the successes of their past stopping only to make a few necessary tweaks that had been sorely lacking in similar titles in the past
and thats not necessarily a bad thing because the platforming genre had by this time been hammered down to a few absolutely key elements that are necessary for such a title to be successful
at a glance the game presents nothing all that noteworthy a gratingly bubbly cartoonish cast a story pulled right out of a coloring book bright and shiny graphics to match the existence of an occasional powerup and a large cluster of bottomless pits
make no mistake if you cringe at the thought of spending a few days in front of a game that looks and speaks like something youd expect to see on a saturday morning cartoon this is absolutely not the game for you
if you share a house with more than just a pet or two your roommates spouses or family members will be making fun of you
if youre at a point spiritually and emotionally where you can deal with that theres a somewhat enjoyable little game buried underneath it allthe storyline is easy to establish short on dialogue and heavy on gameplay and thats just about the extent of the good things i can say about it
the story is bare bones at best establishing the good guys and the bad guys right off the bat the bad guys are the ones with tusks introducing a conflict the guys with tusks want to unleash chaos on the world and a motivation jaks buddy daxter falls into a pit of mystery goo transforming him into a furry critter eventually unleashing you out onto the world to fight evil or some such nonsense
the characters themselves are just paperthin and almost completely devoid of emotion or appealjak the main character naturally is conspicuous in his silence throughout the tale leaving the majority of the speaking parts to the green sage an elderly wizard who grants you a miniature nugget of motivation at the outset of each level and daxter the aforementioned furry sidekick equipped with enough cheesy one liners to make rodney dangerfield spin wildly in his grave both of whom are way way over the top in the flamboyant personality department
once in a while the sages daughter will pop in to share a new bit of technology or something and as you visit new towns youll meet a new character or two but for the most part its daxter and the sage bouncing off of one another and jak standing around to make confused or frustrated facesif youve played any of the postsnes three dimensional platformers that preceded it youve probably got a good handle on how jak and daxter feels
youve got an overhead camera dangling just behind you at all times a couple very basic attacks and the vital ability to jump
as you progress through the game youll discover different variations upon jaks abilities as theyre necessitated such as the ability to somersault to crouch to doublejump and to long jump
whats cool is that these abilities arent something you need to unlock theyre available right from the getgo so theres a process of experimental discovery that makes you feel directly involved in jaks progression as a character
on the other hand the existence of these abilities and instructions on their use are never truly explained so if you havent discovered the long jump by the time jak needs to clear a large canyon by his lonesome youre in for a long painful series of trials and errorsdespite the occasional difficulty in explaining its own controls the actual gameplay of jak is largely a lot of fun
obstacles are challenging without being frustrating most of the puzzles are just difficult enough to whir your gears without forcing you to seek out a walkthrough in a moment of fury and the boss fights are wholly entertaining
it makes good use of the powerups staggering them early to get you used to their intentions and then introducing them at just the right times as they become more and more important later in the game
it does have a few small hiccups that will continually bother a refined gamer by failing to function as designed at critical moments
for example jak doesnt always latch onto the corner of a ledge prince of persiastyle like hes supposed to
nine times out of ten hell perform the brave feat without hesitation but it seems like the most important jumps are usually where he has the most trouble slamming into the edge of a platform and then awkwardly vibrating for a moment before falling to his death
likewise the extremely touchy nature of the doublejump system also provides for its share of headachesalthough i complained a bit earlier about the games hesitancy to fully explain its control scheme once youve experimented enough to actually discover all of the characters possible actions the full control scheme is really very basic and easy to grasp
the way some games map out their button setups i wonder if theyre expecting players to have an extra arm installed to make some certain actions possible the xbox release of grand theft auto san andreas springs to mind
jak overcomes this potential flaw by keeping things extremely simple and never requiring the use of more than two or maybe three buttons at the same time analog stick included
by limiting themselves to the r button the four main control buttons xotriangle and square and the analogs they ensure you never need to move a finger into an awkward position and allow you to really envelop yourself in the gamei think i was expecting a bit more out of the graphics since this was an early title for the ps and thats usually when developers are frothing at the mouth over the new hardware and going out of their way to show off everything it can do
the visuals of jak and daxter just feel like a marginal improvement over the visuals of naughty dogs psone titles and certainly didnt age well in the almost five years since it was released
part of that is due to the cartoony direction taken by the art but you cant blame the lumpy renderings of the sages face when speaking or the distractingly simplistic appearance of most of the games enemies on artistic decision
some things such as the distant skylines in the forest and the radiating glow of eco matter in the wild are very well executed but on the large this is no showpiece for the pss visual capabilities
bluntly if youre looking for an exceptional early graphical display on the ps keep lookingvoice acting aside i cant say much nicer things about the audio
i suppose its of a higher quality than the tunes found on the old psone albeit not by much but the compositions themselves are so aggravatingly bouncy joyful and happy that if you arent in actuality a care bear youll want to rip your hair out by the roots
while im not sure something like heavy metal or rb would suit the feel of the game much better i was expecting something a little more contemporary and interesting considering the marketing that announced the games launch remember the commercials with the title characters reclining poolside with a cluster of bikiniclad young ladies
yeah i dont think they were aiming those at the  year old market
the voice acting is sound for the most part with a few performances standing out above the others
the dark sages voice perfectly matches his demeanor and appearance while the green sage really feels like an old man tired of the world that surrounds him but determined to aid in its resuscitation all the same
on the other side of the coin bad voice acting isnt exactly missing either and the dialog is so bad that even the competent actors have trouble making their lines come to lifewhen stripped down to its very basics jak and daxter is an entertaining play
while there isnt anything the actual gameplay does badly nitpicky flaws aside theres also nothing that it really excels at
its a good nextgen translation of an alreadyenjoyable system of mechanics controls and direction basically reading the map drawn by its forefathers and following it to the gold buried at the end
if it werent for the abysmal storytelling the hot and cold voice acting and the sub par graphics and sound this would probably be deserving of a score well above average that map is so welldrawn
unfortunately i cant honestly say that those factors dont affect my opinion of the disc itself and they drag my score down by quite a bit
if you can shut your brain off or go to make a sandwich during the speaking parts and accept the visuals for what they are youll really enjoy this one
for those of us looking for a complete package prepare to be somewhat disappointedas with most platformers story is not a heavily concerned thought
the same pertains to jak and daxter as a simple story drives this game along
the main plot of the game rests on daxter jaks brother who was transformed into a small orange muskrat by a substance called dark eco
feeling very guilty over daxters transformation he puts him on his shoulder and goes out into the world to find a cure
i must commend naughty dog for character choice though
how often do you get to control a spikyhaired elf and a small orange rodent
though there are very few twists and major plot turns in the game jak and daxter continues the primary focus that platformers are shallow story games
just like the mario games everyone knows that a platform games strongest category is gameplaythe main style of gameplay in this game revolves around collecting items and a  completed meter will remain in check as you collect these items
just like super mario s stars and banjokazooies jiggies jak and daxter must collect power cells
power cells will be awarded by completing certain tasks in the game or finding them in hidden locations
another very collected item in the game is the precursor orb
these orbs are all over the place in each level and serve as the money oriented object in this game
collecting enough of them will allow you to trade them in to other characters for power cells
power cells and precursor orbs are just a few of the items you will need to collect in order to raise your  completed percentagewhile the game does have its entertaining gameplay moments there are some that are rather boring
most of the time you will be running around scrounging for orbs to turn in for power cells
sometimes on more interesting parts you will be asked by other characters to do errands for them and will reward you on your outcome
other events include collecting a certain number of scout flies climbing tall structures shooting a certain number of foes with fire balls and oddly catching a fixed amount of fish in a short time
levels are very large and creatively designed
usually when getting on a large perch you can even see other levels in the distance
also what makes the game even more inviting is that there are no major load times whatsoeveri felt that the graphical nature of the game shined very brightly
naughty dog has really taken advantage of the playstation s graphical processing and it really shows throughout the game
as noted before the horizon stretches out seemingly forever and there are no annoying popups
the frame rate is a bit wild at time in certain areas but it is nothing that really takes away from the gameplay
from the lava filled volcano to the blizzard covered mountains to just the average jungle town every aspect of the game is colorful and true to the platform style gameplay
character designs wont disappoint either
the fluent movements of jak and daxter are all portrayed excellently despite their few moves
the enemies look fine as well and play their role in different levels throughout the game
now while the playstation  is usually criticized for its lack of texture processing this game really proves them wrong
the high resolution presents colors and obstacles with practically no pixelation whatsoever
the cinema scenes correlate with the moving story of the game and the facial animations go well with the comic oriented dialog
i believe that this game will set the primary standard for future ps platformsthe soundmusical aspect of the game is one of the more disappointing features of the game
the character acting basically revolves around the comic relief of daxter
while at times he is funny most of his jokes are pretty lame
they are still light hearted though and make him an enjoyable aspect to the game
jak the hero is mute throughout the whole game and most of the other characters rarely have anything interesting to say
the music of the game isnt anything special either
most of the time you will generally not even notice it
all in all though while it isnt anything unique most of the tunes go well with the atmosphereall in all jak and daxter the precursor legacy is definitely the best platform game on the ps right now next to jak ii the sequel
this game while not very original brings a unique and interesting platform experience
it is a shame that the replay value of the game has nothing to offer once you complete it
however the single player experience is the reason that you even play platform games and while the game isnt incredibly challenging it does have its moments
if you want to know what happened before jak ii or enjoy platforms in general then look no furtherlet me start by talking about the end of this game which is unforgivable
let me provide fair warning that after dedicating many hours to finding every little item jak amp daxter asks you to find youre going to be severely let downokay on to the game
jak amp daxter is a very basic platformer
there are no quotthings to doquot in the game outside of running jumping and collecting
sometimes the game makes you drive a vehicle but these instances are more frustrating than fun
plus the games characters especially jak amp daxter are a bunch of ugly little jerks which doesnt particularly give you much incentive to see this characterbased game all the way throughhowever now that its only  its probably worth your while but only if you like platformers
the world is expansive and fun to explore you will never have the fun and quick acrobatstyle movement that mario had on the n though
these guys move pretty slowly and jump pretty short distancesnone of this detracts from the fact that the graphics are beautiful and fun to observe thoughpick up jak amp daxter if you already own ratchet amp clank and sly cooper and are hankering for another platformer
otherwise there are better ways to spend your buckim torn about this game
for the most part i dont really have fond memories of it but memories of frustration which is quite unusual for me
ive actually had this game since i was very young
if a game is hard enough it must be extremely difficult for me i can get tired of playing it and put it down as well as forget about it for several years
then later in my life i dig it back out to complete it often my skills have improved since i last played
so in that respect it occasionally takes me years to complete a game
ill give you the cons and the pros in that order
ultimately its up to you to decide whether or not this game is even worth your timecons  this game is one player only
this isnt a problem to me as a solo gamer but i know many people like to play in groups or with a partner
this especially hurts this game in fields relevant of todays where almost everything is designed for the possible participation of at least four people
im just warning you about this upfront
no ending
there is no ultra secret ending its all an overhyped disgrace
you have a door that requires at least one hundred power cells to open it
you literally go from that youknowwhathotplace and back to get one hundred of those stinking power cells only for a white light that the characters awe over
you never even know what the white light belongs to
dont bother completing the game one hundred percent for something better either
it doesnt work thats all you get
this made me so hoover dam mad
they had absolutely no right to yank our chains like that
repetitious music
even upon hearing it for the first time in years im sick of it
its okay at first but even to begin with the music could be better
various control quirks
jak looks horrible when hes jumping like some deranged bird trying to fly and his double jump doesnt even work if you wait even half of a second too long
this leads to a lot of unnecessary deaths by falling
also camera controls are just awful it can get pretty difficult when your camera is determined to stay in one angle when you need it to go into another
this causes even more deaths by falling
hard and frustrating
remember all of those deaths by falling i mentioned earlier
youll probably go through thousands of those as well as get lost a thousand times
have a stress ball or pillow ready or you may break your game through your urge to thrash it
adding to this frustration daxter can occasionally be an annoyance a cocky coward whos all talk  various glitches and somewhat poor level design
this combined with jaks terrible jumping ability can make this game a complete nightmare
look around online for more specifics on the glitches thankfully i dont think ive encountered many if any but trust me they wont make your life easier
overused enemies
you pound a lot of the same creatures even over the course of different areaspros  beautiful graphics
nice lush backgrounds pertaining to forests beaches caves and towns
they use good graphics for lost cities the citadel which is like the final level and labs too but those can be a little repetitious
if you take a few minutes to watch the sky in a natural environment you can watch the cycles of day and night with the sun stars and moon
although it cycles slightly too quickly i think thats the most impressive part of it
oh bear in mind these graphics are slightly cartoonish
decent plot
its also very simple jak and his friend daxter are exploring someplace the green sage told them not to go
while they are exploring they find a pool of dark eco a sinister and black element harmful to all creatures
after they find it they are spotted by a villainous sentry which initiates a battle
jak fight while daxter hides behind him but the force of jak knocking out the sentry causes daxter to fall in the dark eco
daxter comes out but soon realizes and screams over being transformed into a cute and furry little ottsel
they return to the green sage who scolds them for going where he told them not to go
hes reluctant to help eventually slipping the information that he cant help anyway only the white sage can help
now how and where do you find him
thats where the journey begins
comicalinteresting characters
most of the characters are funny
in the earlier stages of the game daxter will say something funny every time jak passes out gets defeated on land even to the point of insinuating that jaks breath smells
also early in the game the green sage scolds and screams at them like crazy which is also funny
sadly at the later points of the game these jokes go away making some of the characters seem serious and out of material which isnt overwhelmingly much
that doesnt mean there arent any more interesting characters kiera for example is a female inventor of sorts that will make various crafts for you
youll also bump into a sculptor looking for his muse and even a guy wearing a barrel
the sculptor and barrel wearing guy however are characters that can only be spoken to a limited number of times
the fishing minigame is fun
its addictive at firstconclusionthats all i can really say
this game had the potential to be excellent but it didnt quite hit the mark
those with a lot of patience will enjoy it the most
dont give it to younger children unless theyre really skilled or they wont enjoy it
you can buy it if you want a real challenge that has quirks or if something here really appeals to you but other than that there are better platformers out therethis is a beautifulforestwaterbeaches platform game
very realistic and detailed
daxter adds the cuteness factor while being the mascot
luckily you have missions go out and find power cellsetc
unfortunately that can get reeally boring after searching and searching
if you dont get everything you cant move to the next part
probably best to have the strategy guide next to you
on my own i grew frusterated and wasnt close to finishing the game by the time it was due back
i do wonder that if i had bought it id have gotten farther and feel differently
after this there were two jak minus daxter games made which turned me off and reviews for those said that the games were in a new battle type direction so i never tried any moregreat characters
nice world
i just didnt like playing this game simple as that
may i suggest a good platformer sly cooper
im playing that game now and it made me change my perspective on platformers
i thin the world in this game is too big and i get lost
thats why i didnt like itmost people figure that when a game becomes popular and also merits a sequel it means that the game is a great one to start out with
well that is what i figured at least
unfortunately the sequel corrects much of went wrong with the originalfirst of all jak and daxter is quite likely the most plotless and repetative game ive ever played
yes there is a plot but the storyline has almost no influence over the game
you have to go around and collect little golden floating eggs and perform missions for random people to get precursor orbs
what does that have to do with the evil people youre trying to get to so you can transform your little furry buddy back into his even uglier human form
i dont really know and after playing this game for a while i dont even careyes the graphics are amazing and beautiful but looks arent everything
especially in this game where you go from one piece of land to another without even knowing youve moved into a new place
the problem with this is that the missions you have to complete are different depending on where you are
you could spend a long time searching for a mission without realizing youre not even in the place youre supposed to be looking for itin addition to this you get three blocks of health to lose before you die
unfortunately it takes  little green things to fill up  block
what was naughty dog thinking when they came up with this health systemhowever some of the missions are fun although the races make me want to throw a brick through my tv screen and exploring and collecting is a popular way to feel like youre progressing in a game
also daxter happens to be adorable and pretty funny
its worth a rent try it out at least and when youre bored of it go for jak i bought this game for my  year old cousin it has good graphics and sound effects are good but i reccomend this game for ages this will be great for the kidsintially i bought this game becasue i was at walmart and i decided that i wasnt going to leave the store without a new game meaning new to me not new as in just came out
anyway it was sitting there for  bucks so i grabbed it and said i wonder if this will be as bad as i think
i took it home and put it away we kinda forgot about it and christmas was coming so since it was still unopened i wrapped it and gave it to my wife for christmas she didnt apreciate it the first level was actually kinda fun but then it got to the surfing part this part was more frustrating than x and you have stupid rosie odonnel yelling at you the whole time half the time i remebered to mute the tv but the other times i had to sit in complete annoyance
this all would have been semiok except that extra lives are harder not to get than get so i could never just game over my way out
after i got so annoyed at rosie odonnel that i focused my chi enough to beat the surfing level i was thrust into the wonderfully bad waterski level this one was even worse that the surfing here a strange giant bird pulls you tarzan into rocks illtempered bass and strange acid moss that kills you in two seconds my wife had to leave the room at this point the sound of tarzans bones cracking when he didnt make the jump over the many tree branches was too much for her not to mention the fact that the bird would drag tarzans dead limp body through five or ten more obstacles before the level would reset
at this point i put the game away for about  monthstwo nights ago i had this strange urge to play tarzan untamed again perhaps i having withdrawls from school being out and not having to babysit th graders all day maybe i am just a glutton for punishment but i poped tarzan back in the cube and went for it this time the stars must have been in alignment because i kicked some trash i got through level after level with narry a thought for how frustrating and bored everyone else was getting watchign tarzan smack into rocks and slide through green crystals apparently superman and tarzan have an aversion to glowing green rocks
i ignored the cries of my wife and child and kept playingaround this time the game informed us that we needed to go back and find more film reels or else they wouldnt let us go to the ancient elephant burial ground i went back to the surfing and skiing levelsand my wife went online to look up divorce attorneys
after a few hundred hours of tarzan testing his skull strength against rocks and trees i had enough film to move onat this point i think it is important to mention the boss battles
these are one on one fights in the tradition of street fighterand mk but instead of fighting you furiously tap on the b button until it reveals your special wrestling move which you must perform in a matter of mere nanoseconds or else start the whole b pounding again now this button pounding isnt smooth or easy like one might imagine after having played a mario party game no this is hardcore your finger will hurt after the last two bosses pounding in any case if you happen to pull off this feat of controlled magic tarzan switched into a cut scene of him wrestling or running away or whateverwhen i got to the third bungee level the baboon one i had to run to the bathroom the game had somehow given me diarreah
my wife tried the level a few times while i expelled the entire contents of my digestive tract into the toilet
when i came back tarzan was still falling hoplessly into trees and rocks this didnt change much after i took the controls back
eventually i got the all important film canister winning the respect of the baboons
they take their film very seriouslyok so then i got to the last level before the final boss battle i go crusing through the level dodging kryptonite and saving baby monkeys only to find turk or tantor whatever the elephants name is standing there to tell me i needed to go back to the start of the level and find the real entrance to the elephant grave yard
i went back to the start and having won the trust andlove of my baboon friends i was alble to gain entrance to the elephant grave yardhere i went on the final boss battle where i had to fight two people at once this ended with a cryptic cutscene that i think promised me a better ending if i found all the film canistersall in all my marriage survived and i found that tarzan really was worth the  bucks i spent  months ago in walmart did i mention that it was about  am when i bought the gamei give it a z or a q depending on what scale you want to usetarzan is an okay game but the n and playstation version were muchmuch better
tarzan slides onto gamecube and ps but slips and fails but succeds at the same time
some times if you grab an enemy with your hands than you can see your hands go through them
the cameras just as untamed as the games expectations
if you go left the camera goes right
the short game plot is not helping either
heres my advice rent it and see if its good than if you like buy it
but to me i think its a rent game onlyexcerpts from the full review at nintendorksquottarzan untamed from respected developer ubi soft does a good job of living up to the movie its based on
its the only real kiddy gamecube launch game and even this title is more mature than youd expect from disney
tarzan untamed features some standard d platforming but adds levels with extremesports style
these sequences imitate the movies most exciting scenes where tarzans branchsliding and vineswinging involve skateboarding and bungiejumping techniques
this refusal to be generic saves tarzan untamed from the unhappy fate of most licensed games stale gameplay that doesnt even have that much to do with the license
unfortunately tarzan untamed never succeeds in becoming anything better than merely decentubi softs approach to tarzans gameplay is really quite clever somehow managing to be both innovative and derivative at the same time
if youve played rayman  and shame on you if you havent youve experienced most of the gameplay in tarzan untamed
tarzans platforming which involves a lot of downhill sliding should be immediately familiar
the quotextremequot angle has been played up and tarzan can even rack up bonus points by pulling various tricks but rayman is clearly a bigger influence than tony hawk
the waterskiing sequences are another ubi soft throwback with only the bungie jumping bonus stages and the downhill surfing offering divergences from rayman  on one hand youd be hardpressed to pick a better platformer to imitate and the gameplay fits perfectly with the tarzan license
on the other hand the game doesnt offer much thats newis tarzan untamed fun
sure and the varied gameplay keeps things from getting old too quickly
but its not fun enough to warrant a purchase for most folks and a gamer strapped for cash might even feel that renting this game would be a waste of money
this is the kind of game that youd probably never buy but its not the worst possible thing you could get as a gift and youd probably have a good time playing it with a younger sibling
its a solid game that shows that licensed games dont have to suck and that a skilled thirdparty developer doesnt have to work too hard to make a worthwhile gamecube titlequotby the poor standards of batman games this is not bad its pretty true to the animations style and its got a fair number of cool gadgets and vehicles
but the graphics are really subpar for an xbox titleits clear that this was a firstgen ps game that was ported to the xbox with no visual improvementsthe controls are also inexact and confusing
too often you need to be in exactly the right spot for an action key to work for example to handcuff a downed enemy you cant just be around him but need to be in some mysterious position near his feet that seems to change with each instance
and some jumps need to be pixelperfectfrustratingid recommend this for batfans only
our household bataddict age  loves it but his dad has to do all the hard bits which is to say most everything simply because of the clumsy designi thank my lucky stars that i decided to rent this game prior to purchase
the game itself isnt all that bad butit needs some sort of quicksave
the only way to save the game is to quit the game your playing
save the gamethe problem with this is it takes far too much time
your never really sure where the last checkpoint was
ie
i saved a game today after an hour or so of gameplay on the same level finally got to a cut scene and then saved
turned the game on tonight and im right back where i started from today
another major problem with the lack of a quicksave is the same problem tomb raider had when it first came out
if you die you have to go through the same portion of the game over and over and over and over tedious isnt it
well so is this aspect of  the game
this really shouldnt be such a big deal but it isthe instruction booklet is a bit vague and im not sure about the  batmoves that ive seen advertised
maybe there are that many i just havent seen them have no idea how to perform them or where or how to learn to perform them
or maybe quotbatman lifts his left foot and bends his knee and moves his left foot forward and places his left foot on the groundquot counts as four moves i dont knowother than those major flaws the game is playable but not ownable
the graphics are fairly decent and the cinematic cutscenes are outstandingso unless you are the number one batfan of all times rent this game prior to ownership
dealing with a loss of five bucks is a lot easier to stomach than losing ten times that amounti expect a lot more from an xbox game
i understand that this is a game with multiple versions on all the major platform systems
the problem with this type of game is that its only as good as the weakest system its made for in this case the ps
i dont have any problems with the ps but having seen the graphic possibilities from my other xbox games im a bit spoiled
if this were my first xbox game or it were another ps game for me i might be able to go up another starthe big highlight of the game is the excellent cgi cutscenes featuring the voiceactors of the animated series
it was those scenes that really created the atmosphere of the animated series and made the game worth playing
each scene was like a little reward that reminded me of the oldschool games from my youth
the ingame graphics also retained that artdeco quality of the series but not without flawsof course the coolest thing about the game is being able to control batman and all of his cool gadgets and it does an excellent job in that respect
i was a big batman fan as a kid and even as an adult i have to admit that batman is still ubercool to me
its hard not to like batman
in the game you get to fly the batplane beat the crud out of henchmen whack the joker with batarangs and swing from building to building on a grapplingline
the game tries to do so much that inevitably there are some weaknesses in the interface but i didnt find that too irritatingunfortunately the novelty of being batman wears off pretty fast
some of the missions get tedious especially the batplane scenes
if i were a kid or a young teenager this game would be a lot more fun but as an adult whose played way too many games i found the game play a little too antiquated
its not bad but its oldschool console roots made me realize how far games have comemy biggest complaint however is the graphics
while i like the simple deco style taken from the series i found the visuls a bit too grainy and rough
as i said before the graphics are onpar with a ps game but i think other xbox gamers will agree it doesnt really meet the bar
if i were writing this review for the ps version it would be much different im sureso in summation if you are in the  and under crowd or just a major batman fan youll probably really enjoy this game
if youre and old fogey like me that expects performance from a game rather than novelty you might want to skip it or rent it
either way its not a bad game just not up to my standardswell if youve read my crazy taxi review for the cube then youll know this is what ill have to say about this one also except for one minor detail i dont like it
it basicly copies the crazy taxi engine it gets kinda repetitive and can get rather old quickly
if youre a simpson fan and liked crazy taxi then yes get this game but if you dont like the simpsons and like racing games then crazy taxi is your game not this one
its your choice crazy taxi simpsons crazy taxi simpsons cra ok enough of that
sorry guys gotta downgrade this onemove your keister meister ha ha
this is sooo cool ofer  charcters and huge worlds  player split screen and real character voices
the game is so cool but not so cool at times
the game is about mr burns is bying the twons buses and makeing them radioactive and jacking up the fares now springfiedians must make ther cars in to cabsand buy the buses no time for donuts homerfirst let me say that i like the fifa series
this game is fun to play and easy to play and learn
the features are great and the visuals are stunning
fifa  also has the real players and what can i say it doesnt go wrong when it comes to that the creation options and the gameplaybut to me all of this is nullified when the product has bugs or flaws in the system
needless to say my experience hasnt been aweinspiring with this ea product  which is very disappointing since ea usually releases quality products
for example sometimes the game will freeze when youre making a substitution
that really is annoying when youve played maybe  games and then lose all your data
of course you can save yoru game after every match but then again one night i had such a horrible time it froze every single time i playedand beware of some of the quirky cannots that arent exactly explained in the instruction manual that you have to seemingly find out for yourself
for example the reset team feature is needed basically whenever you start a new league  which may mean that any edits you make to other teams if youre playing in a euro champ league may end up being nullifiedso thats what to look out for
i love the gameplay and the options and graphics
of course your keeper always pales in comparison to the opponent
but i enjoy playing the game  when the bugs arent ruining the experiencethe game fifa  is a great strategy game soccer game that i would like everyone to rent
the game has high quality graphics great multi player with up to  people
this game also has diffrent unique teams from all over the world
this game is awesome because with over  teams to choose from the game play never ends
there are also three difficultys to chose from and you can customise your own team and players
one thing that might not be so pleasent is that if you dont make custome teams and players the game takes up  blocks of memory
if you do customise it takes  blocks of memory
i consider this game a strategy game because if you dont have a game plan this game might be pretty hard even on ameture
the game will probaly take  week before you score one goal
you have to control your aim and accuracy of each kick in about  second so it is pretty hard to get use to the kicking and passingthe gameplay is good yet teven though there are tons of tournaments and seasons to play its just the same thing over and over so dont expect to want to play this game for  hours strate
the game can get frustrating so i wouldnt buy it but at the new low price maybe you shouldi got these cables hoping to really get the most out of my xbox and hd tv
im afraid i couldnt tell any difference between the component video cables allegedly the best svideo supposedly next best or the original cable connectionsthe audio sounds much much better now that its going through surround sound speakers
i went ahead and shelled out an extra twenty buck for an optical cable
playing halo  is incredible
i can hear subtle sounds i could never hear coming out of my tvs speakers and the explosions are awesomeif you already have your xbox connected for surround sound i really wouldnt recommend shelling out  for these cables especially with the next generation of xbox coming out around xmas 
but if you have the surround sound and an hdtv i see no reason to miss out on this upgradenew legends is the type of game that could have been awesome for the xbox but ends up lacking in several key areas
the game has an interesting story and a very neat combat system but the graphics are terriblethe storyline keeps you interested as you try and regain your kingdom in china
at first things are a little confusing because of the way you view things
this can hurt some because you basically are thrust right into the game without a tutorial
but after awhile things get easier and you start to progress with easethe game is your basic hack and slash third person game with the goal to kill your enemies and get to the end of the level
occasionally you have to complete tasks like planting bombs or opening gates but these are straightforward and usually easy to do
the game does get tougher later and figuring out how to complete certain levels can take a long timeyou can use up to two weapons at once either one of two kinds of two of the same and they can do some interesting combos
there is a lot to choose from as well from swords to bows to guns to other special weapons you get from beating regular enemies and bosses
the variation allows you to pick and choose what weapon is right for you which is a pluswhat makes this game fun is working your way through some pretty huge levels
each level looks different and has different characteristics which is fun
also you have help from allies in most of the levels although they tend to go off on their own leaving you to dispatch the bad guys which isnt hardthat leads me to my next point
while i like facing easy enemies the lack of variety can make fighting almost seem like a chore
there are only basically a few types of enemies and while they vary what weapon they have each is roughly the same
it gets to the point where you wonder if the developers developed the enemies last although the bosses are very cool and present their own unique challengesthe main problem with this game comes from the graphics
it looks like a playstation game
thats the original playstation not the playstation   characters for the most part are blocky as are the foregrounds
the motions are also very choppy and not at all smooth
there is also framerate slowdown like you wouldnt believe in certain parts of the gameanother problem is that there are times when the gameplay stops momentarily to restart the music which isnt worth restarting for the most part
also in order to check your goals when they change you have to pause the game which can get annoying
finally the camera angles swing around enough to make you seasick
it also can make fighting extremely difficultoverall this is one of those rent before you buy games
some people can look past the surface and see the great gameplay elements at the heart of new legends
others wont be able to look past the poor graphicsi can understand they wanted to get this game out but this isridiculous
what they did was give me a rough draft without any corrections
to me it looks like they really need help
the only good thing about this game is the weapons fighting and weapon special effects
you can actually practice some of those moves if you watch the characters as they use the weapons
it is good to teach you something about the martial arts
this game could have been sooooo much more but some one got sloppy went to sleep woke up did not look where they were going and step off the empire state building
and new legends shows what can happen when you take a potentially good idea and screw it up because you did not take it seriouslynew legends like halo was originally was announced for the pc
microsoft has since made this an xbox exclusive
this game is an actionadventure game with a twist of d fighting
your main character must destroy the evil that is plaguing the lands
through out your adventure you will pick up weapons mostly meelee weapons
you can dual wield means use  weapons at a time weapons but some requires you to use  hands like axes and bow
weapons and combinations will be associated with different combos but there will be six main weapons you must get to progress in the game which will be from  warlords you must defeat
the enemies seem to spawn constantly so you will not run out of things to killhaving been just released new legends might be a new game butit will remind you of old school gaming
why
it is simple yetaddicting
the graphics wont impress you it doesnt take full advantage of xboxs potential and there is not excuse for it
the gameplay is what will make you stick to your tv the variety ofweapons available and combos are just too many and the controls is quite easy
one thing you have to keep in mind is that howevermany times you save once you die you will restart that levelone major flaw that will irritate younew legends is a good game but its replayabity is questionablethere are no modes or gametype you can choose and no multiplayerwhatsoever
might be an advisable rental
the game roughly is  hours to finishgraphics and sounds  gameplay  replayabilty  this game was a little disappointing for my because i played burnout  first and was expecting something like that
theres nothing like it but it is still a good first game to play in the seriesthis game is pretty cool
its an arcade style racer that is true to its form
this is a cool game because of the crashes and high speed action of course if you are a die hard gt fan like myself dont go into this game thinking its a really cool simulator cause its definitely not
you get about  cars to pick from on each level easy medium hard to race on  different tracks
you get that second clock to get to the checkpoint and to finish a race you have to make it around three times
let me tell you these laps arent short a  lap race assuming you beat the clock and actually finish takes about  minutes on the game clockthey give you a price tag for the amount of damage you do per crash i thought that was cool and a worst drivers list which you get put on if you have enough crashesover all its a fun game the crashes are fun weaving through traffic at mph is just crazy but for you gt fans out there this game will get old after about a half an hour
rent it firstthis is a cool game
all racing fans out there you gotta buy this game
this is fast and fun and the crashes are cool
real car damage and the graphics are cool
this gamerocks
but its not as cool as other racing games cant control the first replay no camera views and no slowmotion saving the replay just only the crash and no replay in player modelooks like this game is taking a lot of flak from gamers and i can understand why
what with the power of the ps its certainly disappointing that games like this are being banged out
they sound great when you hear about them but theyre lackluster when you finally get it home
i saw the tv commercial for this one with all of the crashes and i was hookedits simple really
not many options not much to do
you drive fast you drive like a lunatic
the better you get you get new courses new challenges
the sounds isnt great the graphics are ok  basically this is a blevel ps game maybethe crashes are great and theyre a lot of fun
but honestly rent this one first before you think about buying it
it could have been much much better
put it this way there are way many better ps drivingracing games out there gran turismo gta midnight club etcok but i got tired of it very fast and gave it awaythe is out of your control too much
and as far as the graphics go  um  what graphics
dont expect specialeffects either
i just found this game to be at the level of what used to come out ten years ago or so  where these programmers sleeping all this timelooked weird and didnt move on screen as well as some games but not like i care i bought it for someone elsemax payne is definately a worth while experience
though the graphics now seem dated to games like splinter cell the gameplay and bullettime are soooooo much fun
plus the story telling is easily some of the best ever in a game
it is like reading a novel only that you dont have to read cheers here
ok now come bad points
first the storytelling elements begin to fall flat after the first third of the game
but maybe that is just me
and the biggie this game has some of the lowest replay value ever for a video game
unfortunately this game lacks the ability to choose whichever level youd like
so once you beat it essentially all thats left is to play the game from scratch again
if you want to play that cool level you liked so much you have to play all the levels before it
sure there is higher difficulties that are unlocked but that does seem kind of shallow
at least the pc version version came with a level editor i believe so you could create your own levels and download new ones from other playersbottom line is that this is a really good experience
ive had my copy for about a month yet i already plan on trading it in for a better game
i definately reccomend renting it especially if your pc is lacking horse powerthere is a good story line on this game
however you could play the whole game and skip the cinematic scenes
they dont really tell you anything relevant that trial and error wont do for you while playing
i would buy it again
you probably wont play it again after beating new york minute accept for the special finale
if you liked the rescue of morpheus then you will like this game max payne sets itself apart from most of the other current xbox titles
while the storyline and gameplay arent totally revolutionary it does offer more than many of the quoteye candy onlyquot gamesin the game you play through a series of scenes intermixed with cut scenes that fill in the story and give context to the scenes you are playing
gameplay is simply driving max around and killing bad guys possibly having to solve a puzzle or two along the way
nothing mind bending but pretty funto enable you to take on more enemies than normal the game has a quotbullet timequot mode which is just like the slow motion sequences from the matrix
this sets the game apart and is actually useful in some battlesthe graphics are mediocre at best
scenes are generally dark and the camera can get downright jerky at some points
given that none of the scenes are particularly large and there are no large outdoor environments like halo i would have expected betteroverall max payne is worth a rent
a few solid days of play time is all you need to get some enjoyment from iti just feel that this game is bogged down with too much story and the comic book style cut scenes drive me mad
the voice acting is pretty bad like a late night bad action b movie on cable
i liked the graphics and the controls were pretty easy i spent a few minutes with the tutorial so far it is a fun game plenty of gun play and plot twists i am on the hotel level as we speak
this is the first time i have ever played max payne and since i got it for  from target it was money well spent despite the quotstoryquot  recommended to action fans but i only got it on wednesday i wonder how much longer ill be playing it
i hope it lasts longer than a noo yawk minute thoughi rented this last night and played it for about  hours straighti am up to chapter  level twotherefore as the game consists of only  chapters im gathering im near the endwell i have played enough to make a comment anyways
so here goesthis game is alot of fun
for some this may last an hour for others the whole game
i must admit that the only feature that sets this apart is the use of bullet time  a matrix style featurethis feature is the main selling point for this game and  luckly it doesnt take long for you to get use to how to work this feature
furthermore the game provides alot of oppurtunties early on to use it including a training stagealso i guess i must be more liberal in my beliefs as like horror or violent movies i tend to approach these sort of games with a bit of tongue and cheeks and maturityin other words the fact that the whole premise is based around violence and the murder of a woman and her child didnt offend me as it might some other people
might i suggest to those ppl that they stick with the more kiddy oriented games
i mean when i get a game like this i do expect some adult materialwith that said the actual impact of the violence is pretty cartoonish and really the only thing that gave me a bit of a eck factor was seeing a lump representing a dead baby in the first few scenes of the game but still this pixal generated lump is hardly going to send me into to moral tramuai mean it is only a game and its meant to be hard and gritty right 
the game play is relatively easy and though there will be times where you will die and have to resume the ability to quick save in any spot of the game allows your frustration to be left to your own skill level not the fact that every time you die you have to start from the beginning of the level again all games makers please take note of thisthe two dream sequences are not that great as most have said
i enjoyed the visuals of these sequences but not the game play
i had to use a guide to work my way through the blood lined maze as i just got to point where i was sick of trying to work it out and wanted to get back to the shooting but hey maybe thats just my own frustration with my skill level coming out lolthe controls are easy and will not take long to work out especially if you have been playing other well know game on the x boxmy major con with this game which others have enjoyed is the comic book style cutscenes
at first there amuzing but soon become tedious and i found myself just groaning when they poped up which is like every  min
i mean for me to make such a statement is rare
i love cut scenes i really do
im a visual person and i like to be able to have moments where i can sit back and watch a decent story unfold with good visual
a good example to me is silent hill  i played that game to get to the cut scenes
so for me to make a comment that these ones suck is something
maybe im just not use to the comic book style but overall it made the game seem really out dated
film noir is one thing but when your playing a modern game you rarely want to see something that deliberty dates a game
also they were just annoying
overall the game is fun and you should enjoy playing it and want to get through to the end but i would suggest hiring it first to see if its your cup of tea
i wont buy it because the cutscenes annoy me too much and really it a linear game so once you have played it your done
if you just want to replay to use bullet time it may be for you but this feature alone dont warrant a purchase in my booksfun but a rentali wish this game lasted longer
just when you get the jackhammer or grenade launcher the game is right atthe threshold of conclusion
this would make for a superb  day rental otherwise it will sit on your shelf after completion
if you find it challenging to play the game at ahigher difficulty rating then it might have some replay value
sadly this new zealand software company should have had the inclination to add a few new levels for each port but that simply wasnt the casethis game has great matrix action and good graphics and sound and music and all the performance you need thanxs to the xboxbut alot of suggestive themes and very sad and violentnot as bad as soldier of fortune for pc but still pretty badi reccomend at least year olds or older nothing below unless ya have your parents permission like i do
im you would think that lucas arts whose brother company ilm makes such amazing graphics for the movies would make amazing graphics in their video games
you would also be wrongi do admit swinging the light saber around and destroying like  droids in  seconds rocks but at the same time the game seems to have like deleted scenes and levelsthats my one complaint after beating the game they showed a movie that seemed to have nothing to do with the actual game
at no point in the game do they refer to the little kid aniken yet the entire closing movie a whooping  seconds long i might add eludes to the idea that you should have been interacting with kid the whole game
if i hadnt seen the star wars movie i would have just drawn the biggest blankso in review id wait until they break out with the directors cut version of the game so that you can play all the really cool parts that should have been in the gamechallenging but graphics are only as good as pswell i purchased this game used for about  and dont regret it
as a matter of fact id probably pay as much as  for it
since this game isnt new anymore people wont be paying  for it and thats a good thing
on the upside its a lot of fun to play as a jedi
i really enjoyed being able to use the force powers and fight with a lightsaber
its just too bad that the graphics sound and story sucki really cant comprehend why a game made for the xbox would look this bad
these are the kind of graphics that are found on a nintendo   the actual sound effects themselves arent really all that bad but dont stand out either
the voice acting is almost painful to listen to
every time i heard obiwan say a line i cringed
he sounds almost as bad as i do trying to fake a scottish accent
the story is pretty forgetful
often i would even forget about why i was in a situation slicing everything to bits with my lightsaberoverall this game isnt too bad and i think a lot of people would enjoy it
just dont go in with your expectations set too highwhen lucasarts began releasing the classic star wars games everyone was amazed
great graphics gameplay story and games that really got you into the game
well unfortuantly every game in the world cant be a classic as is the case here but when i bought it poped it in to my xbox and began playingi couldnt stop
it was fun it was creative and while it may not be the greatest game in the world it was a game worthy of buying in my book
heres what i thought of star wars obiwan for the microsoft xbox gameplay this game takes you through the life of obiwan
you start out on a planet of gang members trying to stop them from killing your friends and coworkers
you learn all of the sweet moves air jump force grab takes guns out of enemies hands force push knocks enemies on the floor or off cliffs and force weapon uses objects in the area like rocks or crates and rams them into enemies
youll also discover obiwan can do back and front flips and has one of the coolest toys in the worlda light saber
you walk around in a rd person view controlling obiwan with the left thumb stick and control the light saber when you pull it out with the right thumb stick
and the control here is flawless
pushing to the right causes you to attack enemies in that direction pushing up will bring his lightsaber to come crashing down on enemies
of course if your fighting someone else with a lightsaber you have to block his attacks use the force literally and get the hits in before your get killed yourself
its all very challenging and fun once u get farthur into the gamethe coolest part being when u learn to throw your lightsaber like a boomerang across the room knock out a few guards that have it fly back for more force flying backflipping light clashing battlenow with these skills you must somehow beat  missions and help obiwan save the worldagain
very fun in the long runand once u beat the game you can unlock new characters arenas and such for multiplayer
ill go into that later graphics this is where the game failed
there is no excuse for a game to lack graphics on the microsoft xbox
theyre better than most n games maybe even most playstation games but any system other than that could have supported this with no trouble at all
to begin with the faces of the people arethere
theyre choppy small dots for eyes beards are brown blocks etc  its uglythe worst part here though is all the freezing this game has
it has major glitches
if your in the middle of a big battle things will start to slow down the music and sounds will start to get choppy
when a lot is going on the framerate drops and everything looks like a game thatin a wordstinks
the graphics for the most part are pretty good
but nothing has any detail
there are no faces no animals in the grass no real living water
and the framrate gets so choppy at times you cant even playreally annoying
counsidering the power of the xbox all the glithces and lack of detail are inexcusable
this game might have even worked on the n and in todays world ladies and gentlemen thats sad especially on the xbox multiplayer extremely fun
as you progress through the game you unlock characters and arenas to fight in
while its only for  players it is pretty fun
you can knock your openants down fling objects into them have lightsaber battles hop all over the place fling your lightsaber like a boomerang etc  its all fun and good but  players would have been in one word awsome
and the fact that they didnt include  players is just another blown effort
this with a little work could have been a star game
but it seems like the makers got lazy toward the end and just didnt add what could have been addedoverall this is a great game especially since you can soon find it on the quotplatinum hitsquot lineup a group of games that starting soon you will be able to pick up for less then twenty bucks
its a really fun game and even the multiplayer is pretty cool
more options here would have been betterhopefully theyll make an obiwan  and put the work into a good game that could have made this a classic game
a good game none the less reccomended to all action gamers and of course major star wars fans
this wont disapoint as long as your not expecting greatnessthxobryanstarsthis game is pretty good
it has many good things about it but also many flaws
it is very cool how you fight
you dont press a button and it does the moves for you like in most games but you actually choose the way youre going to hit with the analog stick
it has a pretty good plot line
probably the worst part of it is its graphics
these are not the graphics you can expect from an xbox game
its more like computer graphics
also it gets a little old playing with the same person
i mean i know the game is about obiwan but it just gets a little boring
most games like this let you pick a different jedi once in a while or any time you want
two player is pretty fun it adds that part of a game where you can play with someone else instead of other people having to just sit around and watch
overall a pretty good gameobi wan is a great hack n slash game like jedi power battles psone or the adventure puzzle feel of the tomb raider games psone
dont get me wrong good game but psone type graphics
how the xbox can produce graphics this bad just amazes me when i see games like halo  or the cronicles of riddick
i cant believe i bought this for  when it first came out good grief
hey now their selling it for only  since it was a platinum hit if a game is at that status its usually a good sign
well knights of the old republic is the same price though really if you had a choice between the two which one would you pick
this isnt the best game out their and is now forgotten by many but is a good piece of hidden treasure
well their may be some bad graphics and some chessy voice overs but it is still a solid game filled with some fun gameplay
it may not look like much when you first see it but once you start playing through the game it kind of get addictied
the game is a little too easy and could have been worked out better
gosh i thought the battle with darth maul on the last level was going to actually be hard and well it ends up being the easiest one to me
it didnt take much time to beat it i say just rent it beat it and move on
well the only multiplayer thing is the arena
which was kind of neat but after about  times of playing that i was bored
anyways i liked the variety of puzzles hack n slash action along with some sweet force powers
you go from fighting gangs to miner to sand people to droids  you see their is alot of depth and detail in level design
if this was released on the psone this would have been awesome
as you look at other games you see their really isnt much that boosts the gameplay up its nothing special
it is fun though ill give it that but this isnt an xbox quality game
if you can get this game cheap be free to buy it but this is not worth  not by a long shot
so if youve tried out every other star wars game and are looking for something different you should probably rent it
this game is for hardcore star wars or hack n slash laid back adventure fans
overall i will give this a  not the best made game but still is fun some what
prosfun single player modeawesome level designscreative story somewhat fun missionsjedi power battles and tomb raider all in one packageconsyawnnothing i havent seen beforelousy graphicsway too easychessy graphicsoverall  commentsquestionsthis was actually the first star wars game released on the xbox so you have to give the game that tooobi wan is a real embarrassment for lucasarts similar to bounty hunter for the ps and gamecube
how a major publisher could put out such a sloppy buggy game with so little unique content is pretty shameful
those condemnations aside it has its genuinely fun momentsthe hallmark of george lucass career may end up not being the star wars series itself hes tarnished that a bit with the prequels but the creation of the lightsaber
this singular weapon is what makes obiwan the game shine and rescues it from total failure
the sound and visuals of the sabre ripping through droids and zinging scenery is just a joy from start to finish
using the right analog stick to swing the lightsaber was one of the few sparks of creative brilliance by the developers
obis sabre is the essence of fun from start to finish
every repetitive battle mowing down wave after wave of tusken raiders and deflecting blaster shots back into droids never ceased to amuse me
its a testament to the brilliance of this mechanic that i trudged through the entire gameas far as level design the naboo palace is the only bright spot in the game
its colorful and fun to explore unlike the rest of the drab uninspired game
anything the developers created out of their own imagination in other words outside of naboo is dull and lifeless
i could spend a page lowlighting all the various failures of the game like the forgettable story occasionally awful graphics abrupt and unsatisfying endgame choppy and sloppy environmental interaction on and on
but there are  other reviews that have already done that welli only want to emphasize that as bad as the game is and as disappointingly as it ends the meat of the saberswinging gameplay is such a pleasure that it makes obiwan a worthwhile taski purchased obiwan used for under  to see what the game was like eventhough it gets horrible reviews at most places and is rated one of the worst xbox games out therei was pleasantly surprised though as the game was much better then i had expected
if you are a star wars fan there is a lot to like here
players of the jedi knight series of pc games will feel right at home once you get used to the controlsthere are some negatives to the game though
as noted in other reviews the voice acting isnt great the control set takes getting used to and there are some glitches in the game
those aside there is plenty for star wars fans to like fighting along side quigonn in levels saber training with master windu and battling darth maul how bad can that bei must admit when i saw some of the first reviews for mortal kombat advance it didnt look so good
im a mortal kombat fan so i decided to give it a try
it has great graphics decent gameplay and quality sound
this game has potential to be better but it is still a solid titlethis game is too easy there really isnt that much of a challenge and unlocking shao kahn motaro and human smoke isnt really as exciting as it seems
if you unlock them you can only use them once
someone needs to find a good code for this game like hyper modei have heard a lot of people complain that this game is too hardi must point out however that there is a handicap feature which is in the options menu that makes the game much more playable
its poorly explained in the manual what you have to do to is hit the d pad up and watch the bar move until its a point that you think its oknow having said thati do think the game does deserve a second look
it had very good graphics and sound
some of the more complicated moves are tough to administer though
it also takes some patience to learn some of the special abilities for each of the players like sub zero for examplei recommend this game but be aware this is not a game you can simply jump right in and play
its does take some time to figure it outhope this review helpsthis is an ok game
the games it has on it are pacman pacman arrangment mspacman galaga galaga arrangment galaxian pole position and pole position  the graphics arent very good because theyre old games
the sound is fine
if youre looking for a serious game dont get this
some games are hard and some are easy
if you are a fan of the atari i highly recomend this game
if you get enough points on pacman you can on unlock pacattack and pacmania
this an ok gamenamco museum is a great nostalgic trip to the video game arcades of the s especially for those like myself who first began gaming with such titles as pacman and pole position
the games themselves are not new the fact that they have finally been brought to the playstation is newthe old favorites such as pacman galaga digdug pole position pole position ii ms pacman and galaxian are all here as almost pristine replicas of their original arcade forms and sounds all that is missing is the standup arcade box
recent years have seen some of these games updated and modernized in arrangement formats pacman arrangement digdug arrangement and galaga arrangementhowever there are a few unlockables specifically a tetrislike pacattack
and the threedimensional pacmania
pacattack
is unlocked by scoring a minimum of  points in the original pacman pacmania is unlocked by scoring at least  points in ms pacman
as a tetrislike game pacattack
is fairly straightforward
however pacmania can be frustrating as the entire maze is never in view only about onesixth of the maze is ever seen at once thus requiring good memory and anticipation skills to determine which dots have been eaten and where the ghosts are likely to appear as pacman is maneuvered around the mazethose who spent a lot of time in video game arcades during the heyday of these games likely encountered the same game with differing rules on different machines for example ms pacman probably had three lives on machines in one arcade while she had five lives and a higher bonus threshold in another arcade
namco museum allows for players to customize each game at will usually altering the number of lives levels of difficulty and thresholds for bonuses
for pole position and pole position ii times and qualifying levels can be customizedglobally high scores and game options can be saved to a memory card
however game data is not automatically saved or loaded
during the startup process the player is prompted to choose whether to load saved data or start anew
should a players progress change data this must specifically be saved in the options screen from the game selection menu
this is most important concerning the unlockables pacmania and pacattack
 as the player must consciously save the data to keep the unlockables actually unlockedin the end this is certainly not a groundbreaking game especially for a console as powerful as the playstation
however it is definitely worth owning for the wonderful trip down memory lane
perhaps the best part however is that there is no need for coinsive played all three games in the elder scrolls series and i still think the orignial arena was by far the best
in morrowind the landscape and culture doesnt vary very much from place to place and the combat action can get boring
it was fun in  with arena this is 
they should make the opponants appear wounded or let you hack of limbs something other than just red blood splattering when you hit themyou can still get a kick out of this game there is a lot of places to explore and many things to do
its just not a great gameafter numerous times of my computer crashing and having to start from scratch i finally got an external harddrive so got further than i ever have
im to retrieve something from a burial cave near a campsite of people who dont like you too much
not only was there some flame monster chasing me on the way there that wouldnt leave me alone after i got there which the camp people didnt help me with
they wouldnt even sell me potions or anything unless i forked out alot of gold
stupid
the burial cavern is also impossiple
you have to have magic spells or magic items
if i wouldve known that i wouldve brought all the ones i had with me
the creatures in the cave arent effected by normal weapons
not only that but im gonna have to face that fire monster on the way back and may not make it
stupid
you also get effected too much later in the game with blight or other status where you have to keep on taking special potions till youre back to normal
i understand there should be an element of difficulty in games but this is overkill
not only that but it takes forever to get anywhere in this game
theres too much to do and keep track of
id rate the beginning partsquests  stars but so far i havent felt like getting back to it so id rate it at most  stars where im at now
if you like first person rpgs i suggest kings field
think they only made those for the playstation  and   theyre about due for another oneto be fair to the game i decided to follow up this review with something i wouldve written before i got stuck
the game is pretty inventive and has quite a bit of tasks that will keep you busy
the only thing is the game seems a bit repetative
theres not enough variety and i do agree with one review i read about there not being any waterfalls bird filled forests sunrises and sunsets and other similar visual attractions
yes this game is a bit dark but isnt bad
for the time it came out the graphics and sounds arent bad
i like the first person view and that you can make it rd person to look at your character and she how awesome heshe is with hisher current armorclothingin my opinion the positives are you can bribe salespeople so you can buy low and sell high you have free reign with your character creation
you have quite a bit of options to choose from as far as character origination class and specialty there are alot of items you can find in caves homes etc you can clean out homes as long as no one is watching
i find this funny as i can clear peoples shelves and take the pillows off their beds
lol  you can also steal from shop owners
i stole quite a bit of weapons and armor from someones chest while peaking around the corner of a village not too far from the one you start in
only thing was i had to keep on coming back because i would get overencumbered
this really helped me build some money and get some good equipment
i know its not good to steal but this is just a game and if you dont get caught why not
lolin my opinion the negatives are later on in the game you get infected with blight disease and other status effects too often
i guess they want me to always carry a bunch of cure potions on me
 you end up being unprepared for some places you spend alot of time getting to
i am in one such place now
i spent alot of time getting there as well as having a flame monster chasing me
i didnt have what i needed and the people at the camp did not want to help me
this quest is actually part of the main game
casius cosus or whatever his name is tells you to come here to prove you are the chosen one some things are too repetative  people say the same things the caves look the same ive had the same armor like forever same enemies except some are blighted diseased or otherwise your quests are all the same where you have to go retrieve some item sometimes you have a hard time finding it your weapons and armor breakdown too fast
would be nice if they lasted a bit longer or allowed you to repair them yourself
i have repair vices grips etc
but the game doesnt allow me to use them for some reason some of the enemies are way too hard for where youre supposed to be in the game
i was kicking butt until i got to a place that required me to have magic weaponsskills really stupid
i dont like being forced to have to use magic if i dont have a magic based character
i find that really stupid it takes too long to get to some places especially if you become overencumbered
i was in one such place in vivee i believe took me forever to get there and back and would get overencumbered too quick
also had enemies there that kept on decreasing my stats thus making me overencumbered too quick anyway
when i learned this i would save right before facing them and they kept on reappearing after i already killed them all
maybe theres a wizardsorceror that keeps on calling them up there
who knows some towns are way too big and confusing towns like vivee
everything looks the same and its easy to get lost
i understand there should be some mazes here and there but in towns
so all in all as i said originally i give this game  stars in the beginning when its easier to figure things out and things werent so repetative but  stars later on when it gets too boring repetative and hardmorrowind overall is a decent game but it has a lot of things going against it
at times it feels more like a solo mmorpg and its not for everyoneprosplot  this is the only part of the game that i dont find flaw in
the main story is great and there is plenty of amazing lore
this is the part of the game that is worth playing
music  composed by jeremy soule the music is fantastic
environment  the island is fantastic and mysterious with an endless number of neat places to explore
graphics  the graphics are great for the time the game was released
character class customization  provides you with endless ways to customize your character though the physical customization is severely lackingconsmusic  okay the music itself is amazing
however it is implemented very poorly
instead of songs tailored to specific aspects of the game such as a main theme battle themes and zone themes there is just a handful of songs that loop throughout the entire game
this greatly cripples the environment and overall feel of the game
for example in icewind dale you have beautiful wind instruments for the peaceful town and bellowing horns for the ruins of a dwarven city
in morrowind you have a few themes including main theme that loop all the time and a few battle themes
you can be in a dark evil sixthhouse cave and hear the gorgeous wind instruments and strings of the main theme playing which pretty much ruins any sort of immersion
it almost feels like youre listening to a small playlist on itunes while playing the game
environment  while there may be some really well designed areas in this game its very repetitive
once youve seen one cave shipwreck grotto dwemer ruin sixthhouse shrine etc
youve seen them alland there are a lot of them
it gets old exploring areas that all look the same
the cities are very similar with the exception of a few such as vivec they are all just a few buildings overloaded with lifeless npcs
battle  the battle is utterly terrible
magic is generally worthless
you can have a very high destruction skill and your sword will still do triple the damage of one of your destruction spells
swords arent much fun either
melee consists of constantly spamming the mouse over and over again until it finally hits that huge creature that is practically on top of you
it is just frustrating not fun
unlocking doors and disarming traps is the same  you must spam your lock over and over again until it succeeds
very tedious and very boring
npcsdialoguequests  they lack personality
very few of them are memorable
they all feel like clones and most of them say the same thing
the dialogue is a drag and consists of pushing random wordstopics on the side and seeing if the response from npc  is different that the response from npc  the quests the npcs give you are generally errand boy quests and are very boring
there is also little reward for doing them aside from some reputation and gold
some of them are frustrating and make no sense for example the empire sends you to assassinate a group of people but if you kill them first when you come out the empire arrests you
vendorstrainers  vendors and trainers are a complete drag
there are so many of them and it takes forever to sell anything they have gold limits and you have to sell to specific vendors eg
sell swords to weapons vendor
returning from a dungeon it is an absolute pain to try to sell all of the loot you found
this may be fine for some players but most gamers would be really frustrated with this
equipment  honestly there is not very much cool armor in this game
glass armor is neat and there are some nice weapons but thats about it
combined with the fact that most of the dungeons which are mostly small and insignificant are repeats of one another the lack of equipment takes away from the desire to explore
you can find the coolest armor very early in the main story and after that there isnt much motivation to go digging in the clone caves scattered throughout the island
enchantingspell making  adds a nasty shine to armor that makes it uglier than before
its also a very tedious profession you can either pay exorbitant amounts of money to an enchanter or do it yourself with a low success rate
its overly complex and is more of a pain than its worth
spell making is not as fun as it sounds it mainly consists of combining spells you already know into another worthless spell
physical character customization  lacking not many ways to change your characters appearance
bugs  while a lot of this has been fixed through patches and expansions the game still has a lot of issues including frequently getting stuck in many ways crashing lag etcoverall i think that the main story is worth doing and the game is worth buying just for that
it takes a long time to get into and definitely isnt for everyone thoughplease keep in mind this review was written when the game was first released before any patches or even mods were released
the game is obviously quite a bit different now and would get a higher score from me certainlymorrowind the rd installment of the daggerfall series from bethesda software promised to be the first openended single player rpg game in a fully immersive d environment with cutting edge graphics length and depthwell they got the cutting edge graphics part right apparentlythe character development system is excellent plenty of options to choose from in the areas of magic melee and ranged combat and classesraces
this promising involved character creation system is intuitive deep and fun to play around with by itselfonce youve landed in the first town and are introduced to the reason youve been chosen by the emperor and are allowed to enter the outside world it can be a bit overwhelming and confusing  the game is very openendedyou can pretty much do anything you want buy some stuff kill someone or something sneak steal barter join a guild accept a quest from an npc who gives you one etc or you can just run around the world at your leisurethe frustrating and ultimately disappointing aspect of the game is how incredibly tedious and boring the game becomes after youve gotten more than halfway through the main quest where the game reveals just how shallow it really isthe vendors never carry much money so finding expensive items means absolutely nothing at allthere are only  suits of armor or types of clothing any character in the game can wear along with one or two special suits you can only find in certain areas and after completing certain quests
this simply adds to the tedium wearing the same stuff for over  levels or more at a timeit can take up to  minutes or more to travel from one area to another
and the landscape is barren boring and repetitive despite the handplaced items
everything looks the sameon top of that there are only  monsters you will do battle with  of the time in the game and you get really really tired of combating the same monsters over and over and over for  hours which is what it takes to finish the game and really complete most of the quests
if i see or hear another cliff racer im going to puke seriously
the difficulty level of these enemies never changes they are always the same
and certain areas dont offer harder challenges than others unless you want to wander into a ruin and those are of all the same difficulty level as well no matter where you are in the gamearound level  as a nord warrior specializing in long blades i could kill everything and everyone in the game with little problem at all and i hadnt even finished the main quest yet  still had at least  or more hours to go at least to finish
this was horribly designed there were no challenges left just errand running and talking to the same people over and overmagic and thief characters add some depth and muchneeded complexity to the game but they get old fast and their lack of combat ability can be frustrating ecspecially early on
you can collect and steal tons of different little odds and ends but it gets so boring and useless that its easy to give up after doing it for hours on enddespite these major problems similar to my complaints of mmorpgs the game is very entertaining and fun because of its explorative nature at first at least the first  hours making it worthwhile at leastbut once youve tried and done everything for the most part theres simply nothing more there it gets old quick and i really cant see myself playing it again any time soonfinally the system requirements are incredibly high and it didnt run all that well even on my ghzgeforce rig but at high detail it ran more than adequately
the load times are annoying and constant alsosimply another hyped rpg that is just a single player version of asherons call everquest or anarchy online
and like most rpgs of late boring and tedious despite the intrictate story line and world politics that push you alongif you are a hardcore pc game lover id recommend it but if you are not take a pass ecspecially if your pc is less than ideal for these high end gameslike others reading these reviews i came late to the game
im past the hardcord crowd by a few years looking through some of the older fare in an attempt to see what good has come before
i love the rpg genre and as someone with absolutely no interest whatsoever in the mmo craze im always eager for a good singleplayer rpg
sadly morrowind did not fulfill my interesti think most importantly i wouldve been better off going into it if i had known that the intent of the game is be as openended as possible
as possible as it can manage to the point that its difficult to say if there was a plot i didnt last long enough in the game to find outthis in turn is compounded by some of the minor ingame frustrations i encountered
a big one being that it takes forever to do anything
this of course is due in part to the fact that the world you are in is absolutely massive
unfortunately its also due to the fact that the avatar moves at a rather slow pace  even when running
and unfortunately the sidequests are usually more of the fetchquest fare that have no background or plot just minimal plodding progression
ive played games where it took hours to do one task and was invigorated
when it took me hours to get one thing done in this game i just felt  hours olderit also doesnt help that combat itself tends to be a frustration
you can equip yourself with a weapon and literally sit there clicking the mouse like crazy trying to hit whatever is attacking you and there seems to be complete randomization as to whether or not you actually hit or miss  though miss greatly tends to outweigh to hit and up the frustration factor
in general i love realtime battle so much more than turnbasedbut even realtime battle needs rules
this game feels like its creators were too lazy to think up anya personal aesthetic criticism is that im not a fan of the firstperson perspective
true you can play through the game thirdperson but it becomes almost impossible to see your attackers in combat and so is practically useless to do sothe environment of course is fantastic
the graphics arent the prettiest in my opinion but they do rather fit the atmosphere of the game in an odd way
theres a rather dour feeling to the whole experience and everything from the absolutely outstanding soundtrack to the incredible ingame design and the  degree sound alone is almost engaging enough to keep interest in the game despite its lack of immediate story presentationwhere this game really excels is the customization
i think that and the extreme nonlinear aspects are what would greatly appeal to a particular crowd of rpg fans
theres so many different ways to alter your character  both in the initial creation but also significantly over the course of the game
if you run and swim enough your athletics will increase if you use combat more than magic youll become more proficient at melee combat etc
it really is geared toward ultimately creating a unique character that fits your styleunfortunately it just couldnt keep my interest
over  hours into the game i had made little progress and encountered not even a hint of there being a plot
and so i just rather stopped caring and gave up
i love sidequests as much as the next rpg fan but i find myself more interested in the overall process if theres a bit more linearity or structure  even a sidestory to add to the overall experience wouldve been somethingthis was my first foray into the elder scrolls saga  i have yet to try oblivion  but it does rather dampen my interest
i respect and understand that customization and nonlinearity will appeal to some rpg fans but for me personally i like there to be a little more meat on the bonesi recently fired this game up again after having been lured away many many months ago by broadband and the resulting opportunities for counterstrike and the like
my first goround with morrowind had suffered from choppy framerates and blobby textures owing to my antique d card my new radeon card has made these issues neatly disappear and the game now feels like a revelationmorrowinds flaws have been neatly dissected by innumerable reviewers chief among these being the steep system requirements on the pc at least the npcs with their repetitive canned dialogue which as often as not betrays a disappointingly blithe ignorance of ostensibly earthshaking plot events the small selection of background music and the lack of urgency in the main plotthose things all bugged me in my first short bout with the game back in july but for whatever reason this time i dont really mind at all
the games virtues have made themselves much more apparent especially in contrast with a lot of the stuff ive played in the interim
one of the biggies has to be the character advancement system
the creation system has gotten a lot more attention in reviews and yeah theres a vast constellation of starting options  from race gender and appearance to birthsign to skillsets  but thats par for the course at least in yanqui rpgs
but its in the process of building your guy or gal up that the game really shines every fewpoint improvement in your scores is actually noticeable instead of merely theoretical yet at the same time its balanced so that you dont achieve the massively ott levels of worldshattering power oh look another thirtyfoot hellspawn endemic to most other rpgsmorrowinds gameplay itself is superb with solid intuitive firstperson controls manageable clickanddrag menus and an unobtrusive hud
the combat is particularly nice unlike a straight rpg youll actually need quick reactions and a steady mouse hand but luckily for the clubhanded among us your characters numerical weapon skill is still a bigger determinant of his ability to hit an enemy than your prowess at punching a lot of buttons really quickly
its an elegant hybridized system that allows for a lot of spontaneity and freedom  and its always nice to be able to escape a losing fight by for instance vaulting off a bridge into a ravine or hiding behind a boulder or levitating out of reachthe graphics are lovely from the huge variety of architecture  western halftimbered houses yurts giant ziggurats  to the monsters many of which are genuinely scary to the little details such as the dozens of differentlooking shirts pants and shoes available to the fashionconscious player
the graphics also play into what i really like about the game  the idea that instead of having all the most memorable bits spoonfed to you in a prescripted event or plot twist you have the freedom to experience your own
like the other day when i was exploring a desolate mountainous coastline during a dark night and looked up to see a fortyfoottall statue of a goddess overlooking the sea just as she was sihouetted by the light of the newlyrisen sun behind her
its neat knowing that thats a moment thats purely my own  other players might have seen it but not at the same time or in the exact same waylastly i love morrowinds atmosphere
its not perky and poppy and pinkhaired like a japanese rpg but its not stolid and tolkiengeneric like a dd or might and magic game either  its something new for once
the elder scrolls gameworld is standard fantasymedieval but this takes place in a weird gloomy corner of it like the elder scrolls equivalent of eastern europe or the middle east
weve got a distant western empire with a strong byzantine flavor ruling over an ancient and resentful people who do their best to stick to the old ways most of the games story emerges from this culture clash
theres lots of politics and paranoia and while there is a main villain theres no real clearcut force of good
and while morrowind has neither a wellcharacterized and understandablymotivated villain like jon irenicus in baldurs gate ii or a largerthanlife fanbait champion like sephiroth in ff its main nemesis feels genuinely vile using as his weapons diseased beasts mummified orientalstyle vampires infectious plagues and the very weather itself
the atmosphere is reinforced by the dozens of readable books in the game world which you can browse at leisure many of these are texts giving you a better overview of the history of the elder scrolls world and the backstory of the principal morrowind characters while others are merely wellwritten entertaining and often witty fantasy short stories that would not be out of place in a reallife publicationon balance morrowind is like its predecessors far from perfect  but vastly entertaining nonetheless and well worth the time youll invest in iti love the game
i really do
i love being able to do whatever i want
the game has flaws
one major flaw is crashing
the game has just closed out  times
it happens a lot
the game just closes out
no big deal if i remember to save a tonthe game has openended stuff
you can steal anything
there are tons of things to look at
there are also alot of different subfields of things
alchemy quests and tons of land to explore
the game though feels a little lonely
morrowind doesnt have a lot of people once you look at it all
there are mods though
there is one mod at morrowind summit which drops in people all over the place
the mod requires both expansions and another mod but works well
as for the quests fun
there are quests where you go to dungeons but there are quests where you get to do other stuff
still a lot of the time you will be in vast lands by yourselfgraphics are great
the water looks fantastic and there are tons of different things you can pick up but they all have their own models
although monsters sometimes walk like idiots they are fineactually the game does have one awesome feature that you wont find in alot of other games
a construction set lets you do whatever you want
there are thousands of mods and little features people have created already
morrowind summit has alot
i would reccomend the predator mod which just rocks but is bigoverall this game is fine
the loneliness and everything else can be solved with mods
though it can be boring when you cant walk a while without being attacked by some stupid monster like a cliff racer the game has its high points and lows
i would reccomend it though over the xbox version as the mods are exclusive to pc
there is no multiplayer but if there were it would probably cost money
its cheap now and that really makes it a good dealreviewed on ghz p meg ati rage  video  all at or above recommended hardwarethis is an open ended rpg game meaning there is no well defined plot
it is large but sparsely populated with anything interesting
you spend most of your time walking around either at either a slow or very slow pacegraphics are very much like heretic ii except they run very slowly around  fps
collisions and crashes are very common
fortunately quicksave is fast
sound is good and some of the weather special effects are good toothe user interface is abysmal  two examples
there are  seperate steps required to open a locked door with a lockpick
you know the door is locked you know i have a lockpick why cant you assume im going to use it when i click on the door
the same button space is used to talk to a person and to take an object
at one point instead of talking to someone i accidently took the vase in front of them and got attacked by everyone in the room as a thief
stupid designyoull run into a large number of npcs in this game who are uniformly and identically rude event when youre doing them a favor
its boring and annoyingin summary this game is like writing your phd thesis during a thunderstorm
rather tedious and youll want to save your work frequentlybuy serious sam ii instead
its half the price and twice the funyes this game has been bashed to death by the gaming press but believe it or not some people will actually enjoy this bargainpriced game if they give it a chance and cast away all the negative comments made by the presswhat we have here is a d fighter on the xbox with some remarkable realistic graphics and movements
the animation and movements of the fighters is almost lifelike and the power of the xbox is utilized in ways to make fabric move convincingly and so on
its amazing that d fight fans will salivate over a new bit neo geo fighter beleive it or not they are still releasing games for that system
yet will completely overlook kabuki warriors
the backgrounds are nice too with some clean d polygonal effects thrown in for good measure
any problems so far
yes
there seems to be too many variations of just one character and you wont see any of the more spectacular ones until later in the game
the default character that youll see more often than not is just a boring guy painted in a shade of white who fights with chinese stick weapons
also the backgrounds are kinda boringbut this is intended as kabuki is a type of stage art very popular in japanthe game consists of a tour mode and a time attck mode
the tour mode is cool in that you need to earn money to progress to the goal
you earn money by quick clean victories and for posing and winning the crowd during the fight
after a fight you can trade one fighter to get the best mix of weapon and styles for the fight ahead
the game really picks up when you get some of the characters who fight with the various swordssome insane fun can be had with the usual combos and air juggles you can pull off with these guyshow does it play
imagine killer instinctstyle gameplay where moves and combos can be strung together with simple button presses
persevere and learn the combo system and you have yourself a competent fighting game
if you just mash the buttons and jump around hoping for random victories then youll get less out of this gamethe bottomline  if you enjoy d fighting games and you like learning the combo and timing system then this is definitely a reasonably priced game for you
if you prefer your fighters in d hate fighters or are one of those people who just mash buttons and hope for the best then forget it
get dead or alive  insteadi have the av cord shown in the picture
the four wires at the end are very thin and will easily tangle up with each other
they will break if youre not careful with themnot bad for the price
component cable are very hard to come by for the gamecube so we snatched up these svideo cables and they worked just finesilent hill   restless dreams succeeds at giving off the series trademark creepy vibe and filling you full of despair while scaring the s out of you
unfortunately issues mar this game from reaching its true potential
first off the game is way too hard for people who are not familiar with this series
your objectives are not explained well which will leave you confused and wondering where youre supposed to go and what to find
youll find yourself constantly looking at your map to locate streets and specific locations which will slow you down
second is the controls
the combat in this game is extremely clunky and unreliable and i found myself asking why do i have to press two buttons to attack an enemy
and why is his reponse time slow
why does my camera change views for me
i liked the really creepy vibe in this game but its so hard to control and solve clues
i am hoping since a new developer is working on silent hill  that it will function properly and be easier to work with
but this game is for silent hill fans onlysilent hill  restless dreamsrestless dreams is almost the exact same game as theplaystation versionof the game
the only difference is there is an added scenario you can play through
the storytelling is very dark and disturbing
the graphics shift from dark and weird to demonic and disgusting
the sound in the game is amazing
the problem with the game lies in the repetitive gameplay
i love this game but i will admit that it has an extreme flawgraphics the graphics dont exactly look realistic but they are done in a cinematic way that will leave you breathless
the cut scenes are often short but run seamlessly into the normal gameplay graphics
the picture often has a fuzzy dark look to it that reminds me of an old horror movie
the cut scenes are done amazingly and you will find yourself immersed in the world they have createdenvironments are designed well and will even change as you go through the gameplay
one time you might be walking through a spooky hallway but after a major point in the story that same hallway has blood all over it
there is a considerable amount of fog in the game but it is not to hide graphical failures
you know this because later in the game the fog is gone and replaced by darknessthe dark in this game is creatively done too
if it is too dark your character wont be able to investigate items or his map
you get a flashlight early in the game but there are points where you will just not be able to use it and will have to figure out what to do
at the same time though your flashlight alerts enemies of your presencethe enemies in the game despite not having many of them look great
some stand like mannequins and only move when you get close enough
others with stumble around until you take them down then they will crawl across the floor
there are only about  different enemy types in the game thoughstory you are james saunderland
you have been a broken man since the tragic death of your wife mary three years ago
one day you receive a letter from your thought dead wife
she asks him to meet her in silent hill at their special place
james is unsure of what is going on but he has to check it outalong your trek through silent hill you will meet many troubled people
speaking to them will bring chills down your spine
important characters you meet will be laura an year old girl and maria a striking mary lookalike
these characters all evolve over the course of the storythe story is excellent
it does have a few problems though
one the story is very complex and you really have to think about it if you want to understand it
you might even have to talk to a few other players to even understand it
the story is left open like that
another problem is that the monsters that you face off with throughout the game seem to be an after thought
they are not truly explained until the very end of the game
i felt that it was too late by thensound the sound in this game is almost perfect
early in the game you get a radio
the radio only plays static and only when an enemy is close
this is a good way to create suspense
sometimes the radio will actually play words they you should pay attention tothe voice acting is mostly good
i felt that james felt too calm but everyone else i liked
the monsters all sound disturbing
gun and melee weapon noises are decent
sometimes the addition of random disturbing sounds really creates a great atmosphere in this game
great sound overallgameplay you start on the outskirts of silent hill
all you have is a map the letter and a photo of mary
you make your way into town to try to figure out if mary is there
you discover a town full of monsters and closed to the public in almost everyway
mary keeps sending you clues and you follow them like a dogbecause usually every other way is closed off
the game is like a mystery adventure game with some monsters along the waythis game plays out very similar toresident evil
i have always liked resident evil so i thought this would be a good thing
it is not though
the monsters in this game are lacking and never really pose much of a threat
they are disturbing but you can just walk right past them
in resident evil a zombie or a hunter always had a chance to injure you
in this game there is almost not chance you will get hurt by the monsters
when they do hit you it lacks the suspense
the monsters are just not a big enough deal for you to care about themthe rest of the gameplay has you following marys clues
they lead you to apartments museums and hospitals
the concept involves you entering a building and trying every door until you find one that works
most of the doors are broken and youll never get in them
every single building it is the same thing
once you find a key or something you go back and unlock a door
however this never gets tedious
i enjoyed exploring the various building and find out the secrets of silent hillthis game implements melee and gun combat
both are horribly done
all melee weapons in this game are imprecise and often get you hurt before you can hit an enemy
the autoaim feature in this game is horrible
you often think you have aimed but instead you will hit the wall or something
there are very few weapons even in this game to start with and none of them excite you to wield themdifficulty  note this is how much i like the difficultydifficulty is very well done in this game
you can adjust puzzle difficulty and monster difficulty separately
this allows for you to adjust the two key features of this game for your playing style
this is very innovative in a video game as games usually just have a couple difficulty settings that change everything
this game allows you to customize different aspects of the gameplaywhy did i give this category such a low score then
no matter what difficulty you put this game on the monsters will be too easy
they serve almost no purpose so its not fun killing them
also the exploration in the game is based on luck
you stumble onto things that help you
in the beginning you arent even told where to go
you just have to search the huge town until you find something
there are not a lot of suggestions as to where you need to gooverall i like this game a lot
i really do
i just cant give it that great of a score considering the weak gameplay and luckbased exploration
sound graphics and the story are great but not enough to pull this one up more
i still suggest buying this one if you are looking to enter a very disturbing world but dont expect the best gameplaydynasty warriors  is more of the same kill everything that moves type of game but offers some new modes and features
noticably it offers  player coop
it would have been classic if the p coop was on one screen but koei decided to go spilt screen
bad choice if you ask me
i hate split screnmy brother and i got this yesterday
i thought it was fun for the first hour before it got boring
as star trek fans we downloaded the demo and liked it
than we got the real thingfive days later
here are the things about itproexcelant graphicsvery interesting storyfun combatwide varriaty of ships weapons and theatresconshorrible dubbingbad saving systemfirst officer is a snichtvery scriptedyou fail the mission if you dont follow the scriptyour first officer bosses you aroundyour first officer makes diccisions for youyoure like a observer not a captainyou dont pick your own shipspeoplevery little stratagythis was by far the best ship simulator game that ive gotten a chance to play in a long while
which is why its so frustrating to have such a great game ruined by such awful bug checkingthe story is pure star trek
a star in a region of space goes nova thousands of years ahead of schedule prompting you to investigate encoutering romulans klingons and cardassians in a very well delivered
star trek tng cast members make various entertaining cameos that add a little bit of novelty without feeling like youre in an episode as an observergameplay is unique
you interact with several crew members directly ordering scans directing navigation and targeting weapons
controlling power and targeting round out combat which consists of turning shields and weapons to various targets to cripple or destroy them
this is the best part as you can take direct control to win your battles or trust your weapons officer to know what hes doing which for ai it does actually quite well
missions are challenging but not impossible at least at lower difficultiesthe main almost sole detraction is the fact that its completely broken
there are two critical missions that the game can fatally crash at and because of the save structure is impossible to recover room meaning you can be on the final mission of the game and have to completely start over because of a glitch that doesnt allow the mission to end
im unaware of a patch or workaround to correct this so you have to make it to the final mission then jump over to youtube to see the closing cinematics
that alone takes this from  stars to prosruns on vistagood storyline and game play in single player modeyou get to fight markedly inferior ships with the most powerful ship in thegame but in the last missions so many ships show up that it is still an evenmatchquick battle works wellthere are good mods for this gameexcellent user interfaceextensive use of voice actingin some missions you get romulan klingon and kessok ships in your fleetconsthe game regularly crashes especially during the campaign mode and whenusing a lot of ships in quick battlethe load game feature never worked properly so every time the game crashedor you failed a mission you had to start over from the beginning of thecampaignthe lip syncing is poorly done
they tried to get the lips to sync with thesyllables rather than the words
add the fact that the characters mouthsmove unrealistically slowly and the lip syncing becomes grotesquestealth and shadow missions in a space simin some missions you have to disable or stop a ship rather than destroyingit but the characters assume that you know you arent supposed to destroy theshipyour tactical officer is an idiot
disabling a ship is difficult as yourtactical officer inevitably ends up destroying the ship if you leave him tohis own devices even if you use the disable command
the most frustratingthing is that he cant use evasive maneuvers and fire at the same time withoutyou taking control of firingthe idea of blending the adventure and the action of star trek is fantastic and totally games and activision made a very good stab at it
from the beginning of the game you feel like youre watching an actual star trek episode with a driven story line and recurring characters
unfortunately you dont feel like youre inside the story youre just an observer
for instance you come across a ferengi smuggler whose been making illegal trades with the cardassians
the ferengi captain talks to you but its your xo who talks back and responds for you
there really isnt any sort of a roleplaying component and you wind up feeling very much like a third wheel just along for the ride and watching a moderately interactive movie where you put into action the suggestions made by your subordinates
at no point do you actually have to solve a problem yourself you always know exactly what youre supposed to do because someone just suggested it
on a personal note it took me about an hour to realize that when someone was speaking to me as the captain and a womans voice responded it isnt me who is a woman but the first officer speaking for you as if she were the captain and youre just to stay dumb and happy and let your subordinates act as your voice and mind
combat also puts you very much in the observers chair
felix your tac officer basically orchestrates the whole combat
you can do it yourself but the interface is pretty cumbersome especially for d combat
as for weapons firing if you want to do it yourself all you have to do is keep the mouse cursor within a oneinch square in the center of the screen as the target moves around and hold down the left mouse button
not exactly a massive taxation of your combat abilitiesso it sounds like im bashing the game and i dont mean to
despite this flaw it is a very fun and engrossing game
it does feel like a real episode with combat and that has been something star trek games to this point have been completely unable to emulatethe space and combat graphics are well executed however the bridge templatesin the age of geforce and  graphics cardsleave something to be desired and one you turn the sound up its very compelling and adds significantly to the sensation
the combat model is well designed creating an experience of a very colorful and explosive ballet of graceful giants
felixs dialogue during combat is a nice addition letting you know whats going on and how the ship is manuevering
damage reports are straight out of the episodes and if youre observing from the bridge as opposed to the chase camera torpedo impacts cause sparks to shoot out from consoles and lighting to flickergreatthe mission design has a nice range from the easy to the difficult usually due more to combat as opposed to intellectual challenges of solving problems
unfortunately youre left feeling somewhat helpless as you attempt to get through the difficult challenges bc again combat is the purview of felix and is very much an automated process
you basically wind up just going back to the battle several times until felix gets it rightso weve got a game with a great concept putting you in the captains chair and gallavanting around the galaxy as you try to save the federation but unfortunately you wind up feeling like an extra on the set who just happens to be sitting in the captains chair as opposed to actually being the captainit seems like in trying to blend the roleplayingadventure and the simulation genres totally games wound up creating what is more of an interactive movie and less of a game
in doing so it fails on both counts but makes such a valiant attempt that you cant help but enjoy iti have only a few words to say
excellent try but falls short in three categories  missions needs to be patched or edited for better playability especially mission cem  the ships are not powerful enough for example i never heard of picards enterprise running out of torpedoes of any kind especially the more powerful and accurate quantum torpedoes that is desparately needed in the mission pertaining to the alioth systemcem with many cardassians and  planets to deal with
last  most importantthe interface modes should have been a combination of klingon acadamyand dominion wars
my personal perference the klingon acadamy mode whereby you could use a joystick to maneuver your shipand the dominion wars mode whereas you can target any celestial object inorder to warp out of harms way inorder to make some repairs
the problem is and you trek gamers know this as well as i do in order to finish a mission you have to follow program scripts
these marks goes against the grain when compared to the televised trek series
if these attributes could be patched or added in some way to bridge commander then we will have a fantastic star trek one of a kind game to enjoy for years thank youas the title says my opinions of this game are a mixed bag
i liked this game but i wanted to love it
the developers of this game clearly invested a lot of time energy and emotion into the graphics and the story  but it didnt quite satisfy me
ive been racking my brain to figure out why and i think ive come up with the answerthey didnt go far enough
there were many times that the game would show a brilliant shine of intelligence only to fall back on triedandtrue rpg cliches
im not going to talk about the graphics since its the story and characters that makeorbreak a game for me
quotshadow heartsquot succeeded brilliantly in creating both  though they didnt exactly follow through with what they createdan interesting and fascinating character would be introduced developed for a while and then be reverted to just another warm body to use in battle
a prime example is quotkeithquot an enigmatic vampire living in an abandoned castle
when you first meet him he is a genuniely interesting character
he has a history a motive for joining the party and has some cool things to say
but soon after this quotcastlequot section is over keith just kind of tags along not really doing much or saying anything
the majority of the party characters are introduced this way and its saddening to see that none of them are developed very wellthe story starts out brilliantly battling nations political intrigue and an interesting villian all made what promised to be a darn fascinating ride
but this soon degenerated into a savetheworldfromthegiantmacguffin plot that weve all seen a hundred times before
as the game progresses important plot points that were brought up earlier are forgotten
for example during the intro movie our angsty hero gets his arm sliced off
nonpulssed he picks it up and sticks it back into its socket where it melds together good as new
when i saw this i was pretty darn impressed and wondered how and why yuri obtained this ability but this important detail was never brought up again
many plot points are forgotten like this and its a shameanother small point is that you are given the option to rename your characters which is always a nifty feature
however during cutscenes the characters are always referred to by the default name which can get kind of confusingin a nutshell when i bought the game i was expecting an intelligent game with a cool plot and interesting characters
and thats just what i got  for a while anyway
the game definitely shows promise though and im looking forward to seeing what the developers will come up with nextthis is a fairly good game
it is not a great game nor a terrible game but simply a decent game
it fails where so many do in the gameplay
the story is interesting enough the characters fairly deep but the combat is as is all turnbased combat a crime against gaming
if you like final fantasy games and are looking for something a bit darker then you will love this game
if you liked morrowind oblivion or kingdom hearts you may find this game acceptable as i did
worth a try but dont expect a lifechanging experiencethe first sh game i played was number which was awsome by the way  then i read about sh  and how it was one of the top  rare rp games to own so of course i had to have it
however i was rather dissappointed when i put the game in and started to play
the graphics on this game are really bad and the story for me was a bit confusing
also there is just so much reading involved and you cant just skip through it
sure you can just not read it but then you wouldnt know whats going on
i guess thats why the story was confusing for me i did just skim through all the talking scenes which there are a lot
your main character yuri is kinda cool i guess
he transforms into different monsters so long as you have enough mp and sp for it
the bad thing is he has so many fusions to choose from that it makes it kinda hard to know which three to equip on him
i just simply had my three favorite equipped to him at all timesthen you have some characters that are simply worthless that i hardly played with at all like margarete and zhuzhen liu
even alice is pretty much useless until she learns her ability to cure the whole partythen there are your awsome characters
yuri the hero of course
haley who is just a kid but very powerful
and then there is keith the silver bat who makes a cameo apperance in sh   and the only way to learn new abilities for your people is to play them and when they reach a certain level they will aquire a new skill
that works out great for the team you use the most but it will take forever getting new skills for your less played charactersthis game is very dark and sinnister very different from sh  which was quite humerous and sh  which was set during the great depression
i cant say this game is all that bad it has some rather interesting features such as the judgement ringthe judement ring determines the fate of your attack
if you miss then your turn ends but if youre able to hit your mark your attack is successfulanother thing thats great is that you can aquire like over  items to use on the field or during combat
some of these items are quite powerful and should only be used during boss fightsunlike the other  games you dont have crest magic or stellar charts to equip to your characters
which can be good so you dont have to keep track of whats equipped to who and leveling up your magic
however like in the other  games at least in sh  you can have the same magic equipped to  or  of your people like cure or cure all so you dont have to rely on just one person healing the party and having to keep that person in play the entire game
sure you can use your items but they normally dont affect the party as much as using your magicif you are interested in any of the sh games i suggest playing  first simply because its not connected storywise to the first two
if you played this one first chances are you would not play the others
dont get me wrong the game is good but the others are way better and hey why not add a rare game to your collectioni had just chucked in ffx moviegame horrible really sucks and was waiting for shadowman  when i was misinformed that sh was a sequel to the excellent kodelka a very very very excellent game from ps
so i bought this game
the screen graphics are an excellent ripoff of shadow madness which was a nice graphic ripoff of ffvii
the battle scenes are what grabbed me
there is a battle wheel where you have to xmash on lit sections to fight
fairly new
as the hero you can morph into a monster soul which has varied spell attributes not so new
the quality of the spell effects are a tribute to the ps capabilitiesthe story
its all about the japanese trying to take over china while the occult has its own agenda
nicely done and thank you for not letting pc political correctness ruin a gameall in all the continuity of the game is fair
a lot of political intrigue and there is the ability to create battle  parties
unfortunatley there is a boatload of xmashing through conversation but the graphics are okay even thought the level of puzzle solving is kindergarten at best
the monster graphics are  bitthis is a  hour game so i would rent it only of you have a  day pass
otherwise its a used game salewell grandia  has come and gone
i was fairly happy with the derivative story a cross between ff and bof would be an accurate description but the quest itself was too easy and briefthe good points the battle system is nice allowing for strategy in both combat and player development however see below the story if not original was at least entertaining the sound in the game was nice some parts are stellar some are merely okthe bad points this game is too short about  hours should do it this game is toooooo easy
with recovery points every board or so and massively powerful spells i never had to use an item in the whole game
i didnt use many of the spells since i didnt require them
in fact the hardest boss in the game according to one reviewer and i think i agree was made infinitely easier since one of my characters went berserk and fired off her best spell over and over with almost no time in between castingsall in all the game is fun and with the price drop it is more than worth the money
however i dont understand why people think this is the greatest game ever its not even as good as the firsti have passed this game playing it when i can
took me about a month and there are a few things that i noticed in this game that kepted me from enjoying itfirst the compass within the game is useless
if there is a logical way to understand it then im at a loss
i bought a used copy and so there were no manual associated with this game but a compass is a compass and i had a hard time knowing where i was heading and where i already wassecond the game lags a lot
walk into a town and you will notice a lot of eye candy but then you start to walk around and your running speed is that of a normal walk
the camera angles in towns and dungeons were also very restrictive not allowing me to see what is on the other side of the street because a tall building was blocking my view of what is underneath itthird i would like to mention that this game is very easy
there is no need to draw out maps or anything and hardly any needs to fear exploration
this is because there is about  save points that allows free restoration in each location
one is at the start and the other is right before a hard part
what smart players are going to do is clear the whole map and then go for a heal before meeting the boss
there is no need to be efficient about your magic since you can easily restore itthe game i believe was made for beginners
there is an autofight command but there is very little need for it since there is little need to level your characters up
the only use for this autofight command that i can think of is if you wish to accumulate a lot of money to buy the best set of armor that the current town sells to stay within level of the monsters or if you didnt find the  gold treasure box within the mapthis is a direct port of the dreamcast rpg which was popular if for no other reason than it was one of the few rpgs that made it onto the dreamcast before the system foldedthe beauty of grandia lies in its battle system which successfully combines realtime with turn based by introducing a turn time scale which runs from start to commit inputting a command to act carrying out the command and adding an attribute that affects how quickly characters travel that scale
adding this to a wide range of commands available and the ability to affect the beginning of the battle based on how you approach the enemy there are no random battles  you can pick and choose your fights lend to an amazing battle experiencesadly the rest of the game is woefully lacking
characters and plot are predictable side quests short of looking around for extra items are nonexistent there are way too many places to heal taking away much of the challenge moves tend to fall into either totally ineffectual or totally awesome
categories and worst of all the final boss fight is  fighting the previous bosses of the game followed by a laughably easy final battle especially considering the difficulty of some of the previous fightsthe game is definitely worth a playthrough especially for those who have never tried the grandia battle system but as an entire game grandia ii could have been much morelike the title says its really beefy and thick and displays a great pictureaudio but i almost broke my tv getting them on so i took some pliers and broke off some of the spiral connector to make it fit without forcing it too much
in all i wouldnt buy these or this brand again because of how difficult they are to get on truly a overkilli have both the ms component cables  the monster  cables
with monsters my picture quality increased by about 
i could clearly tell the difference between the monster brand  ms brand
the graphics in games are more detailed youll notice little things you missed prior to using monster cables colors are more vibrant  black is really black that being said these cables are a bit overrated
monsters wont improve your picture quality a lot over the ms cables  they are over priced  for a  graphical upgrade might be a bit much for most people
but if you want the best picture possible get monsters ebay  gamestop sells them for  or less  to have dd  sound you must buy an adaptor which is  bucks yes a bit much the monster cables are overall sturdy but the connectors seem to fall off quit easily  stick like glue to my tvs rear component inputsi will echo the same experience here that other users have noted the cable connectors are too narrow in diameter
i saw a frightening amount of flexing in the back panel assembly of my new sony  xbr while trying to muscle these things onto the component inputs
the set otherwise is extremely well constructed and ill assume all the hightech shielding monster displays on the box art is doing its job as the sound and picture clarity are at least as good as they should be
i did not however see an improvement over the intec multiport switched component set i had previously used
most likely im viewing the clearest definition possible through component cablesanother poster menioned using an exotic grease as lubricant to ease installation
to ease the pain i used plain old clear dielectric silicone electricians grease that i keep around for computer repair
just a touch smeared around the outer surface of the inputs will make the process a bit easierfinally if you do a lot of moving or experimenting with your game systems these are not the cables you want
due to the installation difficulty they should be considered a permanant fixture once connectedim into my rd decade playing video games
i started with role playing games in fact i started with final fantasy  no number after that i mean the original
i picked this up as i was getting tired of action games
graphics are pretty nice and the story line is decent
however i find that once i hit the  hour mark and still havent finished its getting awfully stale
and youll find three of the most inane stupid and poorly programmed minigames ever created in this single title
the most annoying is the chocobo races  how this horrible crud wormed its way into this title ill never know
it looks like it was programmed by junior college kids as a term project its completely unplayable unenjoyable and gets in the way of a mostly fine game
stupid chocobossecond place has to go to the just as silly just as unplayable and unenjoyable capture the blue butterlies minigame
and third place goes to dodging lightning bolts  times consecutively
thats right you mess up just once you start all over
if i had known i needed to complete these stupid minigames to level up my characters i would never have bothered this title and moved on to a sequel or another rpg altogether
i swear ive had more fun painting  its certainly less painfuli must say though this game did succeed in one thing it rekindled my interest in action games
so if you like to be infuriated by a game for redundancy idiotic minigames by all means buy this titlei love jrpgs and i am a big ff fan and i bought this game because my best friend suggested it to me
its his favorite game of all time
i played the game for the first couple hours it was pretty slow but after  hours it got better but this game just didnt suck me in like i thought it would
the characters are alright even though i dont like tidus
the gameplay is like a straight path its not really openworld
i like exploration and not being restricted
the music is good though even though the battle theme gets pretty repetitive fast
the turn based battle system is balanced but not very captivating
the voice acting is acceptable and cheesy at times
i will say that the movielike cut scenes are great for its time
if you are into jrpgs this game would be a great place to start especially if you dont want to feel overwhelmed
personally i think that final fantasy vi and iv are still the better gamesi love rpgs but what has happened
as everyone else says this is a pretty game but i miss the depth of what are pejoratively called oldstyle games
as a  yr old i dont need cutesy junk like tritely deep and complex characters that are so tempting to wideeyed maidens on the other hand im not necessarily looking for the blood and sexuality of a mature rated game
this game is of the former category
this game doesnt have the depth of character or story that lets one get into the game where are lifelike motivations emotion and behavior
game design companies need recognize the older gamers desires for intelligent games and hire a few less designers and hire a writer and someone who can speak english to translate games
you wont get depth here nor anywhere i admit i thought ff was close to being great
i might just buy an old bit sega and buy the phantasy star seriesim going to say the unthinkablefinal fantasy games are overhyped and somewhat boring
the cut scenes in this game are incredible some of the best graphics ive seen wedged in a game and i own an xbox
however i dont understand the mass appeal of these linear adventures
you dont control much of your destiny beyond fighting encounters
the story is horrible i cant believe people are moved by a hackneyed tale about a water polo player
the romance is infantile and definitely geared towards a young audience
beyond the interesting skill system and inventory i dont see any great rpg here and the secret is that most every title in this series is in the same format
it gets  stars for eye candy the rest is dullsvilleconsidering how great final fantasy  was  greatly disappointed me
ill start with the characters
the black mage lulu is such a jerk
it greatly disappointed me because the black mages seemed so great but then you get lulu who has way too big of an attitude
rikku is cute though very cute
tidus well hes ok not horrible but pretty ok kilmaris pretty cool
yuna is nice
these characters also have voices which is a real nice addition
then the battle system
ugh i immediatly was disgusted by the sphere grid for learning new abilities
with the aeons you only see valefor and anima in cinemas but those two cinemas are awsome
not only that but supercool leviathin is gone and so is carbuncle
the graphics are great though and the music scores are very good too
the monsters you get to battle are pretty cool looking
some boss battles can get hard but they are still pretty neat
the story is pretty well though out but the ending was too sadif this animated movie came out in theaters it would get bad reviews across the boardthe graphics of final fantasy x are a sight to behold making other titles on the ps look like something from super nintendo
i dont think its a stretch to say that the programmers of this game are probably some of the best computer programmers in the world
i love cutscenes too in videogames and always have since final fantasy  back in the day they add an emotional element to enhance the gameplaying experiencebut this is ridiculous
the cutscenes in this game go on and on and i grew very bored
now if the story dialogue and voice acting were good then maybe this wouldnt be a problem but in ffx the characters endlessly talk about things like a blitzball tournament as if its some life and death event and it failed to spark my interest
let me play the friggin game already and be quiet
its too bad because i love fighting various enemies with different strengths and weaknesses and leveling up and managing my weapons and armor and buying stuff and exploring ya know the whole rpg shebang
in this game its walk ten feettalkwalk another ten feetwhinewalk nine feetcryopen a treasure chestmoanthere are good points to ffx i enjoyed the sphere grid and the tons of weapons and items and the changing of characters during battles
and of course id sit there agape in awe at the graphics on my  bigscreen
i just hope that videogames dont keep heading in this direction where you watch more than play
metal gear solid  also fell victim to this trend
although that story was more interestingi really did not like this game as much as past final fantasy games
it had waaaaaaaaay tooo much talking
plus it was like final fantasy but on a leash
you always knew exactly what to do and where to go
in ff ff and ff sometimes it would take me as long as  weeks to figure out what the heck i was supposed to be doinggraphics   the graphics are amazing
beautiful in factstory   the story is just awesome i have never beaten the whole game because i got a little bored of itvideos  the videos are very very long
dont get me wrong they were beautifulplayability   there is very little independant action away from the stories
its hard to explain but if you like the other final fantasies u may not be very impressed by this oneoverall  it would have been higher if the game wasnt the toddler for rpgsi thoroughly enjoyed playing this game
the story itself doesnt get interesting until halfway through the game
and then you get hit with a very important revelationthe story takes place in the continent of spira
apparently this continent and its people are regularly terrorized by a monster called sin
the only ones who can stop sin are special people called summoners
the summoners have the ability to call powerful spirits called aeons which they can command to fight on their behalf
however each summoner must visit pilgrimage various temples distributed around spira and pass the trials in order to earn the right to call the spiritscharacter development is through a unigue system called the sphere grid
the sphere grid system will be confusing at first
but you will quickly learn how to use it
i suggest acquiring a strategy guide which you can order here at amazon
that might help you learn how to use the system without much hasslethe battle system is rather traditional
characters either hack slash bash cast spells etc
once in a while after building up a character can unleash a powerful attack called an overdrive
however there is little variety in the types of attacks the characters can do
if you like to hack slash bash and cast spells then i would recommend the legend of dragoon as a better alternativemy one complaint against this game is the sheer amount of repetitive random battles
you cannot walk tidus for more than thirty seconds without triggering a battle
i saw very little sense in fighting the same enemies for the  th time all in the span of an hour
basically time filler
and these random battles break your concentration away from the story and takes away some of the appreciation you might have in the fairly decent plot
i recommend this to the more energetic gamers out there who may not necessarily be looking for a complex story in their rpgfinal fantasy   i just finished the game and left with this emptiness which i do get time to time from finishing typicalaverage gamesfirst of all the highest quality of ff graphic
im sure people wouldnt hesitate to pick grphic as the strong point of ff
yes indeed it is excellent just excellent
however i thought the graphic wasnt that great
what im trying to say is that obviously the graphic does stand out however it doesnt standout pulling out ahhh or oohh
those movie scenes were excellent but other than that it was just averageif you want to witness to the one of the best graphic game try ico it will put ff to shame
to put it in detail it seemed to me that either they didnt integrate suitable graphic for the story or didnt make it smooth enough for gamers to feel comfortable with graphic
i always got this uneasy feeling about graphic of course it was really minor thing but felt like something wasnt match wholeheartedlyi couldnt help myself from wanting to play ff as i was playing ff
of course graphic texturewise ff is better than ff but hey ff was on psone
whenever i summoned aeons i couldnt help myself from thinking about summoning from ff
just simple presentation of summoning in ff was way better than ff
for instance behemoth i probably spelled it wrong in ff the execution and presentation were so messy  it didnt give me that same feeling i had from summoning behemoth from ff i still remember clearly how it used to be so awesome and so cool  i didnt get bored watching same scene again and again not only because the behemoth evoloved in ff but also the summoning scene was simple yet just beautiful just beautifulstory line is probably the strong asset of ff series and i was just disappointed
of course trying to evolve the story around the relationship between father and son was a fresh idea however it wasnt good enough to really convey the full effect
i didnt think voice acting for tidus was good enough in fact destroying the story line with sort of childish immature voice
of course tidus acts immaturally time to time but it was just way out of line
i thought the other voice actings were pretty goodstory line of ff series has been the main reason for me to play ff series and i have to admit that ff has lost its magic the magic it once used to enchant people to be immersed into storynot there anymorei would say music was what people wouldve expected from ff series
i mean it does an excellent job on creating suitable atmosphere however it doesnt live up to the legacy the ff series used to have
ff contains excellent music time to timeex the scene where tidus and yuna plays at the lake but didnt mesmerized me with itmay be the only thing i liked about ff is the incorporating strategy element to the game that was fresh enough the element for me to finish the game
not only they succeed in creating some fresh concept for battle system but also they made it much more difficult so you wouldnt just do buttonsmashing to get the battle over withi read an interview of the either producer or the director of the game and he mentioned about sphere where you can customize your character according to hisher needs and ability
personally the sphere wasnt something which it does let you customize your character easily
of course it does give you control to level up your character however the sphere system was with its own flaws as well
of course i know creating this kind of game especially when the title of the game you are about to produce is final fantasy im sure tremendous pressure is therealrite i better stop typing almost sensing flying stones here and there  to sum of the review final fantasy is overdue fori dont know you tell me
i hope they make final final fantasy where it really contains every wonderful element of the ff series and make it really long and into a masterpiece
i just cant imagine final fantasy  or even final fantasy i wouldve given this game at least  stars but had no choice but to make comparision with previous ff games and thus theres  starsok now you can throw your stonesi really really wanted to like this game
i have never played final fantasy before but have really liked adventure games like devil may cry ico oni and so on
i had heard that final fantasy was similar to those so i anxiously awaited its arrivalmuch to my disappointment i found that all the fighting in the game is turn based
where is the skill challenge or fun in that
some people may like this but i find it thoroughly irritating and incredibly stupidif i want to roll dice ill play a board game
i didnt buy a video game just to save me the trouble of shaking my hand back and forth and letting go of some dice
needless to say i have a new copy of ffx available to anyone who will come and pick it upon the plus side the story seemed interesting what i saw of it anyway and the graphics were amazingif you like psuedodice turn based combat like baulders gate another stupid game i would say this game gets a  star rating
however if you like the combat in your game to be a little more sophisticated this game only deserves a the game is not a great ff game
i mean tactics was so much betteri had this game for few years now but never really played it till now
finally i played and finished the entire game
the graphics are awesome
the music is excellent but its mostly recycled from ff
the story is lame a weak aspect of this game
the main character or you battle your own dad as final boss wtf
then yuna gets married to some fag while its evident that her hole is itching for tidus all along
is this some kind of luke im your father ripoff with some wacko marriage inbetween
the variety of enemies is low its just different color and element of the same beast
the weapons system is lame
the experience grid is pretty good though
the world of spira has some pretty parts but overall it was pretty boring there are only few real towns maybe  the most
there are no real rpg connection between towns or areas
there are no dungeons in this game or almost none except for omega ruins
wtf
the limit breaks are retarded
and all the characters look very nippy they obviously want to be wannabe white too
wtffirst half of this game was pretty fun but the second half went off the cliff it became very boring
the levels were pretty lame and boring especially the puzzle parts so called cloister of trails another wtf
no comparsion to the genius level design of ff such as advancing the pagoda in wutai and getting levithian level shinra corporation getting new characters television march etc endless zany entertaining levels wow i still remember
the world map design was horrible you pick areas from a list
many aspects of ff were dumbed down the title of this game should be intro and demo to final fantasy for newbies x the final boss battle was disappointing its a small circular blob with  small tentacles
the ending is painfully average
final boss and ending are way worse than ff 
there are very little sidequests and requires huge nerdy effort for small crap
overall an average effort by squaresoftgraphics   story   music   combat   adventure   enemies   character   dungeon design   stagelevel design   town design   world design   easter eggs factor   minigames   weapons system   fun   overall every aspect of this game is worse than ff except the graphics
this game made me miss ff this is just plain foulhopefully ff will be better than this ffsquaresoft for the first time will make final fantasy games for microsoft  i sense doom for playstation ive been a final fantasy fan for a long time so this is truly an unbiased review
it breaks my heart to give this game three stars but i have to say that if it werent for the character designs the cut scenes and the music this game would probably not even make three stars
while i do agree that this final fantasy made a great breakthrough with the effects everyone should know that there is a problem with the gamei would highly recommend all who intend to play this game to get a strategy guide
unlike the past final fantasies such as vii viii ix which could be played through with no problems and extreme difficulties of course unless you want to get secrets and side quests done then a strategy guide was probably needed ff x will be a hard one to get through without a strategy guide
why do i say this
well there are parts in this game when you have to go through a kind of test called trials in temples
to avoid spoilers i will not specify why it is just a necessary part for the plot
there are many trials during the gameplay for which you would have to walk around in mazelike areas moving spheres around to reveal new paths so that your character can move on
sometimes making the wrong moves will get you stuck not being able to get the story going
so now some extreme ff x lovers are probably saying only stupid people cant figure this out thats the challenge duh
or things like that
of course i do realize that it is possible to move along and get things right in these trials by yourself without any guides
however it will be very very timeconsuming
believe me some trials get  complicated how are you supposed to know exactly where to go which sphere to move where
and then when you walk around for a while doing the wrong thing you have to undo what you did and then try to remember what you did so that you dont do it again
i just dont see a point in wasting all that time walking in the trials
and then oh yeah did i mention there are no enemies in the trials
basically you will be wasting your time wandering around figuring out what exactly to do and while doing that walking around you will not be able to build any experience points during this time wasted
thus it will not help you develop the sphere grid which is a new system in which characters use experience points to learn new movesmagicup attributes
yes i know what they were thinking adding random battles in trials will break concentration in trials
i guess that makes sense too but with or without battles the trials will be very annoying to figure out without a guideso if you do get a strategy guide then you will be able to get through every aspect of the game
so everything is solved and this game is awesome again yay
well not quite
i have a high expectation from my gameplay and by this i mean when i spend time playing video games i want to enjoy the playing experience as much as possible
i dont think reading the strategy wordforword during the trials trying to figure out exactly what to do referring to the book then the screen is an enjoyable time spent
it really takes you out of the game  in the past when i used to read any strategy guides it would usually be after i have beaten a game then it would be interesting to know what i have missed such as items or special charactersevents
then thatd be interesting to know
and usually these secrets will not need steptostep instructions that these trials require
i think these should be easily memorable so when you play the game you wont have to read the guide while you play again
ff vii was so much better in this aspect there were optional characters you can get limit breaks but none of them requires you to memorize things such as turn left at second corner remove the sphere and put it on the pedestal walk back up again now turn left at third intersection blah blah blah which is not possible anyway
when i first played this game i liked it ok mainly because it is final fantasy after all
i actually gave this game a five star review a few years ago
however now having just continued to play from where i left off last time i looked back and realized that if i had not purchased the strategy guide i probably would have stopped playing way before the plot intensifies
i never did finish the game  the plot despite the hype did not really attract me so much that i felt the urge to find out what happensall in all my main suggestion is to get a strategy guide so you dont spend hours in those trials
other than that the plot sphere grid etc everyone has different tastes for these so my opinion will not be valuable to others and thus it will truly not be fair for me to judge the game on these issuesits a great game but i miss that ability to revisit past location after your character has grown more powerful
still had a great time
to much effort on character voices than on actual game play
jody bissoonive tried to play this game a few times now and it just never seems to grab me
some ff games are tons of fun right from the start and this one just seems boring to me personallyok this game was not too shabby
it had graphics that would blow the house down and the voice acting made charactor developement a whole lot better however there were some serious flaws that prevent it from being an excellent game
does tidus have an uncanny resemblance to meg ryan
it does to me and it drives me crazy especialy when he makes out with yuna it looked very wrong
then theres seymour his voice sounds like peewee herman on steroids and his hair style was bizare
i was a little disapointed with the plot twists or lack thereof
they stuck to the main plot which in some games is not a bad thing however it became very boring in this game and the plot twists made me very mad
like auron being an unsent or tidus and jecht being a dream which im still confused about made me rather upset
and the ending was very poor
some people say it made them cry because it was so moving
i cried because i wasted money on a game that was too easy and very boringto all final fantasy veteran  i would wait on this one because its not worth the money
until it reaches the greatest hits list and im sure it will then i would get iti am a very experienced gamer started around  i have played a lot of rpgs
i honestly cannot believe the hype around this game
let me elaboratethe graphics are almost perfect and really give u a sense of being in spirathe sound is great sometimes other times average
nothing too memorablethe most important part of an rpg is the character development
i could really care less about these characters
the main character is wimp
the sphere grid did not work for me ether
some people might like it i did notthe story starts out great and has an opening scene as good as i have ever seen but thats as good as it gets
not to mention a lot of the overall theme really does not make any sense
the last half of the story was sooo predictablethe battles are good but way too much cinema and after u see them over and over it becomes quite annoying
if have  or  cracks at a boss you have to watch the same cinema over and over
the aeons are cool but honestly is this final fantasy or pokemonsquaresoft needs to tone down the cinematic aspect and just make the game more fun
i had more fun with chrono trigger  years ago
and i think i am going to buy the ps version and play it again
better then average but not up to par with other final fantasysi thought that some of the game was a fault
the voices could be sappy and the story could make too little sense at times
example the encounter with sin early in the game and then people are in caskets and yuna does a sending like  seconds after the attack
by this time i expected people to be finding dead bodies in other words the time frame was a little off
atleast i feel that way about it
but on the good side it made me feel good because i could sympathize with the characters the only other thing i didnt like was seymour
his story was given away far to soon in the game
 stars for what it is  stars if x where factored in and you got it all in one game also get rid of  the crappy voices and confusing  time linei dont want to sound like a hater because i finished this game  times and so found it enjoyable and found its faults easilyi know a lot of you guys will hate me for this but
ff lacks what a lot of the other ffs have
personally my friends and i think ff was the bestgreat story ok graphics a huge mystery awesome characters and much much more
also characters in other final fantasies have more backround and certain quotissuesquot to deal with
thats what i think ff lacks
also it was kinda cool that ff had tons of cussing in it and serious more quotgrownupquot issues
thats something newwhen i bought this game i was expecting another rpg gaming masterpeice from squaresoft buit that was far from what i got
in the past squaresoft has released many fantastic titles including the incredible final fantasy series
this game however is not the final fantasy that i have grown to know and love
althogh the game has still lived up to the series beautiful landscapes incredible cg sequences and well designed charecters looks are not everything and this game lacks a lot of everything elsefirst of all it was to short
i found that i had beaten it in about two weeks playing for an hour or two per day
strangely the creators decided to leave out many of the classic final fantasy systems
they made it so that you do not levelup your character instead you must earn ap points to slowly complete a confusing sphere gridalso they threw the origional worldmap style out the window
the origional was actually a mini version of the planet that you walked around on to get to your destination and would be able to fight monsters on to gain experience
now it is just a piece of paper with dotted lines
adding to this you cannot travel to different places other than that of the plot line until the very end of the gamethey trashed the combat system so that it has not even a hint of realtimein other words you can sit for  years in battle if you like without a monster attacking you and you cannot pause to stop the ingame timerthe character personalities were not very realistic and often left you thinking man those people are really weirdthe voice acting was laughable
the character voices did not enhance the game at all in fact i found it annoyingthe plot of the game was okay but it lacked interaction
you have no actual participation in the plot as you sort of just fill in the blanks so to speak
almost like watching a  hour movieif you have never played a final fantasy game before you could probobly enjoy this otherwise just rent it
in fact if i had never played a final fantasy game before i would probobly give it four stars
in the end the game is not horrible but had a lot of unused potential
there are better final fantasy titles out there and i suggest vii viii and ixthis game is alright
it looks beautiful in cutscenes but not as good the rest of the time
the story is interesting and characters are fine but i didnt really care much about any of them except maybe auron
i wanted more to see the plot unfold
the battles are soso because summoning can be fun but the fighting is not very entertaining otherwise and it is just turnbased
the music is nice i enjoyed listening to some of the songs but there arent really any cutscenes with songs with lyrics like in kingdom hearts or ffx
its more background music
its too bad you cant choose difficulty in most rpgs because i am stuck on yunalesca and ive tried over and over to beat her and cant
so i may never see the ending
but most people can probably beat the game i just get stuck a lot
anyway this game is worth renting and if you like it you should buy it
this isnt really a memorable game overall more for the graphics but there are other games with equal graphics
ive never been a big fan of final fantasy because i never seem to be able to finish them and the battles are so boring
i think zelda or kingdom hearts is betteras a  year old gamer i have grown up playing every final fantasy game
i must say i am a well experienced fantasy gamer
final fantasy x is not a very exciting game
i hate to admit it but it is the truth
i would never speak it if i wasnt so completely disappointed with this game
i read some of these reviews and all these people keep saying that one of the best additions to this series is the voiceover where the characters actually talk so you no longer have to read
i am at the point where i want to turn the volume off so i dont have to hear these people talk
their voices are so annoying
it really makes me feel old when i listen to these characters with their slang
are kids enjoying this
would i still enjoy this if i was still a kid
is this game going to be a classic to the younger generation
i used to get attached to the characters instead i am resisting to play the game altogether
but there is more
so much more
the length of dialogue the stupid blitz game and hardly any fighting compared to older versions of fantasy
im old school
i enjoy reading the dialogue unless they speak really fast like gabe in syphon filter
i can handle that
i also enjoy walking about in the game
some independence to where i feel like i am actually playing the game not sitting through a movie scene sighing after one movie goes on to the next
i have patience but i also have a life
i cant get attached to a game for an extended period of time
when i need to go i need to go
the waiting during these movie scenes last quite awile at times with no way to save it
so if one starts you are stuck watching it or else youll have to quit and do it over next time
squaresoft what ever happened to the classic final fantasys
simple yet so intriguing
all they have done to the final fantasy series is turn it into a graphics display
graphics are awesome but the play is always greatly decreased with each new series
the most exciting part of all fantasy games for me is the battle scenes
when i get stuck being able to run free once in awhile i just fight monsters after monsters
i want to get my fun time in before the movie starts back up again
that is what final fantasy has become
a movie with hardly any interaction
and when you get interaction it is brief so you better enjoy it while you can
at one time i was onesided when it came to final fantasy
i liked the game so much that if the game sucked i would still find something i liked about it
but that is all over
this game is a disappointment to the series and a disgrace to us experienced final fantasy gamersnow for someone with an actualgamecube system this rd party brand madcatz makes a great controller buy if you own awiilike me you may have problems
on the wii the contoller works great for actual gamecube games for some virtual console games and wii games that are compatable with a a gamecube contoller like the recently releasedmario kart wii the madcatz brand should be avoided at all costs
not all of the controls works with wii games compatable with a gamecube controller
for gamecube system owners this is a great controller
for wii owners like me you are better off using agamecube controllerofficially made by nintendobeing a big ufc fan and having dabbled with martial arts and groundfighting in the past i was looking forward to this xbox title above all others
the screeenshots looked great and the official web page sent me into a frenzy
i never owned a dreamcast but i have friends who loved that version and others that loathed the playstation edition
i was hoping that the designers had ironed out any bugs from those installments and the xbox would provide a better system to present the complexities of true nhb mixed martial arts fightingunfortunately after the long wait it could not live up to my high expectations
while the designers have done a great job making the fighters look like their realworld counterparts they could have done a better job on the shading  and textures
all the graphics look a little unfinished to me and when the action gets fast they can get really glitchy
ive noticed that when throwing punches and kicks the fighters tend to flicker or blink
once you notice it it becomes hard to ignore and very irritatingthe gameplay is a little lopsided as well and its far more strikeoriented than id like
in the arcade mode the first night i owned the game i got  victories in a row using tito ortis and all i had to do was punch punch punch
i liked the groundfighting a lot more which isnt surprising for those who know me but victory seems to have a lot more to do with chance than skill
while i really liked the realistic submissions and takedowns most of the grappling is clunky and not very fluid at all
it seems that they have a ways to go before they can really simulate the feel and flow of this type of fightingits not all bad though
i really liked the create your own fighter feature
i was disappointed that royce gracie wasnt in the game so i made my own version of him
there are lots of different advantages you can use to specialize your fighter and several different fighting styles
on the down side i wanted to create tank abbot but the game doesnt seem to offer a model for the less quotdefinedquot body types
seems sort of unfair
i was hoping the unlocked characters would be actual fighters but most of them turned out to be fictional characters more at home in a quotstreet fighterquot game than the ufc
the two exceptions are referee john mccarthy and my personal favorite ice t  yes that ice t  i got a good chuckle out of that oneso far the big saving grace of the game is playing with a friend
i played it for a couple of days alone and was very disappointed
when a buddy came over and we started playing it i warmed up to the game considerably
the ai is nothing compared to a real person which is true of most games
this game is a great distration and the quickness of the matches is nice when you dont have time to get into something longterm like nfl fever or halo
its a pleasant distractioni would suggest to anyone looking to buy this game rent it first
it has its high points and big ufc fans will undoubtedly be interested but the flaws are not easily ignoredits a good game specially if you play it with a friend but the move list doesnt say what are you doing
for example it tells you that standing up when moving forward you can press x and y or a and b or b and y or x and a or a or b or x or y and so on but it doesnt tell you what each keystroke does
you have to experiment a lot and start to figure it out and it takes time because it doesnt respond exactly the same specially if your opponent is making hisher own movesthe level of gore doesnt do a lot just add some blood drops on the matt on its max level but thats itthe fights can be very very fast specially if you and your opponent dont know exactly what moves are doing and that will happen because you wont know wich combination of buttons to press in each situation youll encounter
you will probably end up pressing a couple of combinations for every match and thats it or maybe connect the other control and play against your self to try to figure out what does what and how each character respond to what you have foundi really recommend that you find yourself a guide or something if youre planning to buy this title
or rent it beforehandall that said its a fun gamei played this dvd game for all but two hours and got tired of it
it does feel like you are truely on another planet and the visual animation is very realistic eg
rippling water ect but it is very hard to control your movement and the two centeral characters are terrible actors and i hate hearing thier voices
the puzzels are solvable but not brain teasers just having to write simbols on paper and copy what they sayi hate copying
most of the puzzles are not logical if you work with them enough you can solve them without even thinking
a cut scene or two at the beginning at least would have been nice instead of that cheezy narration and slide show
what else is there in adventure gamescontrol irritatingpuzzles mindless at timesjust take notescutscenes non existantcharacter interaction non exsitant except for brief ghostly visits which you cant talk tooacting terribleone thing you want in an adventure game is at least one of these things to be good
i have played adventure games in the past and for a while they were good but it seems lately they are just cheezy puttogethers
i guess because pc games are mainstream and most mainstreamers like actionif you like pretty java effectsdvd buy it otherwise dont waste your moneythis game came the closest in rivaling mysts amazing sense of aestetics and attention to detaili also recall being impressed by all the movement animation that played in between clicks thereby erasing that fake feeling of just magically floating from one hotspot to the nextsome of the puzzles are indeed infuriating but there is no shame in using a walkthrough when you have gotten to the point past fun and still have so much left of a beautiful alien world to explorethe graphics in schizm are beautful and the story line is interesting but everthing is brought to a jarring halt when the player comes face to face with one of the absurd puzzles
most involve mathematics and one even presupposes a knowledge of basic trigonometry
i mean reallyi didnt care all that much for trig in college
i dont want to pay money to have to do trig nowallow me to try and write a review based upon countless hours of play and analyzing the layout and structure
first this is a x deep strategy title
when first starting the game leaving the help hints on and seriously reading them can help you better understand the workings
the manual i use only to look up a reference if something is confusing me aka
what casus belle was
if you try to understand the game by reading it cover to cover you wont succeed
it takes time to understand how the game manages the ai  and yes you will be using the ai
in lots of cases
the programmers wanted the gamer to feel like hes the leaderpresidentemperor of a galactic civilization not a viceroy of a particular planet or solar system therefor micro managing is definitely out of the question
looking back over your systems from time to time to fine tune is what will get you ahead not working out each detail of each planet each turn
another part of the game  shipyard construction can be very confusing if you dont know how each style of ship can be used
the only way to decide is to play create ships and see what happens
its now second nature to me to create fleets and ship types but it took many hours of understanding before i could finally do it on the fly
this review may sound cryptic but really the only way to understand the game is to dedicate and play with an open mind and a willingness to use your imagination
i personally believe that the ai
could have been fine  tuned to balance ship and troop construction it seems to build too much of a certain type
the game is slow but consuming
i recommend it for anyone who loves deep strategy and has a willingness to learn
it could have been better though
try to borrow or rent before you buy everything bad that youve heard about this game is true
but after playing it for a while it got rather addicting
when i first started playing it i couldnt stand it
but out of shear boredom i kept at it
after some time i couldnt pull myself away from it
now its still not as good as moo
i still find many faults in the game but for some reason i cant stop playing itthere is a certain feeling of being disconnected from what is going on
with little input from you the game will kind of play itself
also i find it frustrating that you cant tell planets what to build or more importantly what not to build
in a large game you can have hundreds of planets under your control and it just isnt feasible to go through ever one of them telling them to make certain things
for examplei have tons of ground troops already yet the game keeps building them even though i want my planets to build ships instead
there is no way to just tell all your planets to just build a certain thing
and when you are under constant attack and ships are running low its enough to pull your hair out when your planets keep making ground troops that you have no need forit took me a long time to figure out just how combat occurred
you can only take  groups of ships into combat at a time
each group can have  ships making a total of  ships in each battle per turn
the instruction manual says you can have more but ive found it to be a rather useless and inaccurate source of information
it took me forever to figure out that if i wanted to invade a planet with ground troops that i had to send only  groups of combat ships and one group of troop ships
if you send more your troop ships may sit on the sidelines as only  groups total can be involved per turnwhen i defeated the orions i got nothing special for my trouble
no super weapons or special ship class
you can find anteran artifacts but they arent quite what they were in moo
im not really even sure why the orions are even in the game as they make no contribution to it
they never go to war against me i cant steal any of their technology because their boarders are too well protected
they seem to have no real function at all in the gamei had a lot of false starts when i started playing the game
start a new game get frustrated and just start a new one
i think most of this was just from a lack of understanding of some of the basic concepts or more so that the instruction manual doesnt explain them at all
here is a couple examples of how inaccurate the manual isthe largest group of ships you can have is called an armada
in an armada you can have a total of  ships
but when you read the instruction manual it says it has  to  shipsthey have types of ships in orderinstruction manual  in the gamelancer  lancercutter  cuttercorvette  corvettefrigate  frigatedestroyer  destroyerlight cruiser  light cruisercruiser  cruiserbattle cruiser  battle cruiserdread cruiser  battleshipdreadnought  dreadnoughtbattleship  super dreadnoughttitan  titanbehemoth  behemothleviathan  leviathanjust look at that discrepancy
the manual is full of them
who wrote this thinganyway for all its faults i still find this game very addicting
im not saying i love it but i cant seem to stop playing itits actually not too bad
but lets get the bad out of the way first the battle graphics are pathetic
the world map graphics though are very pretty and stylish as are the animated races which are all artistically done
the problem lies in tedium
answering all your diplomacy messages in a large game is mindnumbingly mundane since youll almost always accept proposals presented by other races
also a big turnoff is the lack of automatic upgrades to your ships
you must do these manually
its not a big deal since you wont have to do this often but it seems sort of unnecessary
another very significant problem is the insane mediocrity of the first twenty turns or so
this time is spent almost entirely on colonizing other planets give or take some turns depending on the size of the galaxy youre in and how many races you choose to surround you
one more problem lies in the ai of your governers
you can turn them off thankfully but then you have to make all your build queues manually and thats also a bit of a chore since construction takes much less time than say civilization  so a lot of time is spent readjusting the three queues in your planet bases
also youll never want to control the realtime battles nor will you want to watch them since the graphics are disgustingly bad and the gameplay for that part of the game is weak
now for the good the game is very surrealistic the music is fantastic the graphical style is pleasant to look at and neat little touches such as being able to see your forces blow up entire planets or invade them or bombard them with longdistance starships
thats the cool part of this game seeing all your work put to good use creating massive armadas and armies in dropships
basically capturing a planet comes in three simple steps eliminate space defenders unload all ordnance on the planet next turn and send in your ground troops and give everyone orders
its very nicely done
or if you prefer you can just blow up the planet with a planet destroyer
all in all if you can look past the faults of the game im sure for many itll just be too much to handle youll find that its a nice piece of software that had a lot of effort put into itfirst ive owned and played moo and moo
a lot
they were greatand i still play moo occasionally
moo appears to be a natural evolution of the game and it has great potential
butthere are plenty of bugs in the game and a pot full of inconsistencies
the first patch is out but it does not make any claim to fix all the bugs andor correct the many flaws in the game
my advice wait for version  hopefully by the end of the year my guess not theirsthe biggest problem for me anyway is getting used to the ai
actually there are two of them one for the computer players and one for you
the ai for the computer players needs work and the developers know that
but if you can live with the strange way it does things eg
going to war for no reason then declaring peace two turns later and declaring war again two turns later etc
 you can play on
im not sure but it may be possible that the ai cheats
in all the games ive played the computer opponents were always far ahead of me in everything ships weapons strategy money etc etc
they can be beaten but even in easy settings youll have to work hard to do ityour own ai known as your viceroy is a macromanager
you have to give it some guidelines of course but then it takes over and manages your affairs for you
micromanagers beware  you only make it harder by constantly fiddling with settings for your individual planets
another quotbutquot  you will want to get involved in some micromanagement anyway especially ship design and some building lists
you have to learn the hard way what your viceroy does well and what it doesnttheres more  you travel between stars on starlanes just like in space empires iv
that makes for some interesting strategy
it also makes the game really really slow
research is another tedious process
you spend lots of time and money researching the empty spaces between objectives
combat iswell its slow too and you dont have a lot of control
also all ships have to be assigned to task forces
im not sure why this was done but i find the process unnecessarily cumberson
and ships that are not assigned are just not available for anything they dont even show up on the map
ground troops are managed in much the same way
i find all this too complicated
individual ships cant be upgraded you build replacements and eventually get rid of the obsolete onesthe game manual is best described as skimpy
it usually tells you where the buttons are but it gives no clue about why and how anything works
its printed on dark gray paper in point type so if you use reading glasses you can only read it in bright direct sunlight
the illustrations are black on black and very smallif you were thinking of buying the official strategy guide my advice is dont
it was apparently writen for the beta version much of the information is incorrect lots of things are completly missing and some advice is completely wrong
check out the forum insteadin summary this may yet be a great game when all the bugs are worked out
in particular the viceroy is a cool idea that simply needs more work
right now its a bit of a challenge to play around the bugs and shortcomings and because its so slow at first i find the games not a lot of fun
while youre waiting for the next several patches i recommend galactic civilizationsthe socalled x games may not be my forteacute but i cant see how moo really fits into the category of game
you need a great deal of patience and a desire to drop interactivity in exchange for thoroughness of simulationoh you can do everything in this game
you can terraform
you can conduct diplomacy invade other planets build ships and raise armies conduct research bomb another people into molecular components
but somehow none of that is fun here
the graphical interface  what makes a game a game  is so minimal it just takes away the fun
there are too many options to set tax rate spending on various sectors intent of ai governors and too many discrete possibilities within themconsider dark reign  which is an rts and not quite as grand as most x games
you can discretely set your units to scout seek and destroy or hold their ground
in moo you have a continuum of  to  this invites ridiculous levels of fine tuningcombat is about as exciting as playing my atari to be fair its more expansive than gal civ i in terms of what one can do but just not as enjoyable to play
okay i really didnt enjoy either that much but gal civ at least makes you feel like youre not some bored intergalactic bureaucrateverquest shadows of luclin sol is the rd expansion to be released for everquest
as such it offers many great features which many players should find encouragingthe most obvious improvement is the graphics engine
given the massively multiplayer nature of everquest it was impractical at its original release to make the game intensely high graphic because transferring the data to display highpolygon characters and environments would have restricted the gaming audience far too much
given that the average pc these days is much better than the average pc was when everquest was first released most players should be able to handle the immensely improved graphics engine with relative ease
the most obvious example of graphical achievement are the character models the polygon count is over  times higher in some models and the attention to detail is magnificentmany higher level gamers were also complaining about the lack of innovation towards the end of everquest
sol contains over  new zones for players to explore many of which are intended for high level players as well as an intense alternate experience system designed to let high level players improve their characters in new ways
also sol introduces a new character class and a new race offering new character combinations for a wider variety of gameplayof course all this comes with a price sols system requirements are in most cases more than double the original everquest system requirements
windows  users can no longer play the game and i myself had to upgrade both my processor and my memory in order to support it
the recommended specs are a  mhz processor  mb ram  meg geforce or better video card and a cable connectiontalk about harshbut not so harsh when you think about it
everquest needed to upgrade their graphics and keep their old players around in order to compete with newer mmorpgs namely dark ages of camelot and most of said mmorpgs have system requirements around the same as those of solit still hurts to think that someone might not be able to play because they cant afford to upgrade their system thoughi saw the movie and i loved it
then the game came and i bought it immediately
three days later i put it in my game drawer and left it with my n and psx games
its been there for over six months
the levels are challenging but there arent very many and none take more than an hour
pinhead bowling does last forever and its the closest to two player the game has
get codes too
the codes are great
i give it three stars because its a good game but i wasted  and so will you if you buy thisthis game wasnt that good
sure the graphics were great as long as u were outside
the inside was too dark and the moves werebland
once u beat the game on super hard took me about  or  hours u can play through the game as the green goblin
u get his glider and his surpreme weapons
u also get to face a new green goblin w that
the gameplay is fairly easy and gets boring
definately a rental but not a buyps
i love spiderman sadly this game wasnt that goodthis game seems like it could be a lot of fun except i cant get past a couple of fundamental issues
the hardest part of this game is dealing with the poor camera and control
it gets really fustrating quite quickly rolling around in a corner as the camera moves around and the control direction changes
there are  camera modes passive and active and neither seem to do anything different
a chase camera like tomb raider would be a welcome feature
the camera also whippans in and out of the camera hemisphere while crawling around so some people will probably get motion sick
also its very easy to lose track of enemies locations the camera focuses on the character and suddenly theres a bunch of guys right behind you
also when trying to look around spiderman gets in the way as its a behind view vs pov
i want to fight the bad guys not the camera and controller i think ill probably put this one up on ebayspiderman the movie game for game cube had the potential to be great but falls short due to the fact that spiderman is a wimp and a sucka that can be beaten up by a street thug in this game
by the way i have had to write this review more than once as it seems like my previous review has been accidentally deleted or something of the sort so i am going to keep it short this time
the game follows only parts of the movie and has a few additional supervillians  shocker scorpion and vulture
these additional villians are a good thing since they make the game new and refreshing from the movie
spiderman is one of the best d designed models out there and the movielike cinematics are fantastic
play this game on normal difficulty and everything is fine but play it on superhero difficulty and it is atrochious
the enemies on superhero difficulty seem to have a constant lock on spiderman even when spiderman is attached to a ceiling way above them and they cannot see him
plus three hits or so from an ordinary street thug and spidermans health reaches zero
it is a bunch of crap
this matter is only made worse by the fact that spidermans combos are much less effective on superhero difficulty than on normal difficulty
the camera angles during webswinging particularly when you have to make tight turns while chasing an enemy are atrocious at times
spiderman can unlock oodles of threebutton combos in this game but only a few of them are actually effective especially in the final fight against the green goblin
and i found at least one case in which a combo was identical to another combo with completely different buttons and name
i doubt that this crap with identical combos is a gliche that simply occurred on my spiderman copy that i purchased from sam goody for 
spiderman has no sort of fighting skills in this game because he is a wimp and a sucka in this game
spiderman does have some cool abilities though like webzipping and web tactics such as the web dome and impact webbing
this game was still fun while it lasted but it also was far from the spectacular game it could have been
by far my favorite spiderman games are maximum carnage and separation anxiety on the sega genesis
nintendo sega or whoever should remake these games for the game cube as i would be willing to pay  or more for these games
however please do not come out with some port of a sega genesis gameits probably the best spider man game ever the story
well its the movie story
youre spiderman you real name is peter parker
you have the spider habilities
you can crawl walls and everything cmon you know the story graphics theyre really good
d graphics one of the best gamecube graphics the cg animations are perfect sounds the voices from the characters are directly from the movie
w dafoe as the green goblin tobey maguire as the spider manpeter parker fun once you beat it its not that fun to play again
ok there are extras to access
but pressing the word arachnid in the cheat menu you get them all so but when its your first time playing its a great game
great bosses not too hard not too easy good battles good ambients and everything is fine educative no problem here
you just kick bad people
gang ones bosses who are making civilians insecure no problemif you are a spiderman fan there is no doubt you should buy it
if you liked the movie or the comics but you arent a fan you should rent it or buy it depending on how you liked itjust be sure
if you dream as a kid was to be spiderman this is the right game for youactually i give it  and a half stars
solets talk about the futurethat was a line from gil mars in small soldiersbut anyway anyways spiderman the movie for nintendo gamecube is an alright gamenot goodnot badjust in the middlethe bad things about this game are that you cant go on the street or sidewalkon certain levelsand it is hardwhich then gets boringthen you give upthen you play againand so ongraphicssoundgameplayat first  after awhileoka short game that well is fun fun fun fun and thats how it should be its spiderman while this game may be short and does seem to grow a bit boring it still gives you the spirit  stars is for this game for being fun its that simple so thats explained over with and done decent gamethis spiderman game is based on the movie
it is a d adventure game featuring all of the movie spidermans abilities
it is moderately difficult
the camera angles are poor and the character controls are stiff and reaction speed slow
i thought the stealth mode was not implemented very well as most of the time you have to fight the same people you could hide from anyway
the graphics are mediocre at best
the music is pretty averagedespite my criticisms the game is somewhat fun
there are surprise attacks that you have to dodge as spiderman would
there is a decent amount of robustness to the level of interactivity with the environment
for example you can pick up throw or kick objects
the objects have different physics such as rolling for tires and explosions for certain containers
you can climb on walls and ceilings and shoot a web to pull yourself to a wall or ceiling although you may not shoot diagonallyadditionally the controls are explained well and are fairly intuitive
if you are a fan of spiderman or d adventure games you might want to give this game a try
otherwise i would tread carefully and not spend too much money renting or buying thissure its spiderman and all they even added in movie scenes for everytime you beat a level but some parts are dizzy i got a headache on a couple of levelsthis game is a very decent title
using your web diving through the cities and everything is very cool
the one thing i think the game lacked on was the fact that the levels werent that long and the storyline wasnt original since it was based on the movie
i think batman vengeance totally dominanated this game with storyline gameplay and graphics
the one thing spiderman beats it on is replay value
if youre looking for a good clean adventure game go for this titlekids like this game but if the kid is under  it is a little difficult
i have average kids and one who is very smart
the very smart one is the only one under  who will even try this game with out getting fustratedthis game is cool when you first buy itbut then it gets very boringi got the secrets very fastand if you are not fan of spiderman dont waste your the game isnt at all what i thought it would be
it gets kind of boring with you doing the same thing over and over again
all you really do is kill the bad guys that come after you
its not even challenging it was really easy to beat and once you beat you wont have a desire to play anymorethe graphics are good the camera can get annoying when it doesnt go the way you want it to especially when your fighting an enemy
areas can be way too dark to see where a bad guy is
dialogue can get somewhat annoying sometimes because they repeat the same thing over and over
gameplay is alright but ive seen a lot better
if you want a superhero game dont get this one its not worth the money
rent it firstwell this game is good
the graphics are good and it is fun
but the down side is the camera
i found it too confusing to control spidey
i prefer the control of halo or max payne to this game which reminds me dreadfully of resident evilsif you like spiderman get this game
the animation is good and the extras to unlock are funa little for the adult minded but fun indeedi found that my tv had too much red and had a halo like haze around him but after some adjustments i was able to be happy about itthen it gets too hard and very frustrating
im not a spider
i cant seem to find a way to crawl all the way to the top of the vultures home
the controls are solid
the combos are pretty cool
the game seems big enough
its challenging and fun at times
i can only play the same level about a thousand times before i get too frustrated to continue
ive got upwards of  games and this one is smack dab in the middle
if youre a big spidey fan like me get it
just dont be surprised if it gets too hardthanks god i got this game from a friend of mine i borrowed the game from him and the game was good yeah but very very hard
and no im not really into spidermanthe graphics  are very detailed and smooth specially in the outdoor levels the lightning effect of the game arent that perfect
the characters here are well detailed as well as peter parker with the exception of mary jane she just doesnt look like kirsten dunst
the cutscene are very well implemented it looks like a real movie p yeah and i mean it my only complaint about it is that there werent any english subtitlesthe outdoor levels are sooo great and they can be repetitive it looks exactly like ny and sometimes you can see the ubisoft logo on one of the big buildings awesomee
and abuout the indoor levels they arent that special good but not specialsound  music  about the music
well theres nothing special on it but yeah they are cool once you play level two and three they will get very repetitive thank god they have a long lenght
the reason i gave it a  star rating was because tobey mcguire did the voice for the game i dont really know if kirsten dunst did hers
but when you are fighting a foe or something the lines will get very very repetitive specially spideys some of them are stupid anywaygameplaycontrols  the camera angles and the save system arent very good cause sometimes you wont be able to see the enemies cause this stupid camera will get stuck and you wont be able to rotate it the save system is a pain similar to buffy the vampire slayer there is no checkpoints after all
if you die at the end of the level you will have to restart the level again
and is not good in the last levels cause you need to avoid these white robots which is not easy spiderman has some nice combos to pull off they are located like some sort of secrets however it wont be easy to do this cause the buttons layaout arent that good they are chunky if you know what i mean you press the punch button and  seconds later you see spiderman punching is lacking response the difficulty in this game is sooo hard and i started this game on normal and i found it veryyy hard and frustrating specially when you are fighting this green big bird he is throwing bombs at you and since your bar is too well damned low an overexageration of the game developers you will die instantlyif you are a fan of the movie take this game however if you are not avoid it since is lacking a good control responsive and is lacking some other things mentioned abovei like millions of others flocked to see spiderman the movie back in may of   i loved it
i saw it a total of  times in theaters
so when i saw the game i had to pick it up
and pick it up i did and played through the entire thing several times
but something was missing
heres what i thought of spiderman the movie gameplay its a very fun game and this is its strongest point
you can in  words do anything spiderman can
you can swing around the huge cities beat up thugs with over  different moves you unlock new ones buy getting golden spiders crawl on any wall etc  you can shoot web do web domes protect you from enemy gunshots etc  you can also crawl anywhere you can get your fingers on hang down from a sort of web rope and spy on unsuspecting enemies
the whole thing is really quite fun and while ive owned this game for  months i still pop it in and swing around spidey style every once and awhile
thats how good the gameplay isthe problem here
there are only about  levels most fairly easy
and while going back and playing them on the harder setting is fun its not half as fun the second time aroundas for playing it on the harder settings there are  easy normal hero super hero its almost impossible on just normal
easy you can beat in  days but the rest  the enemies strenth twice as strong the enemies atacks are twice as strong your web supply goes down by almost half
its just way too hard
it gets to a point where your almost scared to go down and fight a thug because youll lose so much of your health
hardcore gamers will find the first  settings difficult while casual get stuck on just normal while even hardcore awsome never die gamers will get stuck on super hero
its added depth but its also really annoying
id give gameplay  stars graphics fairly good
you can see the web perfectly spiderman looks awsome
the worlds are beautifly annimated and each are fairly large
the problem
the faces look terrible and there arent enough character designs too many of the same people
when you tie up enemies the webbing jut looks likethere
it doesnt rap around it just looks really bad  when your fighting thugs or people or whatever youll find yourself fighting dozens of people
yet there are only  common types of thugs two types of business men two types of guards you get the point
if your sitting there fighting off  people youll notice that  look exactly the same and the other  look exactly the same
its like your fighting an army of clones
very dissappointing otherwise the graphics are very good
but counting that last comment i have to give it  stars options probably the games weakest point
no multiplayer or player cooperation would have been really cool
no real bonuses or unlockables
there are some minigamers like pinhead bowling or the big brawl but nothing that will keep you playing the minigame for more than a few minutes
and the freedom that this game could have built uponjust isnt there
being able to look for crimes and stop them seeing huge cities from spidermans point of view and getting to explore a full new york city
that would have been coolbut they didnt they just went by the story
and while the story in this game to go with the movie is great i think it would have been cooler if u could have had some freedom in between missions
the way it is you are confined mostly to the insiden of buildings having to go a specific way with no freedom
its still a fun game but didnt take advance of what in my mind could have made a great game
 stars sound the games strongest point
voice acting by the actors from the movie it really adds to the experience
as for the characters not in the movie extremely well done
even the casual look mommy theres spiderman from a little girls perspective is done to perfection as you often feel like you are living in spidermans world
the villains sound evil and menacing the thugs soundlike thugs  and everyone really clicks to a sort of new york feeling which adds to the gamethe web makes sounds swish swash
really cool
the gunshots sound real and scary the fighting scenes soundconvinving
other than that this games sound was awesome
 starsoverall i really liked this game
its fun to go back and play and theres enough positives to compete with the negatives
id definantly recommend this game if u can find it for a good priceas long as your not looking for perfection you wont be disappointed
a pretty good game compared to past spiderman gamesthxcel damage is kind of a hard game to review
the characters are atrociously freakish and sometimes annoying the difficulty can be quite unbalanced sometimes and you may be forced to replay levels tons of times to beat them
however cel damage shines on through these shortcomings with a genuinely fun experience
the main mode smack attack is very fun to play
smack attack is basically a deathmatch mode in which you must score  points before anyone else to win
each time you kill an enemy you gain a few points
there are some truly insane weapons in this game
chainsaws bombs shrink rays and baseball bats are all fair game in cel damgae
this combination of bizarre weapons and high speeds your characters are all in cars makes smack attack a ton of fun to play even if it does take some time to get used to
the second best mode of play is capture the flag in which there are several flags running around throughout the environment that you must collect and transport to a certain point to win
every time you die you lose all of your flags
this can be extremely frustrating because you could be playing like a pro and have  of the flags and then someone comes out of nowhere and kills you
the best strategy for ctf is to simply wait at the end point and kill the people who come near you
the last mode gate rally is the worst
its basically a checkpoint race but since you can get thrown of course so easily it gets quite frustratinggraphics sound playability entertainment verall cel damage gets the reason there is no season mode is because of the title march madness  which means this is a tournament game
that is why there is only a tournament mode
if you want to play a seson with out all the march madness buy ncaa basketball k if youve never played smw before nows your chance
do it
its still a great game and this is an amazing port if youve played smw to death on snes ugh
this is tough
since the gba doesnt have a  button layout as the snes controllers did theyve had to improvise a bit
spinjumping has been relegated to the r shoulder button and its awkward
very awkward
even after all of these years the feel of the orginals controls is still etched into my brain
playing a game religiously for over two years will do that i spose
i honestly dont know if i can get used to this set upthe mario games are always fun and this one is no exception
the level designs excel even more this time with flexible routes
theres a lot of action that will please both kids and adult gamers
marios positive attitude just keeps the game such a pleasant experience
now why cant they improve the graphics
the colors are too bland and the characters too fuzzy
gba can do better than this
i look forward to improved texture rendering in the next appearance by mario and friendsi really cant tell you if this is just great or bad
mario games are fun but to tell you the truth justgetting to old for thisprosgreat gameplay and great for shutting up ya kidsif ya have anylots of levels so it will be long and entertainingtatics needed a little a bit
need to grow ur mind dudeconsdont ya ever get tired of jumping on thingsya might play to muchtry to look at ur self in the mirror if you have the secondportalble games are bad to small and kinda gets you dizzyplay as a frenchitalian multicultural idiot or idiotsluigisuggestingtry to make kids play itnot urselfif you like super mario bros then you will like this too
its a good mario game
seems like a classic
it has a old time feel to it
it reminds me of the really old mario games from years and years ago
its one of the better games you could buy right now
i like it alotmario games as of other platformers always were a bit of a challenge for me my person srtong suite is fps games however i enjoy a varity of genres
this game though makes me mad
im simply stuck halfway through i know what i need to do but i just dont feel like replaying this one level just to find some key or something of the sort
doing the same mission over and over gets repetive to me  however this is no different than any other mario game so i cant fault it for that
if you like mario games youll like this game but if youve never played a mario game before and are easily frustrated id suggest to stear clear of this game or any other level based platformers like iti have owned serious sam second encounter for more than a year now but i never play it
but just today i thought id give it another go
after my experience i decided to write a reviewto begin with serious sam second encounter is a gorgeous game
the graphics are amazing and the music is awesome and really gets your heart pumping
on those qualities alone i would give it  stars
this was actually my first firstperson shooter since my days of playing doom
naturally i was amazed at the difference in graphics and gameplay
serious sam was way more advanced than doom
however i have played many firstperson shooters since my purchase of this game a year ago most notably return to castle wolfenstein and no one lives forever  and  and i have to say as nice as this game was when i first bought it there are a lot better games out therei had purchased both the first serious sam and second encounter at the same time
about halfway through the first one i gave up and found cheats for it on the internet
why
because this game is virtually unbeatable
there are no difficulty levels to choose from which is insane since the whole game seems to play out in what would be one of the highest difficulty levels if it had any
at any time in the game you have about what seems like  different species of enemies coming at you in groups of a dozen each
this hardly seems fair
i know i know
games arent supposed to be easy but this one is just downright frustrating
you have things coming at you from the front the back the sides up in the air and sometimes up from the ground
there is no way you can keep track of and eliminate all of these threats especially since they all seem to keep multiplying
so in other words unless you are in god mode you just keep dyingand dyingand dyingso in other words serious sam second encounter is for serious players
anyone looking for a challenge will sure find it here
but for anyone who wants any sort of a chance to win a game without first suffering from a stroke i suggest staying away from this one
like i said the game looks great
but you know the old saying
looks arent everythingthis game is just well my title describes it
i would like to know exactly what these croatians were on and where i can get some
imagine your most bizarre dream or drug trip and combine it with quakeyeah quake
this game really could have been made in  technically it doesnt impress and could very well have been released as sharewarebut hey its cheap
id buy it just to see the guy with the pumpkin on his head and the chainsawif you like serious sam also check out will rockserious sam  the second encounter is a first person shooter it is an expansion pack but you do not need the orginal game to install or play
the single player gameplay is excellent the gameplay is just shoot every thing that moves and proceed to the next level but it is still fun playing
the level design is superb with very long levels and lots of enemies but unlike the first game there are many jumping puzzles and they not fun playing which is why i gave it only three stars
the multiplayer gameplay is not that great but the cooperative gameplay is outstanding it is one of the best cooperative games i have ever played
serious sam is built on the serious engine
i played it on the opengl video mode and it runs great
directd is also available but not as polished as opengl
the game runs great even when there are hundreds of enemies on screen at the same time
serious sam se is an excellent game if you like doom type fpsthis game is very refreshing
this game has no pretense of trying to tell a story or even acheiving any type of objective of course theres a plot to it but very thin and only found in the instruction bookletall this game tries to do is get you wrapped up in its trippy light show tron inspired world
the gameplay is ridiculously simple
pass a cursor over enemies as soon as you can release button zap enemies
simple as thatthis game is more of an experience than anything else
the epic final level will really impress youthere isnt much staying power though
youll pretty much beat it and move on
but if you have the funds to hold on to it instead of trading it in for another game youll probably come back to this game every now and then just like a favorite movie or cdjust think of this game as the jupiter and beyond segment of  except shooting stuff and making it go boomi was hoping for a lot more than this when i first heard about sonic making its way to the gc
but in realization this game could have been done a lot better
the game offers intersting gameplay the choice between hero and dark but the disparity lies in the unbelievable easiness of this game
despite the fact that sonics and shadows levels are obviously the best and most challenging the rest of the game is either tedious scavenger hunts or just too simple
i was alos expecting a lot more improvement over the dreamcast predecessor
albeit does look a tad more sharp the graphics still dont live up to what sega is capable of prdoucing
along with other camera issues and less then stellar sound i still give this game three stars because it will satisfy the sonic afficianados out there to a certain extent
but if you have allready played this for the dc then this port really offers nothing newsonic made its debut on the sega system
ever since it has been the corporate icon to sega
just like crash bandicoot is to sony or a more prominent example mario to nintendo
when xbox and gamecube came out sega was how should we say it in deep trouble
it conceded giving the rights to games away such as crazy taxi
it also sold some gaming rights to select companies either nintendo or microsoft
sonic was handed to nintendothey took sonic tales knuckles and dr eggman and worked out a plot and made some new characters
all together a good idea but it needs some work stillthe gameplay is very odd
you can be on the dark side or on the good side
the good side is sonic tales knuckles etc
on the sega the bad guy was dr eggman
knowing you cant build a game mainly on one player they added  other people
rogue a copy of knuckles and shadow a copy of sonic
each level is identical for both good and evil but the story line is different
also it has the gameboy advance link
i dont own sonic on the gba but what i know is that you can import chaos sort of like pokemon and be able to interact with them all in d on the gamecube
all in all a good idea
the problem
if you ask anyone what the most boring part of the level is they will say the hunt for the master emerald series
every  or so levels you go on a quest to find  objects hidden
it is so incredibly boring you will give up have the time
also some levels are unfair and involve trial and error methods
you are invincible in a sense too
you collect rings but when you are touched by and enemy or an object you lose all your coins except for  that will spring out from you and you must get them
if you are hit when you have  coins you die
you can also fall down which happens all the time and you will immediately die
those  parts alone make me so angry
it is also too short
the multiplayer could use a definite upgrade
there are not many options to use and some of them are pretty much one sided
such as should i choose tails with  stars or the chao robot with only 
hmmmm with all the problems i can do nothing but give the gameplay a as all my other reviews state gamecube graphics will knock your socks off
sonic adventure  battle stays true to the promise of killer graphics
everything is in d really
however there are camera issues
you cannot really pan around to well
you cannot set the camera to one spot making backing up dangerous for you dont know whats behind you
because of the camera issues im going to give the graphics an the sound itself is not that great
there are no many sound effects
the music and voices though are fantastic
all players have perfect casted voices
there is also great music
all players have different sound tracks
the best thing is you can hear all of them from the sound test option
despite the bad sound effects i cant complain about anything else
sound gets a when i say speed i dont mean how fast sonics feat are
im talking loading time
it takes a while to load a medium time
it would have been nice to see it go faster but its not painfully bad
speed gets an average  gradethe controls are above average
they do have some bugs in them though
you also have a problem with choosing what you want
you have a varius amount of moves to do and you must perform all of them with the a and b button
some special moves are hardly performed because of the confusion of button control
if you decide to buy the game you will immedietly notice something is just not right with the issues controls get a replay value is easy to execute
you can replay any mission differetly  times
you play each level with a select goal then you can play is  more times with a different goal each time
such as in the first level you slide down the streets on a snowboard
your object is to avoid the bad guys
after you beat it you may play it again this time you must collect  coins
multiplayer always adds more points to the replay value but i still suggest you dont buy it because when its over its over
replay value gets a sonic adventure  battle which is technically  not  because a previous game doesn not exist is a nice game to play but becomes boring when you beat it
there are not to many levels and by playing about an hour a day you should be able to beat the entire game in  weeks
if you have sonic on the gba you probably may want to buy it just for the special things it gives you for your chaos such as power ups and special chaos only found in the gcube gamelets reviewgameplay graphics sound speed controls replay value total  giving sonic adventure  battle a there are cheats but only for the chao world
ill give it an extra  because of the cheatsonic adventure  battles new total is  giving it a  a slightly below average gamei loved sonic back in the days of the d side scroller
but now that sonic is in d i just dont enjoy him as much
besides that there are a few other things that take away from the game the graphics are good but by no means great the camera angles tend to become a problem when moving around large objects during cutscenes the music sometimes gets so loud that you cant hear the characters talking controls seem oversimplisticbut on the other hand the sonicshadow levels are fun the chao minigame is pretty cool and the game is easy enough for younger gamers to play but challenging at the same timesonic is great
it is everything else that drags this game downjust likesonic adventureand latersonic adventure directors cut you have secondary characters that you can play as
so please sega stop itthe game is sonic adventure not sonics friends have a tea party and if time permits perhaps an adventure
which i think well see as a  releasealso they have ruined the characters that were great
i used to love knuckles but in this game his controls are bad and levels are awful
i used to love tails but in this game he is in a mech suit
thats right a giant mech suit for no reason whatsoever
the evil versions are exactly the same
robotnik is in a mech suit rogue is a female knuckles etci play sonic games for sonic not for his possesonic heroescontinued this increase in the number of playable characters which also increased how bad it wasdo yourself a favor  pick upsonic adventure directors cutor one of the collections of old sonic games likesonic mega collection plus psfrom what ive read from a lot of the reviews here this game is pretty controversial
many thought it was awesome while others completely hated it
i myself think this isnt a great game but its not a bad one either
one of the best things about this game is its transfer rates
when the characters are blazing through levels the game never gets choppy and slows down like goldeneye did a lot
its graphics could look a bit better but still are exceptable
the whole concept of playing in hero or dark mode is very interesting and helps the games replay value
one thing that really gave this game a kick in the balls was its music
 of it is horrible corny power ranger type music that only has about three lines of song and keeps repeating
i just mute my tv most of the time when i play this
the best feature in this whole game is chao
little cute egg like creates kind of like tomagatchis
you hatch them from eggs and rasise them from infancy to maturity
the style in which you raise them effects how there perosnality and appearance will look
if you spoil them and and never play wiht them they will be on the dark side and look black
if you treat them fair and play they will have a halo and be white
you can even breed chao to lay more eggs
this feature is completly addictive and by far the crown jewel of the game
sonic adventure  battle isnt going down in history as a game like super smash bros melee but it gets the job done
plus theres so many goals to accomplish it will take forever to completly finish the game
i give this a  out of what does a dedicated sega fan say when he sees the sega logo slapped onto a gamecube game
slowly it registers into his sluggish brain then the dupeweed mutters ugh sega and nintendo
collectively together
flabbergasted he questions it to no one particular
he is frozen in wonderment
ummm
no freakin way dude
sorry to break it to you pal but the sega dreamcast may it rest in peace has slumbered in its grave for two years
at the present the total considerable force of sega has just launched to unleash a potential ferocious beast
with an arsenal of sega games deploying in every respectable console the future is shaping up as stunning as never before
among the foremost games to illustrate this contemporary beautiful relationship is sega releasing sonic adventure  battle on the ever impressive gamecube
if you previously settled in the nest incubating thrills with the dreamcast version i wouldnt suggest buying the game because basically you get the same hatchling with an exception of the minority of sound upgrades
nevertheless if your hands havent poked fun into the blue hedgehog and the rest of the bigger gang then thats a different story
or is it
does an unshakable hindrance knock sonics velocity off the tracks and into the grimy mud
indeed it doesyes it should be a merry stroke of grace to see sonic the speedy hedgehog and his few buddies alongside him
well
make that a bundle of buddies
a solid lineup of characters have been summoned into flight bringing the likes of amy and the metal sonic plus others from the ancient ephemeral cartoon
amid the cast are a pair of newcomers shadow a darker version of sonic and rouge the riproaring bloodsucking bathosting a crazy degree of swifter gameplay the singleplayer distributes everything from the dreamcast precisely and imbues it in the gamecube equation
players are to select if they are to rescue the planet on the hero side sonic tales etc
or overpower it in the ominous path of the dark side shadow rouge etc
in its current repute things echo a reasonable magnitude but the unforgettable parts of sonic adventures  battle is playing as sonic or shadow and no one else
moving in inconceivable speeds the two take wing over flashy cities pyramids and through other realms within the  stages
both the hedgehogs dole out the elfin sparkle of the game
in those seconds the game felt like a tony hawk game on steroids grinding cars rails and into the extremes of jawdropping visuals
the added characters on the other hand lose appeal after due time
tails and dr eggman who ride fat machinery basically play like a shooter in lackluster cyclic fashion
remnants of play tilt on scavenger hunts and duller missions
there is diminutive accentuation on what made sonic on the sega genesis treasured
deficient on sweltering action the respect for sonic is now in evanescencestages are technically troublefree retaining a difficulty of a walkover
yet the biggest grievance the mammoth of all disasters in the game is the camera
its so problematic sticky and infuriating that itll aggravate a twoyearold
if you thought sega would return to their blueprints for the gamecube port and fix the disorder your hope is crushed into futility
the camera direction so weakly constructed gets plugged up into walls runs all around the screen and stays frozen in some structuresas for the trappings on the gamecube sonic adventure  battle is quite a flare on the multiplayer spot
expanded nicely over the dreamcast the game features  playable characters in new fiery headtohead competition
the games includes a multitude of extremely worthy action such as kart racing hunting and other splendid but not groundbreaking multiplayer goodnessnext stop the graphical estate
the gamecube port looks much much superior over the dreamcast
running on a breakneck fps its surprising my tv hasnt been caught on fire
texture wrappings are clear and beautifully bright
slow down is abandoned where it belongs no where
the stages are presented in several kind of themes such as military bases and flaming places
despite the horrid camera disease sonic adventure  battle lives as one of the uppermost wow factors on the platform genre
on its audio turf though the game fails to devise something worth listening to
putting the loud crisp sounds of gathering coins or splashes into water the music is terrible lifeless popish music
the tender and placid music really makes me want to pound the electricity out of my tv set
and as you may have suspected it gets shoddier with the voice acting
written pointlessly the story is just a heap of even more who would have thought that the two rivals back in the bit days would combine forces
hell i never expected it
as for sonic adventure  battle in my book its worth a try but doesnt come up as a certified must
fond of my bit memories of the blue speedy mohawkstyled hedgehog looping through endless tunnels the newest installment ranks below expectations
i was expecting the glory of marios jumped from the snes to the n
with a horror show of camera displeasure one has to really why sega has not revised its biggest franchise when they apparently had the time
if they had installed improved camera behavior this would have been a commendable possession on the flythis game doctor is just  a simple game polisher the liquid they give u is either water or brass polish because wen i used it on my final fantasy  x it did work but it shaves a very thin layer off that means if you have big scratches dont buy thisi too have a disc doctor though mine is a musical disc doctor
as such i feel that there is little i can add that is different from the other reviews
however i do not feel that this product is a waste of money or a hazard to your cd collection
it is a simple basic use tool to give you hope of maybepossibly bringing that destroyed disk back from the edge
i used the cleaner on a bad copy of a sega dreamcast skies of arcadiaa good game too and it smudged the whole thing up and made it more unplayable
but the numerous music cds i have used it on have come out better from it
just understand once this has been used on a cd it is on limited time
your best bet is to fix a cd then copy it assuring it survives somehowfirst let me get this out of the way no this is not another gta  far from it in fact
there im donenow with all the hype this games been getting i was shocked when i ended up with what was seemingly nothing more than a long excruciating version of final fight and unfortunately thats all this game ends up being  a beatemup that goes on for way too long
it might be a bit more bearable if they gave you some variety in your missions but the majority of the missions end up being either games of fetch find package bring it here hide n seek find and kill victim before he escape or bodyguard selfexplainatory
all these missions end up doing is making a long game even more tedious
combine this with a lack of a multiplayer mode and youve got rental written all over this gameto bottom line it soe is a long shallow beatemup that youre gonna tire of in a real short amount of time
stay away from it unless youre either a hardcore beatemup fan or you just enjoy watching people gush copious amounts of blood
and allow me to repeat something just in case you forgot this is not another gta there now im really donei remember playing this way back in the day
i remember it being a ton of fun
but back then were simpler times i guess
the game is fun for what it offers but it doesnt offer much
other than mass murdering the civilians walking around in the  levels theres nothing to do outside of the main missions
combat is enjoyable in short bursts but theres not much variety
punch kick a  attack and various firearms
multiplayer is fun enough but it gets stalewhen you first see this game it seems really cool
and your right it is really cool
but when you buy it and play it for over  hours then the cool wears off and you begin to grow tired and boredom begins to set in
this is a really fun game to play with your friends even though it is only one player you both can play at differetn times to see who can get the most kills
there are hundreds and thousands of people on the screen at once making for a very very fun game and it is also visually atractive
you can choose betweeen a multitude of weapons such as the ak or colt graphics sound replayibilty online nomultiplayer no  playeroverall it is a nice game but the fun doesnt last longthis is the perfect title to rent
its fun the graphics are very good
the atmosphere is immersive you really get a sense of being in the middle of a riot
you get to beat the heck out corporate drones and rentacops
its a blastfor a couple of days
unfortunately the game gets repetitive and formulaic after the th mission or so
this holds true for both the chaos mode and the story mode parents who are reading this should be warned this game is incredibly violent there is an option to turn off the gore but at its heart the game is about shooting stabbing hacking and beating people to death
dont say i didnt warn youafter having played the  games listed in my title i have to say that this game is the lesser of the   if youre looking for the same gameplay as gta iii or max payne you will be sorely disappointed
gta iii has a great interactive environment and tons of varying missions
max payne has a self adjusting difficulty level and introduces the new bullet time allowing you to slow down and take better control of the situation
this game is just an endless slug fest
the story revolution mode is fun for about  hour at maximum
the missions soon become so dull and repetitive that you want to claw out your eyeballs
then theres chaos mode
this could have gotten the came recalled like gta iii if it didnt impose points penaalties for killing civilliansocasionally
you run around killing corporation forces and gang members for points
this is the point where most people who have played this game are thinking hey
this should be multiplayer
but its not
this game isnt quite as disappointing as this critique may make it sound but it wont be winning game of the year any time soon
you do have to hand it to rockstar though they can have a lot of people on screen without messing up the frame rate or graphic quality
but if you have  bucks handy get gta iii or max payne before you have to settle for thisi got this game hoping it would show true chaos and the more sinister side of being human
unfortunently i was dissappointed
the first mistake rockstar made is the citizens run around mindlessly like schools of fish
there is no one busting windows throwing things or fighting with each other
i wanted to see what a real riot in progress was like with all the trimmings
the second mistake was the repetitiveness of it all
protect joe schmo deliver this kill this guy
battling the same guys over and over again seeing the same places over and over again and doing the same kick block punch moves over and over again
i might as well be at work
third mistake poor ai
nothing feels as good as seeing the guy that your supposed to protect get hung at a corner and hence pummled to death by your persuers or he saves you the trouble and jumps in front of your gunfire or bad guys shoot walls or each other and not you
all of these dont happen often but they are noticable
on the plus side is the unbelievable amount of people moving
too bad they arent really doing anything
people like to say the graphics look awesome but i beg to differ on that
gtas better than that
notice how the glass breaks instantly on soe
no bullet holeswebs or large portions that didnt break but are still breakable
buildings that you destroy repair themselves later and items disappear
these graphics are average at bestbottom line forget this game
if you got gta put the liberty city survivor code on for some real urban rioting
up the gore with the gore enhancer code and get set for some real fun with no extra expensesrockstar was the king of the moment with their huge success with grand theft auto  for the playstation  people were hoping for the same quality game when they heard about state of emergencyunfortunatly the quality was alot lessinstead of a realistic cartoon world of violence state of emergency gave people a horrible anime cheap arcade game
to compare this game to grand theft auto is to compare need for speed with crazy taxisure a game like crazy taxi is fun but after  minutes you realize how cheap the game is and how repetative it becomes
the same is true for state of emergencygraphicssound and musiccontrolfun factorreplay valuetotalyou might not regret owning it for about  dollars
i feel bad for the people who paid full pricedont they test and play games before they sell them
geezto be honest when i first got word of this game i was skeptical on why everyone thought it would be like gta
i didnt expect it to be that good as far as fun factor and i was right
when you play this game you should just expect a riot game and no more
i had fun with this game because its a guilty pleasure and i think everyone would like to be in a riot if they didnt have to suffer the consequencesstate of emergency offers plenty of weapons to defeat the evil corporation and their efforts to monopolize everything
also you get a small set of renegade anarchists that sport a list of moves that will get you into the feel of the fatal fury daysonly d and a lot more gory
of course recent rockstar games gta max payne have presented the players with a fair amount of gore
soe doesnt fall short on that aspect
you can blow people into pieces and then use the pieces as weapons use a shotgun to remove a head grab helpless rioters and fling them to the ground and beat them senseless and much more
its shere violence at its bestalthough a little redundant at timeswhich brings us to the most obvious reason people dont like this game
the replay factor isnt necessarily of the longest span in other words it gets boring quick
you will notice yourself beating off corporation lackies for what may seem like an eternity in chaos mode especiallyfinally we have the difficulty which is always addressed by reviewers on gaming sites
this game can be hard but its not as hard as people let off
the camera angles get really cooky at times but its nothing a true gamer cant get used to with a little practice
the missions also sport a little difficult but that too can be overcome with some gametimeto sum it up only buy this game if you are a rockstar games fanatic or you really really need a stress releaver
otherwise i would just call this a weekend rental at bestive been destroying people buildings and vehicles in state of emergency for a few days now and have come up with a mixed opinion of it
this game has had such a strange type of hype surrounding it
it didnt seem like the the all the advance praise was false or overtly glowing
early reviews made it seem like something that i would really enjoy and replay over and over
perhaps this could be true for some folks but i dont really feel that way myself after playing it
while i thought that i had read up on it and understood what it was all about well enough to be excited about buying and playing i must say that i am a bit disappointed with it after hacking my way through it these last few daysit is initially very exciting
you are surrounded by complete chaos
it is truly almost overwhelming from the getgo
once you start out blasting your way around and completing minitasks and attempting to gain points and multipliers in chaos mode youll quickly unlock other types of games
theyre all the same though timed  last man standing modes for each level
gameplay while purely fun and exceedingly violent and gory does get quite repetitive after about an hour
theres no depth the the game so if youre expecting that stay away
it is very much an extreme s arcade experience in chaos mode
lately ive been limiting my playing time marathon  sessions of state of emergency are completely fingerandmindnumbing and enjoying it much morerevolution mode does allow for a story line and many missions  spread over the course of  environments
you can unlock  more characters in this mode as well
however this mode is a little unsatisfying
initially the missions are very easy and very short
youll burn through about  of them in no time
there is no speech from the mission contacts 
just a very nintendoesque text box allowing you to learn your orders and accept or decline them
im not very far into revolution mode but so far its not as immediately fun as chaos modeconsidering the amount of action taking place at once onscreen the gameplay is exceptionally smooth
its a completely crazed and confusing gaming environment
but the camera angles as with many rdperson games can get stupid very quickly
you do have some relatively nice options for dealing with this
you can easilty recenter the camera behind you with the shoulder buttons the right analog stick always controls an adjustable camera and you can use the shoulder buttons when standing still to zoom in a bit to allow for a slight increase in precise aiming
speaking of aiming 
theres no targeting systemwhich is good and bad in different instances
you pretty much end up mowing down civilians troops gangs buildings cars and everything else in your path all the timei would say that this would be a great game for a group of friends to sit down with and hack slash and blast through
its completely mindless 
sort of an insane version of street fighter on steroids and highoctane speed
battles for high score rankings among friends are about all it offers in the way of satisfaction
holding it up against a title like grand theft auto iii as many people are doing is a bad idea by the way
its completely differentfor mindless short bursts of extreme s arcadestyled action this game deserves a higher rating than ive given it
outside of this however it doesnt excel althought i do find myself playing it more as my wife and friends join init certainly is fun in that way
i would highly recommend renting it and deciding for yourself if its for youfinal noteaddition   i now have the xbox version and i must say that its a wonderful improvementstate of emergency is definitely not on the grand theft auto  status
sure there is bloody graphic violence happening everywhere you turn but it was a complete letdown for gamers everywhere
the story is about a group called freedom which tries to overthrow the evil corporation that has taken over the streets and stores everywhere
you receive this simple beat em up missions that are very repetitive
for instance protect the hacker while he taps the phone system beat up the mall rats to get the scientists lab box make sure kim woo doesnt loose her pawn shop etc
plus they arent at all thoughtprovoking and they have no element of funif youve heard that there can be up to  people on the screen doing totally different things at the same time that is partially true
yes you can see up to  people on the screen at once but they all do practically the same thing and its not very realisitic
for example if i walk up to any rioter and punch them in the face they all crawl up in a ball for five seconds and then run of without fighting back at all
plus they all run in the same pattern and a lot of them often walk into walls
poorly designed considering all the hype this game receivedanother element this game lacks is a multiplayer mode
with all the bloody fun that this game packs you cannot play with your friends
its a real shame i could see so many different types of multiplayer modes being uses like shoot em up or more tactical modes using all creative weaponsi rate this game a  instead of a  or a  because of its depth and the ability to interact with pretty much everything in the environment
for example i could pick up a trashcan lawn chair box even limbs from a brutalized body as weapons to fight against other people or to smash cars or store windows
plus theres a wide selection of weapons to choose from to desroy the rioters of the city
automatic shoutguns uzis pepper spray axes baseball bats grenades and molotov cocktails are just a few of the many weapons you can use to torture the people in this game
plus if you get tired of doing missions for the freedom group you can always play chaos mode which is a complete destroying mode where you collect points for gang murders blowing up cars smashing windows and slaughtering the evil corporationall in all this game is definitely quantity over quality
if rockstar games spent more time on perfecting its mistakes and making it more detailed and complex than it is now it could definitely be a top consideration for play station s game of the yearhypethis word is defining the gaming industry as of recent and a cause for much disappointment in many gamers eg
mgs  and you think that game lived up to the hype youre only kidding yourself
this brings us to soe since its early showing at e and the success of the incredibly well done gta definitely goty for  on ps state of emergency has been getting a lot of hype amongst reviewers and gamers
does it live up to it
no
is it a bad game by any means
no
should you buy it or better yet spend big money on it
nope
go rent this game first and save your money for something better along the way
the game play is fun and really old school in the arcade smash tv sorta way but gets really repetitive really fast
not mention this game is short but they tried to lengthen it by adding a revolution mode to it in which you take on certain missions
these missions are redundant at best simple unimaginative and boring
the main game mode chaos is where this game really could have shined instead of making the mission based mode adding a player mode would have jumped this game you a couple stars
plus since there is only for levels a bit more to the levels as in size you have been nice and boss characters added to the game might have been a nice touch
overall not a bad game from vis considering the last game they made was earth worm jim d
by the way for most people who dont know this is just fyi rockstar does not make games they are just a publisher under take two gta  was made by dma max payne by remedy and soe by visfirst of all i want to start by telling peoplethat state of emergency and gta are two very differentgames
do not expect soe to play like gta
soe is abeatemup game in the likes of fighting forcepsx anddouble dragonnessnes while gta is mision basedaction game in the likes of drivermultiplatformwrecklessxboxsoe is the type of game that you will either loveor you will hate
thats why i put it on  starsfor me its around  starsthere are two ways of playing this game
kaos and revolutionin revolution mode missions are you main agenda weaponsyou get here are either given to you or you get from an enemy
missionstypes are basic kill someone get this steal this from storekill someone blow this up etc etc of course you will finda lot of resistance along the way
there is this d arrowto guide you to your objective so you wont get lostin kaos mode you basically try to get the highest score possibleby causing trouble and in this mode weapons are just lying on thefloor almost everywhere they also repop by themselves but itis different everytime they repop
you get points killing governmentenforcers and gang members as well as blowing up cars breaking windowsbut of course there is a time limit
every time you kill they will drop a healthand time replenisher so make sure you get em
on the upper right corner youwill see a bonus it changes all the time it will say x kill gangmembers or x breaking windows meaning if you do that youwill get times whatever the normal points are
the higher your pointsare meaner you opponents are first agents then military guys andit goes on and on
this is why i liked this game revolutionis just a bonusall in all a well made beat em up game seriously dontexpect it to be gta yes both was published by rockstar gamesbut they both had different developerstitle basically said it all
this game was ok at first but it got old quick
every level acts and looks the same
i found it more fun just running around shooting people not going with any story line but that got old quick
this game is worth renting playing two or three times but thats about iti rented this game namely so i could compare it to grand theft auto  because it seemed like it might have similar gameplay as it was published by the same company and recieved lots of attention for its violence etc
anyway i was disappointedthe game plays for all practical purposes nothing like gta
yes you get missions and theres a lot of overthetop violence but almost every mission is the same
at first the game was fun but it quickly got repetitive
gameplay is the same throughout the entire gametechnically its impressive with over one hundred people displayed on screen at once each with their own articficial intelligence but its just not a very fun gamei bought this game expecting it to be something like grandtheftauto iii i was very dissapointed
you can play as an excop or lawyerthere are other playable characters but only if you meet the requirements
basicly you run around and meet with individuals who represent a group who disagree with the current government
they inturn give you missions to accomplish that help their cause
in short all you do is kill and kill and blow up cars and buildingsbrake windows and kill and kill some more
the more havoc you cause the higher the score will get
every now and then you have have to protect someone by killing and more killing
and in those missions its very annoying because the one your protecting always seems to die really quick and sometimes its you who accidently kills them
there are a number of weapons at your disposal lying around the streets and inside the building or if choose to you could fight it out with your hands and feet
i like the lawyer she happens to use the martial arts which is very cool to watch
this game is very alive with the whole population of the city running around luting the nearby stores and running off with the items in their hands
its a good game for a very short time but it gets old very fast you just get bored doing the same thing over and over
if you expect gtaiii then dont even bother renting this game its not worth the hard earned cash that you or your parents worked so hard for
but if you like running around causing havoc this this your game but rent it first is my advice to you
hope i helped some i was expecting more
the worst part is i probably would be rating this game higher had i not been infected with the gta iii virus
when i hear that this was the next game rockstar was kicking out i was sitting in my seat expecting to be absolutly blown away and i just wasntits a really really good game but it kind of seemed to get repetive after finishing what seemed to a dozen repeats of the same level and not really being rewarded to any good cut scenes or anythingthis game is kind of cool but it is mainly about killing and shooting people there are various weapons like m basically gta weaponsthere are missions but they will take you a month or more to pass onto another level get grand theft auto  if you are cool or get state of emergency if you are boringi played the demo of draken and it was fun so thats were i wanted this game
the game over all is fun but i did have truble near the begaining of the game in the showdow mire
not a fun place to be
and there is spiders
and i really dont like spiders but there is only  places i  know that there are spiders
enoghf of that i like dragons so thats fun riding on a dragon
the game is long and the story line is good
but the ending could be better
the skill system is differnet because you can only have  skill point to put on your chariter so you can have a strong point and a weak point or you you can be balnced
overall draken is a ok
gamea decent game not the greatest work on the ps but a worth addition and compelling story
worth at least a single play throughi really wanted to like this game and recommend it but it is so so short
i finished it in about an hour and  minutes and that includes watching all the cut scenes
its not that it is to easy but there is only  songs to do
i wouldve rated it higher if it has been longerthe music is very derivative of the first parappa game
i guess there are only so many ways you can carve up  beats but it seems like a lot of the patterns were the same
remember the chickens song from the first game
its back
i guess this could be a positive for a sequel game if used in the right way but i found it sort of annoyingevery  levels there is some sort of bonus game where you break boards or dishes by pressing the appropriate button when the dishboard is displayed
i did not enjoy this at all and wouldve liked to just skip to the next level
of course that wouldnt made the game even shortercontrary to many reviews here i found the story line kind of cute but im not really a stickler for story on most games
in fact i found it very funny
but im sure you have to be in the moodone improvement that has been made is when you push the buttons the relative timing of the presses are shown on the screen sort of overlayed on the pattern youre playing
it made it easier to figure out what went wrong sometimesthe graphics were an improvement over the old game and added to the experience
the load times didnt seem as long as the first parappa and werent very annoyingin summary if you like this kind of game by all means rent it because its fun
if you want to buy look for the old parappa or lammy games the psness is kind of wasted on this titlei was very excited when i found out that parappa was coming to ps
i thought it would be bigger better and more difficult but it turned out that i was wrong
i was very disappointed to find that there are only  levels all at pretty much the same difficulty level if youve beaten parappa  or umjammer lammy you can probably finish this one within one sitting without any problems
besides the easiness there are other glaring faults the storyline is incoherent and boring everything is being turned into noodles or something like that and the lengthy movies between levels have bad translations and arent very exciting
the actual songs are nowhere near as funny and clever as the original ones and the paperthin graphics which were charming on the ps seem cheap and out of place on the ps
after i beat the last level i wished that i hadnt bought it it was just way too easy and unfulfilling
also while umjammer lammy unlocks tons of bonus levels after you finish parappa has none
however despite these faults i would definitely recommend parappa as a rental to any parappa fan even if it is a waste to buyi bought this item and the first one i got was faulty
the video cable outputs did not work so i exchanged it
the second unit i got worked perfectly fine up until one time i was watching a dvd and the screen just made a weird sound and the screen became opaque
something weird happened the unit almost caught on fireit was blowing smoke from the sides and smelled like burnt plastic
i did not even have it on for that long either maybe an hour and a half
i dont know maybe its just that i got another faulty unit hopefully they will exchange it but it works great if you can get one that actually workslike all golf games both video and real when you hit the ball wrong nothing seems to go right
this game is as fun as the other reviewers say but just when you think you have it figured outfor the first generation of games for xbox its good
the game play is very realistic and smooth
however with todays techology the graphics should have been much better
the game is too dark and lacks details
true the graphics may be good to some but if you compare it with todays techology the graphics should be outstanding
overall the game is oki was really looking forward to nba inside drive
i had been playing nfl fever for months and thought this would be the bball equivilant
its not
the graphics are decent nfl fever is better the playbyplay announcers are entertaining and there are some cool dunk sequences but it left me wanting more
i think the main reason i tired of this game much more quickly that nfl fever is the lack of a dynasty mode
there is no salary cap  no createaplayer and no dynamic player performance
sooo the team you create is pretty much the team your stuck with game after game season after season etc
etc
i bought this game and really dont feel it was worth the this game is amazing
the dunks are excellent the graphics are good and this game is fun to play
this is the best basketball game yet
there is no create a player or street play but that does not matter
the season mode is great
in most games if you make a lineup in season mode it will automatically change back but not in this game
the only drawback is that blocking stealing and scoring is too easy
i blocked shaq with iveson and i got  points in a game with one character
also i got  steals with one player while everyone else had less than 
this is a game you should rent unless you are a big fan of basketballthis game was pretty good graphics are tight though some of the closeups are suspect at times mj looks more like treach than anybody  thats not a good thing and everything moves like the real deal
arguably the best firstyear effort for a sports game
dc owners might disagree considering the inaugural nflnba ks the ai is probably the best of any bball game out at the moment
i liked it speaking as an owner of all of the nextgen game systems though  theres a better one out there
nba k for the ps has it beat in nearly every way
freethrows and rookie ai aside and for you xbox owners march brings christmas all over again cuz its gonna drop and drop hard
nba inside drive has done everything necessary to jump straight past the deep but neverchanging live series
they need to get it together and quick because right now its a two  team race
should be fun to watch as they all go at it in this game was alright
it was the best i had played till i thouched halo  but like i said if you like bond then an overall good game to play for gamecubethis is an excellent james bond game for multiplayer mode
unlike what other people said the maps in multiplayer are not that tiny and they can feature ai bots if you turn them on
but this game sucks for single player
the graphics are extremely bad and the guns suck
you cant even tell who is supposed to be james bond
it looks like pierce brosnan but it sounds like roger moore or something
the plot is also very weak
another bad thing is that this game says it has the golden gun and all it is is just a pistol painted gold
the game is in nd person shooter which also sucks
i only recommend this game if you intend it for multiplayer use with  friends
the last bad thing is that after your enemys die they just dissapear which is stupid
but it is what it isim not really big on the bond games
most of then are no more than ordinary first person shooters with licensed characters
i guess since the original goldeneye game on the nintendo  was so popular they felt like they shouldnt stray to far from the winning formulain this game we have a generic interpretation of bond involved in a dull plot involving clones and kidnapped world leaders
we go through several different locations but only some of them are cool and none are used to their full potential
there are a couple of driving levels too but the street design is just uninspiredthe best thing about fps games is the ability to just go berserk and shootup the place hoping to catch the baddies in the crossfire
but you dont really get a lot of ammo and reloading is painfully slow sometimes
and the destruction you can inflict upon the environment is very limitedi can really only recommend auf to bond fans
the rest of you have soooo many other choices for superior fps games you dont want to waste your time with this onethis is a okay game
abit fungraphics  decent graphics bullets explosions scenery etcnot too detailed but finegameplay  okay
guns are quite cool
the ai can be kinda stupid sometimesvalue difficulty  very easy game
very short alsosound  pretty well done
ear blastingoverall james bond freak buy itfps fan dont waste ur moneynot the best fps game out there but good enough
if ur looking for a better fps get timesplitters  james bond nightfire metroid prime the best fps or halothis game never had the feel of a bond game
i walked around and did the simple tasks it gives you and it was over
even if this was just a random shooter i wouldnt like it but since its elegidly a bond game that makes it worse
what about the new kids who are into games who never have even experienced a good bond game
they are being left out of something very cool and so am i its pisses me off
ea makes a great madden game but truely sucks at bond
when they bought the rights to the bond games those games were doomed
what are they thinking
the driving levels in this are short and sorry
sure their nice for a little change but at least make them enjoyable
no skillno lengthno depthno fun
boooo
this game goes to the trashwell whenever someone sees james bond on a game its probably gonne be picked up
well i was walking around at blockbuster and that exact same phenomenon happend to me
i took it home popped it in and began the first mission
i was at parts amazed at parts extremely disapointed while playing  agent under fire
by ea games gameplay okaybut not very good in a lot of parts
first it just feels too easy
you go around shooting people who dont usually shoot back
the game is based on autoaim which really kills gameplay
the people dont look half as good as they should and the missions overall are short and easy
there isnt much of a variety of guns
there is hardly any ammo and for that case what you come with isnt very much
the guns arent very creative either
just a handgun maybe a rifle here or therevehicles you normally control just one or two every  levels
one time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry but its gets old after awhile
the ability though when you have an assistant in the car to shoot from the headroof was extremely cool
that was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns
vehicles are here theyre just not that commonstory pretty good it actually has one at least
you must save a hostage escape the terrorists take out people in stealth break into the room etc it actually went by a story line but the crappy part was james girlfriend gets graphics decent but not good
peoples hands dont have  fingers the backgrounds and guards and such dont have faces
bullet marks disapear after going into the wall
no weather factors collapsing buildings etc the graphics here were once again good not great
sound probably the best part of the game
the voice acting while peoples mouths dont move when they talk is excellent
the sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after reloading brings the gameplay alive
the cars squel when they start fast explosions rock the screen
overall its pretty good
the music in the background isbond of course
the sound was the best part of the game in my opinion that andmultiplayer very fun
the levels are fairly large and the variety of weapons is huge
from jump packs canons bazukas shot guns snipers handguns etcthere are tons of guns
the game keeps score and you can work as a team in player  on  combat
there are life vests to keep your health up and the overall gameplay is good
i loved only one part of this game
it was the multiplayerthis game overall is a good game in terms of how much is costs a twenty should cover it at most stores
persounally id buy it for the multiplayer not the story mode
something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two
this game is a blast in some ways and a major disapointment in others
i plan on buying itmaybe after renting it for a weekthxthe makers of quotjames bond  agent under firequot made some missteps in their development of this bond effort
while still a very entertaining game with some levels that truly capture the imagination quotagent under firequot comes across as a truncated mission
after investing just a few hours in playing quotagent under firequot the game is over and the enemy vanquished
that may have been passable for older gaming platforms with less memory power but its unacceptable for a game on a system like the gamecube
i encountered a similar aggravation when i played quotrebel assault iiquot for playstation
however quotra iiquot failed to possess any redeeming qualities while quotagent under firequot doesquotagent under firequot provides an array of fascinating gadgets and weapons for the player to use in helping bond accomplish his mission
there are gadgets like a laser for cutting locks a decoder for getting past security systems and even a grapple hook to help bond get into out of reach places
the weapons run the gamut from his famous golden gun to the most sophisticated rocket launchers
let it not be said that bond doesnt get to travel in style
he gets to create some highflying mayhem in his classic bmw
he also gets to attack the bad guys aboard an underground tram system
he even gets to storm the streets of some downtown european city aboard a tank and take out people cars and helicoptersdespite the shortness of the game many of the individual boards are quite challenging and satisfying to beat
battles ranging from fights on an oil drilling platform to taking on a bad guy above molten lava to final mission in a remote snowbound mountain hideout are quite a treat to play
the weapons gadgets vehicles and levels that one would expect from bond are what make this game worthwhilethis game i cant say was the bestthe graphics are good but the gameplay is not at alli beat the entire game in two days flatand the worst part about it is that your enemies can see you when you try to sneak around them
so you cant try to beat your level by sneaking past your enemiesthey have eyes in back of their heads
if you like seeeeeriously easy games then buy this gamejames bond agent under fire is not what you would expect from the next of one of my favorite games from n
it is just overall not as fun
it is kind of a game that you can pick up and play but you will get stuck big time if you are not an experienced shooter
the multiplayer action is decent but invisible in the shadow of halo for xbox so dont expect anything like that
this is a game with unfair expectations but i really dont think that this game deserves another look
on the contrary james bond nightfire is great buy that insteadagent under fire was the first james bond title to appear on currentgeneration consoles and its a decent if not spectacular effort
this game is notable in that it doesnt feature pierce brosnans likeness as james bond but an entirely new face that seems to draw from all the james bond actors over the yearsreally this is an average shooter all around
the enemy ai isnt particularly intelligent and the graphics are decent but not noteworthy
bond comes with some extra gadgets but most of these seem like gimmicks without much versatility
theres a very scifiish plot here involving clones that seems to stretch believability even by bond standards and its capped off by a disappointing nonendingthe best parts of the game though are the driving and railshooter stages between the firstperson levels
at the time it was a pleasant surprise to get a nicely produced driving engine in a shooting game and rail shooters are always fun for their simplicity in an oldschool arcade kind of wayi had fun with agent under fire and its an entertaining game if you go in with the right expectations
later bond games are much improved suggesting that ea did learn from their time with this one
bond fans can add this to their collection without worry but hardcore gamers should look for an overall stronger experienceonce goldeneye  was released for the nintendo  console that title instantly became the standard by which all future bond fpss would be judged
in the case of agent under fire for the gamecube it does just enough to get by but fails to stand out in any of the categories that made its predecessor greatthe main problem with this game is that it just feels clunky sometimes
whereas goldeneye was always slick and smooth agent under fire is bulky and awkwardthe single player mode is hitandmiss with some missions being quite fun and others just being a shootemup fest
not having an actual bond movie to base the levels around was the downfall hereof course one of the hallmarks of any bond game is the multiplayer mode and in this aspect agent under fire just doesnt hold a candle to its predecessors
it seems as if the multiplayer experience should be better than it is same basic layout as other similar game modes but again it just lacks that punch of the seminal goldeneye multiplayer mode that redefined fps gamesthough some nintendo gamecube games still hold up today even in the world of xbox  and beyond agent under fire is not one of them
you would be better off sticking with goldeneye on the n than upgrading to thisthis game is so easy to pick up which makes it so much fun
playing james bond is always a pleasure in first person but when you able to run and gun like you do this game is just a blast
the story is no the greatest but lets face it
your james bond
who cares
there are some memerabale moments in this games worth making a playthroughim always baffled by people who like console golf games yet they dont like quothot shotsquot style golf games
to be truly great at quothot shotsquot or any really good golf game takes skill timing finesse shotclub selection and the ability to read greens
what makes a great golf game is how all of those things are achieved how they flow together
tiger woods pga  as much as any other video golf game allows you to manipulate the reality of golf to better play it putting spin on the ball in midair zooming along the path of a putt to read it etc
that being said i want to have fun when i play a golf title
i dont want to try and do three different things with only two hands to get a ball to go where i want it
tiger  wants to be a golf simulation hey man if i want to play bad golf i can go out and actually play golf
i play video golf to be great at golf
this years version looks better in some areas characters greens trees and worse in others robins egg blue ponds
what kind of toxic waste is in that water
the best part of this game is the inclusion of more courses
thank you ea sports for attempting to give us our moneys worth coursewise
the worst part is the tedious work involved in playing itmy advice is to rent it
who knows
you may like being frustratedea sports has made another lackluster game
with the heinous invention of nba live  behind them the ea production team now creates a lackluster baseball game
i would conisder myself a fan of baseball but not an avid fan perhaps this is why i like the game im almost ashamed to say the game itself is decent
the gameplay is average once the difficulty settings are changed on amateur i scored  runs in game 
pretty amazing huh im currently in a season on pro and the games have been pretty true to lifesomewhatthe modes of play are extremely limited
you only have single season and homerun derby there may be another one that im forgetting
the graphics are decent however the players faces are hillariously emotionless and the commentating is sometimes annoying and a bit unaccurate
overall the games deserves  and half stars not three
if your an avid fan of baseball then you probably wont like this one perhaps the allstar and high heat are up your alley
in a nutshell this game is for the casual fanits okay at first but gets boring after a few days  the grafx are great and sound is great but the creatures are a bit small on the already tiny screen
overall its okay
worth about this is a fabulously detailed pinball game detailed with graphics good music especially for gameboy good voiceovers and easy to use controls l button for left paddle r button for the right one up to tilt the machine
pinball of the dead combines the horrifying graphics of resident evil with multilevel pinball tables and just a twist of use the pinball to destroy creatures
the game focuses around three major pinball tables the first with a th century england theme the second with a high tech scifi theme the third with a ghoulish red cemetery theme and various hidden tables you can unlock
the tables also adapt move and live such as little creatures constantly appear in open spaces waiting to be run over by the pinball for points
along with secret tables to unlock there are also cinematic horror scenes which can be unlocked through points hitting something a certain amount of times or discovering a secret area
there are also secret areas with bosses for you to defeat by hitting it with the pinball several times
the gameplay is smooth and instead of having the entire table viewable on one screen the screen scrolls up and down following the pinball
its a good pinball game but although the graphics are for mature audiences the game is quite easy
you can play for ten minutes on a single ball
after all is said pinball is pinballthere is one thing i should get straight before i start
i am not nor have i ever been a fan of britney spears
i probably never will be
but i do like rhythmdancing games so i gave this one a try just for funthe gameplay for the most part is basic
you try to press the correct buttons with the correct timing
mostly you are using the x circle square and triangle buttons but occasionally a directional button will be thrown in which adds to the challenge immensely
you are auditioning to be one of britneys backup dancers by dancing off against other dancers
you go through ten auditions before being allowed to audition against britney herself
after each audition you are awarded points based on your performance
these points eventually reward you with backstage passes that allow you to see video clips of britneythe one innovative gameplay element that i like about this game is that when your competitor does well he or she can make your moves harder
every time your opponent strings a combo of ten button presses together it adds or changes your sequence
it may change one of your buttons it may add a directional button it may cause one of your button presses to be moved up or back or it may add one or two extra button presses so that you have to hit ten buttons in rapid succession
of course by stringing together a combo of ten yourself you do the same thing to your opponent
although this can be infuriating at times it at least adds some challange to an otherwise simple gamei do have a few complaints about the game
first it is too short and easy
you could play through the game with one dancer in a few hours easily and through the entire game with all six dancers in a weekend
therefore i would just recommend this as a rental
also there are only five songs and if you were not sick of hearing oopsi did it again before you will be after playing this game
my second complaint is that there should be a replay option
one problem with rhythm games is that while you are playing you really cannot afford to look at what is going on because you have to be paying close attention to the meter
there should be a way to replay what you just did so you can watch all the moves that your dancer just didif you like rhythm games try this as a rental
you just might find the gameplay very addictive
if you like rhythm games and you are also a fan of britneys you might just find this worth you money
but for serious gamers dance beat really does not offer much depthfirst off this game is not a rts real time strategy like another reviewer said
its more of a squad based or company based if you want to get technical tactical simulator
you control up to three platoons  mss each of suits and assign weapons pilots equipment and orders to each
you also assign routes waypoints and rules of engagement to each platoon avoid or attack
the controls in mission are ok but until you get the last ms i forgot the name you dont have very much in the way of mobility
the fact that your mss have paper thin armor doesnt help the situation any
all in all its a good game with a good amount of strategy and action thrown inyes they got this right and made a racing game from far far away may the force be with you hawhy is everyone saying this game is easy
this is the most frustrating hardest game i have ever played
it might be a  little fun and easy in the beginning but then it gets impossible
do not buy this game
it is sofrustrating
aaaaaaahhhhad similar racing game on computer a few years back
it was more fun but this one is a decent substitutethe idea of taking you sims on the vacation intruiged me and if you are looking at this product the idea probably intrigues you why shouldnt you get this game
limited amount of new itemsvery slow if you do not have a fast computer and up would probably be suitablevacation is extremely similar to hot date
in fact the only difference being that in vacation you can spend the night away from your home
it is almost like being able to spend the night downtownthat is like the only added featureexcect the vacation environment is different than hot datesbut not by muchwhy should you get this game
good question you can now spend the night away from homethey added several new activitiessuch as volleyball and snowboarding although these activities you can only do on vacationso is this game worth its money
it depends
in my opinion i dont think so so from this point on the decision is up to you
glad i could helpsure this is a good game in the beginning
it was fun for the first two days or so
then you run out of things to do
there arent many choices giv en with this quotpackquot
i wouldnt choose this as any of my favoritesbored with your daily activities around the house
give your character a little rest on vacation and have yourself enjoy the new features in vacation expansion packcall a travel agent and get off your house for a camp skiing in a ski resort shopping in malls or go to the beach
every place has accomodation so you can stay overnight there
different places have different activities for you to enjoy your vacation
you can do bbq on a camp site shopping in malls treasure hunt on the beach or make a snowman and play ski on the ski resortdont worry about being absent from your work
the time stops while youre on vacation
dthe sims vacation is just a candy coated renditition of the original
i really dont see the fun in the vacations
this is nothing like real life as the developers dub this a person simulator
all you do is stay at home and add on to your house
now in this candy coated version of the past what is it
three sim games you get to go on boring un interaactive environmentsthis shining little bauble of an expansion pack rather quickly loses its luster
the idea of sending your sims on vacation is a great one and some of the new activities eg building snowmen having snowball fights snowboarding on the half pipe are funat first but the whole thing gets a little boring after a while
what really ruins the game play is the fact that your invited guests have no idea of how to have a good time and you have no control over them at all
as others have said they dont even have sense enough to make use of restrooms and shower stalls
basically in such a scenario your sim is left wandering around trying to find anyone who will do anything with himher
playing volleyball by yourself is not my idea of an ideal vacation
much of the time your chosen vacation spot is all but deserted leaving you high and dry indeed
a family vacation is much more enjoyable because you at least have some control over all of the vacationing sims activities and interactions
even then though the fun is limited and the experience rather monotonousthis expansion pack  is certainly worth buying if you are a sims addict but i wouldnt call it an essential component of the sims experience
it also does slow the game down although i dont see too much difference between vacation and hot date in this regard
you and your sims can definitely have a little fun on vacation but i doubt you will be anxious to rush off every weekend to get away from it alli have all the expansion to the sims and probably will continue to get them even though i rarely play the game
i feel sim vacation was not as good as the first two expansion
i stopped playing it because it took too long to load the vacation spots
i didnt even what to go to different vacation spots because each time you did it took awhile for it to load
it also didnt have many new things as the first two expansions
i dont regret getting the expansion but i did lose interest quicker with this expansion then with the previous oneswell all of the sims stuff is really cool so i cant give this too bad of a rating
but by far out of all the expansion packs for the sims this is definitely the most boring one
therere only three types of places you can go on vacation forest beach and winter
and some of the animations between those three are the same
for example the snowball fight option in the winter places is exactly the same animation as the water balloon toss
not too creativeit was a great idea but if for some reason you can only afford all the expansion packs minus one leave this one out
you wont be missing as much as if you left out one of the other onesi have been with my sims since they came outat first days slipped into nights and before i knew it daylight againbut with all good things it has to end boy was i wrongone expansion after another then came hot datehot date had nice objects but maxis took out the free will which seperated the sims from all other gamesthen came sims vacation well i thought this would make up for hot datethe free will was there but the lack of objects and food choices for your simsi cant wait for sim city this expansion pack like the others before it has a tendency to have major glitches including the occasional crash
althought the pack comes with lots of new objects and a quotvacationquot area its still the same old sims
its like youre just watching them quotdoquot things
its boring
it would have been a lot better if ea had come out with some improvements to the game overall instead of another expansionpeople want slanted roofs and basements and rd floors and children that go thru different age levels not a stupid tent or fishingi rather dislike this expansion
i own all four expansions for the pc sims and this is one of my least favorites
personally i dont think the addition of vacation mode adds much to the game after hot date since vacation mode seems just like downtown but slightly modified
also most of the new items are only available in vacation mode or are heavily themed to the vacation aspect which like i said isnt very good
so if youre a big sims fan and are trying to collect all the expansions or something or just think that your sims need a vacation you should buy this
but for the rest of you id either wait for the price to drop more or just not buy itby rating this expansion only three stars i am not telling you not to purchase the game beacuse it is a musthave addition to your sims collection
as always over  new objects including carnival games the water slide and fireplace with mantle are given to you in this expansion
additionallyas you probably guessed from the title your little sim friends are allowed to take a vacation
aside from the hardtomanage cost of  for most sim families vacationing isnt all that fun
sure you can play carnival games and sleep in beds away from home but nothing amazingly amusing comes along with going on vacation
i must admit however that taking time of from work and school with out being penalyzed is a great plus
after livin large house party and hot date to skip out on vacation would be a crimethe sims vacation expansion pack isnt really drooled over much
this is probably the second expansion pack which enables sims to leave the neighborhood and go to vacation island which is divided into lots based on themes like the woods and snow and ski resortsthe only positive thing i can think about it is its a good place for your sims to runaway to especially if theyre in the makings of becoming a star
unlike hot date here sims still on the fameseeking onesll have a chance to mend their relationships and their fun while even though this is enabled in downtown sims couldnt sleep there
but on vacation island sims can spend as many days as they like and contantly refresh themselves before going back to face the musicapart from that this expansion pack wouldnt really be missed if it wasnt for the sims superstarthis expansion pack for the sims is good in the sense that it provides another thing for your sims to do go on vacation
the vacationing is not that cool though because your sims get bored of the activities very quickly and it is not as easy to keep them happy as it is in your own house for your sims
there are many things to do though and it will take you days of playing to experience them all
with some cool new ideas like buying prizes with tickets this expansion pack is good but still not as good as hot date or livin large
at least it is not rediculous like the newest expansion where you get pets
wowif you visit your local electronics store or even ebay you can pick up a real clone of the official ddr konami mat
what i mean by this is it looks exactly the same and performs exactly the same
it even lights up
kinda  with this dance mat you must be precise in order for it to work correctly and for you to get good points but with the ones you can buy on ebay believe me you can play normally
i would definetely go to your local frys electronics if you are located in california or just go to ebaythis mat is okay for beginners
it wont last too long for advance users but this mat is a great way for a beginners to learn how to play
some people recommend duct tapping plywood on the bottom of the mat some it responds better but if you get a mat anywhere i strongly recommend getting one on ebay
usually they are brand new and factory sealed
they usually come in a sets of two one for you and a friend and sell for about  like this one either in xbox or ps and  for shipping the buy it now price on ebay is usually  but you can still bid on it to save a couple of bucks
shipping for these mats on amazoncom are  for  day shipping and  for two day shipping so you still come out ahead on ebay
i got a mat that retails for  its sort of like the mat that sells for  here its more expensive because it has extra padding and it will last longer for  and  dollar shipping
for hardcore fans who really got some moves and play the ddr games a lot ebay has the metal dance mats with the bar looks exactly like the one in the arcades for about  not including shipping
otherwise this is an awesome mat but if you want to save money and get one for when a friend comes over get one on ebay if you get one on ebay search ddr or search ddr extremethe sequel to one of the dreamcasts few honestly meaningful hits jet set radio future takes the mechanics visuals and all around style established by its proud poppa jet grind radio ports them over to microsofts platform and ties in a few new bits and pieces in the interest of keeping things fresh
its been a few years since i played the original but the impression it left on me was largely a good one particularly on the graphics and audio fronts
i dont remember it as being an overly difficult game to pick up and learn and although it wasnt the lengthiest adventure in the world id often find myself slowing my momentum midstride so i could breathe in the atmosphere and enjoy my surroundings
it was such a gorgeous melting pot of cultures one couldnt help but appreciate it in that respect alonethe story of this sequel isnt all that remarkable but honestly neither was that of the first game
you play as one of the three founding members of the ggs one of half a dozen rollerbladeadorned street gangs fighting for territorial rights to the whole of tokyo
the ultimate goal is to fill the streets with your crews graffiti slowly assimilating members of the other gangs along the way until the entire underground knows and respects your crew
its more than a little reminiscent of the original where the locations were different but the eventual goal was exactly the same
the two storylines are almost dreamily interconnected with several returning characters none of whom seem to have any recollection of the events of the first game or their relationship with the others
one character whose role is bulked up this time around is dj professor k the voice of jet set radio an underground pirate radio station which provided the tunes and the news updates in the dreamcast edition but never really took much of a role in the actual goings on
in jsrf the professor moves from a supporting role to something a little more proactive
his broadcasts are much more pointedly directed to the ggs and are your only real indication of where you should be and what you should be doing at any given timewhile neither game in the series has much in the way of an epic storyline at the very least the actual gameplay experience of the first was enough to keep me coming back for more
no matter how much of the game youd completed it was always a blast to play
i wish i could say the same for the sequel but it seems to have grown both too simple and too complicated for its own good
something as basic as grinding a rail for instance was never much of a problem in the first game
you jumped in the air and if you happened to be within spitting distance of a grindable object when you landed your character was automatically bumped over to it and began grinding along
it was simple yet effective and didnt cause too many headaches at the time
for the sequel however the programmers have really bumped up the number of rails in any given map which makes actually navigating from point a to point b much more of a nightmare
i cant even begin to count the number of times id be trying to reach a difficult spot on the map would jump away from the rail in an attempt to land on said spot would visibly land on the spot i was aiming for and would watch my character automatically clamp onto the rail again and sail away into the abyss
after about fifteen minutes i was screaming for the simple one button grind functionality that was done to perfection in the tony hawks pro skater series which is funny because it was precisely this kind of problem that led neversoft to introduce the ability to actually climb off your board and roam freely around the map
jsrfs grinding system is far too simple and mistakeprone for its own goodi think my main problem with the control system is twofold
for one far too many elements are automated to the point that i never felt like i was fully in control of my character
secondly i felt like jsrf far too accurately represents the physical act of skating and all of its downfalls and limitations
its one thing to simulate the sense of speed balance and adrenaline that im sure a great rollerblade pro feels every time hes on wheels but its something else entirely to handicap your gamers just for the sake of simulation
if youll pardon the repeated comparisons this is a translation that i felt the tony hawks pro skater series had absolutely nailed down
all of the sensations of actually riding a skateboard are there speed control balance restraint but very few of the really bothersome limitations made the leap
when you order your rider to stop moving on an incline its understood that you dont want him to move again on his own
jsrf sends you slowly sliding down the hill
theres no such thing as a nuance of control in this game at least as far as the basic commands are concerned
jumping grinding standing still moving forward whatever they all feel overanalyzed and needlessly nitpicked
wheres the fun in moving at incredible speeds if your character steers like a boat in mudnow with all that said im actually a fan of a few aspects of the control scheme and the newly introduced gameplay mechanics
one of the more imaginative additions is the combo system which works like a sort of hybrid action  sports  music game
youve got the fast pace and loose grip on reality of an action game like the skyhigh jumps in tony hawk theres no way some of jet sets tricks are physically possible the balance and strategy of a good sports game planning where youll jump after the rail ends in the hopes of continuing your combo and the timing and universal coordination of a great music game youve got to time your manual tricks while grinding or grabbing air so that they land precisely along with the beat
fully realized its a truly inspiring little addition although its such a small part of the big picture that its likely to go completely overlooked in most peoples booksas id alluded to earlier the two areas that needed the least attention were the visuals and the audio both of which were true shining points of the original almost singlehandedly responsible for its high profile and its accompanying success
on that front not much has changed
this is still a visually sensational game and although many of the environments and noncentral characters seem blocky and undeveloped for the xbox platform the incredible strength of the character designs and art direction make up for it and then some
this is one of the most complete games ive ever seen graphically
everything a player could possibly get onto their screen is brilliantly detailed with dozens of little surprises tucked away to keep the game interestingthe audio is on the large a huge success
the tracks are entirely fresh without a single tune ive ever heard on the radio and almost exclusively excellent
occasionally youll stumble across a song that sticks out like a sore thumb one song in particular maddened me to no end almost starttofinish middle aged screaming japanese woman and thats a problem that the first game certainly didnt have but such tracks arent very frequent
id have preferred to have a functionality similar to that in tony hawks pro skater  to continue the endless comparisons which allowed gamers to single out tracks they didnt like and eliminate them from the active rotation but a couple bad songs are really a small price to pay considering the quality of the rest of the soundtrackvisual and musical choices aside i was really let down by this game
sega had such a firm foundation upon which to build an absolutely dynamite sequel success seemed like a foregone conclusion but where theres a will i suppose theres a way
and much as it pains me to admit it segas mo
this generation seems to have been creating software that really isnt up to their old standards
while its a blast to watch jet set radio future just isnt that much fun to play most of the time thanks to an incredibly shallow inattentive undertested control scheme
the characters are difficult to identify with since most of their brain waves appear to be flatlined and the story is difficult to follow and nonmotivating
even if a game looks beautiful and sounds breathtaking nobodys going to bother with it if the gameplay and controls arent there
and thats just the case with jsrfwhen you buy a game there are about five things you need to look at
graphics sound gameplay value how long will you play it and basically wheether or not you think you will like enough to shell out the money to buy it
jest set radio future is the sequel to jet grind radio another good game
and for the most part it carries on the serious in serious stylefirst theres the graphics which for the most part are stellar
this is the first cellshaded game i have played meaning that its made to look more cartoonish the photorealistic
thats not kiddie its cool and it fits in the game beautifully
but all is not well
the camera will get stuck behind things and that can hinder your gameplayoverall graphics  on a scale of sound is next
this is where jsrf fails
the soundtrack is awful if your not a fan of techno music
im not trying to say anything about the people that do like it but i hate it
also the screams of the characters you hit while skating gets really annoying
vioce acting is just fine
even though the soundtrack is upbeat and fits with jet sets theme i cant stand and theres no way to turn it off
i hate playing games on muteoverall sound  scale of gameplay is fun and just fine
you control your skater with the left analog stick jump using the a button and can pull of tricks with the left analog stick in a certain direction when you get a boast like on ssx tricky
by collecting spray paint cans you can tag walls and people by pressing the right trigger
its addictive and cooloverall gameplay  scale of its worth buying since there is such a shortage of games on the xbox right now
plus there are a ton of charaters to unlock and places to skate in as well as vs modeoverall value scale of i hate the sound but love everything else and if you like techno pop and some rap mixed in youll love everything about it
so its up to you but to mei like itscale final ratinggraphics sound gameplay value  tilt  if you have a mute buttonbut iti got this game and i thought that it was a lot of fun until i hit a snag
my game locks up when you meet up with combo
so i took the game back and got a replacement thinking that it might be a glitch in the software
well i got a new one and tried it out to find that it had the same problem
i loved this game and i would like to be able to play it for longer than  minuteswhen i first bought my xbox jsrf and sega gt came with it
that is the only reason i own this game
first the graphics  the graphics have a nice quality
very unique and colorful
the gameplay its a fun little skating game with a cool story nothing more
you dont even have to press any buttons to grind a rail
just jump on it and your character will start grinding
story the story seemed very deep for a skating game and i was pretty interested in it
there is a multiplayer mode for this game and i enjoyed it with my younger brother for several months
but once we got other games this one sat in the closet collecting dust
it was fun for a while but id rather spend my time playing different gamesthe good beautiful visuals stunning soundtrack quick and easy to playthe bad impossible camera no trick system stupid story very monotonous you can beat the game in less than  hoursi remember hearing all about jet grind radio back in the day when i only dreamed of owning a dreamcast
about  years later i pick up jsrf off ebay for  and wellyou get what you pay for
i expected a lot more of this game but really its just repetitive with a horrendous camera lame story and a few others odds and endsthe story is almost nonexistent where you have to stop the poison claw gang from taking over the city and you basically go through the city covering their tags with yours and racing them here and there
thats really all there is story side and its a huge let down
i found the best thing here were the visuals and audio
the game has beautiful celshaded graphics with a rich hip and techno driven soundtrack
when it comes to game play things are very simple and derivative
each section has a certain amount of tags you have to cover and you do this by grinding around places and covering them up
you have to pick up spray cans lying around everyone to do this though
blue ones are worth ten and yellow ones are worth one
once you cover all the tags you have to meet the poison claw gang and challenge them to a race
these are really easy and only require a little trial and error
the tags are fairly easy to locate thanks to them being dotted on your mapi found the levels to be a bit claustrophobic though since you characters can defy gravity and jump  feet so youd miss your line on the building and fall all the way down
this leads into the terrible camera which you cant control and never stays behind the character
you always have to make circles and use the reset camera button
this ruins a lot of the game because youll climb all the way to the top of a high tower and then fall all the way down and have to climb the top again because you couldnt see that open ledge
so this is the basic concept of how you play the game its just grind here tag here fight camera here watch dorky japanese characters dance around rinse and repeat
dont get me wrong this game is pretty good but the game is just to monotonous and the camera ruins everything
sometimes the police will be after you so you knock them down and spray paint them to death some are too strong to knock down so you boost into themyoure probably asking where is the trick system
well there isnt one
the game relies on a few moves while grinding by hitting the x button and maybe a backflip here and there when you jump and thats about it
you do handplants in half pipes but when you jump tricks are automatically done and there are maybe a handful of tricks
after maybe  hours of playing youll get bored and irritated with the game so much youll stop playing like i did
i got maybe  through the game and just stopped playing because it was too annoying and repetitivethe game was really great back in the day because of the amazing graphical style but i think sega concentrated too much on that
the game has some serious slowdown on the xbox  and makes the game almost unplayable in certain areas
there really isnt much in sound just a grinding sound grunts moans whooshing and crowd sounds when you run into them
i love the visuals sega but in the sequel please upgrade the game playi dont doubt that this may be the best baseball game for ps and standing alone i would have given the game  stars but compared to last year there is little improvement
high heat  was a great game for its game play but had horrible graphics and some kinks to work out
do did little to improve the game
there are some improvements from last year however most noticable is the improved look of the players do added a little more detail
the stadium graphics have improved slightly but still terrible
the best thing about the game is that the overall game play remains the same so the game is still very fun
however the kinks are still present
the worst is the shifting of camera angles when you are trying to catch a fly ball
as the camera angle shifts the direction you are moving the player shifts so it takes you off the ball or you just may lose sight of the area you are running to
also a huge flaw in the game is that that camera angle doesnt shift when the ball is thrown past a man it maintains a close zoom on the ball so you cannot see any of your players no matter how far or close they are to the ball
you may throw it to first for an easy out and the ball gets past the first baseman you no longer can see the first baseman so you cannot direct him to the ball the runner usually ends up scoring or getting to third
the last major flaw with the game is that during the playoffs the game switches from a calender mode to a tourament layout
this is unrealistic because you could win your series in  straight while you wait for the other bracket to play  games and your pitchers do not get any rest in the  days off
the only pitcher that is ready to go is the pitcher that would have pitched in game  and the other pitchers still need the full  man rotation to get fully rested
and again there is no franchise mode
team sport games should not be on the market without a franchise mode
do would be far ahead of the competition if they can incorporate a franchise mode using the minor leagues
and how about some type of celebration after you win the world series there is absolutely nothing
also when a player dives it takes him  seconds to get up which is way too much time
also the dive and jump button are both the same button triangle so you may want to jump but computer causes you to dive and then you have to sit on the ground for  seconds before you can get up and recover the ball
do needs to seperate the two movements
i really dont understand why do did not fix these flaws since they were in high heat   the game this year has players in the dug outs but they are still figures that dont add to the game
after a player scoreshe still walk over to the dug out and then disappear
he doesnt enter the dug out he just diappears
hey do how difficult is if for them to walk down stairs to a bunch of their teammates and slap their hands or get angry and throw a bat or just sit down
the game still keeps excellent statistics but they are very difficult to navigate through
for example you cannot simultaneously see the person with the highest batting average and the team the person plays on
this goes for nearly all the stats the team name is not fixed as you scroll horizontally so it is hidden as you check out the statshowever this game is far from bad
the game play is still terrific and realistic
you can now adjust the game to whether you would like more of a realistic or arcade feel
so it is attractive to both type of gamers
i like realism so my review is based on my perspective
the pitching is realistic and you must select carefully where to place balls with certain players
players also have hot streaks and droughts just like in real life
also a player can perform better or worse than what is expected which is also attractive about the game
the game remains to be realistic and fun to play but i expect that a software company can improve on its titles annually
do dropped the ball with improvements and this game is far from perfect
i would still recommend the game if you are looking for a baseball game however i would rent it first to see if you like ityou could say that this is the definitive version of onimusha because its got extras and the best visuals
however i cant help but wonder why capcom didnt decide to loosen up the controls a little more
this game controls like the original resident evil where you press up to move forward and left and right make your character rotate
its not a game breaking control scheme obviously but it could have been updated to make moving the character easier
visually its great and i cant complain
the added bonus would be the ogre tower that has floor after floor of enemies and bonus treasure as you work your way to the top
i think this game is entertaining with some really great cutscenes and an impressive ending but i still have one question after all of it
in this game nobunaga is this demonic emperor that your trying to stop
in real life i thought he was supposed to be some sort of japanese legend or something
why did they make nobunaga a bad guy
perhaps i just need to research what i heard a bit morei like survival horror games and i like samurai games so i thought this would be a pretty good game
after playing it for a couple of weekends i can t fully recommend it to the casual gamerfirst off the control scheme never really gelled with me
it wasnt difficult to manuever around but it never completely felt natural to mepaticularly when you are engaged in battlebecause of that the game seem unnaturally difficult especially the boss fights
the worst character to deal with was this seemlying unstoppable demonic doll which flys around in the airive played a lot of games before but i never felt so frustrated like this one
there were times i wanted to smash my controller on to the groundi give this game points on the great graphics and sound but you may want to rent this one before buyingi anticipated this game highly as most reviewers said that this game with incredible
well it was incredible  incredibly averagethe controls are so ridiculous and tiring that even an experienced gamer has a hard time maneuvering as well as trying to fight while at the same time quotstealing soulsquot  halo has exceptional controls this is just plain terriblethe graphics are nice if you like prerendered graphics nothing is real time as far as graphics go your character cant jump just what kind of samurai is he
 and he cant do things like walk up stairshe cant do that because the background is prerendedered and except for some slight movement its static and doesnt changeif you want a good game stick with halo and avoid this unless its on salelets face it  we all love a goodlooking game
while some purists out there might claim that looks or graphics dont matter we all know that thats not true
when we launch a game like wreckless and take a look at the screen we all want to run out and call our spouse sibling or friend to check it out
and graphically speaking this is a title worth checking out
the problem with the game is that it is extremely tough in a way that becomes frustrating and infuriating
this is an arcade type game which requires the player to repeat levels over and over again until the figure out the key to beating it
i unfortunately am not that patientso give the game two stars for how it looks and one star for how it plays
thats three stars which makes it better than average
the look on the nongamers face when they see it is worth the price of admissionon a totally aesthetic level youd be hardpressed to find a prettier game on any gaming system
the xboxs muchtouted gpu really shows its stuff off in wreckless the yakuza missions with realtime reflections bumpmapping everywhere and intense city streets
never before have the streets of hong kong been modeled in such detail
much of what you see can be demolished from the dim sum stands to fences to oncoming traffic
watching the people running for their lives in the streets is both fun and realistic
you cant run them over thoughnow that ive gotten the graphics out of the way let me explain how the game plays
sadly playabilitywise wreckless really doesnt hold a candle to its beautful graphics
why you ask
because its just a super runabout sega dreamcast clone with far better graphics and effects
youre basically given a series of missions to complete mostly ramming enemy vehicles until their energy bar runs outwith a variety of cars that seem to handle like they were constructed out of tin foil
its painfully easy to spin out or flip over which is bad news since all the missions are timed
sometimes a legitimate hit on a yakuza car will send you flipping around bouncing off innocent cars in the traffic in a chainreaction method costing you both time and your sanity
if you flip your car over be prepared to lose several seconds while the game gives you a new car
also the game clock keeps ticking while youre in an elevator or taking snapshotsthese are basically cut scenes in which you have no control yet you still lose time
bad game design
sometimes the actual goal of the mission is rather vague and relies too much on trial and errorthis is most evident in the stage where you have to take out  dim sum stands going only by  camera snapshots and a pretty useless hotcold tracking meter
considering that the city youre driving in is pretty large this is by no means an easy task
it seems like you can play the same missions over again and wind up with different resultsluck has a lot to do with your success in the game
the ai is not very forgiving and the lucky aspect just reeks of poor game designhaving trouble with a particular mission
too bad
youre going to have to play through it over and over until its beaten
theres no way to skip any of the tough missionswreckless has been highly praised by practically every game magazine ive read and i am wondering why this is
the nice graphics
the special effects
theres definitely nothing new in this game and i find it to be a bit on the frustrating side
am i sorry for buying it
not at allits fun for a mindless gaming session but will i be bothered to play through it over and over again to finally beat it
probably notnote to developersthis is a prime example of quotpretty graphics and eye candy do not make a great gamegameplay is the all important aspect of any video gamequotwreckless by activision is a highintense demolition derbylike arcade racer for the xbox which makes great use of the xboxs ability to render great looking graphics
its a shame that the gameplay didnt match the look of the game
the game itself is pretty fun to pick up and play for the first couple of hours but the repetitiveness of crashing into people other cars and just the city environment gets tiring
it doesnt help that despite having an easy set of driving controls wreckless lives up to its name in terms of controlling the carmaybe it was done purposely but a racer which causes a player to spinout fishtail and crash at the slightest bump or pebble on the course doesnt make for a highspeed gaming
it seems that theres a great game just waiting to come out of wreckless but instead it remains locked behind a repetitious gameplay balky driving mechanics and boring missions objectives
wreckless does make for great eyecandy as the developers made great use of the xboxs graphical power
the sound effects are aboveaverage and works great with a home theater surround sound system
definitely a rental if that at best
criterion studios would get it right with their burnout series and culminating with the excellent burnout revengeof all the postrelease xbox games to come out this is the one that i and probably everyone else have looked forward to the most
i bought it without a second thought when i finally saw it on the rack at the storeunfortunately i didnt have the review that i am writing now to give me a second thought
perhaps this will help youlet me start with what is great about the game
no doubt about it the graphics are it
they are absolutely just as amazing as all the hype has made them out to be
and the replays the replays are designed so well that combined with the graphics you could be fooled into thinking you are watching a care chase from your favorite action movie
unfortunately thats about all the game does really wellwhat the game does poorly is appeal to nonhardcore gamers
this game is not for the casual gamer
this game is hard
its challenging because the missions are tough but difficulty in controlling your vehicle increases the difficulty tenfold
whats really frustrating is you have a vehicle that can crash through just about anything in the game from mailboxes to city buses but if you touch a wall your car sticks to it like glue
the streets are often extremely narrow and intersections are usually not noticable until youve already passed them
this makes navigating the city an agrivating experience most of the timehardcore gamers may be able to beat all the missions  in all but their complaint will more likely be that the game is too short each mission takes aproximately two minutes to complete
casual gamers will find much more longevity in the game as they play the same mission over and over again until they finally put the game away and never play againthis is one of those games that you want to like so bad it hurts
the concept is already proven in the classic and extremely underappreciated dreamcast game super runabout which has inferior graphics but superior gameplay but the execution in this game is really lackingbuy this game if you want something to show off your xboxs graphical capabilities
even the most stubborn playstation loyalist will have to admit that there is no way in hell that the ps could ever look near this good
or buy this game if you are a hardcore gamer who is up to the challenge
youll definately like the game much more if you can actually complete the missionswreckless stylistically is one of the bestlooking game ive played
when it came out in  a few of the major game reviewing outlets were giving the game high praise as though so mesmerized by the visuals they were unable to see that the game itself stunk
i admit as i played through it i was stunned by the technical aspects of the game
it had nice lighting beautiful filters greatlooking cars and spectacular effects when you smashed into things
the whole city of hong kong was alive with people traffic light or heavy and buildings with flashing signs
not many games even today can boast such visuals
the game had a unique visual style that lifted it above and beyond those simply concerned with realism
if i were to sit down and put this in my xbox today it would be to admire the nice visuals not to enjoy the gameplayany enjoyment you get out of the gameplay revolves around the games graphics
you crash into other cars and smile at the destruction
you fire the tanks cannon and watch as the cannon shell lights up its surroundings while hurtling towards its target and then comes the visual bang when the explosion scatters cars and objects everywhere
missions essentially boil down to destroying objects andor cards traveling at high speeds and even some wacky ideas
the game is more actionadventure than racing game
after the first few missions which are quite fun you begin to realize it doesnt really matter that the game looks so great
frustration begins to set in as you set out on missions to collect tnt or when you come across platforming section yes on a car in order to take pictures of specific locations
also sadly the missions are timed
what could easily make the game more enjoyable is a mode that allows you to drive around hong kong just to admire the games massive city
instead the missions confine you to very small areas within the gameafter eleven or twelve hours of gameplay time you probably wont put this back in your xbox
there are different difficulties to play through but after youve beaten a mission on normal its not all that difficult on hard
the game was later released for the ps and gamecube with double the missions more cars to unlock missile attachments pedestrians to run over and a huge degradation in graphics
without the great visuals no matter what else is added the game is just not worth itthe game has great levels great cars great missions except that it is way to short
there are two different senerios you can choose from cops or spys
each senerio has  missions which take like  minutes to complete each one
once you unlock all the cars and secret things this game get borring fastperhaps i demand a little too much from a video gamebut this is one that you should run right out and rent but avoid actually purchasingthe graphics were fabulous
the gameplay was interesting
the storyline was a bit fuzzy
and the time to beatthree days
granted i didnt unlock all of the cars but who really cares
you get the one you need after you pass the first mission
so basically in three days of off and on gameplay you would have an expensive coaster on your hands if you bought it
maybe you could lend it to friends and borrow something that has a longer shelf life but theyd probably be at your door later that week screaming for you to give back their copy of halo or project gotham
on the other hand you could take my advice play beat and return a pretty good game to enter rental store of your choice here and be done with it for a tenth of the financial cost and with all of your friendships intactthere isnt much to this game you drive around the hit things with your car
sort of an outdated concept not really worthy of xbox marketing
the graphics and game ambience is great
there are a lot of reviews that try and compare to grand theft auto gta that is not a fair comparison
gta is a different game also much more fun
a fair comparision is driver but again driver is more fun as there are more game options
what wreckless lacks is alternate forms of game play
some people tire of the mission based game and want to free roam or do other missions
this game would have been great to have free roam as there are great levels yet no time to do any of themthis game which i was dumb enough to buy  is fun but if your not a patient person youll be thowing your controller into the screen
but those people who are patien and who have major time on there hands youll love this game
the graphics are great the thing is as hard as the game was i wanted to keep playing it because i wanted to get past it
so the replay value is really good
so overall grahpicsgameplaysoundreplay valuechalleningfunthis game is pretty cool the graphics are awesome and the characters laughable in my opinion
however there is not much replay value in it
you might want to rent it firstthis game was not my cup of tea
i quickly got bored within  minutes of playing this game
yes the graphics are amazing as advertised but i found the gameplay shallow and plain boring
the good thing is that the levels are huge and filled with pedestrians carts buildings and traffic
unfortunately due to the timed missiondriven nature of the game you never get to fully explore which is what made gta so amazing the city
also unlike gta you are not free to get out of your car and roam about
the basic gameplay is to crash into enemy carstruckscartsetc
surprisingly the car physics is more sim than arcade
personally i would have much prefered racing the streets of hong kong against other cars rather than chasing bad guys so i can ram them to deathi got pretty excited about this game  months ago when i saw a preview video but its been a disappointment
i strongly recommend a rental before shelling out after all the hype surrounding this game it turns out to be little more than buggy eyecandyafter taking so much time to detail the world to spec why on earth is the driving style arcade and no way to choose for a more realistic drivethe replay feature on this game is horrid if you actually want to watch it for the replay
the camera angle and lighting effects for lack of better word change sparatically and you may or may not be able to see what you wanted with the terrific detail of the gameas someone else noted after you hit a car for as much damage as it can handle it will blink a few times then go poof
also once you hit a car all its passengers suddenly appear outside of the vehicle
seriously now lets all go out in the middle of the road in a car then just suddenly pop out if we are nudged by anythingalso of note if you want to brake at any time be certain to keep all four wheels on the ground  trust me if one wheel is in the air your car will accelerate
even if you apply brakeanother point of interest if you are falling a short distance then land with brake applied the vehicle will spin approximately  to  degrees to the left
this makes it very difficult to line up moving panels  oh and what
moving panels i mean like mario where you have to jump from the bricks that move to other ones that are also movingin a carplease if you have a playstation get grand theft auto   if you dont at least find a game worthy of the cash you should spend instead of on this gamerecommending wreckess poses a dilemma
there are so many things about the game that are good most specifically those things surrounding the graphics
wreckless contains a beautiful and detailed hong kong cityscape and is chock full of special effects
after a mission you can watch a replay that is stunningly realistic
the game is also easy to pick up and lots of fun to playso whats the problem
unfortunately this is not a game that will grip you for hours
after the pretty graphics and the novelty of smashing everything in sight wear off you find the gameplay has little substance
drive around smash stuff drive around some more etc
dont get me wrong the game can be great fun but only as something you pick up every once in a while when you want a quick and fastpaced game
dont hesitate to buy wreckless up if you can get it at a discount
otherwise you might want to try a rental firstone last thing that should be mentioned
this game is based in hongkong so vehicles drive on the wrong ie left side of the road
this means that when you start you will find that your natural inclinations meet you head on with a lot of traffic
in order to be able to complete more advanced levels you have to learn to get in and stay driving in the left lanethe battles are so short in this game and the story mode is so short i had all the extra characters and such after just a few days
there are much better games out there virtua fighter  and doa are prime examples of good fighting gamesi cant honestly see how resident evil survivor got lower scores than this game
this game stars leon kennedy the guy from re and  and the game begins on a ship filled with zombies and you must make your way through it
sounds like a good oldfashioned zombie slaughterfest right
unfortunately mostly thats wrong
this game features perhaps the stupidest method of killing zombies i have ever seen let alone any game ive played
heres how it works there is a strange scale with a rectangular thing that goes back and forth on the scale and since your enemies are in front of you you can only hit them when the rectangular thing passes them yes its as confusing as it sounds
the graphics look okay for a game boy color game but they need work
what manages to save this game from disaster is the creepy vibe creepy music and overall okay presentation of the game
the puzzles feel about the same to its psone console cousins find certain things like keys to unlock new areas along with an assortment of other things
the zombies still have their decomposing glory in their looks and the fact leon is on this game manages to salvage most of the presentation
but its stupid killing methods and the lack of a deeper game will probably leave most handheld fans disappointed if you want a resident evil handheld go buy resident evil deadly silence for the ds instead
also the game is a little less clear on objectives than its console cousins as well so you will get lost and confused
unless youre a rabid re fan there isnt much to check out on this game
oh and capcom why cant you shoot with the a button while aiming with the b button
seriously it would have been much better if it didnt have that stupid scalets a good game but accuses the old ok to have a good time
it is a copydespite the beautiful graphics and multiple characters to choose from including several from final fight i just cant see any real difference between this and the endless other on beatemups out therei never really mastered all of the special moves but there werent needed as fighting with simple punches and kicks was good enough
its fun for a while but in no way a game i would spend ages playing and finishing as every last character
im not that sad and ive got better things to do with my timegraphics asound bgameplay blasting appeal blong before i bought the nintendo ds i already resolved to get a game boy advance game to test the systems backwards compatibility
and one title has always been first on my list
from capcoms classic fighting series street fighter alpha  for the gba is probably one of the best fighting games for a system that ironically just wasnt built for fighting gamesthough graphics and features alone dont make a video game its amazing that so much perhaps too much was stuffed into one little cartridge
while some sacrifices had to be made the announcers gone and the musics average at best the graphics are pretty close to what youd find in console versions of the game
you also get to choose from a whopping  characters including  hidden characters from capcom vs snk with all their special moves super moves and ism fighting styles intact
the game also has  playing modes to keep you busy half of which are unlockables but hey thats what cheat codes are for
and best of all the games battery backup saves everythingthe games most obvious drawback is of course the controls
as frustrating as it is to perform ryus hadoken fireball with a dpad and an awkward button layout the developers did all they could given the hardware
but sometimes even the easiest attacks can take half a beat to perform
and sfa s single mode might as well be its story mode if you choose a new character while youre on a roll with another youre forced to start from scratchin spite of the kinks sfa  is still a sweet setup for the gba
but simplified controls would have made it perfect
of course if you got to have street fighter on the go you can either make due with this or play sfa max with the psps control nub
either way your thumbs will get quite a workoutthis game is rated t for teen violenceghouls n ghosts for sega genesis was one of my all time favorite gameswhen i heard about maximo i practically screamed with joyi bought itpopped it into my ps andwellthe screams of joy quickly turned into screams of aggravationit captures the essence of the gng worldthe worlds are big colorful and filled with beastiesthe music is done welland then we get to the rest of the gametoo often you have no idea where to gothere are very few save pointsyou get killed every ten secondstheres challenging then theres just flat out cheap and annoyingthe combat in this game sadly falls into the latter categoriesi dont even remember how far i got into this game before i just gave upone of the few games that i paid hard cash for full price back when it came out and just gave up due to the ridiculous difficulty levelits worth a rental if you can still find itgamers who enjoy nothing short of total aggravation will enjoy this gameold school fans of ghouls n ghosts might want to let this one fade awaybeautiful graphicsgreat atmospheretoo darn hardonce upon a time there was an arcade game in the s called ghosts and goblins
this game was later ported over to the original nintendo system
it was a fun game but one of the most difficult games i have ever played in  years of gaming
maximo is reminiscent of ghosts and goblins and this is not a bad thing
this is a three dimensional hack and slash game
it takes skill to stay alive
a similar game would be medievalthe difference between maximo and medieval would simply be the amount of fun each game is to play
while overly easy medieval was a lot of fun
maximo is just not that fun to play
im a fairly patient gamer being a fan of rpgs but i could not muster up enough interest to keep playing maximomaximo is quite a game
in many aspects it is quite good with its great graphics and vast environments
but one thing just stands out and must be mentioned one must possess some serious serious masochistic tendencies in order to venture into this gaming world
i mean come on i enjoy a good challenge as much as the next guy but the difficulty in this game is almost ridiculous practically to the point of being painfulthere are  main worlds which are broken up into about  square miles of area you must check out as you try and do battle with  monsters at the same time just hoping to avoid those  hits it takes for you to croak and hoping youll get a single measly life potion so you can survive a few more steps til you get attacked by  other beasts
plus if you do make it in one piece to one of the  or  save points in the entire game and kudos to you if you do youre so wasted by then its practically pointless cause the next time you load the game all you can pretty much do is take one step and dieso basically graphics wise its pretty cool
but the experience itself can be torture
the only reason i give maximo  stars is cause its so freakin hard that there is that feeling of hell yeaaahh
 when you actually get to finish any part of your quest which most likely occurs when your armor is long gone and youre down to your boxersits fun slashing breaking stomping skeleton warriors but i feel theres something missingcapcom made it so you cant continue unlimited times which makes the game tougher for novice players
game was a bit toughi dont feel like theres any replay value
i think many feel this way because on auction sites you will find many copies of maximoso overall fun at first no more fun in about a monthi rented this game and i played it for a good chunk of time when i realized i was doing the same darn things over in each level
i know there are different moves he gets but common
that doesnt make a great game
so if you play this game after a while into it you will notice your eyelids getting heavy you will yawn a few times then realize that this game is more than a bit repeatative in each level
then if your like me youll put it away and forget you even bought the thing because there is nothing that should grab your attention in maximo
if you want a good slice and dice game go out and get devil may cry
if you already onw devil may cry then what do you want with maximo
there is nothing that would make me want to buy maximofirst off let me start off by saying that this game is hardchances are if youve ever played the original ghouls n goblins or ghost n ghouls then youll know exactly what youre in for
the problem is maximos a more modern take on gng but offers gameplay thats marred with frustrating control a lack of dual analog stick action and some of the worst draw distance ive actually seen on the ps
matter of fact the only other game that suffered with such frustrating controls would be a game called spirits and spells for the gamecube which was considerably worstthe main problems of the game would be actually judging the distance of a well timed jump or judging the distance of an attack against an enemy right in front of you who more than most of the time does not get hitthe enemies have a great system of fighting and their techniques vary
not so much with what theyre doing but when they actually do it maximo himself is armed with a sword shield armor and some neat powers such as a flaming sword longer sword a lightsaberesque looking sword variation and so on
but i found that no matter what i was armed with the best gameplay approach was taking my time
because not only are the enemies hard and in overwhelming numbers but levels are riddled with traps such as the ground collapsing on you arms reaching from the ground sapping health etcwith that said heres the good newsthe graphics are goodthe game resembles a gamecube platformer rather than the usual jaggy games on the ps
its smooth the colors are crisp rich and vibrant and it really takes advantage of what the pss capable of which is an incredible feat considering this is an early title
certainly it doesnt look as good as some ps games like jak and daxter or rachet and clank but it certainly ranks very high and looks tons better than a good number of ps gamesall in all i enjoyed this game
if it wasnt for the frustrating controls and lack of dual analog sticks this wouldve gotten a better score from mei bought maximo because of fond memories of the ghosts n goblins and ghouls n ghosts games
the switch from d to d has reared an unfortunate problem in the shape of the camera angles
in the originals you always knew where your enemies were approaching from
the majority of your enemies spring from the ground and then make a beeline straight to you and this can be very frustrating when you havent realized that theyre behind you
the angles ban be manually switched via the shoulder buttons but id have preferred the game to try to keep the action ahead of your charactermy other gripe is that this game is basically psones medievil with smoother graphics
not medievil  either the original from years back
the backgrounds the monsters the music all hark back to medievil and unfortunately theyre not even as original or varied
admittedly all medievil was was a copy of ghouls n ghosts in d but it beat maximo to it by a good few yearsdefinately rent this out first and then make your mind up
played back to back with the likes of devil may cry maximo comes off as a little too shallow and simplisticrunning on land sword fighting and searching for items gets pretty tiresome i think
its standard fairbut sailing the seas and blowing up other ships with your cannons is a lot of fun
great evenif anyone from ea is reading this id love to play a multiplayer version of this where you sail the high seas and blow your friends out of the water
thats easily the best parti think the storyline is highly improbable if not dorky
quotmy mother was a pirate
quot and having modelesque game leads for the sake of it is getting kind of old
so forget all that and spend as much time on the open ocean as you canim shocked to find myself dissapointed at this game
there are developers who clearly have a fine attention to detail and the right attitude about making games but there is no cooperative two player no multiplayer at all the map designs are rather linear and dont lend themselves to exploration the game is unplayable without a dual shock controller and finally moh allied assault and moh underground were better
get those insteadi never played any of the other moh games but the trailer for this looked cool so i rented it one night last week
the first mission is cool enough  obviously inspired by saving private ryan  but i soon became frustrated by the games controls
having to use the analog nubs to move look and aim the gun was tricky  and the constant vibrations given off by the dual shock controller made aiming at far off targets extremely difficult
although the game itself was intriguing  it was fun to blow up stuff  there are still plenty of problems that i dont expect from the ps the ai
in the game while intelligent still suffers from slight confused at points  running at walls for instance or seemingly becoming confused the poor aiming system without any auto aim even the centering feature seems off center makes hitting any target with accuracy difficult
many times i found myself having to take a few hits just to get a shot off there isnt that much freedom in movement
even when walking around outside you are limited to the paths that you can take
basically you must walk a certain route and cant go any other direction
it becomes frustrating when you realize that your freedom is actually quite limited you cant kill npcs like in games such as halflife
whats the fun of a war game without friendly fire
bleh the music  eventually they will figure out that it takes longer than  minutes to finish a level in these games and make the music a bit more subdued or at least less monotonous
during one espescially tricky level i was ready to kill myself due to this loud and repetitive score its too darn loud
at times the explosions and gunfire drown out the game dialogue
espescially in the opening mission
i understand that war is noisy  but all of those explosions didnt drown out the musicall in all the game  while at times fun and impressive  comes down to your average fps
there is no real challenge to the game if you take your time  but youll find that you want to finish the game as soon as possible just because it becomes repetitive after some time
perhaps worth a rental  but dont buy this onemost medal of honor games are very good the multiplayer mode is fun and the missions are interesting
frontline does not have a multiplayer mode and the missions are really boring
the ai is awful just because an enemy can throw your grenades back at you dose not make the game any more realistic or challanging
thegraphics are not that great and the game is short
i beat it the same day i bought it in about four hours
overall the game is fun but it does notv have the replay value of the first tworent ithere is the bottom line for this gamepros  loads of fun experiencing world war  battles
awesome sound that keeps you on the edgs of your seatcons  a whole lot of glitches
people stand half way through doors at times
animation for people is very boxy at times
enemy ai is smart but your allies are all retards that stand around and get killed
only about  out of  missions where youre actually fighting with more than just yourself which makes it incredibly unrealistic
there is no blood so its impossible to see whether or not the person is reloading injured or dying
the aiming with the weapons is terribly inaccuratebought this  year ago and its in the middlethis is game is one of the weirdest shooters i played besides metal gear solid 
the graphics are kind of weird but the authenetic vocies of german soldiers make it up
the game gets confusing though
the first level where you try to leave ship and pass the barracks took me  hour just to cover the wounded soldiers
this game also gets you a headache after you play
overall just get medal of honor rising suni was eagerly waiting for this game being about  months since the pc version came out
unfortunately it was not worth the wait
while being advertised as completely differnet missions there are way too many that are rehashedmy biggest complaints are about gameplay
the missions are short and the enemies are far too easy
during the opening mission langing at utah beach you can stand up and run from one side to the other side of the beach on hard mode without taking severe damage
i personally think the game was made easier than the pc version becasue you can only save at the end of a mission
another annoyance
this leads to short easy missions
additionally since you use the right analog stick to aim the control is jerky to say the least
there does not appear to be a way to set the sensitivity of the controls so aiming at a specific enemy or at a body part is quite difficult
the enemies are so easy that on the normal skill level you can run into a room that has  germans with machine guns and shoot them one by one
the ai seems ok at best
enemies will not try to circle around you even when there are other doorsan enjoyable game but maybe the ps was the wrong platform
after making the huge leap from underground to the pc with allied assault this is a step back
enjoyable but does not seem to have a ton of replayabilility
more a rental than a purchaseafter mohaa came out i was expecting a lot from this game
the graphics in this are just poor
it looks like your in an interactive painting
the ai is still pretty stupid just like in mohaa
the missions are boring and the dday mission isnt even close to as intence as the one in mohaa
my biggest complaint is there is no ingame save
i slent  hours on one level then died and had to start all over againdont get me wrong i love the medal of honor series but somethings troubling me
this series has taken a turn for the repetetive the level design has seriously lacked coming on to the ps and pc
shouldnt they be bigger
more expansive
the worst part is the sarcrifice made to enemy ai and animations
you may get to shoot enemies in different parts of the body but aparently this does not reflect in the damage you take
you can shoot and enemy in the head  times before he goes down but shoot another enemy once in the knee and hes dead as a door nail
maybe the knee is there secret weak point
now what this game does right is sound authentic realistic and intense if only the gameplay followed  graphically the game is pretty much as good as it gets on the ps but if graphics make a game then this is for you just dont mind the gameplay
there is a bit of replay here as with all the moh games but the overall game is a little short well actually average length for these games nowadaysmohfrontline looks like one of the best games especially at the beginning when youre thrown into the storming of the normandy beachesbut then you go on all of these quotbondlikequot missions i mean who in wwii fought alone who broke into a secret uboat factory alonethere is no way a person could take out that many people
its possibleif i wanted a  person alone shooter i would have bought nightfire or one of the other bond seriesi wish that mohfrontline was a tactical sqaudbased first person shooter i mean even when youre teamed up with a group of people they never kill anyone just recklessly shootin the end metal of honor frontline  could have been the coolest game invented if it wasnt so quotbondlikequot it gets really old having to kill everyone yourself without the help of your socalled quotcommradesquotmoh frontline is only cool if you really like  or something like that but if youre looking for squadbased real war i recommend ghost reconheres a breakdowngraphics  this is one of the best parts of the game it all fits together nicely and looks seemlessgameplay  its ok but machine guns have infinate ammo and its just really shotty ai is completely awfuldifficulty  too mixed theres no feeling of levels getting harder or easier the beginning is hard but then in the middle its really easy
and at the end you face off with tons of germans with one bullethow stupid
fun  gets really hectic and just really stinks that youre on your own facing tons of germansit seems kind of futile
you dont even get to fly the cool plane seems like all of the hours youve spent on the game have been fore nothingthis game could have been great but it wasnt
i mean there is a good premisis but its just too boring and too repetitive
its definately not worth  trust me if you havent played it yet youre not missing anythingthe good high production values solid action great sound effects good animations varied enemies and levelsthe bad no multiplayer lots of slowdown aiming sucks the controls are bad no checkpoints makes the game very difficultthis was one of the first games that blew me away when i was a kid and made me proud to own a ps
the opening dday scene took my breath away all the explosions the scripted scenes the death animations the sound it was all here and the productions values were through the roof
looking back at it  years later throwing an egg on the floor is more excited than watching this game
while i cant compare it to games that came after it even back then there were issues with the game and they just really stick out nowfrontlines realism dropped off after the opening level
after dday you get recruited to do special missions across europe and are a onemanarmy
its very unrealistic when youre running around by yourself killing squads that an entire army takes to take down
youre blowing up fuel depots sabotaging equipment assassinating important nazi figure heads and various other things
the game is solid the scripting is still nice today but the shooting mechanics and controls suck
theres no aiming down the sights instead you just zoom in
shooting from the hip has no reticle so this is useless
my biggest issue with the game and even back then was that it is insanely difficult and there are no checkpoints
if you die you restart the entire level which can be infuriatingyou have to be careful and run around finding health packs and ammo
you can pick up enemies weapons and instead are stuck with what you are given at the start unless you find a placed weapon
i did like the variety of enemies such as fat chefs throwing knives at you engineers cooks butlers and even enemies in robes
the death animations are still nice but wheres the damn blood
the game almost comes off as campy because it is so far from capturing the tragedy of wwii
even back in the day i felt this way
the pacing of the levels is also off because some levels will be really long and tough while others are super shorti did find that the game had some fun cheat codes but theres no replay value
multiplayer wasnt put into the ps version and even the graphics are lacking
theres a lot of aliasing and the framerate drops tremendously during explosions
everything does look clean and you can tell a lot of time and care was put into the game
i just cant get over how bad the aiming is its so squirrely and hard to get a bead on enemies
the game has a pretty decent length campaign and is worth the cheap price if you never played this game
frontline was one of the best wwii games for a reason because it was one of the first to really have high production valuesin the end frontline feels very dated but you can see why the game was praised so much back in the day
the production values still show but the ps cant keep up with the action
the aiming is terrible and controls are all wrong but what can you expect from an  year old gamethere are some gameplay genres that prove the old adage the more things change the more they stay the same
medal of honor frontline proves that no matter how you dress up a first person shooter at its core frontline is basically the same as most other first person shooter games
the game degenerates into the same static formula of running around and arbitrarily blowing away the enemy the only difference is you are doing it in a world war ii settingthe graphics in this game are terrific
its almost too bad they are used in a game that gets this monotonous
the nazi uniforms are very accurate and detailed
the environments are nicely rendered
there is the occasional slowdown where the framerate slows to a crawl but thats is forgiveable
electronic arts really went the extra mile to make sure that this game authentically portrayed the era as faithfully as possible
the sound is also very well done
the weapons have great sounds when you use them
glass breaking footsteps on creaky floors
the game gives you some excellent audio effects
the controls are also good but they will take you a little while to get the handle of using both analog sticks to aimunfortunately its the gameplay that leaves something to be desired from medal of honor frontline
no matter how hard you try to dress it up the game play is extremely repetitive an mind numbingly so
no matter what weapon you use it doesnt change the fact that you are doing the same thing over and over again
alot of people who play first person shooter games will tell you that its more realistic but it comes at the expense of gameplay
if this game were presented in third person perspective i cant help but think that it could have opened the door for more diverse gameplay
such as commanding squads and even some stealth elements
but there are certain segments of the gaming public that would consider such an idea as blasphemous as if it were violating some sort of fps doctrine
with that mindset you get what you have here basically the same game as countless other fps out there now just in a differnt package
the game is also very linear in nature
you go from point a to point b with no deviation and with zero room to improvise along the wayi gave this game three stars mostly for its graphics however i still cant recomend it
if youre looking for a different take on the shooter concept then i would have to recomend freedom fighters also from electronic arts
it takes combat shooter a step further by giving you a third person view and mixing in squad commands and a nonlinear style of gameplaywhen i first played the dday beachlanding level i was quite impressed however as i progressed further i discovered many things which gradually decreased my level of enjoyment
first and foremost among these would be the gawdawful atrocious goodfornothin justplainlousy controlsonce again the dualshock  proves how completely worthless it is for firstpersonshooters
shooting a soldier from just ten feet can be a challenge
i cant believe they didnt implement some sort of autoaim feature such as in goldeneye
did they honestly think these controls where adequate
about the only good thing i can say about the controls is that theyre not as bad as the first two psx gamesea must have decided that the controls made the game too difficult so they were kind enough to make all the nazis you have to fight severely mentally disabled
if the nazis in real life had been this dumb wwii would have ended in a week
i cant tell you how many times i found these guys stuck running in place while a battle raged around them
this would have made the game far too easy were it not for the controls see above and the lack of savepointsi think limiting saves is a cheap way of making a game challenging
i played half the game on the hard setting and i found the challenge to be just about rightexcept for the fact that i kept losing hours of playtime due to the lack of saves
finally i had to move the difficulty down a notchwhich made the game to easybut it was better than having to play entire levels over again each time i died
i mean some of the levels can last over an hour when you die right near the end it can be somewhat aggravating
when it was announced that the ps would have  meg memory cards i thought we would finally be through with savepoints or complete lack there of
why can we not save anywhere as in pc games
and if they must put savepoints in a game then they should never be further than  minutes apart
playing parts over again just to get to the point where i left off is just a waste of my timethere is one part of mohf which truly impressed me though
from the sound of bullets whizzing by you to the shouts of nazi soldiers or the johnwilliamsstyle orchestrated score the sound in mohf is truly second to none
i especially like the sound of the sniper rifle
when i first found it i kept pulling the trigger over and over just to hear the echoing crack each bullet madeanother strong point is the graphics
while they may not be technologically impressive the framerate could be better and the textures are kind of dull when you get up close to them they do a very good job of accurately recreating wwii
im no history expert but everything seems to have a very authentic look to itthat is except for the complete lack of blood and gorei think that if your going to try to accurately recreate a war in any medium then it should not be censured in any way
war should be depicted as bloody and horrific as it is in real life
if theyre worried about exposing children who might play this game to violence then i think showing them a censured and sanitized wwii and then telling them its historically accurate would be far more detrimental
war is hell and it should be depicted that waymy last gripe would be the same gripe i have with almost every fps
its way too linear
im tired of being stuck on rails
im tired of every door being locked except for the one im supposed to go through
and im sick of always being stuck in a canyon every time the game is outdoors
its not really fair to fault mohf for thisas its a problem that almost every fps hasbut i just wish there were more games like deus exwith all these complaints you might think i hated this game but somehow i still found it enjoyable
maybe its just the authentic wwii feel or the excellent soundtrack or maybe its just because i love killing nazis but somehow i did have fun playing this game
its no halo but its still one of the better fpss available for pssound    flawless in every waygraphics    authentic wwii look but technologically could be bettercontrols    seriously needs an autoaim feature
dualshock s joysticks just arent up to the jobgameplay   completely linear terrible ai and no saves in between levelsfinal score    somehow despite all the flaws i still had quite a bit of funthis game is not fun for me
difficulty is at times ridiculous and ai is not good at all
only buy if you have money to burngreat graphics and sound
very linear the game feels like its on rails and it gives you no freedom
the ai is also very stupid and the controls stink
this game is worth renting but dont buy it im glad i didntthe good  amazing sound effects bullets flying past solid explosions authentic germanspeaking ss soldiers
historical accuracy except for the final missions
you can reenact the storming of the normandy beach the battles in holland throgh countryside and ruined cities and you can fight alongside other us and uk troops
the weapons are authentic to the ww
the graphics are rather good for a firstperson shooterthe bad  impossible to hit enemies near walls the bullets just hit the air and the nazis turn around and shoot at you
of course they never miss  more linear than a roller coaster ride
this is the most linear starttofinish fps i have ever played
enemy soldiers do not always die when shot at very close range even with weapons that could put a hole through the engine block of a chevy
many many many graphical glitches
you can walk throgh certain npcs enemies that fall from heights after being shot will sometimes freeze there headfirst on the ground with their legs flailing wildly
no blood or gore of any kind
if we want to show how horrible war is show the horrific results of death on the battlefieldthis game being produced by ea big games left me thinking it would be super cool definitely close to nba street and especially the ssx snowboarding games
dang i was let down big timethe game is somewhat fun and has good graphics
but it doesnt compare to the games mentioned above
not even compared to the arcade snowrider gamesi wouldnt recommend buying this unless you are a hardcore fan of this genremc white said  it rocksnothing so special in this title 
if you want to seek for the best graphics  go for pc
on ps the graphics are a bit worse but still fair to play the original need for speed hot pursuit has to rank up there with the best all time race games
it was so much fun because of features like damaged vehicles realistic physics notable variances and modeling in the licensed vehicles great police and competitor ai gorgeous scenery and effects
now after quite a wait nfs hot pursuit  is here
unfortunately it doesnt live up to its predecessor and namesake
to be fair though let me list the positive qualities that make this game a choice for some playersarcade feeling  if you like the driving games that you normally have to dump  in to play this is probably a game for you
graphically the scenery and tracks are very pleasing to the eye though not quite what one might expect with todays capabilities
still its hard to argue that it doesnt look good if nothing elseon to the negativesarcade feeling  yes this is both a positive and negative mark for the game
the original nfs felt and played with a palpable sense of control
you wanted to drive as fast as possible but worked hard to keep your car intact and damage free
not so with this game
you can crash and smash to your hearts delight
there is no damage modelling or concerns that your vehicle will perform any less than when you started
how well you drive doesnt really matter so long as you generally keep the car pointed down the trackai  the police are every bit as fast as you are regardless of the vehicle you choose to drive
they have little problem harassing you and no matter how effective of a driver you are the only ways to loose them are to duck through a shortcut or manage to somehow wreck them
this is lazy game design
furthermore police have the habit of ignoring all other drivers
though countless other speedsters dash by a waiting officer the cop will only stop eating donuts when you pass by
and thanks to the poor physics and game play the majority of the time you will have a cop riding your car doors like an ant on a cake crumb
being speedy has little to do with this game and outrunning any pursuit is more or less impossible
dont mistake it  they designed it this way and this aspect alone is a huge sore point with the games core play style and aiphysics  while this goes along with the arcade flavor of the game for those who might prefer it the physics are still horrible
yes even an arcade game
flamboyant wrecks spin you awkwardly and utterly unbelievably sometimes dozens and dozens and dozens of times
itd be mockingly ridiculous if they actually meant it
but no this is just more laziness showing through
its sad to say but i recall driving games on the intellivision and atari that had better physics modeling than this nfsgameplay  the cars all perform like each other
regardless how effective your driving you wont find any reward
in some ways when you win a nagging sense will linger because youll know that you were lucky rather than skillfully achieving your finish
skill has nothing to do with it in this game
and it just doesnt have the same fun factor one expects from an nfs game because of the high luckfactor play
what a crying shame toographics  while the graphics are notably good in many respects some of the things that made the previous nfs games that much more delightful are absent in this game
no gutsquashed bugs tapping onto the windshield dust plumes obscuring the view or the other environmental details that helped create the immersive feeling that earlier games in the series provided
overall the graphics are nice and neat
too neat to feel satisfyingoverall
if you like arcade racers this is ok to spend your money on despite the flawed game play
i would probably recommend saving your money or buying another game altogether however particularly if you are a fan of the previous preporsche nfs games
this one is lacking in all the qualities that made previous players love and enjoy the nfs seriesneed for speed hot pursuit   playstation   for  amazons sake not bad  but im sure ps version is better  even a ps will be better once they make one for the ps so blah to ps game owensfor the first few hours this game is a blast
the concept here is a good old fashioned car chase with you controlling cops or speeders
the game physics are very forgiving making this an easy game for beginners to enjoy
this however is where the game also fails
because it forgives so much no need to steer guardrails will bounce you back on track no need to worry you will magically catch up if you fall too far behind you never flip you accelerate about the same whether you are on sand or road etc it also never rewards you for driving well
you can race flawlessly for x number of laps only to have some cheesy accidentcoptreecompetitor come out of nowhere to steal your victory in complete cpu cheeseball fashion
this game offers a wealth of cool licensed cars ferrari porsche lambo etc but since the drivingphysics model is so unrealistic they all pretty much drive the same ie brakes stink cars oversteer like nobodys business and make the games career mode ultimately unrewardingthe graphics are good and the sense of speed is nice
the sounds are great and lead to the ambience the control is arcadey a plus or minus depending on your pov and the replay value is decent
its a fun game but dont look for too much depth or realism here get gt insteadprosthis game is very fun to play
has a million modes with replay value
nice scenery
the shadinglighting effect needs to be seem to believed
the graphics rival that of crash amp burn
meaning they are great the cops are relentlesscons
i was disapointed in the speed of the cars
in mc you knew you were going  mph
in this game going  feels like your going  this really disturbed me
nothing feels better then having the feeling you are driving at incredible speeds
the slow motion piece when you wreck gets redundant very quickly amp spoils the intensity of the game
it was cool to watch a few times but really slows down the game in mo
ofcourse this effect works great when doing jumps
lasty i didnt like the controls
maybe the physics were to authentic for me i prefer a arcade feel instead of playing a sim style controlstill a great game nfs hot pursuit  is basicly a pc to console nfs high stakes and all the unrealistic qualities of a console game to go with it
but hp is not all bad its somewhat fun to race in career mode and unlocking cars and tracks is fairly regular which helps to keep the game moving
i would say that this game is more multiplayer then single player
the hot pursuit mode is really fun but the lack of car realism when driving is maddening
corners come pretty smoothly and usually you can take them but when hitting a side rail your car will merely bounce off
im not sure that the cars all handle realisticallyin the hot pursuit mode you are a cop trying to stop speeders through ramming speed blocks and spike strips
personally i dont think i would buy hot pursuit  because there are better buys out there
look into the gt series or any other car game with more emphasis on the cars and part upgrades but if you want a quick jump into a nice sporty looking car and to evade the local smokey or be one then i guess hp is your ticketi guesssowscarfacethis racing part of the game is awesome no denying it but this isnt truly a review its a warning
its about the worst thing to happen to a racing game to me forever
it is undoubtably the worst soundtrack that i have ever heard  purchase at your own risk
i recommend a cd player nearby at all timeswell okay
sure ea did it again with another great need for speed game
i got it for the pc a couple months ago wow the graphics are incrediblegame physics are awesome cars are realistic sound is incredible and realistic which is what youd expect from a need for speed game
however i found the game playfun factor itself to be quite lacking
the multiplayer mode is also lacking which i will discuss later
i was expecting so much more
for the last two years i have been addicted to nfs porsche unleashed
there was so much you could do in that game you got to buy new and used vehiclesfix them upupgrade them
you could adjust your gear ratios on some vehicles and you could adjust suspension set up and ride height tire pressure etc etc
you could repaint your vehicle in custom colors with different striping patterns and put a number on iteven the license plate showed your name
even in the original hot pursuit game you could play with several aspects of your car from tire type to gear ratios to suspension stiffness and much much more
hot pursuit  does not have any of this
yeah you get to drive a lot of great fast cars
and sure you can buy upgraded versions of those carsand of course its got need for speed action graphics handling and sound
but it gets boring driving the same car with the same suspension set up the same equipment and the same paint job around the same tracks
also now your license plate says nd  spd
it may not seem like much to a lot of people but i rather liked being able to customize my plate in porsche unleashed
also the multiplayer is wonderful but leaves a bit to be desired
you cant even that i am aware of play multiplayer in hot pursuit mode on the pc
all you can do is pick your car and your track
you dont even get to choose the upgraded specialty vehicles you have to pick a stock one
and in the other need for speed games since you were able to perform upgrades to your vehicle and play with the suspension and drivetrain settings you were able to race against others in multiplayer mode in the cars you had worked so hard to buy and upgrade
one other disadvantage of the game is that you have to use your points to buy all the available tracks
some of them are expensive
and not only do you have to pay for them once but if you want to race them backward mirrored or backwardmirrored you have to buy each one of those individually as well
on a scale of one to ten the graphics and sound are a  the physics and realism of the game deserve a  multiplayer deserves a  which could easily be a 
fun factor is a  which could also easily be turned into a  by adding some unique options
difficulty is a   the game is quite possible to master with experience but man expect to lose quite a few races and have some nice wipeouts when you first install the game
all in all i give the game a  rating
it was worth the money for the pc but i look to be tired of playing it in    monthsthough this game was moderately hyped i was looking forward to it being a fan of the pirate genre
the first person aspect of the game is okay but takes a while to get good at the insane camera angles and there is considerable clipping
the sea battles are pretty good and the story is moderately entertaining
most parts of the game are really easy which is good if you are  or just lousy at most video games like i am
but some parts are really fustrating and confusing
overall it could have been a much better gamei had hoped that this game would be a next gen version of prince of persia but all i got was a cross between a mariostyle game and a wanna be thirdperson shooterthe sea battles though a cool idea a less than spectacular  its very difficult to manaveur the boats with speed and the action is very slowpacedthe game itself is very simple  you run around killing pirates and finding treasures but its just not that fun
perhaps kids will like this because of the cartoon style drawing and that there is not too much blood shown but adults  well stick with max payne or gunvalkeriethe graphics are very psish and just does not seem on par with the xboxs potential
my suggestion rent it for your kids if you have any and then decide to buy it  but if you dont have kids stay away from this gamejames bond  agent under fire
i personally would like to say i expected much better than this
people have to learn their lessons the hard way it seems
as many of you might know ea has made two other bond games both of which terribly bombed
wouldnt anyone not trust them
i didnt so when i played it at a friends house here is what i have to sayfirst of all the graphics are nothing everyone says they are well nothing has really lived up to its hype in this game
just like any videogame the faces are pointed and square
the detail is terrible and guns look like blocks of metal
nothing impressive herenext thing the controlls are terrible
especially if you are playing on the xbox
the controlls can never be as good as halos because like ever videogame you can not customize your controlls they just give you the worst possible list of controllssingle player is just kill anyone you see and get the the finishi have to admit that saving and killing the vip in mutliplayer is awesome
that is the only reason this game is  starswhat does this say
fps games are terrible for videogame systems
computer games are better than videogames because almost every good fps has exactly the oposite of agent under fire
fps on computers are good
video games are bad computer games are goodif you a big fan of bond games you will absolutely enjoy playing auf
if however you are a casual fan and were enthralled by the gameplay in halo and the like id rent this game before purchasingwhile the gameplay is solid the graphics are not nearly as spectacular and the enemies not nearly as intelligent as halothis game as all other bond games before it is very fragmented and is tough to get back into once youve been away from it for a whileit is for all of the reasons above that i give this game  stars with a lean up to maybe   good gamingthis game is a good example of a first person shooter gone bad
the default controls are awkward fortunately you can change them to resemble quothaloquot and the constant interruptions of m and r pointing out the obvious doesnt help
this game is not worth more than a rental you might get some enjoyment out of the multiplayer feature but thats about itsingle player was fun for awhile muitiplayer how ever wasnt that fun besides the jet packs will entertain for a while but gets old quickwell whenever someone sees james bond on a game its probably gonne be picked up
well i was walking around at blockbuster and that exact same phenomenon happend to me
i took it home popped it in and began the first mission
i was at parts amazed at parts extremely disapointed while playing  agent under fire for the microsoft xbox by ea games gameplay okaybut not very good in a lot of parts
first it just feels too easy
you go around shooting people who dont usually shoot back
the game is based on autoaim which really kills gameplay
the graphics are great for the ps but on the xbox the people dont look half as good as they should
the missions overall are short and easy
there isnt much of a variety of guns
there is hardly any ammo and for that case what you come with isnt very much
the guns arent very creative either
just a handgun maybe a rifle here or therevehicles you normally control just one or two every  levels
one time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry but its gets old after awhile
the ability though when you have an assistant in the car to shoot from the headroof was extremely cool
that was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns
vehicles are here theyre just not that commonstory pretty good it actually has one at least
you must save a hostage escape the terrorists take out people in stealth break into the room etc  it actually went by a story line but the crappy part was james girlfriend gets graphics decent but not good
peoples hands dont have  fingers the backgrounds and guards and such dont have faces
bullet marks disapear after going into the wall
no weather factors collapsing buildings etc  the graphics here were once again good not great
better than most ps games but here on xbox one of the worst
sound probably the best part of the game
the voice acting while peoples mouths dont move when they talk is excellent
the sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after reloading brings the gameplay alive
the cars squel when they start fast explosions rock the screen
overall its pretty good
the music in the background isbond of course
the sound was the best part of the game in my opinion that andmultiplayer very fun
the levels are fairly large and the variety of weapons is huge
from jump packs canons bazukas shot guns snipers handguns etcthere are tons of guns
the game keeps score and you can work as a team in player  on  combat
there are life vests to keep your health up and the overall gameplay is good
i loved only one part of this game
it was the multiplayerthis game overall is a good game in terms of how much is costs a twenty should cover it at most stores
persounally id buy it for the multiplayer not the story mode
something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two
this game is a blast in some ways and a major disapointment in others
i plan on buying itmaybe after renting it for a weekthxwhen i first read about this game i was fairly excited
im a huge fan of the gladiator and benhur films and im fascinated by this era in mankinds historyat first glance this game is great
beautiful graphics huge sprawling levels great chariot to chariot racing
id never played anything like it and as far as i know this is the first chariot racing game ever and definitely the first chariot game on any of the next generation systems nintendo gamecube playstation  xboxafter an hour i found some pretty significant downfalls to the game
firstly the controls are confusing and complicated
you control both the driver and the fighter which means you have to steer accelerate brake and fight all at the same time
this isnt so bad after a while once youve gotten the hang of it but its a steep learning curve nonetheless
also the courses get a bit old and repetitive
some of the smaller courses require  laps and this is really boring seeing as its just an ovalall in all this game would make a decent rental
if you need to get a dose of chariot action then by all means get this gamebut if youre like me and youre on a budget or if you just want to wait lucasarts will be releasing gladius in early  which will be a gladiatorial arena type gamei like this game for its idea
it certainly is different from most other games out therethis game is great to play when friends come over
it isnt too hard at first and even good players wont pull too far ahead nor will bad players fall too far behind making this a great party gameunfortunately this is also the problem with this game
no matter how good you are you can not manage to pull ahead
eventually the fighter on one of the other charriots will make you crash
you can catch up pretty easily but it really is a matter of luck to be ahead at the end of the race
perhaps the best strategy is to stay in the last position for the majority of the race and attack towards the end hoping to move by without getting knocked outthis is a simple yet frustrating platform game
this thing has no originality to it whatsoever
then again no one should expect that
first off its a neat game
controlling pacman and navigating that little yellow ball through lush environments is a joy
pacman goes through greens forests snow seas and a spooky swamp
the fact that such a retro figure would be updated to a modern day game is a great thingnow the bad part
this is game is very very cheap
i guess the developers wanted to lengthen the game play without doing extra work
they just made some parts really hard
the second to last boss will make you want to slam your controller
youll swear you made a jump correctly only to fall to your death
to add to that the camera angles are a complete mess
in fact its so severe im surprised the qa department let it go through
sometimes youll be able to alter the camera view but when you have to make the jump quickly as many jumps in the second half theres no time
the camera will switch angles right before the jump or youll make a blind jump and will give you fits
this terrible visual perspective will make you want to kill the game engine developers
couple this with the fact that you cant save at the points you want and youll be repeating stuff a lot
to show how annoying the game is just check out the commercial
youll see they gave pacman over  lives
the commercial producers had to cheat to get the screen shotsfinally they wanted to add some variety so they added swimming skating and a submarine
these levels are very onedimensional and the skating really suffers from the jumping problems mentioned earlierall in all its a good old fashioned fun platform game that doesnt stretch your intellect but could prove really really frustratingprospac man looks so cuteits pac man cmongreat graphicsconstypical platform sort of a carbon copy of rayman  and sonic from dreamcastthe camera angle is terriblenot hard but very very cheapbad variationstime  hoursdifficulty medium to hardfrustration highthis game is not what i was hoping for
but its not a total loss either
arcade fans will love it
its funny how n pushed so many great racing titles but some how there is so few on gamecube
be patient the best racing games youll ever play will arrive on gamecube before you know it
fzero where are youthis game is pretty good
the main problem with it is the batting style of the game
it is too hard to hit the ball but you can put it on easy batting in the options in the middle of the game
i think the outfield plays could have been more simple to do but not too bad
this game is worth buying if you lik baseballbaseball games
but if you are not sure you should rent or play it at a friends house first
this game is actually better than the other game triple play
i dont know about world series though i suggest trying that first also before buying any baseball games except mlb slugfest which is a different blitzstyle type of baseball game where you can hit peoplethis game on xbox is good but could have been much better
pros  graphics is excellent life like faces of the mlb playerscons  the game play is not good
no zoom anglesinstead of all extra featuures asb should have focus on the game play
you will probably get bored with this game after a couple of hoursacclaims all star baseball is now a onceproud franchise instead of the king to which all other baseball sims aspire to
what has happened
all star  for the n was an incredible game with very high replay value
this is just good and it could be so much better
although i gave it a  star rating i actually would give it a  if i could
it is better than a  but it is definitely not a  here are the reasons whygameplaywhere to begin
as others who have reviewed it before me i have already become exasperated with trying to hit
then there is the difficulty in baserunning and fielding
a fly ball was hit over my outfielders head and so i mashed the right trigger to dive for it one thing it takes as long between hitting the button and the fielder executing the move as it does for me to travel to the next state
that is what hurts this game the most the loss of fluidity in motion that was so evident in the n versionsgraphicsi will admit that the graphics are awesome overall but there are some spots that are truly bad
take batting practice at pnc park and you will see the cheesiest downtown backdrop ever made for a system with this kind of power
it looks as if the buildings were actually drawn and colored by hand
there are some minor glitches in player movement as well such as when two players intersect
yet overall this is a strong area for the gameextrasthis is truly the strongest point of the game
it is loaded
i agree with an earlier review that the efforts of the programmers should have been focused on gameplay and not on bells and whistlesreplayi will keep trying but at this point i would only give this a  out of as a diehard all star fan from the n i bought this without a second thought toward renting it first
big mistake
i am very disappointed and i have learned that i must rent first no matter how trusted a franchise the game representsi havent played this game enough to have made a final decision but i want to comment on a few aspects
i dont have time to play full games often and if you are like me and busy you can set the game to quotmanage onlyquot and generate a count
doing this a game takes about  minutesthe game has tons of features including a minor leagues and create a player
it bugs me though that the computer automatically subs for tired players and forces you to use that line upalso i dont think the graphics are that good because you only get one camera angle
then the replay is shown after every play
this wastes time
i wish you could turn that offi think as time goes by i will have more fun with this game because it has so many features and depth
i would probably buy high heat  for the pc if my computer was fast enough to run it because i enjoy the simming aspects of baseball games
i think all star  is probably the best of the console games for simming a seasonit looks like there are no good baseball games this year
this game is much better in gameplay and graphics than high heat  it doesnt get boring as quick as high heat
also the schedual seems to be from this years not like high heat
i say you should rent both because they are both funfor about  daysallstar baseball  is a good game for people who enjoy pitching and fielding
this game does a good job in both these departments
i struck out over ten guys granted it was just tampa bay but who cares in one game something i cant do with the other games
fielding is also easy to do
unfortunately it is not easy to hit the ball
hitting in this game is either a ground out or a home run
those who like to hit the ball deep may want to avoid this game
also why does this game bother with a home run derby segment
youre lucky you get one outthe premise of this game was nice
i expected more from clive barker
the direction of this story gets lost
i found the plot becoming weaker as the game progressed
the atmosphere was nice
the characters were too stiff
the game is pretty much straight forward
theres one spell which had a physical affect on me
when the screen turns into a purple haze to see and hear beyond normal senses i found that my eyes became strained
i suffered eye damage from this game
becarefuli may be the only one to feel this way but i found that quothitman quot didnt live up to the quality of the original
the first game was unique in style and execution and scored extra points simply for the stealthsubterfuge aspects
both games limit the players freedom significantly but its hard to see how this could be avoided in a game supposedly about stealthunfortunately i felt much more limited in the choices i could make to complete the missions during quothitman quot
in almost every scenario the game forced the player into a narrow variety of paths leaving little freedom to concoct hisher own plan of attack
basically to complete the mission the player has to perform quotguessandcheckquot actions until heshe discovers one of the few quotcorrectquot ways to proceed
this was more true in quothitman quot than in the first gamepersonally i strongly disliked the slightly greater emphasis on story in the sequel
first in the voiceover it was a ridiculously bad decision to give  a sicilian accent
he went from sounding cold and calculating to sounding like a ridiculous parody of quotgoodfellasquot
the character was originally a soulless personalityfree machine of a man with no real history and i didnt like how he was suddenly allocated a whole slew of morals
basically he became a stock quotheroquotcharacterquothitmanquot was a solid game and quothitman quot delivers many of the same perks as its predecessor
unfortunately nearly everything that sets this game apart from the first is a step backwardnot much difference in this game from the original
had some difficulty with the controls especially switching weapons the original was a nightmare hitman  and igi were both nightmares
i kept playing them until i couldnt stand it anymore  the controls were terrible and i still see some problems with it in this game the game is interesting and its definitely fun to blow somebody away but the controls are still a bit awkward im on the fence with this one folksyou might find it a lot of fun and manage to work the controls better than me
eados needs to do some work on this game before its really top notch it has the makings of an excellent game with some deficienciesprimarily contols the demo didnt allow me to save either nor did the first hitman game
like igi eados was supposed to have addressed that issue in the new gamei was a huge fan of the first hitman
despite all the bad press it had been getting i could see no fault with it
the idea of being able to play a professional hitman was beyond anything any other games had to offer at that time
the only fault that i had with the first hitman was the lack of ingame saveshitman  gave us the saves
fine
i was hoping more from the team in terms of s skillsmovement abilities instead of just more weapons
what about mantling  climbing over walls
or what about the ability to distract the guards  say throwing his voice around
or throwing rockcoin
scaling building with more high tech equipmentshitman  is really more of the same which is fine really if it is packaged as an expansion pack and not a sequeli agree with what pcgamer said about the game series
its a couple of steps short of being a great game
i think the fundamental idea behind the game is good
however it needs alot of workfirst off the enemy ai is out to lunch
enemies will flip out on you at times when it feels youre doing everything right prompting the often used wtf phrase for the game and are happygolucky at times when your clearly up to no good
many times you can upset the enemy by doing something wrong or being in the wrong place only to rectify the situation completely by a change of clothes which many times is done in a dead end room or hallway
if the ai was any good enemies should get at least a little suspicious of a foot bald dude oh yeahupc tatoo now wearing a change of clothing coming out of the same placearea the enemies just chased your character agent  into
but no everthing is kosher with them
to make matters worse sometimes enemies catch you in the act of changing into the clothes of a victem you just killed only for them to stand there and go quothmmmis this rightquot
sometimes you can actually get away with even that just by walking out of the area
one level in particular had problems with ai
basically the idea was that you needed to come up with a pizza delivery boy disquise and had to take out a pizza boy for it
i found the best place to do that was in the bathroom while the delivery boy was taking a whizz
nobody else was in the bathroom at the time so no one would immediately see a crime and then report it
killing him was no problem
changing into his clothes was no problem
but the second you go to drag his body to a more secluded location everybody goes nuts
from the map system you can see how all security make an immediate beeline from across the building to the bathroom you are in to take you out
after trying this a couple of times i opted not to drag his body anywhere taking a risk that someone would walk in on it
no one ever did
i find that with both the first and second hitman i have to quotwork aroundquot the ai like that
i hope they totally changed the ai on contractsalthough the map system has been greatly improved and simplified over the first hitman i personally think that having a quotsatellitequot dynamic feedback on every individual on every floor inside and outside is stupid
it really makes the new feature of looking through keyholes in doorsfor enemieslaughable
i hope they have removed this in quotcontractsquotanother thing i dislike is the report card you get at the end of every level
you get ranked on how aggressive you were in the past level the more aggresive the poorer the score and how stealthy you were the higher the better
although i dont mind being ranked on my performance in the game this system allows players to finish levels with horrific scores
in another words they can go through the level shooting at almost everything in sight
personally i think that defeats the purpose of the series
if you want a shooting fest you shouldnt expect it here
i would prefer if it was more like the original i said more like it not just like it because that system was not without faults either
if you cant finish the level like something resembling a quotsilent assassinquot you shouldnt get past it
you should get shot to pieces in a real hurry
unfortunatly this is not the case
you just get a bad report card and move oni like the addition of the tool shed a place you collect all of the various weapons available throughout the game
unfortunatly many of the weapons are unholsterable and have to be carried out in plain sight of everyone else in order to be collected
if you are seen with it causing an alert very likely your score goes down
also such weapons have to be carried out of the level one at a time
so you have to gamble with which weapon you leave a level with hoping ones you have discarded will be available later in the game for you to collect
for example the first level allows you to collect a golf club and a sniper rifle
but you can only take one out
i have yet to see another occurrance of either weapon later in the gamei also liked the use of more appropriate costums in this release
gone are the days of a foot caucasion chineese waiter in china delivering poisened food to unsuspecting targetseventhough i liked the levels of the first hitman better i thought more time was spent on them ie plant leaves moving out of your way as you pass by i also liked some of them here
stpetersberg for example was done pretty welloverall i have to say i liked the original despite the extra lives system better then the second
i hope that contracts is considerably revamped over hitman  this game is not bad but it could of been betterhi everyoneplease excuse my improper typingtypo errorssentences running longetci just boughtfatal frame  and  on ps  game discsi have played similiar games such ashaunting ground and rule of rosei just started the st game in this seriesfatal frameso far evrything is going greatno freezingno glitchesas of yeti will be back with a fullerbetter review when i am finished this gamefrom what i seen writtenpretty much matcheson describing this game
another spookyadventure gamesee yas soonthis game is pretty scary but after reading some of the reviews here i think some people might be over doing it
i heard some guy even say that the game was so intense and scary that there was a feeling of depression afterwards
another guy said that even as he wrote his review he was looking over his shoulder
i dont know what game those guys played or what their on but be assured thats taking it a bit too farthis game like most other survival horrors outside of resident evil and silent hill attempt to make a formula that would combine the best of both of those great franchises
this game doesnt quite have as many jump scares as resident evil instead it also has some kind of meter that brightens up in orange to warn you that there is a ghost nearby and the closer the ghost gets the brighter the orange light
no surprise this is almost a direct copy of silent hilloverall the game isnt quite as scary as most resident evils as few of the jump scares come as sudden and as sharp as they do in resident evil
the game also falls short in my opinion of being as disturbing as silent hill the characters are surprisingly cartoonish looking for a survival horror
the game has no blood and sometimes when your fighting ghosts the background music will break into funky japanese pop or something
ghosts will also say cheesy lines like my eyes my eyes theres no one here
to some all that might actually be pretty disturbing who knowsoverall this is still a refreshing and scary game and its probably my favorite survival horror only behind silent hill
resident evil is great the formula still creates your basic scare but the plotline and characters need a reality checki guess i gonna get a lot of negative votes for this reviewbut i feel like i need to put my thoughts about this game in hereso many people are calling fatal frame games scarypersonally i saw nothing terribly scary only the constantly dark boring environment and a bunch of ghostsi am not going to compare this game to the other horrors since that would mean i am promoting another title which i dont want to doeverybody has different tastes and different views on thingsi am a big survival horror fan so i was determined to get all of games of that type luckily i didnt buy all of ff since unfortunately they all look just the samethe first ten minutes of playing i was excited by everything  the first ghost the athmosphere the animationsbut the more i wandered in the house the faster my excitement wore offalso when i tried to play part  i was disappointed by how familiar it looked with the first parteverything looked just the same still some dark boring house those ghostsonly the main character was differenti never finished any of these gamesi just couldnt play anymore this is how they bored mei guess its just not my type of horror since i dont share the japanese view on horror movies and suchpersonally for me ff lacked action interaction and some differences in surroundings for a changeoverall i rate this game  stars for innovative idea with ghosts and photocameras for the graphics and for the storyi was so excited when i first heard about this game
a femme operative going around blasting away bad guys with her assortment of goodies just has a certain appeal to it
wellive had it for a week now and i cant wait to finish it so i can move on to something else
an occasional flaw here and there is acceptable but this is ridiculous
i cant count the number of times i was facing an enemy got shot tried to duck and cover and the next thing you know im facing the wrong way running directly into the fire
maybe those gadget glasses in the game shouldve been seeing glasses instead
now when i get shot instead of retreating and hiding i just have to stand there and take it like a man im supposed to be a woman in this game
too bad it doesnt have a save anywhere feature then i could live with this problem
hopefully i can finish this in a week and move on to bigger better games
producers of this game call the guys at red faction next time before putting your game out on the street
you almost had it better luck next timei am not a big fan of star wars games
i dont read the books and i have no desire to go beyond the films for anything
i dont really play flightsims of any kind so why i bought this game is beyond mehaving said that i can say that this game is fun fastpaced and wickedly addictive
the gameplay is fast and furious and players need to be aware of the environment and the things going on around them
many things happen at once and it seems as if you are constantly bombarded with laser fire from every directionthe controls are easy to master for both shipsand the gameplay is pretty good no learning curve required
for those die hard ihavetogeteverything gamers there are numerous bonus things to unlock
they include everything from extra starcraft lucasfilmarts bits bonus missions and game previews
to get these items you really have to strive to complete all objectivesi suppose that my only beef with the game is that it is too short
i suppose if you really wanted to you could beat this game is  or  hourstops
not to say that it isnt fun or that the replay value is minimal but i think that the game could have been a little more detailed and strategically plannedmost missions have to be completed in under  min
they include bonus objectives and hidden objectives as welli found that the game started out simply enough but in later missions the difficulty level is off the scale
older patient players will have the most fun with this game
those looking for a quick weekend rentable romp through space combat should just give it a rent or two
i suppose this game would appeal to a larger audience if it had been tweaked a bit more but i find that the average player would get a little lost with the storyline and the characters
diehard fans only on this one folksthis game is okay
the only problem is that theres this anoyning guy
he keeps saying i bet you cant hit that
he keeps saying that in each level
man thats anoyning
spiderman the movie game was much better than this
way better
if there going to have star wars  just dont put that anoyning guy in therebeing a star wars fan can be an expensive way to live your life there are literally thousands of books games comics and toys to choose from and if youre on a limited budget like i am you have to be choosey
there was a time when star wars games were the pinnacle of video games back during the original xwing tie fighter and the first two dark forces games lucas arts produced superb quality adventures with great stories
i think episode i changed all that as the mad rush to cash in on new star wars movies opened the door to mediocrity
instead of producing only a few titles the flood gates were openjedi starfighter is very much a middle of the road kind of game
it is for sure heads and tales above battle for naboo but a far cry from tie fighter
the sequel to the initial starfighter game jedi starfighter incorporates a new story and the delta ship that obiwan flew in attack of the clones
the story is ironically topical with modern day real life the trade federation is in cahoots with a warlord named captain toth to produce bioweapons leading jedi master adi gallia to investigate
the game also brings back the fiorin nym and his sidekicks from the originalgame play is pretty basic fly around and shoot things while accomplishing mission goals
since you can fly several craft you get a host of weapons other than lasers but also swarmer missiles depth charges cruise missiles and little guided attack ships that surround your target and shoot at it
when you fly as adi in the jedi starfighter you gain the addition of force powers that you can use against enemy ships
a neat idea but the execution doesnt really pay off and the abilities are not as good as the other ships weapons
as an added bonus when you progress you can unlock other ships like an xwing a tie fighter and slave where it falls down is that the game is too easy
i could have finished it entirely in my first sitting had i not had other things to do
even on hard it wasnt all that tough plus if i died it was usually because i crashed into something and not because i got shot down
the challenge just wasnt there
it also became frustrating sometimes during missions because of the ingame chatter between pilots that moved the story along could not be overridden so that you could issue orders to wingmen
you would have to wait till they stopped yammering before you could order someone to attack or protect your targetthe graphics are soso by playstation  standards and decidedly subpar for the pc
however it rarely suffers from a low frame rate because of too much action o the screen plus its very colorful
everything is well detailed with well designed models
explosions like so many other games are kind of lifeless
the sound is quite good though slave s weapons and engine noise are nothing like they were in episode ii
also on the upside are a mess of extras that come with it like concept art and commentaries by the programmers always a plus
this game is best bought as a greatest hits and not at full priceif you can find one of these that isnt the same then youre lucky
this one is fine but nothing spectaculari started getting into these monster truck games on the nintendo ds with the exception of playing the pc versions of monster truck madness many years ago and i have always enjoyed them
i mistakenly thought this game here was path of destruction so i was surprised when i loaded up the game and it said it was from  this game here is not like any of the other monster jam titles that i have played before
instead of competing in races freestyle or crush cars you are instead driving behind the wheel of a monster truck in an arena type environment where you can obtain weapons and try to blast away other trucks for the win
it was an interesting first day or so playing this as it is very different to other titles as i said and it reminds me a lot of games like mario karts  player elimination where you try to pop their balloons or other games like wwf racers metal gear solid etcyou can compete in exhibition season or minigames
during season mode you pick your truck you want and take to the arenas in  of the  events depending on what you choose
the first one puts you up against  other trucks and the goal is to eliminate other trucks by either ramming into them until their health meter reaches nothing and they explode or use weapons to your advantage
some levels you can even push trucks into the ocean and what not to eliminate them
there is a total of  races per season and  seasons
so there is a total of  races in each season or  races to complete each of the  seasonal events
quite frankly this becomes extremely boring after a while as there is only  arenas to compete in and each season is just repeating the same thing as the lastthe other two events are cash grab where you have  minutes to collect as many monster jam tokens as you can you only need to get  of the  or so to win
and the other is just make as much damage to things as possible
all  events feel too much like the same exact thing
one you just dont have a timer and need to eliminate the competition the other two are just a race against the clock which is not hard in fact it feels too easyextra trucks can be unlocked each truck in the game has a champion edition model
basically just a paint job change somewhere a flag on the back and apparently are a bit faster then the default however for the most part every truck feels the same during game play and speed is not something you feel like you are experiencingthe weapons and items you can receive are plasma rays machine guns rockets flame throwers and shot guns you can also obtain some nitro boosts which really seem to have little to no effect other than it makes a noise when you use it and the fuel gauge of it runs down quicklysomething that is cool about it is you start off in the arenas of las vegas strip a military base aztec pyramid and what not and you think you are just in a stadium like hole but you can burst through certain parts of the walls and find extra areas where objects and weapons are hidden
it certainly makes for a very different sort of monster truck gamebut as i said who can really be bothered playing the same  levels over and over again until you have completed  events
had the game had some unlockables like infinite weapon power giant monster sized wheels or more events to unlock then this game might have been worth the price you pay luckily mine was free so its been ok to try it out but i am pretty tired of doing the same thing over and over again so it will collect a lot of dust before it ever sees the light of day again if it ever doesone last thing the ai is pretty stupid and wont usually crack down walls and even when they obtain powerups and mj tokens those ones reappear for you
the ai is very clumsy however sometimes very unfair as they land on you and you die you do the same thing and somehow you explode
however this doesnt happen often and for the most part you dominate the computers ai
to get the most out of this game its probably recommended to play it on multiplayer
if you have anyone interested in playing it with yougame play   graphics   sound   commentary   controls   replay value   after at least  or  seasons completedoverall   i rate this game  stars
it is ok but could have been so much better
sure the trucks are up to date but it is a little off of what the real life thing is
the game is about monster trucks
i thought they would have like freestyle and races but no they dont
after i bought it i wish i hadnt
no where near what i thought it would be
the graphics are very poor too
i think the developers were trying to make this into a twisted metal game with all of the firearms on the trucks
unfortuneately if they ever come out with another game i will not buy it
i might rent it to try it but i wouldnt buy it first
i have already made that mistake once
i do not think this game is worth this game has good graphics but compared with other games such as pikmin easily falls shortill keep this short and sweet
test drive is a decent game but put up against gran turismo  or burnout it just doesnt get the job done
what really gets me is they advertise the game has such spectacular wrecks and they are so unrealistic and blah
when you reck into another car even if youre going like  your car will just slam into the other car and bounce off with not a scratch on it
no explosions or shattered glass nothing
its just kind of anti climactic
anyway not a bad game just not as good over all as the previous games i mentionedthe game is fun but the playing gets boring after a while
if you dont get the checkpoint you lose
need for speed is much betterfirst of all the load time is terriblelets get that out of the waythe car physics are badi mean real bad
have you ever hit another car and sent it flying  feet in the airbackward with no damage to your car
the only fun factor is weaving through traffic
the controls are not responsive and attempting a power slide at a hairpin turn almost always results in disaster
this is coming from a racing game fanaticdecent graphics and a great selection of muscle cars fail to save this game from condemnation
dont buy these gamesmidnight clubtest drivetokyo extreme racertry these insteadrallisport challengeworld rally championship iiinfshot pursuit   colin mcrae rally after playing test drive  and  i didnt expect much from this game
however the graphics have changed a lot
thank heavens for that since part  and  had some of the worst graphics in gaming history
the realisme of the game wasent to impressive and the quotstoryquot mode wasent such a huge knockout
the game is overall a good arcade game for thosse of you who find gran turismo frustating and hard
for us others who are looking for realisme well just have to wait for gran turismo  the game is not bad tough but it could have been a lot better
the selection of cars and tracks are very limited when you first start and except the paintjob it aint nothing else you can do with the car except racing it
the tracks are beatifull and the graphics are very to live with
much of the music is awesome and some of it are very headaching
i would recomment to buy the game
its fun and with the two player mode its even more fun
the tracks can be very hard due to the lamo high trafficthe things you love about test drive and hate about test drive run in a dead heat
the action is fast and furious the streets flashing by in a  mph plus blur is a bit of a rush but ultimately there really isnt much to look at no check that theres a lot to look at but there really isnt much to see that we havent already seen in say crazy taxi
frame rates are solid but the landscapes are anemic and flat the cars dont fare much better feeling a tad on the jagged side with muted paint jobs and reflections
the sound is horrible with some effects missing altogether when you pile into a lamp post at break neck speed there is no sound of crumpled steel just an odd silence
which brings us to a another major disappointment car damage like the sounds of destruction there is none not so much as a scratch or paint chip no twisted fenders or one single dented bumper which in the end makes test drive feel unfinished to say the least
on the up side however test drives levels are large and teaming with traffic and peds the sense of speed is very nice and the controls are comfortable and easy to acclimate yourself to and the cop chase mode is a hoot but in the end there are better and much prettier examples of driving games out there simulation project gothem arcade see wreckless and for a little of both well just have to wait and see how midtown madness  fares
you wont love test drive but you wont hate it so if youre looking for something different to drive around on your x box this weekend thats arcade style crash em up fun rent it and save your money for something useful like say a cute poster of a kittythis game is fun and entertaing for a while that is its graphics to start arent the best but they arent the worst
the car models are pretty good
but where in the hell is the car damage xbox should have car damage
the towns you drive through look pretty good and the story behind is not as bad as i thought
but the races are good but after  a while it gets repetitive you drive through the same city  times its just in diferant parts and its not that hard to win
it goes along good you get differant kinds of races like pink slips and linear and circut
the bad thing is in pink slip is if you lose your outa the job no pink slip meens u lose your car you should just lose your car and not your carreerso hear are the pros and consprosnot bad graphics
very enternaing for a while
lots to do
awesome cars for muscle car lovers
good underground story
love the charachters u race with in the undergroundcons
no car damagegets repetitive
pink slipstake the carnot the career
in underground u race through the same city its annoying
not enough corses in cop chase
could be alot betterso to conclusion this game is a deffinant rentin ways this game can be fun but in other ways in can be as frustrating as hellfirst in underground mode you can only race as two cars
drag races get pretty boring after a whilecop chases are great but why do you always have play as the copwhy not be able to run from cops
most of the music is good but some disappointsand finally graphics are great as usual with xboxso rent it before you buy itthis game is entertainingdont get me wrong
however it is not and never can provide the well rounded multiplayer experience of starcraft and warcraft ii because of the superhero aspect of the game
top strategy for this game
spend as little time as possible building economy infrastructure and army and concentrate on upgrading your heros
two upgraded heros will thrash two or three groups of units
for those who enjoy the challenge of balancing production power with speed prepare to lose when i build a minimal war machine and upgrade my heros
economy does play a factor if two players both focus on character development but armies are of secondary import which is a shame for a rtsif you are more interested in rpg type play this game is for you
if resource management and military strategy are more your cup of tea stick with starcraft
while i still usually win i have to admit this game fell short in my estimation
superweapons and hero units are greatbut they should not be available right from the start of a round and should need much more cost and effort to developyou play a couple tutorial scenarios with the orcsthen you get to play the whiny human prince
the prince turns bad and you get to play him again for the undead scenarios
i stopped playing shortly after the undead scenarios started i had enough of the whiny emo princeother then that the hero system was ok could have been so much more made me a little disappointed
turned into just an average game with a poor story and castwhat we have here is a game that works brilliantly as a single game
but once youve played through it all and seen all the yes brilliant cinematics what are you actually left withsome portions of it rely very much on starcraft tech like for instance the undead who are almost identical to starcrafts protoss
calling this the best game from blizzard is a mistake since weve seen it all beforeisnt it time we saw something entirely new for a change
not just a little improvement on something that started ages ago dune 
as a multiplayer game this gets old fast
the slow gameplay gets too boring over its rival star craft made by the same name blizzardthese strategy games need something new a new idea and they need it quick
the game is too mathematical
why couldnt each time for instance have had one really good unit that cost plenty and would take a long time to build
hmm
guess it would be a huge step to take but it would be really exciting
like the super weapons in dune  ah well the graphics and music and all are all good
but ive finished warcraft iii now so guess im heading back to good old diablo  for the momentumi have finished the single player campion and here are some of my impressions the graphics is surely a big improvement over the previous blizzard games
but it is not truly d the d environment doesnt play a role on how the units act the four playable races are not very balanced
some are definitely stronger than the others
the unit generation and interface are very similar to starcraft each races are different but still in the same models of the three races in starcraft there are plenty of units but all pretty standard
i actually think the units in starcraft are much more versatile and exciting the storyline is semicomplete at most
major heros pretty much just dissapear after their particular campionuntil the last level which is a dissapointment see later notes
and the major bad guys didnt even make an appearance yet
guess blizzard is saving all of them for wc or an expansion pack the levels are not well designed
there are not that much varieties
the last level is very dissapointing since its a defense level you just need to last  minutes and a big part of this  minutes are played by computers
you can help but not command although blizzard said that heros play a major part in the strategy in multiplayer mode it probably wont matter since you wont have time to develop your hero and they are pretty weak to start withoverall if you are a rts game fan this game is probably worth it if not you may want to wait later to pick up an inexpensive copy when the price goes downwhile warcraft iii is great both in terms of graphics usuallyand sound there are some major issues that keep it from being one of the great rts gameslike others have mentioned the graphics are generally great
the buildings units and environments all look solid if not incredible
while the cutscenes between episodes are some of the best ive ever seen the cutscenes between individual levels look cartoonish and ultimately take away from the sense of drama
blizzards choice to use the ingame models for those cutscenes backfiredgraphics uneveness aside perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game is its gameplay
whereas the previous craft games were challenging warcraft iii is relatively easy
virtually all levels can be won the same way and theyre usually very repetative although there are a handful that are unique like the level to stop malganis from acquiring  undead followersthe only real saving grace of the game is its story
while not particularly original it is engaging enough to make you want to trudge through the game to find out what happens nextnah dis aint goodol warcraft
too much graphics but too little gameplayits just a warcraft that wants heavier hardware
not worth buyinwhat they should have done with starcraft they did with with wc
bad movei didnt really want to go against the many other reviewers and dislike this game but i have to tell the truth here
let me explain why
this game should not be called warcraft iii because it is not a real time strategy game like wi an wii
from the blizzards own webpage faq quotplayers build a town similar to starcraft and warcraft
however warcraft iii has less emphasis on town building so most races need fewer buildingsquotthe game is more like an rpg or actually like what the old timers used to call an adventure game with much better graphics
you have to do way too much walking around for this to be a strategy game
i like to build up my impregnable cities against the hordes in my strategy gamesyou do not get to pick a species and work through the campaign and build up better and better cities of your own design as in previous editions
rather you get pulled along in a linear fashion by the story line and sometimes you get to build traditional cities
other battles seem more tactical based than strategy
mostly you dont even get to pick your side you work through the plotlines using the species set for you and occassionally you get to switch
now dont get me wrong this is done well but it is not the kind of game i wanted nor expected based on the previous editionsdo an internet search for material on the game and you will find that they almost exclusively talk about the networked version of the game
this means to me that you have to go through your own game scenarios to get to the kind of game many people look for from this title
again nothing wrong with that if it is what you like to do but i do not
related to this is the quotcustomquot game but these are also geared more to networked or swapped scenariosi played dune ii warcraft i and ii and liked them very much but did not like warcraft iii because of the above reasons
if you are not looking for a traditional strategy game like the previous editions you may like this game like the other reviewers
another thing the cinematics were pretty nice but choppy on my computer which may be the computers faultthis game is an inferior version of zeus
although both games share the same basic principles of agriculture housing industry distribution religion and arts zeus had a much lighter touch and thus was more entertaining
emperor does not have as rich a voice acting portfolio as zeus and instead of humorous voice portrayals like the john wayne cavalry and new yorker inspectors in zeus you get very tedious borderline offensive chinese accents in english
additionally pronunciations of chinese words are almost always wrong outside of the main intros
like zeus combat has many bugs which sometimes threaten to frustrate the player into giving up
for example if you launch an invasion an opponent will sometimes see this as a great opportunity to attack you
fair enough but whats stupid is when said invader is the city you are going to attack
and the two armies blithely cross pathes and you get defeated because ha ha you have no military
or worse the tendency for a defeated city to immediately and repeatedly rebel
sometimes they will rebel presumably because you are weak when you are returning from conquering them
just awful and tedious
also the computer controlled cannons are like incredibly virtuosos with pinpoint accuracy but your own cannons seem to be completely ineffectual
also sometimes your invasions will fail for no reason and the program gives you mounds of weapons
i can only imagine that this is because for plot reasons the programmers dont want you to win yet but they dont want the rigged outcome to damage you too badlythe same factors that led me to become obsessed with zeus way back when the fun challenges of figuring out optimal housing and distribution etc are in play here so all is not lost
however the distribution system is so dumb sometimes it boggles the mind
suggestion for future games provide different settings for accepting goods from industry and other warehouses and for distributing to industry and other warehousesas a standalone game emperor would be quite commendable
but as a successor to zeus it is a step backwardsthis game kept me entertained for a while and i even loaded on my laptop because i missed it
unfortuantely my laptop blew up
yes it was   year old alienware laptopthe graphics werent bad and the premise of this game was good
i happen to like this game better than vegas tycoon
while vt had better graphics to me you had slightly a little more to do in casino empireyou were given tasks to complete involoving none other than a casino
various locations and some of the casinos some mostly empty looked very nice
the graphics could of been a little more detailed and the pit bosses needed more realism as well as the slots
security cameras with a security room could add to the realism where you can actually catch cheaters robbers and so fourth looking on the secruity screens from the cameras you placed throughout
it would of been nice also to add a hotel and actually design it make the rooms and design and include the resturants little bit of resturant empire and maximum occupancyhotel tycoon mixed in by making a resort complete with a pool parking lot and designing comp cards
a window would take you to a screen tha shows when the person is coming to the hotel when heshe is leaving and later on how much comp did heshe earn
if heshe brings their family you need things to do for the children or else they wont have a pleasant stay and in turn will not spend much time in the casino
the resturants and keno were awful
i hate pasting resturants on walls its so unreal
it wuld of been nice to build a buffet breakfastlunchdinner style resturant and actually design it and go ini would of also liked to see progressive jackpots the huge signs and perhaps opening and closing so the technicians can service the slots fill them and clean up as well
adding a bar would be a plus
many casinos have bars that you can sit at
the cashiers and waitresses would add to the realismif you are going to release a game that requires me to put the cd in the computer to play it then package the cds in something other then this flimsy paper packaging
i wish someone would use their heads for a change
why is it that i can buy a ten dollar audio cd from the local music store and they wont short change me with this sort of cheap packaging garbage
that audio cd will come with a plastic cd case that will protect it
but i spend five times as much money on your pc game and you dont have the consideration to include decent packaging
i could cut you a lot of slack if i just needed the cd once to install the product but thats not the case here
it might be an idea to start thinking about your customers for a change instead of finding new ways to save a few penniesthat said the game is pretty good the interface is similar to the rainbow six  series with the big exception that the game is geared towards giving the player the real experience which means lethal force is always a last resort
so if youre expecting a game that is like counter strike or rainbow six  where you shot first and ask questions later youre not going to get very far with this titleok ill start on a positive note
the th instalment of swat uses the unreal tournament  engine which provides fantastic graphical and audio effects
the textures and scripted animations for example cockroaches are excellentnow the negative the game itself is lacklustre and offers nothing new over swat  in fact swat  was better in some ai respects  read onthe gameplay is exactly the same as swat  except that the enemy ai has been brightened up a bit
the bad guys will run away if shot at and take cover in dark corners to spring ambushes
good you think except that the swat officer ai is dense
very dense
this is due to the fire only when about to be fired upon logic which spoils the gameevery time the ai sees a suspect with a weapon they will shout drop the weapon  so far so good but if the suspect declines to drop the weapon the officers will not incapacitate the suspect and ensure he drops the weapon instead they will repeat themselves forever until either the suspect turns around with the weapon in hand and takes one of the officers out it happens a lot  the bad guys turn really fast or the officers kill him
bearing in mind the officers dont seem to turn that fast you can lose all your officers with this very random event no matter how careful you areif you try to take the bad guy out before he gets the drop on your fellow officers and you havent issued a drop your weapon statement you will have points deducated from your mission score
this is very frustratingthe danger is compounded further by limits of ai communication
you cannot tell your officers that there is a bad guy round the corner if you use your optiwand
so when you say to the team clear the room they will go in oblivious to the threat
they may bump into each other as well with the end result that all of them are shot dead by a loony with a shotgunin these cases you normally try and take the bad guy out yourself but he spins round too fast and youre dead
you cant save during missions so you have to restart from scratchyou cannot tell your officers to look in a certain direction
they can move to certain points in a room though
guarding certain doors can be hairy sometimes as a resultha and if you run out of ammo easy to do on automatic firing mode you cant take any from your downed colleagues
i just felt like i was playing a game of rockscissorsstone in swat  i never felt that my actions would affect the outcome of a mission it was down to luck what direction the terrorists were facing in a room and whether theyd shoot my men first or theyd  be shotthe first few missions are enjoyable but then everything gets difficult and you will probably end up working vigilante when the ai team are dead
considering that some baddies need multiple shots to die body armour
and you cant pick ammo up on the way you might end up out of ammo and cant complete the mission anywaydont get me started on the snipers they are uselessif youre a lucky sort of person you might enjoy this game
if youre not you will probably end up hating it
i would wait for a patch before buying the game to be honestgraphics is good but the ai and the gameplay needs a little commentst  we always get penalized if we saw a suspect and did not have them disarm without usind deadly force 
and a lot of time you see a suspect with guns and you have to shout several time for him to obey your orders 
but the split second he dont he get you wounded 
very annoyingthe sniper control is a joke 
you have to always go to the sniper and take the shot and leave your team vulnerable to attack when the sniper see s suspect
no illuminated rectical on the scope also
so in dark spot you cannot see the recticaloverall game play is okay
but i wish they would improve on thje game play and aivirtua fighter  is a very good fighting game and one of the best on psbut it could use some more gameplay modesthe graphics and sounds are top notch and the gameplay is fun for awhiletoo but it neeeds some more interesting modeskumite just didnt satisfy meit also needs some ending movies like the dead or alive and tekken gamesstill for  fighting fans should buy itvirtua fighter  is absolutely awesome
the graphics are beautifully stunning the locales varied and interactive down to the footprints and snowflakes in reaction to the characters the music mindboggling and the fighting secondtonone however vf has a fairly steep learning curve for inexperienced players
before the games release i had read repeatedly that pai is one of the easier characters in the game while i am not a complete newcomer to martial arts games i never really felt as if i was able to execute a good number of movescombos for pai  it almost felt more like i was simply mashing buttons virtua fighter  does include a training mode and i did work through some of the tutorials
however truly learning this game and performing well requires a huge investment of time  something i do not have at my disposal  as well as a strong knowledge of each characters defensive repertoire  which is somewhat of a significant step away from other fighting games such as the doa and tekken seriesfirst off let me say that i am an avid tekken tag player
it is probably my fav game of all time and i have spent much time mastering it
with that said on to vf
everything about this game is is pretty good
the graphics are good although i think they could be a little better and the sound is good as well
the real winner here is the many technical moves and combos you can pull off with the characters
the shaolin monk and the drunk are the coolest characters to ever enter the fighting genre with the exception of lei from tekken the main problem i had with the game and the reason i only gave it  stars
actually more like   is the button configcombo system
this is a real pain in the fact that you have to hit an actual button to guard instead of just holding back is more of a pain than you can possibly imagine
and the combo system is very very very complicated and annoyingso if you can get past the annoying and complicated button config
then you got a fun game to play
its a little to annoying for me but im gonna keep playing it for a while and see if i can pick up on the config
a little bettergood lucki liked this game when i was  and i was really good at it but i guse i forgot how to playim still waiting for someone to come out with a fighting game that will take the gameplay to the next level
this is no better and no worse then doa tt and the others
just different charactersall you ahve to do is to beat all the players ands then what
this game is great for the arcade but not for a home system the graphics are great the move and fighting style originalsubject to debateits really not so bad however i dont like people playing games in my house on my console see so play all alone i need a game like mgs or dmc splinter cell you name it i like iteven rpgs  horror survival game that can work so i give this game three stars after a  weeks you forget this game it weill collect dust unless you are a child who like doing the same thing over and over beating the same people dont buy this play it the arcade or even practise at home to kick ass in the arcadelaterzzz folks  gamersthe game is average in just about all aspects graphics gameplay and storyline
the game doesnt provide anything over the standard mariotypesmashingcratesandcollectingfruit game but is still fun nonetheless and provides a good amount of play time
many of the levels are too challenging for younger players
there are some levels where the player dies by missing a jump falling into water and drowning
i thought the image of the character floating face down in the water wasnt appropriate for younger kids
for the most part though it will provide entertainment for all agesthis is the  yu gi oh game to buy
the storline is kinda hard to follow at first but you catch on quickly
the way you get more cards in your chest is pretty cool you have to defeat other opponents
if you have a yu gi oh card you can put in the number and if you have enough star chips you can put in into your deck
i recommend getting this yu gi oh game rather than any other onegun valkyrie for the xbox system was one of the games touted to show the processing power of microsofts very first video game console
game developer smilebit also developed another xbox game jet set radio future and publisher sega succeeded in creating a beautiful game
gun valkyrie fully harnesses the xboxs ability to create great graphics especially smoke and particle effects
what brings this action game down was the inclusion of one of the most unforgiving control schemes of any video game ive ever triedthe game is set in an alternate timeline early s where humanity has found a way to harness the power from the passing halleys comet and thus discovering brandnew scientific applications for this new technology
gun valkyrie uses the steampunk theme of the scifi genre and does it well
the art design of the game mixes beautifully victorianera architecture with futuristic weaponry and gear
planets are soon colonized and its in the space colonies that the story takes place
gun valkyrie is pretty much an action shooter where the player gets a chance to choose between a female or male fighter and shoot down an inordinate amount of aliens which have a passing resemblance to the arachnids in the film starship troopers
again the design of the alien planet and its inhabitants are well rendered and makes this a great looking game but its the control scheme which for some reason makes uncomfortable use of the two analog sticks for movement by way of clicking themgun valkyrie wouldve been one of the great games
not just in terms of look and design
it definitely wins high marks for graphics and production design
but its the unforgiving controls which turns a difficult game into one thats beyond frustrating that it cancels out any fun the game may provide a playerthe controls are a little difficult it is hard for me to do certain dashes in the game where you have to press a series of buttons all at once
however it has great graphics and you can play either a male or a female
basically it is just a firstperson shooter not as advanced as halo but much simpler
i dont understand the difference between certain guns as i did in halo
this is another game which you should try before you buypros great graphics  people to play funcons not more than just  people to play not enough characters annoying especially when jumping from platform to platform and falling levels take way to long bores me out after a whileremember try before you buyi have only played this game once and let me tell you that some baseball games on gbc are better than this oneno races nor trick contests
spoiled by ssx tricky i supposeokay so graphically this blows thpsx out of the water
but you need more than thatthe controls are so tight and a little too realistic
remember in x when you did your first  and you got so excited
thats how you feel the first time you land your s successfully hereif youre used to x you have to expect a whole new game
if you missed x then youll blow away everyone who didntthis is an addictive game that offers soooo much depth
i bought baseball mogul too  this blows it out of the waternow for the downside it is painfully apparent that this game was devoloped by baseball fanatics who didnt know a lot about mainstream programming
the first thing that surprized me was that it didnt take advantage of the windows autorun feature strike   fair enough i was still able to install it
then i tried to figure out how to upload all of the classic players  teams into the game  since the game doesnt come with an instruction booklet i looked for a help function but there was no integrated help feature strike   i finally accessed the help section after i closed season ticket first from the programs menu  it said you can upload  extract files from the baseball archive
where
where is the archive
on the disk no
there wasnt a url
so i tried the website  it had no help section for season ticket strike   ps
i did find the database  you can download it at websitethis game has all the potential to be a great game but getting help on this game  trying to figure out its little kinks can cause major hair lossi will make this fairly short
i liked the first unreal alot
it was revolutionary for its time with graphics not seen before if you had the best hardware to turn everything up
unreal had great lighting creepy atmosphere great view distance and a multilayer sky that moved very nicely
many cool games have come out since with some great ones like return to castle wolfenstein
now we have unreal  and with the improvements in graphics these days along with much faster pcs and video cards i was hoping for u to have the character of the first game
i just didnt see the same character in u
the graphics are good but compared to recent games like rtcw or even the latest unreal tournament i didnt like how generic the game looked
like i said u was quite a step forward when it came out
u just seems plain in comparison
gameplay is pretty good but there are many other fps games i enjoyed more
so u was ok but i was a little disappointedi remember reading reviews about how this game was gonna save gaming
whatever
great graphics
yes
solid gameplay and control
yes
good story
yes
multiplay and depth
nothe game was too short and no multiplayer although they have released it free from what i hear on the internet and are selling a newer version of this game with multiplay included but it is too late for mei loved the graphics and enjoyed the characters and the enemies were all very cool but this game is not even close to saving gaming
that will be the job of halflife  and doom for the price this game is selling at now it would be a worthy buyi payed full price expecting more and when i found out there was no multiplay i knew i wasted my money
oh well
life goes onthis game is no doom  or halflife but the graphics are great and the weapons and gameplay are decent
buy used and have funi really enjoyed the fast intense action of the original unreal but even more so unreal tournament
now we have unreal ii the awakening finally
the graphics are satisfactory and even pretty cool but thats a given
i enjoy adventure games as well as d shooters and i liked the original doom series because it at least followed some story that made sense
so does this game which involves a few different types of quests and situationsthere is minimal challenge except for a few parts which are incredibly hard unless you turn the difficulty to the easiest ratinghowever it is a sore dissapointment for fans of fast action and highpaced d shooter games
also if you are looking for anything particularly new or interesting here you wont find much with the exception of turrets and force fields that you can use to defend an emplacement from attacks
you are also given the ability to command a half dozen troops in a couple scenarios which is more fun than the rest of the game imostory seems pretty well thoughtout for a d shooter storyline but just doesnt hold my interest
i think the entire story is really a lame and depressing tale of a gullible space marinethere is no fast paced action
you cant even run very fast and the cpus ai is strange
at some points you will get jumped upon facefirst even before you can respondive heard a lot about this game and the screenshots looked great so i grabbed it as soon as it came outafter watching a cool introduction sequence when i started the actual game three things suprised mea unreal  ran as slow as molassesb when the games view zoomed in on a person the textures on his body were all warped and distortedc after playing for a few seconds i got a general protection fault erroreventually i found out that the gpf error was because i enabled the quoteaxquot sound feature despite the fact that i have a soundblaster audigy card that eax should work with so i disabled that
i upgraded all of my drivers and directx so now the textures looked normal
but the game still ran as slow as molassesunfortunately lowering the details seriously blurs the textures but youve gotta go what you gotta do right
well after lowering some details i got the game running decently but that all changed when i got into a firefight
the game turned into a slideshow and i would often end up losing almost all of my armor because i couldnt aim my weapons properly
i got up to a mission where the player walks around in snowy conditions outside of a base and while the effect was very nice looking it also made the game virtually unplayable
at this point i gave up on unreal  because all the enemy had to do was run towards me and the game would slow to even less than a crawl making my character completely helpless
whats most annoying is that my pc is brand new and topoftheline well it was three months ago so performance like this is inexcusable even with all the details turned downlast but not least a level editor comes with unreal  where you can create your own levels but when i loaded it up i got another general protection fault
from what i have read in the games official forums the editor is an early version and many of the options are quotnot implemented yetquot anywayapparently there is something wrong with the game itself and many other people that i have talked with seem to have the same problems that i do
sure some people can run this game smoothly and with no problems but from what i have seen the majority have had serious technical issues with unreal overall im giving this game three stars because i know that this game has potential to be a winner it has great graphics sound and a feasible storyline
however it was released a bit too early and is loaded with performance bugs and issuesif you want to purchase this game i recommend that you wait until the games developers release a patch for the game that resolves its current problems
in the meantime pick up a copy of unreal tournament  it has graphics that are just as good as unreal  and it runs better tooafter playing the game all the way through all puzzles are solved all mysteries are revealed all ai opponents strategies are cracked and countered
pretty game but zero replay value
buy unreal tournament  instead when patched up to the most current patch level its a blast of a game with infinite replayabilityit is pretty to look at but falls flat when compared to the first game in the seriesi am running a p system with megs ram radeon  pro etc i find the game enjoyable to play and the graphics are very good
i get great fps until there are many npcs with alot of weapons discharges going on then it goes downhill from there
the same performance hit happens with fsaa turned off
i think the game has memory leaks and that can be fixed with patches i believe
atari was under pressure to release the game and may have cut a few cornersive been a big fan of the unreal games since i first started playing unreal in   i absolutely loved it and im still playing the singleplayer campaign i must have played through it  times or more
i was very pleased to see that return to na pali did a great job of extending the unreal adventure without ruining it
unreal tournament was a blast to play as well even though it didnt include a singleplayer campaign
so with all this unreal software that made me so happy you can imagine how i felt when i heard that unreal ii was in the works
but as they all say quotdont believe the hypequotunreal ii was hyped up allright and a prominent pc games magazine said quotits gonna change computer gaming as we know itquot  how ironic considering that unreal ii has very little new to offer except for the graphics which almost a year later may still be the best out there
its a good game but it has very little to thrill me
more than anything else i must take legend to task for taking so much out of the game that should have been left in
unreal had great monsters as well as great levels to battle them on
legend for some strange reason only left the skaarj in and even the skaarj in unreal ii arentt as great as the original skaarjunreal ii however does get a few other things right
some of the new weapons are good
the shotgun is very effective and the grenade launcher which can fire different kinds of grenades is cool
perhaps the best new weapon is the flame thrower
it spouts a very effective and attractive flame and i must wonder why the older unreal games didnt include a flame throwerafter playing unreal ii i soon realized that a real sequel to the first game is in order
bring back all the elements that made unreal so great but with state of the art graphics and sound
sure add new gameplay characteristics but dont throw the baby out with the bath water
that is dont call a game quotunrealquot while making it unreal to its fantastic pedegree
epic games do you hear mealthough i salute the late legend entertainment for offering a departure title in the unreal franchise i must admit i am disappointed by the offering
unreal had a successful enjoyable formula
if that formula could have somehow been infused with the beautiful graphicsmusic and fun combat system featured in unreal  legend would have had a runaway hitunfortunately that is not the case
unreal  felt too much like its own unique deal which i suppose would have been fine had the game not been promising a sequel to unreal
this is what happens when you have an ambitious developer handle a popular franchise with a publisher imposed deadline under the burden of thousands of fans grand expectationsi bought unreal  and i was glad i did but im anxiously awaiting unreal  to give me some satisfaction the unreal wayi loved the orginal unreal and its mission pack return to napali
they are one of the most beautifull games i ever played
unreal  is a good game but not good enough for an unreal sequel
the orginal unreal deserves more than this
the gameplay is quite linear a little short with no multiplayer
ofcouse it has a good story while the previous game did not but the gameplay here is not that great
the weapons are large and look strange with not so great effects
its the future futuristic weapons should be smaller with better effects
powered by the latest version of the unreal engine the graphics are great with beautifull skies but there are no mirrors or cool reflective surfaces
fire effects and the flame thrower are really well done
unreal had beautifull and large levels here the levels are very small not that well desinged
you will be watching the loading screen frequently
unreal  is just an average shooterthis game looks amazing the weapons the environments everything in this game looks hands down better then anything else ive seen to date but after you look past that you see that there isnt much else to it
the levels where you command marines are the only levels that are memorable in my opinion and after you spend  hours or so playing you realize that its over and thats never a good sign when a game doesnt include any multiplayer or vs the cpu modes
the story isnt enthralling and between each mission you have to waste time running around your ship prompting your shipmates for their predetermined dialog cut scenes should have been used here considering it takes about  seconds or so to load up your ship and then another minute or  to get thru with your shipmates scripted dialog and then another  seconds to load up the next mission unnecessary
the weapons arent particularly good or bad with the exception of the pathetic assault rifle which of course is your main weapon
i hate not to recommend this game but i cant its simply too short with very little replayability and no multiplayer if utk and this were combined into one game id give it  stars but with the absence of multiplayer support and only  hours of gameplay i cant recommend it no matter how pretty it isthere is no doubt that unreal ii the awakening is the current best looking game of all time
it delivers staggering graphics that while you need a power house of a machine to utilize sets a new standard by which other games of this genre will be judged
at least until doom iii and thats just a retelling of the original dooms story is released later this year
or halo for the pc also due out this year from gearbox
or deus ex take your pickunreal ii builds on the existing mythology established in the first unreal and in return to napali it even mentions the tournaments and liandri corporation
not to mention the three flavors of skaarj reptile warriors big bigger and oh my god
that aside it is a totally new game that capitalizes on the unreal name
however i doubt very much unreal ii will have the same effect its predecessors will it is graphically pretty but isnt that good of a game even though it makes an effort to build a story better than the first ones did even though again they are basically the same
as terran colonial authority marshall john dalton a former marine who had been disgraced you ply the space lanes of the outer rim bringing law to the lawless in your ship the atlantis yawn
 with your crewmatesfirst up is the luscious aida whose pixelated polygons put lara croft to shame shes basically second in command and gives you all your mission breifings
aida also complains to you a lot
next up is isaak another washout and drunk he explains all your weapons and makes modifications to them
finally is the ships pilot neban who is kind of like a little vorlon plus hes the only instantly likeable member of the crew and his turns of phrase are amusing
there is some interplay and development between all the characters but its pretty minor
unfortunately it doesnt matter whether you interact with these people or not if you skip a briefing from isaak its not like you go on a mission without weapons or are unable to figure out what these weapons dothe missions revolve around obtaining seven pieces of this ancient artifact while this isnt exactly a new story idea in science fiction or fantasy it is also not one that is too difficult to make interesting
in unreal ii however they dont even try because while it is a driving goal to obtain the next piece it really could have been anything a computer disk a bag of money or whatever
it ultimately doesnt amount to very much when it is finally revealed what it does
it is of course wanted by everyone in the galaxyplus you can wander around the atlantis between missions
this is great but serves no purpose
you can open a few hatches and crawl around in some tunnels but you cant do anything to or with anything
you cant press buttons to make things happen all you can do is look a little like being in a louvre
in fact a lot of the game is like this  except for the things youre allowed to kill environmental interaction is nonexistentthe story aside the programmers also dropped some things that were in the original that could have been useful in unreal ii there are no portable light sources available for you to use no flares or flashlights
i also suspect that even the story was tacked on and the game itself is just a showcase for legends and digital extremes new graphics engine
as well there are numerous other games coming out that use the unreal ii engine such as deus ex ii it will be interesting if they can get more out of it than the originators did
the music is a mixed bag but no where near the same quality as unreal or unreal tournament
sound effects are pretty good but nothing to write home aboutmission maps are quite large expansive out door vistas on alien planets that eventually lead indoors in seamless transitions
texture detail is superb and razor crisp most things like signs and all but the smallest of computer displays are readable
the engine is capable of so much detail from waving grass and trees to flowing water curves curves and more curves and creatures such as fish birds and land critters that it gives everything a wonderful and very realistic organic look to it
it is often as much as fun to just explore the worlds youre on as it is to start shooting and killing bad guys
character models be they humans skaarj mechanized marines etc
are all firstrate with highly detailed facial features and expressionsbut the game play just isnt there i finished the game in less than six hours total time
i got it on a thursday and finished it that night
i felt let down there wasnt enough to do beyond accomplishing goals the environment doesnt interact well you cant even blow up trees though you can kill all the fauna you come across
here is a game that could have benefitted from red factions geomod code it could have made things more interesting
it was also reported that the unreal editor that shipped with the game was easier to use than previous versions
i loaded it up and wondered that if by easier they meant harder and more complexso basically what we have is a spectacular looking game that delivers awesome visual splendor but only mediocre game play
this was also one of the three games that i was really looking forward to in  the others being halo and the sequel to the greatest game of all time homeworld  so far im zero for three
unreal isnt a bad game its an okay game
its that really good looking girl you knew in highschool the one you found out was really shallow once you got to know herthe original unreal was a phenomenal game  one of the best ever created
i can understand that following in those footsteps could only be hard
by at least atari could had triedthis is not a game that has anything to do with the original title
i could not get involved couldnt care less about the characters or the story
it took me all of two afternoons to finish it off and was a great disappointment since i was a great fun of the first and couldnt wait to get my hands on the sequel  which it is notthe graphics are good but nothing close to groundbreaking
the surfaces are nice the shadows nonexistent and the muzzleflashes totally annoyingif you have an older system that cannot handle the latest fps releases i would advise far cry or red faction i instead
even graphically older the original unreal would be a much wiser choicein  tim sweeney changed the face of fps gaming forever
unreal was released and became a major gaming hit that revolutionized fps along with practically reinventing the game engine the unreal engine is a very important core gaming tool behind many modern fps today
that concept was a reality thanks to tim sweeney spending  years in his garage
at the time this was the reason to buy a graphics cards like a voodoo or a tnt and run it on your windows  systemunreal was a deep game lots of levels lots of running around lots of shooting mindless blasting pressing levers going through levels that have some maze qualities running across the same bad guys with some variations the textures ai and level design surprisingly still able to deliver on a satisfactory game play today
unreal beats a lot of fps games that have since been released
it is an alltime great for those of us gamers out there who remember the end of the s and remember what it was like to play fps games that people would line up around the block to buyunreal was not followed up directly by unreal  in fact unreal become a multiplayer called unreal tournament that was released in  the next update was unreal tournament unreal  was released in  it pretty much tanked for a couple of reasons
the first was that it was not a sequel to the original unreal that ended in a cliff hanger
unreal  is a new story about a marine that travels from planet to planet picking up alien artefacts while blasting aliens
unreal  has some great looking environments
there is a game here and if you have played the best fps has to offer then unreal  is worth checking out
however it is nothing like unreal and that is a major drawback
also it is  times slower than the original unreal as your marine walks at a snails pace about in a clunky suit
the missions are very leisurely linear and extremely easy to beat
the game isnt a challenge but at the same time the environments are very well rendered but the story isnt very good
i found myself finishing it though because there are only so many fps games out thereso if you are looking for an fps you havent played then i would suggest replaying the original unreal and then if you feel you must then go for this it is usually available in unreal box sets
all in all this game was a cut below par but did look good at times and there is a nice array of weapons to use but the spirit of unreal is departed and what is left is something that doesnt deserve the name it hasprosenvironmentsrange of gunsconsit is not unrealit is very slowstory is not goodunreal  is definitely a downgrade from the original unrealbesides the great scenery great graphics and game engine there isnt much to this game
the storyline lacks depth and it fails to immerse the player
if you see this title in the bargain bin then maybe you should pick it up
otherwise i wouldnt pay the money for it
theres a lot of other great single player fps titles out there
unreal  i feel that is not worth to be the successor of the unreal franchiseafter all the multiplayer versions that came out unreal universe is exspanded again in a new single player adventure
this time with voice acting and facial posing
neatstill the game even on it hardest settig was way to easy for me in the first run through
and was way too short for my taist
then again it was still longthe weapons where balanced fairly well lots of nice features
had a fairly intresting story and an intresting slantstill it dissapointed me
fun but nothing really newon the surface this uninspired first person shooter has everything that makes up a great game futuristic save the universe plot with a hardboiled iconoclastic exmarine trying against monumental odds to set things right decent array of weapons relatively large mix of foes intuitive user interface pretty good but at times irrelevant scenerybut the whole thing just never really comes together
i think the biggest problem with unreal  is that everything in the game has been done before  and done before by better and more creative programmers eg
halo jedi outcast doom
given the above i am somewhat suprised by the high marks from some of the other reviewers  maybe theyve never played an fps beforenetnet tired rework of fps format with no significant differentiator from other fpss already on the market suprisingly high system requirements atari recommended system requirements mb ram mb video ram pentium  ghz or higher worth borrowingrenting but not worth buying due to limited replay valueunreal  isnt much different from its predecessor in most ways
in fact theres really only three good changes the adaptation of halflife style weapons selection the addition of a story with characters and dialogue and the new engine
on the other hand there are several negative changes most notably the very short duration of the game the lack of multiplayer and a far more restrictive style of playas far as plotdriven games go unreal  isnt going to win any awards
the story is something a  year old scifi buff could pull out of their pants and theres really no surprises to speak of
simply put this isnt much of an rpg even though theres a dialogue tree
in an attempt to make the game flow with the story the developers added mission objectives to be accomplished
this does work but it constrains the player so much that you really dont do any exploration
the result is the exact opposite of the original unreal in which your sole objective is to get to the exit killing everything in between and i honestly cant say which was betterthere is definitely less customization in this game
most importantly theres no multiplayer it seems atari expects you to get unreal tournament  if you want that
all right fine but i would really have liked to put some of those new weapons to work on my friends
at the least they could have put in some sort of bot deathmatch to vent frustration and afford some replay value
as for the game itself youre marshal john dalton
if you dont like that too bad hes all the player there is
the mission plot is linear and you probably wont play it more than once
there are cutscenes between missions where you go back to your ship and chat with the crew
thats fine but there should be a way to skip them
instead of collecting arms and ammo as you go your health shields weapons and ammo are all reset every level
i guess this might help out folks that cant aim or dodge but i found it generally irritatingthat said there are a lot of mission objectives that are fun to do
some allow you to command marines or place turrets to mow down enemies
sadly theres not much use for the sniper rifle save for one objective on the secondlast level
the locations you visit are varied interesting and exquisitely detailed
you also see many different types of enemies and friends as well not just a bunch of skaarj as in unrealthe highlight of the game has got to be the graphics it really looks great and fire effects in particular are amazingly well done
the weapons you get often have spectacular destructive capabilities but beware enemies will have these too and are a pleasure to put to work
theres really no particular advantage in picking one weapon over another except for running out of ammo but the look and feel of the different guns makes it worth switching aroundthe ai as before is superb
enemies wont just charge at you or at least not unless they think theyre going to win
theyll dodge your rockets and take cover popping out to tap you on the melon before ducking back down
the handful of boss characters you encounter also have unique behavior which is sometimes quite irritating
each of the varied races behaves in a different manner some of which might be familiar to unreal players
however despite the fact that i made it all the way through the first unreal the new bulletdeflecting skaarj did mop the floor with me a few timesas far as game physics go you do move a bit slow must be all that armor but youre also tougher than you were in the old unreal
you can pick up shield and health charges recharge at stations or scavenge shields off dead enemies
the shields dont work like they do in games like dark forces in that you still take health damage when you get shot
in fact it wont be uncommon for you to die with a lot of shields left so health is still the key factor
theres some interaction with the environment but its largely good old switchpushing
some puzzles are scattered throughout the play but nothing particularly stupefyingin all unreal  is a shorter version of unreal with updated graphics and a better but not by much story
if it hits the bargain bin id definitely recommend it just for the looks
otherwise this ones only for folks that just cant get enough of unrealthis tetris has a story mode as well as arcade  or vs  player no vs ai
the gameplay is based on tetris square guys needing a new home on diff planet
you get a little quare mascot
the presentation has good ideass the explosions are great  lightning when you do a goal such as tetris or cascade etc but the colors are very muddy  hard to differentiategameplay tylestetris  original stylesquare  couldnt get into this i didnt have instructions  still couldnt figure it outcascade  try to make back to back tetrisesclear lines by having extra peices from previous tetrisline clear fall down to make more tetrieslines cleared not bad for those who are great at tetris  need more challengehot lines  about  horizontal neon lines at diff spots on the grid only clearing linestetrises on those lines count
lame unimaginative way to change up tetrissticky  starts with grey blocks with holes that you have to clear to the bottom which is the goal more to clear as level increases as well as speed but the peices themselves are in different colors so when they fall  dont fall perfect they will slide apart  down
adds a great additional strategy though you can still play like the old way as if they dont split
the only con to this game is that it speeds up the falling peices very quicky before building up the grey blocks at the start
great fun  hope to see it redone in future wii or next gen nintendo games with also a vs mode ai  multiplayerfusion  has the sticky style of playing but also adds similar to bomb bliss style of tetris as well
not only do you have grey blocks  split colored peices of sticky but you also have single yellow blocks that fall down
goal is to have all the yellow blocks fall to the bottom to explode  they have to be a full line to do so
when you clear a line though those yellow blocks dont ever disapear until bottom in full line so each line clear will make more holes  adds to the quick thinking  changing of playing field
also a great variation of tetris  hope it gets redone  add vs mode ai  multiplayerthe contraversydislikes of this game is the muddy color presentation i do like the world themes  art style  most importantly the easy spin which allows you to spin  spin  spin for a long time deciding
this can be turned off as well as the bouncing of the peices when they land which i found annoyingdistracting
this has the hold  peice ability as well as ghost to know where the peice will fit if you let if fall down at the spot youre in that second as it fallsarcade mode does have a vs mode but only with a friend not vs aii still love the old gameboy version as well which had a varation like sticky that starts with grey blocks with holes but no peices that split
i call it damage control as in having holes when playing  knowing you have to fix that asap
i wish they would bring that mode back too as they made the blocks as the start high up at high levels without increasing the speed as muchthere are other reviews of this old game on several game sites like gamespot etc but there are only a couple of videos on youtube showing gameplaythe original crazy taxi was such a fun game that it stole hours away from my otherwise uninteresting life
this third installment an exclusive for the xbox continues the same gameplay of picking up funky passengers racing against time and dropping them off in one piece hopefullyunfortunately the graphics is also little improved a shame considering the xbox is capable of doing many times more than what the game offers
sound is also at best mediocre
controls are easy to learn and master and the fun factor can be high for some audience  and definitely more fun than the copycat simpsons road rageyou may want to rent this title before buying it
i enjoyed the demo from official xbox magazine enough to rent it from blockbuster but im definitely not buying it for my permanent librarythis game will be very funexcepty for a few problems which have taken place in all the other crazy taxi gameswhile going at top speed it is almost immposible to pick up a pedestrian
vice versa when you are dropping them offsecond the game in all of the rest of them had been extremely easy to beat as well
my gues about hourbesides that this game is very funcrazy taxi  might have seemed like an awesome whateveryouwant driving game if only gta and gta vice city had not come along
against vice city crazy taxi  seems like a small minigamecrazy taxi  does have nice graphics as you drive through  cities that approximate san francisco las vegas and new york city
each city has its own personality and you get to choose from a handful of taxis and drivers for each cityin essence you grab a fare and have to take the fare to their destination
you rack up cash for doing so and the more fares in a row you can do the better
there are also an assortment of minigames like jump through the flaming hoops and pop the balloonsit this had come out say  years ago the drivingwhereeveryouwant would have been amazing
the fact that you could just cruise the streets plowing over sidewalks taking shortcuts and looking at the nice graphics would have been great
unfortunately for ct something else came along  grand theft auto
grand theft auto has taxi missions with the same earnings and time limits
but in gta that is but one tiny part of a huge gameplay system
and when you dont feel like doing timed missions you have the luxury of driving anywhere you want in any car you want and exploring the world you haveyou can say that gtagtavc is for the ps and crazy taxi  is for the xbox
but what does that mean
that because they were programming for the xbox crazy taxi s developers could only put out th of the game
at least if they were going to solely concentrate on taxilike things they could have put in more cities or more taxis or more missions or something
but the game comes across as an arcade port which it was that didnt have a lot of energy behind it unfortunately
what they put out as a complete game is something the grand theft guys kicked out as a fun little side toy
i am a huge huge fan of arcade games and also a huge fan of driving games so i really had high hopes for this
but unfortunately the game turned mindlessly repetitive too quicklyim disappointed that the ps has the vice citygta shining as their driving in a city showoff and that the xbox can only hold this up as a comparison
its time for the xbox developers to take the brilliance behind halo and show us that they can have a vice city like incredible experience on their platformsummary fun for a short while but not something that grabs you for weeks or monthsafter reading the previews and comments of other amazon customers this sounded like a game i couldnt live without
i bought it without trying it first and it was the first time that i have regretted a game purchase on my xbox system
the game has okay graphics but the vehicle physics are somewhat lame even for an arcade game the gameplay is redundant and the only  standard controller schematics that they allow are both poor
i played the game through all of the x tests which prime you for the actual game and even after getting used to the controls  handling of the car i didnt have much fun with it
in fact i would go so far as to say that the tests are much more fun than the actual game itself
the games concept is a good one but the gamplay just falls short imho
i only gave it a  rating because its not a terrible game and some people may actually find it to be a fun game
but my copy is going on ebayhouse of the dead  lets you shoot your way through zombies
you play as a woman who is looking for her father and a guy follows you too that doesnt even do anything to help you the game is alright but this game has quite a handful of pros and conspros  great graphics and creepy environments
cool and detailed zombies and weird bosses and creatures the game gives you enough credits to actually make it a bit easier to play so that if you die you can easily come back storyline is pretty good not the best though cool cutscenes
you can unlock hotd  and play that on the game pretty cool featurecons  aiming the gun can be quite difficult especially when you have a million zombies on your a
you only have one weapon the whole game which is the shotgun
the guy that follows you doesnt even help you or anything yet he is in every cutscene and seems like he is not even with you
you have to help him from getting killed yet he doesnt do nothing for you i mean what the 
the game is very short you can beat it in one night if you are quite good at those type games
the last boss of the game is impossible to beat and it took me over literally  tries to beat it
it is hard i repeat it is hard
basically it is a diffcult game a short one but the difficultness makes up for it even though it has some flaws and cons i still recommend it
it is quite cheap now anyway so if you like these shoot em up games i recommend you get house of the dead iiithe game is a real pain in the trigger finger if you dont have auto fire and auto reload
theres a lot of parts where even that barely helps
other than that the graphics are old school in hod and prehistoric in hod you must beat hod first to unlock hod
this game is on my  or  inch tube tvs because the  plasma i have wont work with the mad catz light gun i purchased with this game
i do have the wii version of this game and its the same game down to a t  needless to say it handed me my head on a tray
my hand and arm cramps up after a few rounds and then im deadshould be called house of monotony
i bought this game in the hopes of mindlessly shooting zombies
maybe i thought it would be like max payne or medal of honor frontline
i was wrong
this game forces you to approach various situations
you cant avoid them or approach from other angles
in addition you cannot save after each chapter so you are forced to start all over
a player can only take so much of skipping the movie and being told where to shoot the security guard and the thing in the cage
very dull and frustrating
skip this onesave for konamis original arcade beatemup the lineage of games based on the simpsons has been less than stellar
the last two games to feature matt groenings maladjusted family unit the simpsons wrestling and the simpsons road rage threw together the colorful characters of springfield with gameplay that was remarkably similar to that of certain other popular game franchises
now that pro wrestling and a crazy taxi clone have both been checked off the list for simpsons game concepts ea and the code monkeys have sought to mimic the tony hawks pro skater formula to produce the simpsons skateboarding
the concept isnt exactly inspired to begin with but the game itself is executed poorly enough that neither fans of the cartoon nor fans of action sports games will want to have anything to do with it
as unenjoyable as the gameplay is the single biggest offender in the simpsons skateboarding is its graphical presentation
when you begin play youll initially have access to only one level as well as homer marge lisa and bart as playable characters though fulfilling objectives in the first level will unlock the subsequent level and finishing the game will net you other playable characters like nelson muntz krusty the klown otto the bus driver and others
the levels youll go through are all broad approximations of springfield locations designed as skate parks
youll start off in the area surrounding springfield elementary and move on to downtown springfield also visiting itchy and scratchy land the nuclear power plant and the springfield gorge
in each of the  levels in the simpsons skateboarding youll have to complete a set of goals before you can move on and the goals remain largely identical from level to level
youll start off with six quick lesson objectives in skillz school where the game essentially forces you to master a few key maneuvers before you can move on
once youve completed skillz school youll move on to the regular level objectives none of which should surprise action sports aficionados
in each level theres basic item collection like grabbing three donuts three highscore score objectives a destruction objective like knocking the head off the statue of jebediah springfield and a lettercollection objective which changes from level to level and includes spelling skinner or squishee or the like
finally each level also has a competition component where you have to earn a certain point score on a specific area on the map before the time runs out
there are also two perfunctory multiplayer games which include a basic scorebased competition and a game of horse
theres nothing in the simpsons skateboarding we havent seen in a dozen other action sports games
the game will occasionally get rather devious with the item placement on some of the collection goals but that edge is dulled by the big arrow at the top of the screen that directs you to your next objective
this simple linear format might be more forgivable if the gameplay was solid but such is not the case
the gameplay is just a strippeddown tony hawk with a handful of basic kickflips grinds aerial grabs inverts and manuals and a special trick or two
the limited number of tricks isnt really so bad but the boards handle lousily turning wide moving rather slowly being needlessly difficult to bring to a stop
rotating your skater while pulling a vert trick is theoretically done with the shoulder buttons but either the timing is incredibly specific or this mechanic is just broken because half the time the skaters simply ignore the spin command
grinding on the other hand is stupid easy as the balance meter will stay at dead center as long as you dont move to the left or right while youre actually on the rail
the game is full of these kinds of gameplay quirks that make it unexciting to play
as unenjoyable as the gameplay is the single biggest offender in the simpsons skateboarding is its graphical presentation which is just bad
the township of springfield has been rendered in a flat blocky fashion with lots of foursided buildings and sixsided trees and the textures range from passable to downright awful exhibiting lots of blur and occasionally some really nasty color banding
the actual character models do kind of resemble their animated counterparts but their proportions dont look quite right and joints between the distinct head torso and limbs portions of the models are all very visible
remember the episode of the simpsons where homer and bart fall into a weird threedimensional world and are rendered with polygonal models
those models are head and shoulders above anything that the simpsons skateboarding is even remotely capable of
topping it all off is some really vicious and sporadic slowdown which brings the game to its knees
the only positive thing to say about this games graphics is that the levels are large and the draw distance is unnoticeable but these merits hardly make up for the rest of the visual deficiencies in the simpsons skateboarding
the game sounds only slightly better featuring a blaseacute soundtrack of reinterpreted simpsons themes and lots of voice samples
the game sounds only slightly better featuring a blaseacute soundtrack of reinterpreted simpsons themes and lots of voice samples
actually theres just lots of voice but youll hear bystanders like apu barney gumble and ralph wiggum say the same few phrases whenever you get near them
springfield action news anchor kent brockman serves as commentator for the game and hell call out every single trick as you pull them off
with only two different inflections for each phrase this becomes preternaturally annoying within the first level
with so many other quality action sports games on the market at the moment the only possible reason you might be attracted to the simpsons skateboarding is the simpsons themselves
but unfortunately the game makes such hamfisted use of the license that only the most casual of gamers or the most hardcore of the simpsons fans will be able to enjoy the simpsons skateboarding
everyone else truly has no excuse for playing the simpsons skateboarding and should steer clear of this tired excuse for an action sports gamealright this review is going to reveal the truth about arc the lad
no there isnt any spoilers but i will spill out the real detailsarc the lad  great game
really short
but really fun after you play it once it isnt as great but still i loved the battles and the d graphics worked greatarc the lad  ok its got alot more in it
you can change your weapons more spells tons of characters monsters to control yet sadly fails
the reason being
noone actually plays to the end
most of these people reviewing probably havent gotten to the second half of the game
the first part is great
then the battles start to get more frequent
the third part is enormously filled with meaningless battles one after another
then we reach the final areas
tons of battles in which the reward is a new plot twist you now must go to some random town and enter a doom tower filled with  levels of battling fun
ok so you beat the tower then split up in some ice area  groups thousands of battles
so you reach the final dungeons
ok you walk up some stone blocks now your going to have to fight  consecutive battles in a row
then go into this place and search for like  switches or something it wasnt clear
i fought  battles going into a house and coming out then realized there was nothing in there
i walked up to it entered battle went inside and battled entered a room to find nothing left the room and battled went outside and battled
in these battles you are outnumbered
you just use your magic and take them down in about  hits
the magic starts to get real annoying after you see it thousands of times
ok so you find the switches guess what you have to go into this creepy lair and fight some bosses great
overall the game really slumps
most of the reviews here just say that arc the lad  has more then arc the lad  and is better
sure arc the lad  starts great but i am warning you you will probably just stop caring by the endarc the lad  i got to the final dungeon and quit in arc the lad  then arc the lad  was popped in
i did not load my data because well i never finished arc to the dead end
so you basically are a hunter
the cast seems dry compared to the original
still the d seems appropriate because most games are d now
it isnt better then what you can find anywhere else
just go play a game like final fantasy  or legend of dragoon and you will be more satisfied
but arc the lad  seems kind of a blend of arc and arc with some today standards thrown inarc the lad monster arena pointless you load in some monsters from arc the lad  i used a monster throught the whole game in arc yet the monster was still  levels behind all my other characters
monsters are pointless you have like  different good characters to choose from
this game just has some battles and buying of stuff
dont worry about itextra the book is kinda cool considering its hardback
the little stand things are not really needed
the memory card holder will probably never be used
but the analog covers seems kinda okay but feel weird
the making of the games is not really a blast either its just showing you how they do stuff that you will never be able to dooverall the games are not that satisfying
if arc was released alone for like  dollars i would get it
but it is really short
so do not spend your money on this product
borrow it from a friend play arc then return itarc the lad ii is worth getting on its own though the save transfer from iii make ii an even greater game
im not finished with iii yet and its not nearly as strong as atl ii
atl i is a weaker game too but at least its fast pace makes it finished quicklybatman dark tomorrow hs been in development for a long time
now that it is out i must say that i am disappointed
camera angles are mostly bad and the levels are frustratingon the contrary batman does a lot of things right
hand to hand combat is nice and the graphics are good
fans of the comic books can enjoy an allnew story from dc comics
the game is hard so if you really need it get a strategy guidethe game is just so disappointing
too many levels feel pointless
animation is awkward
buy this game only if you are dieing to see the new storyi thought the graphics were greatas far as the plot it is not the best game but still very goodthe room on the second floor by the stairs where i heard voices was so tempting to enteri wish i could have actually gotten inside that roomwhat is surprising most of all is that there was nothing hidden behind a mounted deerheadi thought for sure that there would be a hidden chamber behind a mounted swordmooseheaddeerheadetcseveral rooms i could never enteri rate the game a  but probably at least a  if i could have entered every roomoverall a good gamea pointandclick adventure the cameron files secret at loch ness takes place in scotland during the early s
you take on the role of the chicago based private detective alan parker cameron who is hired by lord alister mac farley to investigate strange events occurring around devils ridge manor
upon arrival in scotland cameron quickly discovers that his patron has disappearedthe secret at loch ness utilizes the same degree game engine seen in other dreamcatcher adventure titles like necronomicon dracula resurrection the messenger and dracula the last sanctuary
as you move the cursor around the screen it changes at specific hotspots to indicate when an action can take place or an item can be acquired or usedinstallation of the game is quick and uneventful but intermittent problems crop up during animation sequences throughout the adventure
often animation simply stops or the sound skips making important conversations between characters difficult to understand and follow
the dreamcatcher web site offers a few ideas on how to fix the problem but none of them are guaranteed to work and in fact none had any positive effect
animation sequences cant be replayed and since they contain key plot elements the problem affects gameplay to a certain degreethe game opens with an animation sequence of cameron after he returns to chicago from scotland in which he does his best sam spade imitation while talking to himself about the case
this idiosyncratic method continues at various points throughout the game offering you a few clues before being taken back in time to scotland where you must find the lord of the manor mac farley and discover the secret horror that is taking place on the shores of loch nessthe use of a diary penned while cameron is in scotland serves much the same function as a hint file
the detective writes notes regarding possibilities of how to solve certain puzzle situations and where he should go next to search for clues
saving becomes important since cameron can die at several points during the gamethe puzzles are mainly average in difficulty and are solved by using found items
a few plot points hinge on having particular objects in your inventory at specific times and you must explore thoroughly to find them
a unique feature of the game engine is that the cursor turns into a red circle with a slash through it if you cant explore an area or pick up an item until later
this function serves as a major clue since you know something will take place at that hot spot at a future point in the gamealthough the game doesnt have the spook factor of some other dreamcatcher titles the sounds certainly have their moments as evidenced by creepy background noises in the apparently haunted mac farley manor
outside the castle the wind howls and the landscapes of loch ness are bleak
a few memorable pieces of background music serve to set the mood when the character is in obvious dangerthe interiors of the manor are rich and detailed leaving many nooks and crannies to explore
unfortunately many of the npcs in the game look and talk as if they were caricatures cameron included
banshee a mac farley family friendly spirit offers a chance for some creativity but the game designers fail to capitalize on the opportunitythe cameron files secrets of loch ness is a pretty good game and a prety standard one for dreamcatcher  first person adventure interspersed with third person cut scenes
the premise is that you are a chicago investigator of scottish descent who has been called to scotland by a friend of your fathers to investigate mysterious happenings at his ancestral manor
when you get there you discover that the person who hired you has disappeared
now you have to find out whats happened to him and whythe scenic graphics are very good and immensely detailed
in fact i would almost say they are too detailed
if you are the kind of gamer who is frustrated by seeing a great number of objects that you cant examine or a lot of doors that you cant go through you will be irritated by this game
most of the set pieces are just that little things that make the scenery interesting that you can do absolutely nothing with
there are books you cant read cabinets you cant open or even come close to
i thought there were lots of opportunities for giving more information about your situation that were totally passed up
at first this was annoying but i quickly learned to ignore anything that didnt leap out at megame play was initially slow and navigation a bit confusing and difficult to get used to
a lot of this was due to the over abundance of detail
there were lots of times i wanted to go someplace or look at something that just wasnt accessible
in particular the castle layout was hard to learn
and once you had learned it it became clear that there were quite a number of places that were just irrelevant
this became a burden in the later portions of the game when you had to go back and forth through great empty stretches of castle to reach the rooms where something was happening
a quicker way to navigate the castle such as a castle map or diagram would have been helpfulloch ness is an exceedingly linear game
everything has to happen in a specific order
you are barred from exploring certain rooms and areas until youve completed the necessary prior actionsand you often are barred from leaving a place until youve solved all the puzzles there
while this does keep you from a lot of backtracking and prevents you from running around looking for inventory items that you either dont need yet or are right under your nose it cuts down on the need for real thought
in a way this game plays itself
this sensation is enhanced by the main characters notebook and by the comments he is given to making throughout the game both of which practically tell you where to go and what to do next
i would advise experienced gamers to ignore the notebook completely
theres no way of turning off the comments howeveras you may have guessed from the previous loch ness is extremely easy
puzzles are generally inventorybased with some timed arcadetype activities
the one or two mechanical puzzles virtually solved themselvesthe sound and music are pretty good  the voice acting is average
there were some places where the dialog was hard to understand
i was surprised that there was no option for subtitles which would have been helpful
in fact i was surprised that loch ness didnt offer some of the standard sound and video options such as an ability to adjust the levels of music and background sounds
there was a real quotbare bonesquot quality to a lot of the game in this respect as you were stuck with whatever settings the programmers came up with
as most games these days offer personalised settings i wondered why this one didntaside from the linearity of the game my major complaint was that loch ness didnt seem as fully developed as it could have been
you were only given the bare bones of a story that could have been much more interesting
the npcs were virtually unneccesary as none of them added anything really
one in particular appeared from nowhere and had no discernable relationship to anything else
fleshing out the story instead of relying on numerous cliches could have helped a great deal and made the game last longer
even after a slow start i finished loch ness in slightly over ten hoursstill i enjoyed loch ness
i would recommend it for a beginner or for a more experienced gamer looking to fill in the gaps while waiting for more complex gameswell too many times i was going to drop this game and thought that it was a very silly one but something kept pulling me back the game puzzles if they deserve to be called that are sometimes so easy and simple and sometimes you dont have no clue what to do anyway mixing easy with hard was not bad the only thing that really bothered me was the movement it was horrible slow and very boring and with limited response the graphics were not so greatoverall it was not a bad one i finished it in one day and by the way it worked with windows vista perfectlyhad i written this review a few months ago i would have given grand theft auto  a star glowing review
but that was then and this is nowwhen i first purchased this game it was all i played
i couldnt speak more highly of it
i knew a couple of people who had played it and it sounded great
and for a couple of months it really was
but somewhere along the way it just got tiring
i will probably get yelled at for saying this but its a really hard game
i know i know video games arent supposed to be easy and i dont expect them to be but this one is just insane
some things i overlooked when i first started playing because i was blinded by love but now i see them clearasday
just the fact that you cant save a game at any old time is very annoying
you have to get to your hideout to save a game and sometimes your hideout seems to be a million miles away
you cant save during a mission so if you die or get arrested you lose all of your weapons and lose money
you never realize how wonderful quicksavequickload is until it is taken away from you
there isnt even any difficulty levels to choose from
the timed missions are sometimes excruciating and they can take multiple tries to accomplish
and ever since i started playing again recently ive noticed that the audio is all messed up which makes it annoying to listen to cutscenes and the radio stationsbut here are the good points its fairly openended
i can take any car i want and drive it to wherever i want and choose the radio station i want to listen to
the radio stations are probably one of the highlights of the game  every single one is wonderful
plus with the pc version of the game you can make your own mp station and put whatever songs on it that youd like
the graphics are great and each island is huge  so huge its easy to get lost
and just standing on the sidewalk watching passersby is entertainment enough today i saw a cop run over an old man
so i cant give this game a really bad review because it did hold my interest for quite a while
its a clever highlyaddictive game and worth the money
for anyone who is looking for a real challenge with close to a hundred hours of gameplay this game is for you
for anyone who isntdont say i didnt warn you
